on monday , leighton upped the pressure by making its own application to the panel to block the all-share bid on the grounds that it would rob the company of its independence .
" although hochtief owns 54.5 percent of leighton , leighton is not in the normal position of a controlled ' downstream ' entity , " leighton chairman david mortimer said in a statement .
under the current governance arrangements between the german company and its australian subsidiary , leighton has an independent board and management .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 25.10.2010 two venerable clubs chart divergent courses out of crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer is the new man in the cologne hot seat fc cologne and borussia moenchengladbach are both off to disastrous starts in the bundesliga .
one has panicked and fired its coach , the other plans to stay the course . in the bundesliga , if you go six straight games without a win , or have only one three-pointer to your credit nine games into the season , you are liable to get fired .
like stuttgart 's ex-coach christian gross before him , fc cologne 's zvonimir soldo learned that lesson on sunday .
the billy goats parted ways with their croatian coach of a year-and-a-half at roughly the same time that they landed in last place , courtesy of the former cellar-dwellers stuttgart 's win over st. pauli .
now , news of a last place club sacking its coach rarely comes as a surprise , but when viewed alongside the goings on at another presently hapless club , borussia moenchengladbach , cologne 's move to let soldo go seems rash .
perhaps cologne can learn a lesson from their old rival .
gladbach is one rung higher up the bundesliga ladder than cologne at the moment , with six points from nine matches , but that does n't really tell the whole story .
the foals are , if anything , looking even worse than cologne at the moment .
the awfulness of gladbach 's defense is threatening to take on historic proportion .
with 27 goals allowed thus far , they are very nearly on pace to break tasmania berlin 's record of 108 for the season - a record that has stood for 45 years , and one that most assumed would never , ever be broken .
still , michael frontzeck is not out of a job .
the coach is scarcely even looking over his shoulder , and the fans are standing behind him .
deep-running roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- has been a loyal soldier at borussia moenchengladbach that he is sitting as pretty as he is , even in the midst of gladbach 's ugly form , is mostly down to his roots .
frontzeck 's managerial record - not only at gladbach , but in his prior stints at aachen and bielefeld as well - has been patchy .
but he was born in moenchengladbach , played nine seasons in three stints with the club , and understands how much borussia means to its fans .
frontzeck showed guts , and demonstrated how well he knows his club , after saturday 's humbling home loss to bremen .
gladbach 's hardcore support was baying for blood after the 4-1 loss , and many a manager would have tuned the jeers out and headed for the locker room .
frontzeck , though , saw an opportunity to circle the wagons , and climbed into the stands to hold an impromptu 15-minute question-and-answer session .
afterward , he told reporters that it had been a " comfortable conversation , " and not at all one where fans were " just looking for someone to blame . "
“ we all agreed that we can only get out of this situation together , ” he said .
“ that the fans are standing behind us is a good feeling . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiny bald head in the middle of this picture ?
that 's frontzeck the contrast with cologne could not be starker .
soldo came to the club as a rising managerial star , on the back of a croatian title with dinamo zagreb , but also as an outsider - one who seemed miscast from the start , in that he never seemed to care about the club 's history or understand the club 's special relationship to its fans .
history 's burden perhaps more than any other clubs in the bundesliga , cologne and gladbach supporters are obsessed with history .
that 's because it 's just about all they 've got . gladbach 's rich past is well-known .
they won five league titles in the 1970s , and made it to another five european finals in that golden era for german football .
for many years , though , cologne too fielded a consistently good team .
in the first quarter-century of the bundesliga , the billy goats won the league twice and finished in the top eight all but four times .
then , in the 1990s , things began to fall apart at both clubs .
cologne finished second in 1990 , and made it to the german cup final in 1991 .
gladbach won the cup in 1995 .
since then , no titles at all , for either club .
moreover , gladbach has been relegated twice , and cologne four times in the past 13 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the haircuts show it 's been some time since cologne were in a cup final falling so far , so fast , and so hard has brought on a certain delusion among both sets of fans .
the older ones still think of their club as big and important , and the younger supporters have grown up in their elders ' echo chamber , weaned on the glories of yesteryear and expectant of a return to glory any minute now .
both clubs attract tens of thousands of fans to home matches irrespective of the side 's current form , and both are followed assiduously in the local press - who are only too happy to talk up a finish in the european places after two wins in a row , and call two straight losses a crisis .
the fishbowl atmosphere can overwhelm a coach who 's not prepared to play along , as the aggressively mild-mannered soldo never was .
but for a coach who 's " one of their own , " like frontzeck or christoph daum in his recent run at cologne , it 's a perfect fit - even if they do n't win anything .
holding fast supporters seem to have determined that the base price of entry to coaching at their club is genuflection at the altar of tradition , a sort of fundamentalist fandom that seeks to purify the club of corrosive outside influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer 's cologne bona fides are unquestioned in this respect , cologne 's interim coach frank schaefer is off to a stellar start .
he has never led a senior side before , but fan darling lukas podolski pronounced his onetime youth team coach " a cologne man through and through . "
-lrb- it 's true - the 46-year-old schaefer has been working as a youth or reserve team coach at cologne for 20 of the past 26 years . -rrb-
for good measure , schaefer himself opened his maiden press conference by stating that he was " a cologne lad and fc guy too . "
he also chose as his assistant coach dirk lottner , a cologne native who played six seasons at the club and has worked with schaefer in the youth system since retiring in 2007 .
cologne 's local tabloid express cooed that " you ca n't get much more cologne than that ! "
the club says it 's not ruling out a higher-profile hire , but holding onto schaefer for a while at least has to be the best play at the moment .
the fans want cologne natives on the touchline , and so they shall have them .
let 's hope they can coach a little as well .

both factions of the hurriyat conference have called for a boycott of their first visit to the kashmir valley . the decision to have a group of interlocutors was originally part of an eight-point initiative announced by the indian government to engage with the people of jammu and kashmir and move forward to find a solution to the crisis . the group , which has a one-year mandate and will report after monthly trips to the valley , is supposed to cover views from all three regions of jammu , ladakh and kashmir . the three-member team of dilip padgaonkar , radha kumar and m.m. ansari - a journalist , an academic and an educationist – was set up earlier this month in the wake of renewed unrest in the kashmir valley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hurriyat conference leader syed ali shah geelani has called on delhi to accept his five-point proposal " we will engage with every section of opinion , " dilip padgaonkar explained .
" why do we have this dialogue ?
so that we can have a permanent comprehensive political settlement to the kashmir dispute .
that has to be tried out .

as california votes on the issue , dw looks at the german situation . when the left party recently campaigned in state elections in north-rhine westphalia under the slogan " right to smoke , " their idea to legalize cannabis made headlines in germany .
the same principal has been in the green party 's program for 10 years .
and back in the mid-90s , the social democrats ' otto schily suggested making personal cannabis use legal .
but the question did n't come up again when schily later became interior minister .
efforts to decriminalize marijuana use for the estimated two million germans who smoke it , similar to measures in the neighboring netherlands and czech republic , have been gridlocked for some time .
only the greens and the left are still actively throwing themselves into the fray .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : possession laws vary across germany " it 's a so-called ' soft drug , " ' said gregor gysi , the left party 's parliamentary leader .
" that means its effects are no better or worse than those of alcohol , und just because it is associated with another culture , we treat it differently . "
" what we actually need with cannabis is , first of all , strict controls for minors .
but for adults business should be open for two reasons : first , it would reduce crime associated with buying and second it would end the practice of large amounts of money being made through cannabis sales . "
hazy laws currently in germany , smoking marijuana itself is not a crime , but growing , possessing and selling it is .
the federal constitutional court recommends not enforcing a penalty for possession of small amounts of cannabis for personal use , as long as the possessor is not near a school and poses no threat to the public .
but germany 's 16 states do n't have the same laws for what constitutes a " small amount " of cannabis .
in berlin it is up to 15 grams -lrb- half an ounce -rrb- ; in munich it 's six grams .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffeeshops selling cannabis are across the border in the netherlands authorities in the state of bavaria have warned of " increasing ignorance of guilt regarding cannabis consumption " and have started to crack down on smokers , so much that the german hemp association has made calls online for letters of protest .
raphael gassmann , head of the german center for addiction issues , is n't sure that taking a hard line is the best approach .
" anyone who thinks hard cannabis legislation - in germany or internationally - will lead to less consumption is , experience tells us , wrong , " said gassmann .
" in comparative law studies we have n't once seen a serious indication that punishing cannabis consumption drastically raises or significantly lowers the practice . "
gassmann said one result of going after marijuana users is that they become criminalized .
he adds that can have a devastating effect on their lives if they lose their jobs because of the crime , for example .
mixed support in any case , there seems to be conflicting feelings regarding the problem among the german population .
in a survey of the german hemp association conducted this year , just over 50 percent of germans approve of a liberal approach with regard to cannabis consumers .
but only a quarter of those surveyed support legalizing growing and personal consumption of cannabis , as well as a government regulation of the drug .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medicinal marijuana rules could change soon the social democrats ' parliamentary drug expert , angelika graf , considers legalizing cannabis the wrong signal to send .
she points out the difficult fight against two other legal drugs , alcohol and tobacco .
" i do n't think we 're doing ourselves any favors when we try and reign in use of legal drugs on the one hand and legalize a new drug on the other , " she said .
" that does n't work . "
no one seriously thinks that germany 's current government coalition of christian democrats and free democrats will loosen the country 's cannabis laws .
but , the coalition did recently agree that doctors in germany will soon be able to prescribe pain medication containing cannabis to seriously sick patients , without applying for special approval every time .

the website on friday published some 400,000 confidential documents on the war in iraq , which suggest negligence on the part of uk military in several cases of civilian death and torture .
" we can bemoan how these leaks occurred , but i think the nature of the allegations made are extraordinarily serious .
they are distressing to read about and they are very serious , " clegg told the bbc in an interview .
condemning wikileaks the comments came after britain 's ministry of defense joined the pentagon in condemning the release of the classified documents , saying they could put the lives of british soldiers at risk .
wikileaks ' publication of the documents will make the job of british and allied troops " more difficult and more dangerous , " the ministry said saturday .
the documents , which wikileaks founder julian assange said reveal 15,000 more civilian deaths than were previously known about , will put britain in a difficult legal position , according to a solicitor working on behalf of iraqis who claim abuse by british forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy pm clegg called for an investigation phil shiner , of public interest lawyers , said there was a " huge and growing body of evidence about the killing , ill treatment and torture of iraqis while in uk custody . "
" some of these deaths will be in circumstances where the uk -lsb- has -rsb- a clear legal responsibility , " he added .
despite condemning publication of the leaked files , the ministry of defense said in a statement that it would " consider " the information if it revealed any new evidence .
denmark vows to scour documents meanwhile , denmark 's military announced sunday it would carefully study the leaked documents to see if they revealed any wrongdoing by danish soldiers . " we want to see the documents for ourselves and compare them to our own information , " said danish defense command spokesman torben kjedsen . danish defense minister gitte lillelund bech said she was pleased with the decision , although danish media report the files reveal negligence on the part of danish soldiers in cases where prisoners were tortured by iraqi police .
us and uk ' turned a blind eye ' british newspaper the guardian , which had the documents in advance of their publication , said the leaks showed " us authorities failed to investigate hundreds of reports of abuse , torture , rape and even murder by iraqi police and soldiers whose conduct appears to be systematic and normally unpunished . " " us and uk officials have insisted that no official record of civilian casualties exists but the logs record 66,081 non-combatant deaths out of a total of 109,000 fatalities , " the newspaper stated . the guardian speculated that wikileaks had received the material from the " same dissident us army intelligence analyst " who leaked material on afghanistan , which the site published in july .
wikileaks , however , has not revealed its source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange said the documents revealed war crimes wikileaks founder defends the release julian assange defended his site 's release of confidential documents against condemnation from us and uk authorities , saying " this disclosure is about the truth . "
" the first casualty of war is the truth .
we hope to correct some of that attack on the truth that occurred before the war , during the war , and which has continued on since the war officially concluded , " he said .
assange said the documents showed evidence of war crimes .
he also told al jazeera television the documents provided enough material for 40 wrongful killing lawsuits .
" the lessons of iraq can be applied to afghanistan and to other countries western governments may choose to invade , " said assange , who vowed to continue publishing leaked documents .
the death toll in iraq now stands at 150,000 , 80 percent of which were civilians , according to the organization iraq body count , which cooperated in the analysis of the released material .
the civilian deaths revealed by the leaked documents occurred as a result of " small incidents " occurring daily during the conflict , the organization 's head , john sloboda , said .
he added that the vast majority of civilian deaths had been caused by " internal violence " among iraqi factions .

some 200 protestors seized control of the depot at fos-sur-mer , believed to be the largest in southern france , as riot police looked on , according to news agency agence-presse france .
meanwhile , a depot in central france , at saint-pierre-des corps , was freed after a week of paralysis when around 30 demonstrators walked away from the site without incident .
strikes in the country 's oil industry and blockades of fuel depots have left 35 percent of gas stations in the paris area completely dry or out of at least one kind of fuel , a transport ministry spokeswoman said .
about one-third of gas stations in western france were in " real difficulty " and 10 to 15 percent in the rest of the country were empty , she added .
unions have already called for two more days of strikes , and university students are planning nationwide marches on tuesday in last-ditch efforts to stop the pension reform before a reconciliation between the two houses of parliament and a final vote by the national assembly expected wednesday .
sarkozy popularity suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has n't been able to stop protests - or his sinking approval sarkozy 's government insists that the pension reform , which will raise the minimum retirement age to 62 from 60 , is " inevitable " and the only way to fill an expected pension budget gap and reduce the country 's growing deficit .
but the opposition socialists say if they win presidential elections in 2012 , their candidate will restore the retirement age to 60 .
polls suggest a majority of french voters support or sympathize with the strikers , but jean-francois cope , leader of sarkozy 's ump party in parliament , blamed the widespread disruption on the work of a minority .
" strikes , protests , yes , but taking the economy hostage is intolerable , " he said in an interview with le parisien newspaper .
" most of the country is paralyzed by the actions of a handful of extremists .
everyone should understand that we have no other choice . "
as the unpopular pension reform plan moves closer to becoming law , sarkozy 's approval rating has dropped to an all-time low , dashing hopes that the legislative achievement could bring him a political comeback .
a poll conducted by the ifop institute and published in the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday showed only 29 percent of respondents were satisfied with sarkozy 's job performance .
that was down three points from september , and was a new low for the president since he took office in 2007 .
sarkozy and his allies are hoping that the ongoing protest and strike movement in opposition to the pension reform will die down as families leave their homes for the mid-term school holiday this week .

" it 's clear from those inspections that while most of the data is fragmentary , in some instances entire emails and urls were captured , as well as passwords , " wrote alan eustace , google 's senior vice president of engineering and research , in a post published late friday on google 's public policy blog . this is the first time that google has revealed the full extent of the privacy breach , which it had previously blamed on a coding error . the company said it plans delete the data " as soon as possible " and wants to make improvements to its policies . this follows a previous announcement in may , prompted by investigations by german privacy officials , that the company had mistakenly collected unencrypted wifi payload data -lrb- information sent over networks -rrb- using its street view cars . the cars are used for google 's mapping service and take panoramic photos of streets in various countries around the world . situation merits further examination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google plans to add germany 's 20 largest cities to street view by the end of 2010 the latest revelations failed to surprise johannes caspar , hamburg 's commissioner for data protection and freedom of information , and the leading authority in the german google investigation . " this just confirms what we expected , " he told deutsche welle .
" it could already have been predicted a few months ago . " according to caspar , germany will continue with its enquiry as planned , aiming for an independent assessment before " we think about taking further action . "
following the may privacy invasion scandal , hard drives of computers involved are being inspected .
should google 's statement be proven true , caspar says the company may be fined . according to ulrich boerger , a hamburg-based privacy lawyer , evidence of password and email leaks would add another dimension to the privacy debate in germany , but " it 's difficult to talk about any concrete consequences at this stage . " similar reaction in the uk google 's latest revelations have also not altered the general course of action for uk authorities , despite having cleared google of the charge of having collected " meaningful personal details " earlier this year . " we will be making enquires to see whether this information relates to the data inadvertently captured in the uk , before deciding on the necessary course of action , including a consideration of the need to use our enforcement powers , " wrote the information commissioner 's office , great britain 's data protection agency , in a statement published on its website . google has previously said it did not realize that kismet , a free software program it uses to detect wireless networks , was also recording snippets of emails and web pages .

some 200 protestors seized control of the depot at fos-sur-mer , believed to be the largest in southern france , as riot police looked on , according to news agency agence-presse france .
meanwhile , a depot in central france , at saint-pierre-des corps , was freed after a week of paralysis when around 30 demonstrators walked away from the site without incident .
strikes in the country 's oil industry and blockades of fuel depots have left 35 percent of gas stations in the paris area completely dry or out of at least one kind of fuel , a transport ministry spokeswoman said .
about one-third of gas stations in western france were in " real difficulty " and 10 to 15 percent in the rest of the country were empty , she added .
unions have already called for two more days of strikes , and university students are planning nationwide marches on tuesday in last-ditch efforts to stop the pension reform before a reconciliation between the two houses of parliament and a final vote by the national assembly expected wednesday .
sarkozy popularity suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has n't been able to stop protests - or his sinking approval sarkozy 's government insists that the pension reform , which will raise the minimum retirement age to 62 from 60 , is " inevitable " and the only way to fill an expected pension budget gap and reduce the country 's growing deficit .
but the opposition socialists say if they win presidential elections in 2012 , their candidate will restore the retirement age to 60 .
polls suggest a majority of french voters support or sympathize with the strikers , but jean-francois cope , leader of sarkozy 's ump party in parliament , blamed the widespread disruption on the work of a minority .
" strikes , protests , yes , but taking the economy hostage is intolerable , " he said in an interview with le parisien newspaper .
" most of the country is paralyzed by the actions of a handful of extremists .
everyone should understand that we have no other choice . "
as the unpopular pension reform plan moves closer to becoming law , sarkozy 's approval rating has dropped to an all-time low , dashing hopes that the legislative achievement could bring him a political comeback .
a poll conducted by the ifop institute and published in the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday showed only 29 percent of respondents were satisfied with sarkozy 's job performance .
that was down three points from september , and was a new low for the president since he took office in 2007 .
sarkozy and his allies are hoping that the ongoing protest and strike movement in opposition to the pension reform will die down as families leave their homes for the mid-term school holiday this week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 25.10.2010 two venerable clubs chart divergent courses out of crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer is the new man in the cologne hot seat fc cologne and borussia moenchengladbach are both off to disastrous starts in the bundesliga .
one has panicked and fired its coach , the other plans to stay the course . in the bundesliga , if you go six straight games without a win , or have only one three-pointer to your credit nine games into the season , you are liable to get fired .
like stuttgart 's ex-coach christian gross before him , fc cologne 's zvonimir soldo learned that lesson on sunday .
the billy goats parted ways with their croatian coach of a year-and-a-half at roughly the same time that they landed in last place , courtesy of the former cellar-dwellers stuttgart 's win over st. pauli .
now , news of a last place club sacking its coach rarely comes as a surprise , but when viewed alongside the goings on at another presently hapless club , borussia moenchengladbach , cologne 's move to let soldo go seems rash .
perhaps cologne can learn a lesson from their old rival .
gladbach is one rung higher up the bundesliga ladder than cologne at the moment , with six points from nine matches , but that does n't really tell the whole story .
the foals are , if anything , looking even worse than cologne at the moment .
the awfulness of gladbach 's defense is threatening to take on historic proportion .
with 27 goals allowed thus far , they are very nearly on pace to break tasmania berlin 's record of 108 for the season - a record that has stood for 45 years , and one that most assumed would never , ever be broken .
still , michael frontzeck is not out of a job .
the coach is scarcely even looking over his shoulder , and the fans are standing behind him .
deep-running roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- has been a loyal soldier at borussia moenchengladbach that he is sitting as pretty as he is , even in the midst of gladbach 's ugly form , is mostly down to his roots .
frontzeck 's managerial record - not only at gladbach , but in his prior stints at aachen and bielefeld as well - has been patchy .
but he was born in moenchengladbach , played nine seasons in three stints with the club , and understands how much borussia means to its fans .
frontzeck showed guts , and demonstrated how well he knows his club , after saturday 's humbling home loss to bremen .
gladbach 's hardcore support was baying for blood after the 4-1 loss , and many a manager would have tuned the jeers out and headed for the locker room .
frontzeck , though , saw an opportunity to circle the wagons , and climbed into the stands to hold an impromptu 15-minute question-and-answer session .
afterward , he told reporters that it had been a " comfortable conversation , " and not at all one where fans were " just looking for someone to blame . "
“ we all agreed that we can only get out of this situation together , ” he said .
“ that the fans are standing behind us is a good feeling . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiny bald head in the middle of this picture ?
that 's frontzeck the contrast with cologne could not be starker .
soldo came to the club as a rising managerial star , on the back of a croatian title with dinamo zagreb , but also as an outsider - one who seemed miscast from the start , in that he never seemed to care about the club 's history or understand the club 's special relationship to its fans .
history 's burden perhaps more than any other clubs in the bundesliga , cologne and gladbach supporters are obsessed with history .
that 's because it 's just about all they 've got . gladbach 's rich past is well-known .
they won five league titles in the 1970s , and made it to another five european finals in that golden era for german football .
for many years , though , cologne too fielded a consistently good team .
in the first quarter-century of the bundesliga , the billy goats won the league twice and finished in the top eight all but four times .
then , in the 1990s , things began to fall apart at both clubs .
cologne finished second in 1990 , and made it to the german cup final in 1991 .
gladbach won the cup in 1995 .
since then , no titles at all , for either club .
moreover , gladbach has been relegated twice , and cologne four times in the past 13 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the haircuts show it 's been some time since cologne were in a cup final falling so far , so fast , and so hard has brought on a certain delusion among both sets of fans .
the older ones still think of their club as big and important , and the younger supporters have grown up in their elders ' echo chamber , weaned on the glories of yesteryear and expectant of a return to glory any minute now .
both clubs attract tens of thousands of fans to home matches irrespective of the side 's current form , and both are followed assiduously in the local press - who are only too happy to talk up a finish in the european places after two wins in a row , and call two straight losses a crisis .
the fishbowl atmosphere can overwhelm a coach who 's not prepared to play along , as the aggressively mild-mannered soldo never was .
but for a coach who 's " one of their own , " like frontzeck or christoph daum in his recent run at cologne , it 's a perfect fit - even if they do n't win anything .
holding fast supporters seem to have determined that the base price of entry to coaching at their club is genuflection at the altar of tradition , a sort of fundamentalist fandom that seeks to purify the club of corrosive outside influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer 's cologne bona fides are unquestioned in this respect , cologne 's interim coach frank schaefer is off to a stellar start .
he has never led a senior side before , but fan darling lukas podolski pronounced his onetime youth team coach " a cologne man through and through . "
-lrb- it 's true - the 46-year-old schaefer has been working as a youth or reserve team coach at cologne for 20 of the past 26 years . -rrb-
for good measure , schaefer himself opened his maiden press conference by stating that he was " a cologne lad and fc guy too . "
he also chose as his assistant coach dirk lottner , a cologne native who played six seasons at the club and has worked with schaefer in the youth system since retiring in 2007 .
cologne 's local tabloid express cooed that " you ca n't get much more cologne than that ! "
the club says it 's not ruling out a higher-profile hire , but holding onto schaefer for a while at least has to be the best play at the moment .
the fans want cologne natives on the touchline , and so they shall have them .
let 's hope they can coach a little as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 25.10.2010 twenty-five-year conservation effort pays off on germany 's north sea coast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many bird species are at home in the protected mud flats and salt marshes germany 's wadden sea national park , along the north sea coast , turned 25 this month .
as the world struggles with agreements to reverse biodiversity loss , the wadden sea shines as an example of transnational conservation . the wadden sea is one of central europe 's most important nature reserves . the strip of north sea coast is home to the biggest contiguous area of mudflats in the world , and stretches from den helder in the netherlands to esbjerg in denmark via three german states . much of the wadden sea was listed as a unesco world heritage site in 2009 because it serves as a flourishing habitat for some 3,200 species of animals , provides an important way-station for migratory birds , supports a wide variety of plants among its salt marshes and has played a crucial role in restoring seal populations over the past two decades . today the wadden sea is seen as a model for promoting cross-border conservation , but the road to success was not straight forward . road to riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal populations are recovering thanks to a nurturing environment the wadden sea national park is really three parks divided between the german states of schleswig holstein , lower saxony and the city-state of hamburg . the oldest is the park established in germany 's northernmost state , schleswig-holstein , in 1985 . it was prompted by a dawning awareness that piecemeal legislation was proving inadequate at dealing with the growing impacts of industrial and agricultural waste , development and commercial expoitation on the region . at first , proposals for a park met with stiff resistance from locals , who feared for their hunting and fishing rights , resented impositions on their freedom to use the area and worried about an influx of tourists . yet through a mixture of compromise and consensus-building , the state 's then premier , uwe barschel , managed to build enough support to pass legislation . " it sounds crude , but we were just trying to get people on board , " recalls detlef hansen , the head of the national park . " we formed working groups with fishermen , with shepherds , with hunters , and let them have a say in the decision making . " in the end , it was conservationists who felt they were getting the short end of the stick and initially dismissed barschel 's plan as a sham . yet over the years , protection was extended : in 1990 a deal was struck to protect seal populations in the wadden sea – the first accord signed under the bonn convention on migratory species . today , that accord between germany , the netherlands and denmark is held up as a model for multilateral species protection programs . success has boiled down to " defining common objectives " and " working together " with all stakeholders , said jens enemark , secretary of the common wadden sea secretariat - the international organization tasked with facilitating cooperation in the wadden sea . this has meant identifying and mitigating the main human threats to the region , namely pollution , disturbance and habitat destruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the tide is out , visitors enjoy walking on the sea bed local dividends and it 's not just seals that have reaped the rewards , says detlef hansen . " today , you stand on the dike and you realize that it has become a quiet , peaceful place - there 's no more bird hunting , no low-flying planes , and military maneuvers are history .
visitors , and also the inhabitants , can enjoy the blooming salt marshes , " hansen said . locals now overwhelmingly support the national park , and while jens enemark says conservation authorities continue to have different priorities to fishermen and others who depend upon the region for their livelihood , relations are far more cordial than they were two decades ago . indeed , the thriving environment has proved a boon for another industry . " more than two million guests a year spend vacation on the north sea coast of schleswig holstein , " said konstanze hoefling-hoff of the north sea tourism service . " we know from polls and headcounts that more than a million of them stop at the visitors- stations of the national parks , " with popular activities including " guided hikes on the mud flats and other excursions . " to prevent the region from being loved-to-death by over-eager visitors , the wadden sea has a unique partnership program , which ties together the national park service , volunteers , and conservation groups . the german branch of the world wildlife fund fro nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- praises the partnership . it says nature has been able to recuperate , as a result , and that at least in the tidal mud flats , species have ceased to die out . the north sea is also cleaner , and the animals in the mud flats are less frightened than they once were , according to hans-ulrich roesner , a spokesman for the wwf in husum , in northern germany . oil on the horizon ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservation stations have done their job well yet the wwf also says causes for concern remain . " the biggest blot on the national park is the oil exploration which is still taking place in the mittelplate oil field , in the southern part of the region , " roesner said , claiming that this disrupts wild geese in their molting areas , and can leave them unable to fly in summer . unsustainable levels of commercial fishing are an ongoing problem too , from wwf 's perspective , and on this score " something needs to change soon , " roesner says . within germany 's borders , financial considerations also loom . there is n't enough money to go round for rangers , and changes to germany 's system of compulsory military service , mean that there is likely to be a knock on effect for social work , as fewer young men opt for this alternative service – a useful source of labor for everything from medical care to nature conservation . despite these challenges , the wadden sea serves as a useful case-study for others seeking to strike a deal to save nature . author : werner junge , jennifer abramsohn editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a rapid border intervention team is expected to be deployed . a rapid intervention team from the eu border agency , frontex , will be deployed for the first time to greece to help shore up the country 's porous border with turkey , the european commission has said in a statement .
the move comes after greece put out an emergency call for the border team , which is to act under greek authority .
eu internal affairs commissioner cecilia malmstroem said she had " immediately activated the mechanism to liaise with frontex and to communicate among all interested partners , so as to handle this emergency situation in the most expeditious and efficient way . "
" the situation at the greek land border with turkey is increasingly worrying , " she said .
" the flows of people crossing the border irregularly have reached alarming proportions and greece is manifestly not able to face this situation alone … i am very concerned about the humanitarian situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions inside many of europe 's detention centers are considered poor according to the united nations , an estimated 300-400 illegal immigrants enter greece every day , many of whom come from africa and afghanistan .
the un last week called on eu states to do more to lighten the migrant burden on greece , which it said has created " catastrophic " conditions for refugees .
un special rapporteur on torture manfred nowak described conditions inside greece 's overcrowded detention centers as " inhumane . "
an overwhelming majority of the refugees use greece as an entry point to other european union countries , and arrivals by land have increased by more than a third in a year .
last week , turkey pledged to cooperate with greece in a bid to control the flow of irregular immigrants making their way into europe , in exchange for greece 's help in easing visa rules for turks .

at the very latest , since abu ghraib , the international community had come to the realization that the war in iraq was a ‘ dirty war ' .
there were killings .
there was torture .
mercenaries operated as brutal aggressors .
shi 'ites and sunnis took turns massacring each other .
that one of the most barbarous dictators was overthrown in the process has practically been forgotten .
instead , the image of a dirty war has now been even more enduringly anchored in our collective consciousness .
thanks to the disclosures made by wikileaks , we have perhaps been given a more accurate insight into the course of events and a more precise figure on the brutal human rights violations and number of deaths .
according to the files , more than 150,000 people were killed in iraq between 2004 and 2009 , if we can believe the documents from us military sources . # b # documents appear to be credible can we believe them ?
yes , we can .
the documents appear , in principle , to be credible .
however , it is important to treat them for what they are : one source among many , and a one-sided one at that , originally intended for internal , domestic consumption .
not everything in these documents can be characterized as a bitter truth intended to be camouflaged from public view .
this or that bit of information could be a half truth or ‘ pseudo-fact ' ; for example , when the person reporting draws the wrong conclusions due to their subjective perspective , or wishes to hide personal lapses or errors from superiors .
few things in life are more regularly “ air brushed ” or openly manipulated than reports to supervising superiors , and this is very probably no different for the us army in iraq .
wikileaks also needs monitoring critical questions , therefore , are certainly permissible : did wikileaks do everything possible when vetting the documents to ensure that no human lives will be put at risk ?
we can only hope and wait .
and , by the way : where are the checks and balances on wikileaks ?
the group is going to have to accept questions like these - just as traditional mass media or outlets like facebook and youtube have done - in view of the fact that its political muscle has grown significantly .
they all shoulder a major responsibility , without ever having been elected .
of course , it also depends on who is asking the question and with what motive .
the criticism of wikileaks , expressed by washington and baghdad , is hypocritical .
both are concerned about their reputations .
us president barack obama only appears to be in a comfortable position .
he can not really sit back and claim that all the missteps and consequences are the fault of his predecessor , george w. bush .
in the selective perceptions of many people – and not just in the arab world – the united states is once again on the pillory .
files dicey for iraqi leader the publication of the documents , however , is just as much of a blow to iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki .
he now stands there in public as a political leader who condones torture , including the abuse of supporters of political and religious groups , whom , for the last seven months , he has been trying to win over as coalition partners in a new government .
not surprisingly , al-maliki suspects intrigue behind the wikileak revelations .
he knows that the publication of new , shocking details could cost him his political career .
in as far as the documents are not proven to be forgeries or seriously flawed – for which there is no evidence at the moment – then the blame for them lies with him and george w. bush – and not with wikileaks .
as with vietnam decades ago , the same holds true for the war in iraq today : dirty details need to be thoroughly evaluated and dirty truths brought to light with no holds barred .
the people of iraq , in particular , deserve nothing less .

that one of the most barbarous dictators was overthrown in the process has practically been forgotten .
instead , the image of a dirty war has now been even more enduringly anchored in our collective consciousness .
thanks to the disclosures made by wikileaks , we have perhaps been given a more accurate insight into the course of events and a more precise figure on the brutal human rights violations and number of deaths .
according to the files , more than 150,000 people were killed in iraq between 2004 and 2009 , if we can believe the documents from us military sources . # b # documents appear to be credible can we believe them ?
yes , we can .
the documents appear , in principle , to be credible .
however , it is important to treat them for what they are : one source among many , and a one-sided one at that , originally intended for internal , domestic consumption .
not everything in these documents can be characterized as a bitter truth intended to be camouflaged from public view .
this or that bit of information could be a half truth or ‘ pseudo-fact ' ; for example , when the person reporting draws the wrong conclusions due to their subjective perspective , or wishes to hide personal lapses or errors from superiors .
few things in life are more regularly “ air brushed ” or openly manipulated than reports to supervising superiors , and this is very probably no different for the us army in iraq .
wikileaks also needs monitoring critical questions , therefore , are certainly permissible : did wikileaks do everything possible when vetting the documents to ensure that no human lives will be put at risk ?
we can only hope and wait .
and , by the way : where are the checks and balances on wikileaks ?
the group is going to have to accept questions like these - just as traditional mass media or outlets like facebook and youtube have done - in view of the fact that its political muscle has grown significantly .
they all shoulder a major responsibility , without ever having been elected .
of course , it also depends on who is asking the question and with what motive .
the criticism of wikileaks , expressed by washington and baghdad , is hypocritical .
both are concerned about their reputations .
us president barack obama only appears to be in a comfortable position .
he can not really sit back and claim that all the missteps and consequences are the fault of his predecessor , george w. bush .
in the selective perceptions of many people – and not just in the arab world – the united states is once again on the pillory .
files dicey for iraqi leader the publication of the documents , however , is just as much of a blow to iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki .
he now stands there in public as a political leader who condones torture , including the abuse of supporters of political and religious groups , whom , for the last seven months , he has been trying to win over as coalition partners in a new government .
not surprisingly , al-maliki suspects intrigue behind the wikileak revelations .
he knows that the publication of new , shocking details could cost him his political career .
in as far as the documents are not proven to be forgeries or seriously flawed – for which there is no evidence at the moment – then the blame for them lies with him and george w. bush – and not with wikileaks .
as with vietnam decades ago , the same holds true for the war in iraq today : dirty details need to be thoroughly evaluated and dirty truths brought to light with no holds barred .
the people of iraq , in particular , deserve nothing less .

on sunday , the cargo ship became the second vessel with german crew members in two days to be attacked by somali pirates .
the pirates gave up their attack after the crew shut down their boat . a german cargo ship seized by somali pirates off the coast of kenya is now free , according the vessel 's owners .
verena beckhusen , spokeswoman for the bremen-based shipping company beluga-reederei , said the cargo ship beluga fortune was free monday , a day after being taken hostage in the indian ocean , some 1,200 miles -lrb- 1,930 kilometers -rrb- east of mombasa , kenya .
the ship and its crew , including two german citizens , were continuing their planned journey to south africa , beckhusen said .
no crew members were injured , and the ship sustained only minor damage .
pirates had already given up pirates had already left the ship by the time british frigate montrose arrived at the scene monday after steaming 15 hours to beluga fortune 's aid .
all 16 crewmembers were safe , the beluga shipping company told the newspaper weser kurier .
the beluga fortune is now a success story of german shipping companies ' standard procedures of shutting down all power and hiding the crew when a ship is attacked .
the ship 's crew radioed at 7 a.m. on sunday that pirates were attempting to board .
they then immediately stopped the engine , blocked the fuel line and switched off all systems on the bridge - making it impossible for the pirates to move the ship .
" the cool-headed behavior ... of the beluga crew on board and the quick action of navy units ... left the pirates no other option than to give up their dream of a million -lsb- -euro -rsb- ransom and to flee , " beluga shipping said in a statement .
beluga shipping 's executive partner niels stolberg stressed that the crew 's training in handling stressful situations such as pirate takeovers had paid off .
" our precautions and concentrated training of the crew worked out very well , " stolberg said , adding , " our colleagues on board have gotten off lightly from this attack and have escaped with no more than a fright . "

a rapid border intervention team is expected to be deployed . a rapid intervention team from the eu border agency , frontex , will be deployed for the first time to greece to help shore up the country 's porous border with turkey , the european commission has said in a statement .
the move comes after greece put out an emergency call for the border team , which is to act under greek authority .
eu internal affairs commissioner cecilia malmstroem said she had " immediately activated the mechanism to liaise with frontex and to communicate among all interested partners , so as to handle this emergency situation in the most expeditious and efficient way . "
" the situation at the greek land border with turkey is increasingly worrying , " she said .
" the flows of people crossing the border irregularly have reached alarming proportions and greece is manifestly not able to face this situation alone … i am very concerned about the humanitarian situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions inside many of europe 's detention centers are considered poor according to the united nations , an estimated 300-400 illegal immigrants enter greece every day , many of whom come from africa and afghanistan .
the un last week called on eu states to do more to lighten the migrant burden on greece , which it said has created " catastrophic " conditions for refugees .
un special rapporteur on torture manfred nowak described conditions inside greece 's overcrowded detention centers as " inhumane . "
an overwhelming majority of the refugees use greece as an entry point to other european union countries , and arrivals by land have increased by more than a third in a year .

on sunday , the cargo ship became the second vessel with german crew members in two days to be attacked by somali pirates .
the pirates gave up their attack after the crew shut down their boat . a german cargo ship seized by somali pirates off the coast of kenya is now free , according the vessel 's owners .
verena beckhusen , spokeswoman for the bremen-based shipping company beluga-reederei , said the cargo ship beluga fortune was free monday , a day after being taken hostage in the indian ocean , some 1,200 miles -lrb- 1,930 kilometers -rrb- east of mombasa , kenya .
the ship and its crew , including two german citizens , were continuing their planned journey to south africa , beckhusen said .
no crew members were injured , and the ship sustained only minor damage .
pirates had already given up pirates had already left the ship by the time british frigate montrose arrived at the scene monday after steaming 15 hours to beluga fortune 's aid .
all 16 crewmembers were safe , the beluga shipping company told the newspaper weser kurier .
the beluga fortune is now a success story of german shipping companies ' standard procedures of shutting down all power and hiding the crew when a ship is attacked .
the ship 's crew radioed at 7 a.m. on sunday that pirates were attempting to board .
they then immediately stopped the engine , blocked the fuel line and switched off all systems on the bridge - making it impossible for the pirates to move the ship .
" the cool-headed behavior ... of the beluga crew on board and the quick action of navy units ... left the pirates no other option than to give up their dream of a million -lsb- -euro -rsb- ransom and to flee , " beluga shipping said in a statement .
beluga shipping 's executive partner niels stolberg stressed that the crew 's training in handling stressful situations such as pirate takeovers had paid off .
" our precautions and concentrated training of the crew worked out very well , " stolberg said , adding , " our colleagues on board have gotten off lightly from this attack and have escaped with no more than a fright . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greek-owned gas tanker york remains in pirate hands somali pirates a continued threat germany 's foreign office reacted to the news on monday , saying that the fight against somali pirate attacks had to address the " roots of piracy . "
the ministry called for support for the somali interim government to train security forces .
the greek-owned ship york meanwhile remains in the hands of somali pirates .
the flag , captained by a german citizen under a singapore flag , was taken by pirates on saturday off the kenyan coast .
so far this year , pirates have boarded at least 130 ships and fired at over 50 .

instead it will hike the price of cigarettes through a new tobacco tax . the german government says it favors raising the price of cigarettes through a new tobacco tax rather than taxing heavy industry as originally envisaged in the government 's economic austerity program .
following a meeting at the chancellery on sunday , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and economics minister rainer bruederle said the move would see the financial burden on energy-intensive industries eased by nullifying previous plans to slash a rebate such companies were entitled to on a so-called " eco-tax . "
the measure is expected to spare heavy industry from having to fork out around 600 million euros -lrb- $ 841 million -rrb- each year for the eco-tax .
the ministers stressed , however , that the replacement tobacco tax was not yet set in stone and was still only a proposal .
they said it would be put to parliamentary groups for discussion on monday .
news agency reuters reported that any such tax would seek to bring in around 200 million euros in additional revenue for 2011 , with this figure rising to 800 million euros by 2014 .
industry lobby victory ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy industry will view the tax reversal as a success birgit homburger , leader of the parliamentary group of junior coalition partners the free democrats , said easing the eco-tax burden would help secure jobs and aid germany in maintaining its reputation as an attractive location for energy-intensive industries .
however , the move is likely to anger green and leftist groups .
the left party has already voiced opposition to easing the tax burden on industry .
the decision by the german government serves the " lobbying interests of the corporations " and places the costs of the financial crisis on those who are not responsible for it , said left party taxation spokeswoman barbara hoell on monday .
industry groups had heaped pressure on the government over the eco-tax , arguing that slashing eco-tax rebates could endanger up to 870,000 jobs and complicate operations for medium-size businesses .
hans-peter keitel , president of the federation of german industries , said that reducing the rebate would threaten stability in the country 's entire industrial sector .
also to come from the meeting at the chancellery was confirmation of a plan to simplify german taxes from 2012 .
the scheme would save german taxpayers around 500 million euros , ministers said , and could be partially retroactive for 2011 .
it would also mean tax returns would only have to be filed every two years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de taxes -pipe- 25.10.2010 smokers to cough up more for cigarettes as industry gets tax break großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers would be made to fork out more for cigarettes the german government says it wants to cancel plans to make heavy industry pay more for polluting .
instead it will hike the price of cigarettes through a new tobacco tax . the german government says it favors raising the price of cigarettes through a new tobacco tax rather than taxing heavy industry as originally envisaged in the government 's economic austerity program .
following a meeting at the chancellery on sunday , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and economics minister rainer bruederle said the move would see the financial burden on energy-intensive industries eased by nullifying previous plans to slash a rebate such companies were entitled to on a so-called " eco-tax . "
the measure is expected to spare heavy industry from having to fork out around 600 million euros -lrb- $ 841 million -rrb- each year for the eco-tax .
the ministers stressed , however , that the replacement tobacco tax was not yet set in stone and was still only a proposal .
they said it would be put to parliamentary groups for discussion on monday .
news agency reuters reported that any such tax would seek to bring in around 200 million euros in additional revenue for 2011 , with this figure rising to 800 million euros by 2014 .
industry lobby victory ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy industry will view the tax reversal as a success birgit homburger , leader of the parliamentary group of junior coalition partners the free democrats , said easing the eco-tax burden would help secure jobs and aid germany in maintaining its reputation as an attractive location for energy-intensive industries .
however , the move is likely to anger green and leftist groups .
the left party has already voiced opposition to easing the tax burden on industry .
the decision by the german government serves the " lobbying interests of the corporations " and places the costs of the financial crisis on those who are not responsible for it , said left party taxation spokeswoman barbara hoell on monday .
industry groups had heaped pressure on the government over the eco-tax , arguing that slashing eco-tax rebates could endanger up to 870,000 jobs and complicate operations for medium-size businesses .
hans-peter keitel , president of the federation of german industries , said that reducing the rebate would threaten stability in the country 's entire industrial sector .
also to come from the meeting at the chancellery was confirmation of a plan to simplify german taxes from 2012 .
the scheme would save german taxpayers around 500 million euros , ministers said , and could be partially retroactive for 2011 .
it would also mean tax returns would only have to be filed every two years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 25.10.2010 two venerable clubs chart divergent courses out of crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer is the new man in the cologne hot seat fc cologne and borussia moenchengladbach are both off to disastrous starts in the bundesliga .
one has panicked and fired its coach , the other plans to stay the course . in the bundesliga , if you go six straight games without a win , or have only one three-pointer to your credit nine games into the season , you are liable to get fired .
like stuttgart 's ex-coach christian gross before him , fc cologne 's zvonimir soldo learned that lesson on sunday .
the billy goats parted ways with their croatian coach of a year-and-a-half at roughly the same time that they landed in last place , courtesy of the former cellar-dwellers stuttgart 's win over st. pauli .
now , news of a last place club sacking its coach rarely comes as a surprise , but when viewed alongside the goings on at another presently hapless club , borussia moenchengladbach , cologne 's move to let soldo go seems rash .
perhaps cologne can learn a lesson from their old rival .
gladbach is one rung higher up the bundesliga ladder than cologne at the moment , with six points from nine matches , but that does n't really tell the whole story .
the foals are , if anything , looking even worse than cologne at the moment .
the awfulness of gladbach 's defense is threatening to take on historic proportion .
with 27 goals allowed thus far , they are very nearly on pace to break tasmania berlin 's record of 108 for the season - a record that has stood for 45 years , and one that most assumed would never , ever be broken .
still , michael frontzeck is not out of a job .
the coach is scarcely even looking over his shoulder , and the fans are standing behind him .
deep-running roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- has been a loyal soldier at borussia moenchengladbach that he is sitting as pretty as he is , even in the midst of gladbach 's ugly form , is mostly down to his roots .
frontzeck 's managerial record - not only at gladbach , but in his prior stints at aachen and bielefeld as well - has been patchy .
but he was born in moenchengladbach , played nine seasons in three stints with the club , and understands how much borussia means to its fans .
frontzeck showed guts , and demonstrated how well he knows his club , after saturday 's humbling home loss to bremen .
gladbach 's hardcore support was baying for blood after the 4-1 loss , and many a manager would have tuned the jeers out and headed for the locker room .
frontzeck , though , saw an opportunity to circle the wagons , and climbed into the stands to hold an impromptu 15-minute question-and-answer session .
afterward , he told reporters that it had been a " comfortable conversation , " and not at all one where fans were " just looking for someone to blame . "
“ we all agreed that we can only get out of this situation together , ” he said .
“ that the fans are standing behind us is a good feeling . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiny bald head in the middle of this picture ?
that 's frontzeck the contrast with cologne could not be starker .
soldo came to the club as a rising managerial star , on the back of a croatian title with dinamo zagreb , but also as an outsider - one who seemed miscast from the start , in that he never seemed to care about the club 's history or understand the club 's special relationship to its fans .
history 's burden perhaps more than any other clubs in the bundesliga , cologne and gladbach supporters are obsessed with history .
that 's because it 's just about all they 've got . gladbach 's rich past is well-known .
they won five league titles in the 1970s , and made it to another five european finals in that golden era for german football .
for many years , though , cologne too fielded a consistently good team .
in the first quarter-century of the bundesliga , the billy goats won the league twice and finished in the top eight all but four times .
then , in the 1990s , things began to fall apart at both clubs .
cologne finished second in 1990 , and made it to the german cup final in 1991 .
gladbach won the cup in 1995 .
since then , no titles at all , for either club .
moreover , gladbach has been relegated twice , and cologne four times in the past 13 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the haircuts show it 's been some time since cologne were in a cup final falling so far , so fast , and so hard has brought on a certain delusion among both sets of fans .
the older ones still think of their club as big and important , and the younger supporters have grown up in their elders ' echo chamber , weaned on the glories of yesteryear and expectant of a return to glory any minute now .
both clubs attract tens of thousands of fans to home matches irrespective of the side 's current form , and both are followed assiduously in the local press - who are only too happy to talk up a finish in the european places after two wins in a row , and call two straight losses a crisis .
the fishbowl atmosphere can overwhelm a coach who 's not prepared to play along , as the aggressively mild-mannered soldo never was .
but for a coach who 's " one of their own , " like frontzeck or christoph daum in his recent run at cologne , it 's a perfect fit - even if they do n't win anything .
holding fast supporters seem to have determined that the base price of entry to coaching at their club is genuflection at the altar of tradition , a sort of fundamentalist fandom that seeks to purify the club of corrosive outside influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer 's cologne bona fides are unquestioned in this respect , cologne 's interim coach frank schaefer is off to a stellar start .
he has never led a senior side before , but fan darling lukas podolski pronounced his onetime youth team coach " a cologne man through and through . "
-lrb- it 's true - the 46-year-old schaefer has been working as a youth or reserve team coach at cologne for 20 of the past 26 years . -rrb-
for good measure , schaefer himself opened his maiden press conference by stating that he was " a cologne lad and fc guy too . "
he also chose as his assistant coach dirk lottner , a cologne native who played six seasons at the club and has worked with schaefer in the youth system since retiring in 2007 .
cologne 's local tabloid express cooed that " you ca n't get much more cologne than that ! "
the club says it 's not ruling out a higher-profile hire , but holding onto schaefer for a while at least has to be the best play at the moment .
the fans want cologne natives on the touchline , and so they shall have them .
let 's hope they can coach a little as well .

on sunday , the cargo ship became the second vessel with german crew members in two days to be attacked by somali pirates .
the pirates gave up their attack after the crew shut down their boat . a german cargo ship seized by somali pirates off the coast of kenya is now free , according the vessel 's owners .
verena beckhusen , spokeswoman for the bremen-based shipping company beluga-reederei , said the cargo ship beluga fortune was free monday , a day after being taken hostage in the indian ocean , some 1,200 miles -lrb- 1,930 kilometers -rrb- east of mombasa , kenya .
the ship and its crew , including two german citizens , were continuing their planned journey to south africa , beckhusen said .
no crew members were injured , and the ship sustained only minor damage .
pirates had already given up pirates had already left the ship by the time british frigate montrose arrived at the scene monday after steaming 15 hours to beluga fortune 's aid .
all 16 crewmembers were safe , the beluga shipping company told the newspaper weser kurier .
the beluga fortune is now a success story of german shipping companies ' standard procedures of shutting down all power and hiding the crew when a ship is attacked .
the ship 's crew radioed at 7 a.m. on sunday that pirates were attempting to board .
they then immediately stopped the engine , blocked the fuel line and switched off all systems on the bridge - making it impossible for the pirates to move the ship .
" the cool-headed behavior ... of the beluga crew on board and the quick action of navy units ... left the pirates no other option than to give up their dream of a million -lsb- -euro -rsb- ransom and to flee , " beluga shipping said in a statement .
beluga shipping 's executive partner niels stolberg stressed that the crew 's training in handling stressful situations such as pirate takeovers had paid off .
" our precautions and concentrated training of the crew worked out very well , " stolberg said , adding , " our colleagues on board have gotten off lightly from this attack and have escaped with no more than a fright . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greek-owned gas tanker york remains in pirate hands somali pirates a continued threat germany 's foreign office reacted to the news on monday , saying that the fight against somali pirate attacks had to address the " roots of piracy . "
the ministry called for support for the somali interim government to train security forces .
the greek-owned ship york meanwhile remains in the hands of somali pirates .
the flag , captained by a german citizen under a singapore flag , was taken by pirates on saturday off the kenyan coast .
so far this year , pirates have boarded at least 130 ships and fired at over 50 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 25.10.2010 two venerable clubs chart divergent courses out of crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer is the new man in the cologne hot seat fc cologne and borussia moenchengladbach are both off to disastrous starts in the bundesliga .
one has panicked and fired its coach , the other plans to stay the course . in the bundesliga , if you go six straight games without a win , or have only one three-pointer to your credit nine games into the season , you are liable to get fired .
like stuttgart 's ex-coach christian gross before him , fc cologne 's zvonimir soldo learned that lesson on sunday .
the billy goats parted ways with their croatian coach of a year-and-a-half at roughly the same time that they landed in last place , courtesy of the former cellar-dwellers stuttgart 's win over st. pauli .
now , news of a last place club sacking its coach rarely comes as a surprise , but when viewed alongside the goings on at another presently hapless club , borussia moenchengladbach , cologne 's move to let soldo go seems rash .
perhaps cologne can learn a lesson from their old rival .
gladbach is one rung higher up the bundesliga ladder than cologne at the moment , with six points from nine matches , but that does n't really tell the whole story .
the foals are , if anything , looking even worse than cologne at the moment .
the awfulness of gladbach 's defense is threatening to take on historic proportion .
with 27 goals allowed thus far , they are very nearly on pace to break tasmania berlin 's record of 108 for the season - a record that has stood for 45 years , and one that most assumed would never , ever be broken .
still , michael frontzeck is not out of a job .
the coach is scarcely even looking over his shoulder , and the fans are standing behind him .
deep-running roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- has been a loyal soldier at borussia moenchengladbach that he is sitting as pretty as he is , even in the midst of gladbach 's ugly form , is mostly down to his roots .
frontzeck 's managerial record - not only at gladbach , but in his prior stints at aachen and bielefeld as well - has been patchy .
but he was born in moenchengladbach , played nine seasons in three stints with the club , and understands how much borussia means to its fans .
frontzeck showed guts , and demonstrated how well he knows his club , after saturday 's humbling home loss to bremen .
gladbach 's hardcore support was baying for blood after the 4-1 loss , and many a manager would have tuned the jeers out and headed for the locker room .
frontzeck , though , saw an opportunity to circle the wagons , and climbed into the stands to hold an impromptu 15-minute question-and-answer session .
afterward , he told reporters that it had been a " comfortable conversation , " and not at all one where fans were " just looking for someone to blame . "
“ we all agreed that we can only get out of this situation together , ” he said .
“ that the fans are standing behind us is a good feeling . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiny bald head in the middle of this picture ?
that 's frontzeck the contrast with cologne could not be starker .
soldo came to the club as a rising managerial star , on the back of a croatian title with dinamo zagreb , but also as an outsider - one who seemed miscast from the start , in that he never seemed to care about the club 's history or understand the club 's special relationship to its fans .
history 's burden perhaps more than any other clubs in the bundesliga , cologne and gladbach supporters are obsessed with history .
that 's because it 's just about all they 've got . gladbach 's rich past is well-known .
they won five league titles in the 1970s , and made it to another five european finals in that golden era for german football .
for many years , though , cologne too fielded a consistently good team .
in the first quarter-century of the bundesliga , the billy goats won the league twice and finished in the top eight all but four times .
then , in the 1990s , things began to fall apart at both clubs .
cologne finished second in 1990 , and made it to the german cup final in 1991 .
gladbach won the cup in 1995 .
since then , no titles at all , for either club .
moreover , gladbach has been relegated twice , and cologne four times in the past 13 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the haircuts show it 's been some time since cologne were in a cup final falling so far , so fast , and so hard has brought on a certain delusion among both sets of fans .
the older ones still think of their club as big and important , and the younger supporters have grown up in their elders ' echo chamber , weaned on the glories of yesteryear and expectant of a return to glory any minute now .
both clubs attract tens of thousands of fans to home matches irrespective of the side 's current form , and both are followed assiduously in the local press - who are only too happy to talk up a finish in the european places after two wins in a row , and call two straight losses a crisis .
the fishbowl atmosphere can overwhelm a coach who 's not prepared to play along , as the aggressively mild-mannered soldo never was .
but for a coach who 's " one of their own , " like frontzeck or christoph daum in his recent run at cologne , it 's a perfect fit - even if they do n't win anything .
holding fast supporters seem to have determined that the base price of entry to coaching at their club is genuflection at the altar of tradition , a sort of fundamentalist fandom that seeks to purify the club of corrosive outside influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer 's cologne bona fides are unquestioned in this respect , cologne 's interim coach frank schaefer is off to a stellar start .
he has never led a senior side before , but fan darling lukas podolski pronounced his onetime youth team coach " a cologne man through and through . "
-lrb- it 's true - the 46-year-old schaefer has been working as a youth or reserve team coach at cologne for 20 of the past 26 years . -rrb-
for good measure , schaefer himself opened his maiden press conference by stating that he was " a cologne lad and fc guy too . "
he also chose as his assistant coach dirk lottner , a cologne native who played six seasons at the club and has worked with schaefer in the youth system since retiring in 2007 .
cologne 's local tabloid express cooed that " you ca n't get much more cologne than that ! "
the club says it 's not ruling out a higher-profile hire , but holding onto schaefer for a while at least has to be the best play at the moment .
the fans want cologne natives on the touchline , and so they shall have them .
let 's hope they can coach a little as well .

on sunday , the cargo ship became the second vessel with german crew members in two days to be attacked by somali pirates .
the pirates gave up their attack after the crew shut down their boat . a german cargo ship seized by somali pirates off the coast of kenya is now free , according the vessel 's owners .
verena beckhusen , spokeswoman for the bremen-based shipping company beluga-reederei , said the cargo ship beluga fortune was free monday , a day after being taken hostage in the indian ocean , some 1,200 miles -lrb- 1,930 kilometers -rrb- east of mombasa , kenya .
the ship and its crew , including two german citizens , were continuing their planned journey to south africa , beckhusen said .
no crew members were injured , and the ship sustained only minor damage .
pirates had already given up pirates had already left the ship by the time british frigate montrose arrived at the scene monday after steaming 15 hours to beluga fortune 's aid .
all 16 crewmembers were safe , the beluga shipping company told the newspaper weser kurier .
the beluga fortune is now a success story of german shipping companies ' standard procedures of shutting down all power and hiding the crew when a ship is attacked .
the ship 's crew radioed at 7 a.m. on sunday that pirates were attempting to board .
they then immediately stopped the engine , blocked the fuel line and switched off all systems on the bridge - making it impossible for the pirates to move the ship .
" the cool-headed behavior ... of the beluga crew on board and the quick action of navy units ... left the pirates no other option than to give up their dream of a million -lsb- -euro -rsb- ransom and to flee , " beluga shipping said in a statement .
beluga shipping 's executive partner niels stolberg stressed that the crew 's training in handling stressful situations such as pirate takeovers had paid off .
" our precautions and concentrated training of the crew worked out very well , " stolberg said , adding , " our colleagues on board have gotten off lightly from this attack and have escaped with no more than a fright . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greek-owned gas tanker york remains in pirate hands somali pirates a continued threat germany 's foreign office reacted to the news on monday , saying that the fight against somali pirate attacks had to address the " roots of piracy . "
the ministry called for support for the somali interim government to train security forces .
the greek-owned ship york meanwhile remains in the hands of somali pirates .
the flag , captained by a german citizen under a singapore flag , was taken by pirates on saturday off the kenyan coast .
so far this year , pirates have boarded at least 130 ships and fired at over 50 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 25.10.2010 two venerable clubs chart divergent courses out of crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer is the new man in the cologne hot seat fc cologne and borussia moenchengladbach are both off to disastrous starts in the bundesliga .
one has panicked and fired its coach , the other plans to stay the course . in the bundesliga , if you go six straight games without a win , or have only one three-pointer to your credit nine games into the season , you are liable to get fired .
like stuttgart 's ex-coach christian gross before him , fc cologne 's zvonimir soldo learned that lesson on sunday .
the billy goats parted ways with their croatian coach of a year-and-a-half at roughly the same time that they landed in last place , courtesy of the former cellar-dwellers stuttgart 's win over st. pauli .
now , news of a last place club sacking its coach rarely comes as a surprise , but when viewed alongside the goings on at another presently hapless club , borussia moenchengladbach , cologne 's move to let soldo go seems rash .
perhaps cologne can learn a lesson from their old rival .
gladbach is one rung higher up the bundesliga ladder than cologne at the moment , with six points from nine matches , but that does n't really tell the whole story .
the foals are , if anything , looking even worse than cologne at the moment .
the awfulness of gladbach 's defense is threatening to take on historic proportion .
with 27 goals allowed thus far , they are very nearly on pace to break tasmania berlin 's record of 108 for the season - a record that has stood for 45 years , and one that most assumed would never , ever be broken .
still , michael frontzeck is not out of a job .
the coach is scarcely even looking over his shoulder , and the fans are standing behind him .
deep-running roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- has been a loyal soldier at borussia moenchengladbach that he is sitting as pretty as he is , even in the midst of gladbach 's ugly form , is mostly down to his roots .
frontzeck 's managerial record - not only at gladbach , but in his prior stints at aachen and bielefeld as well - has been patchy .
but he was born in moenchengladbach , played nine seasons in three stints with the club , and understands how much borussia means to its fans .
frontzeck showed guts , and demonstrated how well he knows his club , after saturday 's humbling home loss to bremen .
gladbach 's hardcore support was baying for blood after the 4-1 loss , and many a manager would have tuned the jeers out and headed for the locker room .
frontzeck , though , saw an opportunity to circle the wagons , and climbed into the stands to hold an impromptu 15-minute question-and-answer session .
afterward , he told reporters that it had been a " comfortable conversation , " and not at all one where fans were " just looking for someone to blame . "
“ we all agreed that we can only get out of this situation together , ” he said .
“ that the fans are standing behind us is a good feeling . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiny bald head in the middle of this picture ?
that 's frontzeck the contrast with cologne could not be starker .
soldo came to the club as a rising managerial star , on the back of a croatian title with dinamo zagreb , but also as an outsider - one who seemed miscast from the start , in that he never seemed to care about the club 's history or understand the club 's special relationship to its fans .
history 's burden perhaps more than any other clubs in the bundesliga , cologne and gladbach supporters are obsessed with history .
that 's because it 's just about all they 've got . gladbach 's rich past is well-known .
they won five league titles in the 1970s , and made it to another five european finals in that golden era for german football .
for many years , though , cologne too fielded a consistently good team .
in the first quarter-century of the bundesliga , the billy goats won the league twice and finished in the top eight all but four times .
then , in the 1990s , things began to fall apart at both clubs .
cologne finished second in 1990 , and made it to the german cup final in 1991 .
gladbach won the cup in 1995 .
since then , no titles at all , for either club .
moreover , gladbach has been relegated twice , and cologne four times in the past 13 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the haircuts show it 's been some time since cologne were in a cup final falling so far , so fast , and so hard has brought on a certain delusion among both sets of fans .
the older ones still think of their club as big and important , and the younger supporters have grown up in their elders ' echo chamber , weaned on the glories of yesteryear and expectant of a return to glory any minute now .
both clubs attract tens of thousands of fans to home matches irrespective of the side 's current form , and both are followed assiduously in the local press - who are only too happy to talk up a finish in the european places after two wins in a row , and call two straight losses a crisis .
the fishbowl atmosphere can overwhelm a coach who 's not prepared to play along , as the aggressively mild-mannered soldo never was .
but for a coach who 's " one of their own , " like frontzeck or christoph daum in his recent run at cologne , it 's a perfect fit - even if they do n't win anything .
holding fast supporters seem to have determined that the base price of entry to coaching at their club is genuflection at the altar of tradition , a sort of fundamentalist fandom that seeks to purify the club of corrosive outside influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer 's cologne bona fides are unquestioned in this respect , cologne 's interim coach frank schaefer is off to a stellar start .
he has never led a senior side before , but fan darling lukas podolski pronounced his onetime youth team coach " a cologne man through and through . "
-lrb- it 's true - the 46-year-old schaefer has been working as a youth or reserve team coach at cologne for 20 of the past 26 years . -rrb-
for good measure , schaefer himself opened his maiden press conference by stating that he was " a cologne lad and fc guy too . "
he also chose as his assistant coach dirk lottner , a cologne native who played six seasons at the club and has worked with schaefer in the youth system since retiring in 2007 .
cologne 's local tabloid express cooed that " you ca n't get much more cologne than that ! "
the club says it 's not ruling out a higher-profile hire , but holding onto schaefer for a while at least has to be the best play at the moment .
the fans want cologne natives on the touchline , and so they shall have them .
let 's hope they can coach a little as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 25.10.2010 germany 's almost legal drug : cannabis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis use is n't completely tolerated in germany legalizing cannabis in germany is only a political side issue , but the topic persistently finds its way back into the conversation and the headlines .
as california votes on the issue , dw looks at the german situation . when the left party recently campaigned in state elections in north-rhine westphalia under the slogan " right to smoke , " their idea to legalize cannabis made headlines in germany .
the same principal has been in the green party 's program for 10 years .
and back in the mid-90s , the social democrats ' otto schily suggested making personal cannabis use legal .
but the question did n't come up again when schily later became interior minister .
efforts to decriminalize marijuana use for the estimated two million germans who smoke it , similar to measures in the neighboring netherlands and czech republic , have been gridlocked for some time .
only the greens and the left are still actively throwing themselves into the fray .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : possession laws vary across germany " it 's a so-called ' soft drug , " ' said gregor gysi , the left party 's parliamentary leader .
" that means its effects are no better or worse than those of alcohol , und just because it is associated with another culture , we treat it differently . "
" what we actually need with cannabis is , first of all , strict controls for minors .
but for adults business should be open for two reasons : first , it would reduce crime associated with buying and second it would end the practice of large amounts of money being made through cannabis sales . "
hazy laws currently in germany , smoking marijuana itself is not a crime , but growing , possessing and selling it is .
the federal constitutional court recommends not enforcing a penalty for possession of small amounts of cannabis for personal use , as long as the possessor is not near a school and poses no threat to the public .
but germany 's 16 states do n't have the same laws for what constitutes a " small amount " of cannabis .
in berlin it is up to 15 grams -lrb- half an ounce -rrb- ; in munich it 's six grams .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffeeshops selling cannabis are across the border in the netherlands authorities in the state of bavaria have warned of " increasing ignorance of guilt regarding cannabis consumption " and have started to crack down on smokers , so much that the german hemp association has made calls online for letters of protest .
raphael gassmann , head of the german center for addiction issues , is n't sure that taking a hard line is the best approach .
" anyone who thinks hard cannabis legislation - in germany or internationally - will lead to less consumption is , experience tells us , wrong , " said gassmann .
" in comparative law studies we have n't once seen a serious indication that punishing cannabis consumption drastically raises or significantly lowers the practice . "
gassmann said one result of going after marijuana users is that they become criminalized .
he adds that can have a devastating effect on their lives if they lose their jobs because of the crime , for example .
mixed support in any case , there seems to be conflicting feelings regarding the problem among the german population .
in a survey of the german hemp association conducted this year , just over 50 percent of germans approve of a liberal approach with regard to cannabis consumers .
but only a quarter of those surveyed support legalizing growing and personal consumption of cannabis , as well as a government regulation of the drug .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medicinal marijuana rules could change soon the social democrats ' parliamentary drug expert , angelika graf , considers legalizing cannabis the wrong signal to send .
she points out the difficult fight against two other legal drugs , alcohol and tobacco .
" i do n't think we 're doing ourselves any favors when we try and reign in use of legal drugs on the one hand and legalize a new drug on the other , " she said .
" that does n't work . "
no one seriously thinks that germany 's current government coalition of christian democrats and free democrats will loosen the country 's cannabis laws .
but , the coalition did recently agree that doctors in germany will soon be able to prescribe pain medication containing cannabis to seriously sick patients , without applying for special approval every time .

a rapid border intervention team is expected to be deployed . a rapid intervention team from the eu border agency , frontex , will be deployed for the first time to greece to help shore up the country 's porous border with turkey , the european commission has said in a statement .
the move comes after greece put out an emergency call for the border team , which is to act under greek authority .
eu internal affairs commissioner cecilia malmstroem said she had " immediately activated the mechanism to liaise with frontex and to communicate among all interested partners , so as to handle this emergency situation in the most expeditious and efficient way . "
" the situation at the greek land border with turkey is increasingly worrying , " she said .
" the flows of people crossing the border irregularly have reached alarming proportions and greece is manifestly not able to face this situation alone … i am very concerned about the humanitarian situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions inside many of europe 's detention centers are considered poor according to the united nations , an estimated 300-400 illegal immigrants enter greece every day , many of whom come from africa and afghanistan .
the un last week called on eu states to do more to lighten the migrant burden on greece , which it said has created " catastrophic " conditions for refugees .
un special rapporteur on torture manfred nowak described conditions inside greece 's overcrowded detention centers as " inhumane . "
an overwhelming majority of the refugees use greece as an entry point to other european union countries , and arrivals by land have increased by more than a third in a year .
last week , turkey pledged to cooperate with greece in a bid to control the flow of irregular immigrants making their way into europe , in exchange for greece 's help in easing visa rules for turks .

the website revealed some 400,000 confidential documents on the iraq war . british deputy prime minister nick clegg called sunday for an investigation into allegations against the british military found in iraq war documents leaked by whistle-blowing wikileaks .
the website on friday published some 400,000 confidential documents on the war in iraq , which suggest negligence on the part of uk military in several cases of civilian death and torture .
" we can bemoan how these leaks occurred , but i think the nature of the allegations made are extraordinarily serious .
they are distressing to read about and they are very serious , " clegg told the bbc in an interview .
condemning wikileaks the comments came after britain 's ministry of defense joined the pentagon in condemning the release of the classified documents , saying they could put the lives of british soldiers at risk .
wikileaks ' publication of the documents will make the job of british and allied troops " more difficult and more dangerous , " the ministry said saturday .
the documents , which wikileaks founder julian assange said reveal 15,000 more civilian deaths than were previously known about , will put britain in a difficult legal position , according to a solicitor working on behalf of iraqis who claim abuse by british forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy pm clegg called for an investigation phil shiner , of public interest lawyers , said there was a " huge and growing body of evidence about the killing , ill treatment and torture of iraqis while in uk custody . "
" some of these deaths will be in circumstances where the uk -lsb- has -rsb- a clear legal responsibility , " he added .
despite condemning publication of the leaked files , the ministry of defense said in a statement that it would " consider " the information if it revealed any new evidence .
denmark vows to scour documents meanwhile , denmark 's military announced sunday it would carefully study the leaked documents to see if they revealed any wrongdoing by danish soldiers . " we want to see the documents for ourselves and compare them to our own information , " said danish defense command spokesman torben kjedsen . danish defense minister gitte lillelund bech said she was pleased with the decision , although danish media report the files reveal negligence on the part of danish soldiers in cases where prisoners were tortured by iraqi police .
us and uk ' turned a blind eye ' british newspaper the guardian , which had the documents in advance of their publication , said the leaks showed " us authorities failed to investigate hundreds of reports of abuse , torture , rape and even murder by iraqi police and soldiers whose conduct appears to be systematic and normally unpunished . " " us and uk officials have insisted that no official record of civilian casualties exists but the logs record 66,081 non-combatant deaths out of a total of 109,000 fatalities , " the newspaper stated . the guardian speculated that wikileaks had received the material from the " same dissident us army intelligence analyst " who leaked material on afghanistan , which the site published in july .
wikileaks , however , has not revealed its source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange said the documents revealed war crimes wikileaks founder defends the release julian assange defended his site 's release of confidential documents against condemnation from us and uk authorities , saying " this disclosure is about the truth . "
" the first casualty of war is the truth .
we hope to correct some of that attack on the truth that occurred before the war , during the war , and which has continued on since the war officially concluded , " he said .
assange said the documents showed evidence of war crimes .
he also told al jazeera television the documents provided enough material for 40 wrongful killing lawsuits .
" the lessons of iraq can be applied to afghanistan and to other countries western governments may choose to invade , " said assange , who vowed to continue publishing leaked documents .
the death toll in iraq now stands at 150,000 , 80 percent of which were civilians , according to the organization iraq body count , which cooperated in the analysis of the released material .
the civilian deaths revealed by the leaked documents occurred as a result of " small incidents " occurring daily during the conflict , the organization 's head , john sloboda , said .
he added that the vast majority of civilian deaths had been caused by " internal violence " among iraqi factions .

both factions of the hurriyat conference have called for a boycott of their first visit to the kashmir valley . the decision to have a group of interlocutors was originally part of an eight-point initiative announced by the indian government to engage with the people of jammu and kashmir and move forward to find a solution to the crisis . the group , which has a one-year mandate and will report after monthly trips to the valley , is supposed to cover views from all three regions of jammu , ladakh and kashmir . the three-member team of dilip padgaonkar , radha kumar and m.m. ansari - a journalist , an academic and an educationist – was set up earlier this month in the wake of renewed unrest in the kashmir valley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hurriyat conference leader syed ali shah geelani has called on delhi to accept his five-point proposal " we will engage with every section of opinion , " dilip padgaonkar explained .
" why do we have this dialogue ?
so that we can have a permanent comprehensive political settlement to the kashmir dispute .
that has to be tried out .
it is a complex problem . " separatists refuse to meet interlocutors however , the interlocutors have got a somewhat hostile reception , with the separatists refusing to meet them . an ardent supporter of the state 's merger with pakistan , hard-line hurriyat conference leader syed ali shah geelani said dialogue with new delhi would only be possible if the government accepted his five-point proposal that includes accepting kashmir as an international dispute . mirwaiz umar farooq , who heads another faction of the conference , described the appointment of the interlocutors as a mere wastage of time .
he said that the lingering dispute should be resolved through tripartite talks between pakistan , india and the " real " kashmiri leadership . pessimism about group 's success nonetheless , the team tried to get on with the task at hand , interacting with young people , visiting jails , calling on politicians , and also praying for the success of their mission at the holy muslim shrine of hazratbal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interlocutors want to talk with all sections of society including angry youths iqbal nazir , a lecturer at the amir singh college in srinagar , was not very optimistic : " this does not seem like a healthy initiative taken by india given that we have seen commissions and working groups being created before .
their recommendations did not reach any conclusion .
and these interlocutors seem to be meeting the same fate . " for sana altaf , an educationist , the prospects seemed equally bleak : " the visit of the interlocutors at this time is not going to be beneficial .
the central government should carve out a situation in which people can lead a normal life , after business , schools and education have been restored .
the interlocutors may have long-term results but as of now they are not accessing the ground situation which is very important for the common man of kashmir . " last december , the government 's move to engage separatist leaders in " quiet diplomacy " failed . author : murali krishnan editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 25.10.2010 two venerable clubs chart divergent courses out of crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer is the new man in the cologne hot seat fc cologne and borussia moenchengladbach are both off to disastrous starts in the bundesliga .
one has panicked and fired its coach , the other plans to stay the course . in the bundesliga , if you go six straight games without a win , or have only one three-pointer to your credit nine games into the season , you are liable to get fired .
like stuttgart 's ex-coach christian gross before him , fc cologne 's zvonimir soldo learned that lesson on sunday .
the billy goats parted ways with their croatian coach of a year-and-a-half at roughly the same time that they landed in last place , courtesy of the former cellar-dwellers stuttgart 's win over st. pauli .
now , news of a last place club sacking its coach rarely comes as a surprise , but when viewed alongside the goings on at another presently hapless club , borussia moenchengladbach , cologne 's move to let soldo go seems rash .
perhaps cologne can learn a lesson from their old rival .
gladbach is one rung higher up the bundesliga ladder than cologne at the moment , with six points from nine matches , but that does n't really tell the whole story .
the foals are , if anything , looking even worse than cologne at the moment .
the awfulness of gladbach 's defense is threatening to take on historic proportion .
with 27 goals allowed thus far , they are very nearly on pace to break tasmania berlin 's record of 108 for the season - a record that has stood for 45 years , and one that most assumed would never , ever be broken .
still , michael frontzeck is not out of a job .
the coach is scarcely even looking over his shoulder , and the fans are standing behind him .
deep-running roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- has been a loyal soldier at borussia moenchengladbach that he is sitting as pretty as he is , even in the midst of gladbach 's ugly form , is mostly down to his roots .
frontzeck 's managerial record - not only at gladbach , but in his prior stints at aachen and bielefeld as well - has been patchy .
but he was born in moenchengladbach , played nine seasons in three stints with the club , and understands how much borussia means to its fans .
frontzeck showed guts , and demonstrated how well he knows his club , after saturday 's humbling home loss to bremen .
gladbach 's hardcore support was baying for blood after the 4-1 loss , and many a manager would have tuned the jeers out and headed for the locker room .
frontzeck , though , saw an opportunity to circle the wagons , and climbed into the stands to hold an impromptu 15-minute question-and-answer session .
afterward , he told reporters that it had been a " comfortable conversation , " and not at all one where fans were " just looking for someone to blame . "
“ we all agreed that we can only get out of this situation together , ” he said .
“ that the fans are standing behind us is a good feeling . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiny bald head in the middle of this picture ?
that 's frontzeck the contrast with cologne could not be starker .
soldo came to the club as a rising managerial star , on the back of a croatian title with dinamo zagreb , but also as an outsider - one who seemed miscast from the start , in that he never seemed to care about the club 's history or understand the club 's special relationship to its fans .
history 's burden perhaps more than any other clubs in the bundesliga , cologne and gladbach supporters are obsessed with history .
that 's because it 's just about all they 've got . gladbach 's rich past is well-known .
they won five league titles in the 1970s , and made it to another five european finals in that golden era for german football .
for many years , though , cologne too fielded a consistently good team .
in the first quarter-century of the bundesliga , the billy goats won the league twice and finished in the top eight all but four times .
then , in the 1990s , things began to fall apart at both clubs .
cologne finished second in 1990 , and made it to the german cup final in 1991 .
gladbach won the cup in 1995 .
since then , no titles at all , for either club .
moreover , gladbach has been relegated twice , and cologne four times in the past 13 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the haircuts show it 's been some time since cologne were in a cup final falling so far , so fast , and so hard has brought on a certain delusion among both sets of fans .
the older ones still think of their club as big and important , and the younger supporters have grown up in their elders ' echo chamber , weaned on the glories of yesteryear and expectant of a return to glory any minute now .
both clubs attract tens of thousands of fans to home matches irrespective of the side 's current form , and both are followed assiduously in the local press - who are only too happy to talk up a finish in the european places after two wins in a row , and call two straight losses a crisis .
the fishbowl atmosphere can overwhelm a coach who 's not prepared to play along , as the aggressively mild-mannered soldo never was .
but for a coach who 's " one of their own , " like frontzeck or christoph daum in his recent run at cologne , it 's a perfect fit - even if they do n't win anything .
holding fast supporters seem to have determined that the base price of entry to coaching at their club is genuflection at the altar of tradition , a sort of fundamentalist fandom that seeks to purify the club of corrosive outside influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer 's cologne bona fides are unquestioned in this respect , cologne 's interim coach frank schaefer is off to a stellar start .
he has never led a senior side before , but fan darling lukas podolski pronounced his onetime youth team coach " a cologne man through and through . "
-lrb- it 's true - the 46-year-old schaefer has been working as a youth or reserve team coach at cologne for 20 of the past 26 years . -rrb-
for good measure , schaefer himself opened his maiden press conference by stating that he was " a cologne lad and fc guy too . "
he also chose as his assistant coach dirk lottner , a cologne native who played six seasons at the club and has worked with schaefer in the youth system since retiring in 2007 .
cologne 's local tabloid express cooed that " you ca n't get much more cologne than that ! "
the club says it 's not ruling out a higher-profile hire , but holding onto schaefer for a while at least has to be the best play at the moment .
the fans want cologne natives on the touchline , and so they shall have them .
let 's hope they can coach a little as well .

frontzeck showed guts , and demonstrated how well he knows his club , after saturday 's humbling home loss to bremen .
gladbach 's hardcore support was baying for blood after the 4-1 loss , and many a manager would have tuned the jeers out and headed for the locker room .
frontzeck , though , saw an opportunity to circle the wagons , and climbed into the stands to hold an impromptu 15-minute question-and-answer session .
afterward , he told reporters that it had been a " comfortable conversation , " and not at all one where fans were " just looking for someone to blame . "
“ we all agreed that we can only get out of this situation together , ” he said .
“ that the fans are standing behind us is a good feeling . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiny bald head in the middle of this picture ?
that 's frontzeck the contrast with cologne could not be starker .
soldo came to the club as a rising managerial star , on the back of a croatian title with dinamo zagreb , but also as an outsider - one who seemed miscast from the start , in that he never seemed to care about the club 's history or understand the club 's special relationship to its fans .
history 's burden perhaps more than any other clubs in the bundesliga , cologne and gladbach supporters are obsessed with history .
that 's because it 's just about all they 've got . gladbach 's rich past is well-known .
they won five league titles in the 1970s , and made it to another five european finals in that golden era for german football .
for many years , though , cologne too fielded a consistently good team .
in the first quarter-century of the bundesliga , the billy goats won the league twice and finished in the top eight all but four times .
then , in the 1990s , things began to fall apart at both clubs .
cologne finished second in 1990 , and made it to the german cup final in 1991 .
gladbach won the cup in 1995 .
since then , no titles at all , for either club .
moreover , gladbach has been relegated twice , and cologne four times in the past 13 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the haircuts show it 's been some time since cologne were in a cup final falling so far , so fast , and so hard has brought on a certain delusion among both sets of fans .
the older ones still think of their club as big and important , and the younger supporters have grown up in their elders ' echo chamber , weaned on the glories of yesteryear and expectant of a return to glory any minute now .
both clubs attract tens of thousands of fans to home matches irrespective of the side 's current form , and both are followed assiduously in the local press - who are only too happy to talk up a finish in the european places after two wins in a row , and call two straight losses a crisis .
the fishbowl atmosphere can overwhelm a coach who 's not prepared to play along , as the aggressively mild-mannered soldo never was .
but for a coach who 's " one of their own , " like frontzeck or christoph daum in his recent run at cologne , it 's a perfect fit - even if they do n't win anything .
holding fast supporters seem to have determined that the base price of entry to coaching at their club is genuflection at the altar of tradition , a sort of fundamentalist fandom that seeks to purify the club of corrosive outside influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer 's cologne bona fides are unquestioned in this respect , cologne 's interim coach frank schaefer is off to a stellar start .
he has never led a senior side before , but fan darling lukas podolski pronounced his onetime youth team coach " a cologne man through and through . "
-lrb- it 's true - the 46-year-old schaefer has been working as a youth or reserve team coach at cologne for 20 of the past 26 years . -rrb-
for good measure , schaefer himself opened his maiden press conference by stating that he was " a cologne lad and fc guy too . "
he also chose as his assistant coach dirk lottner , a cologne native who played six seasons at the club and has worked with schaefer in the youth system since retiring in 2007 .
cologne 's local tabloid express cooed that " you ca n't get much more cologne than that ! "
the club says it 's not ruling out a higher-profile hire , but holding onto schaefer for a while at least has to be the best play at the moment .
the fans want cologne natives on the touchline , and so they shall have them .
let 's hope they can coach a little as well .

one has panicked and fired its coach , the other plans to stay the course . in the bundesliga , if you go six straight games without a win , or have only one three-pointer to your credit nine games into the season , you are liable to get fired .
like stuttgart 's ex-coach christian gross before him , fc cologne 's zvonimir soldo learned that lesson on sunday .
the billy goats parted ways with their croatian coach of a year-and-a-half at roughly the same time that they landed in last place , courtesy of the former cellar-dwellers stuttgart 's win over st. pauli .
now , news of a last place club sacking its coach rarely comes as a surprise , but when viewed alongside the goings on at another presently hapless club , borussia moenchengladbach , cologne 's move to let soldo go seems rash .
perhaps cologne can learn a lesson from their old rival .
gladbach is one rung higher up the bundesliga ladder than cologne at the moment , with six points from nine matches , but that does n't really tell the whole story .
the foals are , if anything , looking even worse than cologne at the moment .
the awfulness of gladbach 's defense is threatening to take on historic proportion .
with 27 goals allowed thus far , they are very nearly on pace to break tasmania berlin 's record of 108 for the season - a record that has stood for 45 years , and one that most assumed would never , ever be broken .
still , michael frontzeck is not out of a job .
the coach is scarcely even looking over his shoulder , and the fans are standing behind him .
deep-running roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- has been a loyal soldier at borussia moenchengladbach that he is sitting as pretty as he is , even in the midst of gladbach 's ugly form , is mostly down to his roots .
frontzeck 's managerial record - not only at gladbach , but in his prior stints at aachen and bielefeld as well - has been patchy .
but he was born in moenchengladbach , played nine seasons in three stints with the club , and understands how much borussia means to its fans .
frontzeck showed guts , and demonstrated how well he knows his club , after saturday 's humbling home loss to bremen .

as the world struggles with agreements to reverse biodiversity loss , the wadden sea shines as an example of transnational conservation . the wadden sea is one of central europe 's most important nature reserves . the strip of north sea coast is home to the biggest contiguous area of mudflats in the world , and stretches from den helder in the netherlands to esbjerg in denmark via three german states . much of the wadden sea was listed as a unesco world heritage site in 2009 because it serves as a flourishing habitat for some 3,200 species of animals , provides an important way-station for migratory birds , supports a wide variety of plants among its salt marshes and has played a crucial role in restoring seal populations over the past two decades . today the wadden sea is seen as a model for promoting cross-border conservation , but the road to success was not straight forward . road to riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal populations are recovering thanks to a nurturing environment the wadden sea national park is really three parks divided between the german states of schleswig holstein , lower saxony and the city-state of hamburg . the oldest is the park established in germany 's northernmost state , schleswig-holstein , in 1985 . it was prompted by a dawning awareness that piecemeal legislation was proving inadequate at dealing with the growing impacts of industrial and agricultural waste , development and commercial expoitation on the region . at first , proposals for a park met with stiff resistance from locals , who feared for their hunting and fishing rights , resented impositions on their freedom to use the area and worried about an influx of tourists . yet through a mixture of compromise and consensus-building , the state 's then premier , uwe barschel , managed to build enough support to pass legislation .

should google 's statement be proven true , caspar says the company may be fined . according to ulrich boerger , a hamburg-based privacy lawyer , evidence of password and email leaks would add another dimension to the privacy debate in germany , but " it 's difficult to talk about any concrete consequences at this stage . " similar reaction in the uk google 's latest revelations have also not altered the general course of action for uk authorities , despite having cleared google of the charge of having collected " meaningful personal details " earlier this year . " we will be making enquires to see whether this information relates to the data inadvertently captured in the uk , before deciding on the necessary course of action , including a consideration of the need to use our enforcement powers , " wrote the information commissioner 's office , great britain 's data protection agency , in a statement published on its website . google has previously said it did not realize that kismet , a free software program it uses to detect wireless networks , was also recording snippets of emails and web pages .

some 200 protestors seized control of the depot at fos-sur-mer , believed to be the largest in southern france , as riot police looked on , according to news agency agence-presse france .
meanwhile , a depot in central france , at saint-pierre-des corps , was freed after a week of paralysis when around 30 demonstrators walked away from the site without incident .
strikes in the country 's oil industry and blockades of fuel depots have left 35 percent of gas stations in the paris area completely dry or out of at least one kind of fuel , a transport ministry spokeswoman said .
about one-third of gas stations in western france were in " real difficulty " and 10 to 15 percent in the rest of the country were empty , she added .
unions have already called for two more days of strikes , and university students are planning nationwide marches on tuesday in last-ditch efforts to stop the pension reform before a reconciliation between the two houses of parliament and a final vote by the national assembly expected wednesday .
sarkozy popularity suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has n't been able to stop protests - or his sinking approval sarkozy 's government insists that the pension reform , which will raise the minimum retirement age to 62 from 60 , is " inevitable " and the only way to fill an expected pension budget gap and reduce the country 's growing deficit .
but the opposition socialists say if they win presidential elections in 2012 , their candidate will restore the retirement age to 60 .
polls suggest a majority of french voters support or sympathize with the strikers , but jean-francois cope , leader of sarkozy 's ump party in parliament , blamed the widespread disruption on the work of a minority .

a rapid border intervention team is expected to be deployed . a rapid intervention team from the eu border agency , frontex , will be deployed for the first time to greece to help shore up the country 's porous border with turkey , the european commission has said in a statement .
the move comes after greece put out an emergency call for the border team , which is to act under greek authority .
eu internal affairs commissioner cecilia malmstroem said she had " immediately activated the mechanism to liaise with frontex and to communicate among all interested partners , so as to handle this emergency situation in the most expeditious and efficient way . "
" the situation at the greek land border with turkey is increasingly worrying , " she said .
" the flows of people crossing the border irregularly have reached alarming proportions and greece is manifestly not able to face this situation alone … i am very concerned about the humanitarian situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions inside many of europe 's detention centers are considered poor according to the united nations , an estimated 300-400 illegal immigrants enter greece every day , many of whom come from africa and afghanistan .
the un last week called on eu states to do more to lighten the migrant burden on greece , which it said has created " catastrophic " conditions for refugees .
un special rapporteur on torture manfred nowak described conditions inside greece 's overcrowded detention centers as " inhumane . "
an overwhelming majority of the refugees use greece as an entry point to other european union countries , and arrivals by land have increased by more than a third in a year .
last week , turkey pledged to cooperate with greece in a bid to control the flow of irregular immigrants making their way into europe , in exchange for greece 's help in easing visa rules for turks .

but no such luck .
economics minister rainer bruederle said that although he would like to see the company 's headquarters remain on german turf , he was not willing to intervene in the market process .
and chancellor angela merkel agreed on both counts .
that was the end of that , but not the end of the story .
on sunday , germany 's weekly news magazine der spiegel reported that hochtief is now in talks with qatar , thanks , no less , to mrs merkel .
a spokeswoman for the coveted construction company told reporters that during an industry leaders dinner at berlin 's presidential palace , the german chancellor had taken the opportunity to introduce hochtief chief executive herbert luetkestratkoetter to the qatari economics minister .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel does not want to see hochtief split up should qatar decide to get on board with its sovereign wealth fund , it would be as a ' white-knight ' investor , a role it has played in the past for the volkswagen group .
australian assistance but hochtief is not leaving its fate solely in the lap of the middle east .
the company is also looking to australia , home of its hugely successful subsidiary leighton holdings , to bolster its defenses .
last week , the german company applied to the australian takeovers panel to try and force acs to make a fully priced bid for outstanding shares in leighton , which contributes some 80 percent of hochtief 's total earnings and is therefore particularly attractive to the heavily indebted spanish bidder .
on monday , leighton upped the pressure by making its own application to the panel to block the all-share bid on the grounds that it would rob the company of its independence .
" although hochtief owns 54.5 percent of leighton , leighton is not in the normal position of a controlled ' downstream ' entity , " leighton chairman david mortimer said in a statement .
under the current governance arrangements between the german company and its australian subsidiary , leighton has an independent board and management .
protecting minority shareholders furthermore mortimer said that to allow a takeover by acs - which currently holds a 29 percent stake in hochtief - without a commitment to retain leighton 's independence status or any obligation to make a cash bid for the subsidiary would not be in the interests of shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is looking to australian regulators for support " leighton 's independent directors are concerned that german takeover law does not provide the same level of protection for the interests of minority shareholders that investors expect of companies listed on the australian securities exchange , " he said .
the australian takeovers panel has three weeks to decide whether the spanish bid for hochtief is in actual fact a bid for leighton , and whether minority shareholders would be disadvantaged a successful takeover .
if the regulators find in favor of leighton , it could double the money acs would need to buy a controlling stake in the german company .

some 200 protestors seized control of the depot at fos-sur-mer , believed to be the largest in southern france , as riot police looked on , according to news agency agence-presse france .
meanwhile , a depot in central france , at saint-pierre-des corps , was freed after a week of paralysis when around 30 demonstrators walked away from the site without incident .
strikes in the country 's oil industry and blockades of fuel depots have left 35 percent of gas stations in the paris area completely dry or out of at least one kind of fuel , a transport ministry spokeswoman said .
about one-third of gas stations in western france were in " real difficulty " and 10 to 15 percent in the rest of the country were empty , she added .

but the opposition socialists say if they win presidential elections in 2012 , their candidate will restore the retirement age to 60 .

but no such luck .
economics minister rainer bruederle said that although he would like to see the company 's headquarters remain on german turf , he was not willing to intervene in the market process .
and chancellor angela merkel agreed on both counts .
that was the end of that , but not the end of the story .
on sunday , germany 's weekly news magazine der spiegel reported that hochtief is now in talks with qatar , thanks , no less , to mrs merkel .
a spokeswoman for the coveted construction company told reporters that during an industry leaders dinner at berlin 's presidential palace , the german chancellor had taken the opportunity to introduce hochtief chief executive herbert luetkestratkoetter to the qatari economics minister .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel does not want to see hochtief split up should qatar decide to get on board with its sovereign wealth fund , it would be as a ' white-knight ' investor , a role it has played in the past for the volkswagen group .
australian assistance but hochtief is not leaving its fate solely in the lap of the middle east .
the company is also looking to australia , home of its hugely successful subsidiary leighton holdings , to bolster its defenses .
last week , the german company applied to the australian takeovers panel to try and force acs to make a fully priced bid for outstanding shares in leighton , which contributes some 80 percent of hochtief 's total earnings and is therefore particularly attractive to the heavily indebted spanish bidder .
on monday , leighton upped the pressure by making its own application to the panel to block the all-share bid on the grounds that it would rob the company of its independence .
" although hochtief owns 54.5 percent of leighton , leighton is not in the normal position of a controlled ' downstream ' entity , " leighton chairman david mortimer said in a statement .
under the current governance arrangements between the german company and its australian subsidiary , leighton has an independent board and management .
protecting minority shareholders furthermore mortimer said that to allow a takeover by acs - which currently holds a 29 percent stake in hochtief - without a commitment to retain leighton 's independence status or any obligation to make a cash bid for the subsidiary would not be in the interests of shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is looking to australian regulators for support " leighton 's independent directors are concerned that german takeover law does not provide the same level of protection for the interests of minority shareholders that investors expect of companies listed on the australian securities exchange , " he said .
the australian takeovers panel has three weeks to decide whether the spanish bid for hochtief is in actual fact a bid for leighton , and whether minority shareholders would be disadvantaged a successful takeover .
if the regulators find in favor of leighton , it could double the money acs would need to buy a controlling stake in the german company .

following a meeting at the chancellery on sunday , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and economics minister rainer bruederle said the move would see the financial burden on energy-intensive industries eased by nullifying previous plans to slash a rebate such companies were entitled to on a so-called " eco-tax .

the measure is expected to spare heavy industry from having to fork out around 600 million euros -lrb- $ 841 million -rrb- each year for the eco-tax .
the ministers stressed , however , that the replacement tobacco tax was not yet set in stone and was still only a proposal .

the left party has already voiced opposition to easing the tax burden on industry .
the decision by the german government serves the " lobbying interests of the corporations " and places the costs of the financial crisis on those who are not responsible for it , said left party taxation spokeswoman barbara hoell on monday .
industry groups had heaped pressure on the government over the eco-tax , arguing that slashing eco-tax rebates could endanger up to 870,000 jobs and complicate operations for medium-size businesses .
hans-peter keitel , president of the federation of german industries , said that reducing the rebate would threaten stability in the country 's entire industrial sector .
also to come from the meeting at the chancellery was confirmation of a plan to simplify german taxes from 2012 .

a rapid border intervention team is expected to be deployed . a rapid intervention team from the eu border agency , frontex , will be deployed for the first time to greece to help shore up the country 's porous border with turkey , the european commission has said in a statement .
the move comes after greece put out an emergency call for the border team , which is to act under greek authority .
eu internal affairs commissioner cecilia malmstroem said she had " immediately activated the mechanism to liaise with frontex and to communicate among all interested partners , so as to handle this emergency situation in the most expeditious and efficient way . "
" the situation at the greek land border with turkey is increasingly worrying , " she said .

un special rapporteur on torture manfred nowak described conditions inside greece 's overcrowded detention centers as " inhumane . "
an overwhelming majority of the refugees use greece as an entry point to other european union countries , and arrivals by land have increased by more than a third in a year .
last week , turkey pledged to cooperate with greece in a bid to control the flow of irregular immigrants making their way into europe , in exchange for greece 's help in easing visa rules for turks .

instead , the government will be advised to cut desk jobs in the defense ministry . a german government commission is to urge caution on plans to radically reduction the number of service personnel numbers within the country 's armed forces .
findings of the inquiry are instead to recommend a dramatic scaling back of office staff in the defense ministry from 3,090 positions to just 1,600 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg said troop numbers could fall to 164,000 " as i see it , they need half the number of employees as they currently have at most , " frank-juergen weise , who chairs the commission , told the public television broadcaster ard on sunday .
chancellor angela merkel 's government has been investigating ways to save money on the armed forced , with up to 240,000 people currently in uniform .
defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenburg has said that this total could be slashed to 164,000 troops in the future , with an end to the current german policy of military conscription . however , the commission is expected to recommend that the figure be reduced to between 180,000 and 190,000 , with further cuts being deemed impracticable .
savings within ministry savings would instead be made at the ministry , which has its main base in the western city of bonn - where 2,570 people are employed - and a smaller section in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle welcomed the inquiry 's findings the six-strong commission is to hand over its 114-page report to zu guttenberg on tuesday , advising that remaining resources be concentrated in berlin .
they said that the dual location of the ministry meant that it suffered from " fragmentation " and that a move to the capital move would allow more central control .
civic leaders in bonn , the former capital of west germany , have warned that major lay-offs there would lead to protests .
foreign minister guido westerwelle welcomed the report on behalf of his free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- party , junior partners in the ruling coalition , saying that greater efficiency was necessary .
speaking to ard , westerwelle added that the end of conscription to make way for a fully professional army was a " long-standing desire " of the fdp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 25.10.2010 germany 's almost legal drug : cannabis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis use is n't completely tolerated in germany legalizing cannabis in germany is only a political side issue , but the topic persistently finds its way back into the conversation and the headlines .
as california votes on the issue , dw looks at the german situation . when the left party recently campaigned in state elections in north-rhine westphalia under the slogan " right to smoke , " their idea to legalize cannabis made headlines in germany .
the same principal has been in the green party 's program for 10 years .
and back in the mid-90s , the social democrats ' otto schily suggested making personal cannabis use legal .
but the question did n't come up again when schily later became interior minister .
efforts to decriminalize marijuana use for the estimated two million germans who smoke it , similar to measures in the neighboring netherlands and czech republic , have been gridlocked for some time .
only the greens and the left are still actively throwing themselves into the fray .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : possession laws vary across germany " it 's a so-called ' soft drug , " ' said gregor gysi , the left party 's parliamentary leader .
" that means its effects are no better or worse than those of alcohol , und just because it is associated with another culture , we treat it differently . "
" what we actually need with cannabis is , first of all , strict controls for minors .
but for adults business should be open for two reasons : first , it would reduce crime associated with buying and second it would end the practice of large amounts of money being made through cannabis sales . "
hazy laws currently in germany , smoking marijuana itself is not a crime , but growing , possessing and selling it is .
the federal constitutional court recommends not enforcing a penalty for possession of small amounts of cannabis for personal use , as long as the possessor is not near a school and poses no threat to the public .
but germany 's 16 states do n't have the same laws for what constitutes a " small amount " of cannabis .
in berlin it is up to 15 grams -lrb- half an ounce -rrb- ; in munich it 's six grams .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffeeshops selling cannabis are across the border in the netherlands authorities in the state of bavaria have warned of " increasing ignorance of guilt regarding cannabis consumption " and have started to crack down on smokers , so much that the german hemp association has made calls online for letters of protest .
raphael gassmann , head of the german center for addiction issues , is n't sure that taking a hard line is the best approach .
" anyone who thinks hard cannabis legislation - in germany or internationally - will lead to less consumption is , experience tells us , wrong , " said gassmann .
" in comparative law studies we have n't once seen a serious indication that punishing cannabis consumption drastically raises or significantly lowers the practice . "
gassmann said one result of going after marijuana users is that they become criminalized .
he adds that can have a devastating effect on their lives if they lose their jobs because of the crime , for example .
mixed support in any case , there seems to be conflicting feelings regarding the problem among the german population .
in a survey of the german hemp association conducted this year , just over 50 percent of germans approve of a liberal approach with regard to cannabis consumers .
but only a quarter of those surveyed support legalizing growing and personal consumption of cannabis , as well as a government regulation of the drug .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medicinal marijuana rules could change soon the social democrats ' parliamentary drug expert , angelika graf , considers legalizing cannabis the wrong signal to send .
she points out the difficult fight against two other legal drugs , alcohol and tobacco .
" i do n't think we 're doing ourselves any favors when we try and reign in use of legal drugs on the one hand and legalize a new drug on the other , " she said .
" that does n't work . "
no one seriously thinks that germany 's current government coalition of christian democrats and free democrats will loosen the country 's cannabis laws .
but , the coalition did recently agree that doctors in germany will soon be able to prescribe pain medication containing cannabis to seriously sick patients , without applying for special approval every time .

as the world struggles with agreements to reverse biodiversity loss , the wadden sea shines as an example of transnational conservation . the wadden sea is one of central europe 's most important nature reserves . the strip of north sea coast is home to the biggest contiguous area of mudflats in the world , and stretches from den helder in the netherlands to esbjerg in denmark via three german states . much of the wadden sea was listed as a unesco world heritage site in 2009 because it serves as a flourishing habitat for some 3,200 species of animals , provides an important way-station for migratory birds , supports a wide variety of plants among its salt marshes and has played a crucial role in restoring seal populations over the past two decades . today the wadden sea is seen as a model for promoting cross-border conservation , but the road to success was not straight forward . road to riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal populations are recovering thanks to a nurturing environment the wadden sea national park is really three parks divided between the german states of schleswig holstein , lower saxony and the city-state of hamburg . the oldest is the park established in germany 's northernmost state , schleswig-holstein , in 1985 . it was prompted by a dawning awareness that piecemeal legislation was proving inadequate at dealing with the growing impacts of industrial and agricultural waste , development and commercial expoitation on the region . at first , proposals for a park met with stiff resistance from locals , who feared for their hunting and fishing rights , resented impositions on their freedom to use the area and worried about an influx of tourists . yet through a mixture of compromise and consensus-building , the state 's then premier , uwe barschel , managed to build enough support to pass legislation . " it sounds crude , but we were just trying to get people on board , " recalls detlef hansen , the head of the national park . " we formed working groups with fishermen , with shepherds , with hunters , and let them have a say in the decision making . " in the end , it was conservationists who felt they were getting the short end of the stick and initially dismissed barschel 's plan as a sham . yet over the years , protection was extended : in 1990 a deal was struck to protect seal populations in the wadden sea – the first accord signed under the bonn convention on migratory species . today , that accord between germany , the netherlands and denmark is held up as a model for multilateral species protection programs . success has boiled down to " defining common objectives " and " working together " with all stakeholders , said jens enemark , secretary of the common wadden sea secretariat - the international organization tasked with facilitating cooperation in the wadden sea . this has meant identifying and mitigating the main human threats to the region , namely pollution , disturbance and habitat destruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the tide is out , visitors enjoy walking on the sea bed local dividends and it 's not just seals that have reaped the rewards , says detlef hansen . " today , you stand on the dike and you realize that it has become a quiet , peaceful place - there 's no more bird hunting , no low-flying planes , and military maneuvers are history .
visitors , and also the inhabitants , can enjoy the blooming salt marshes , " hansen said . locals now overwhelmingly support the national park , and while jens enemark says conservation authorities continue to have different priorities to fishermen and others who depend upon the region for their livelihood , relations are far more cordial than they were two decades ago . indeed , the thriving environment has proved a boon for another industry . " more than two million guests a year spend vacation on the north sea coast of schleswig holstein , " said konstanze hoefling-hoff of the north sea tourism service .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 25.10.2010 germany 's almost legal drug : cannabis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis use is n't completely tolerated in germany legalizing cannabis in germany is only a political side issue , but the topic persistently finds its way back into the conversation and the headlines .
as california votes on the issue , dw looks at the german situation . when the left party recently campaigned in state elections in north-rhine westphalia under the slogan " right to smoke , " their idea to legalize cannabis made headlines in germany .
the same principal has been in the green party 's program for 10 years .
and back in the mid-90s , the social democrats ' otto schily suggested making personal cannabis use legal .
but the question did n't come up again when schily later became interior minister .
efforts to decriminalize marijuana use for the estimated two million germans who smoke it , similar to measures in the neighboring netherlands and czech republic , have been gridlocked for some time .
only the greens and the left are still actively throwing themselves into the fray .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : possession laws vary across germany " it 's a so-called ' soft drug , " ' said gregor gysi , the left party 's parliamentary leader .
" that means its effects are no better or worse than those of alcohol , und just because it is associated with another culture , we treat it differently . "
" what we actually need with cannabis is , first of all , strict controls for minors .
but for adults business should be open for two reasons : first , it would reduce crime associated with buying and second it would end the practice of large amounts of money being made through cannabis sales . "
hazy laws currently in germany , smoking marijuana itself is not a crime , but growing , possessing and selling it is .
the federal constitutional court recommends not enforcing a penalty for possession of small amounts of cannabis for personal use , as long as the possessor is not near a school and poses no threat to the public .
but germany 's 16 states do n't have the same laws for what constitutes a " small amount " of cannabis .
in berlin it is up to 15 grams -lrb- half an ounce -rrb- ; in munich it 's six grams .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffeeshops selling cannabis are across the border in the netherlands authorities in the state of bavaria have warned of " increasing ignorance of guilt regarding cannabis consumption " and have started to crack down on smokers , so much that the german hemp association has made calls online for letters of protest .
raphael gassmann , head of the german center for addiction issues , is n't sure that taking a hard line is the best approach .
" anyone who thinks hard cannabis legislation - in germany or internationally - will lead to less consumption is , experience tells us , wrong , " said gassmann .
" in comparative law studies we have n't once seen a serious indication that punishing cannabis consumption drastically raises or significantly lowers the practice . "
gassmann said one result of going after marijuana users is that they become criminalized .
he adds that can have a devastating effect on their lives if they lose their jobs because of the crime , for example .
mixed support in any case , there seems to be conflicting feelings regarding the problem among the german population .
in a survey of the german hemp association conducted this year , just over 50 percent of germans approve of a liberal approach with regard to cannabis consumers .
but only a quarter of those surveyed support legalizing growing and personal consumption of cannabis , as well as a government regulation of the drug .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medicinal marijuana rules could change soon the social democrats ' parliamentary drug expert , angelika graf , considers legalizing cannabis the wrong signal to send .
she points out the difficult fight against two other legal drugs , alcohol and tobacco .
" i do n't think we 're doing ourselves any favors when we try and reign in use of legal drugs on the one hand and legalize a new drug on the other , " she said .
" that does n't work . "
no one seriously thinks that germany 's current government coalition of christian democrats and free democrats will loosen the country 's cannabis laws .
but , the coalition did recently agree that doctors in germany will soon be able to prescribe pain medication containing cannabis to seriously sick patients , without applying for special approval every time .

" today , you stand on the dike and you realize that it has become a quiet , peaceful place - there 's no more bird hunting , no low-flying planes , and military maneuvers are history .
visitors , and also the inhabitants , can enjoy the blooming salt marshes , " hansen said . locals now overwhelmingly support the national park , and while jens enemark says conservation authorities continue to have different priorities to fishermen and others who depend upon the region for their livelihood , relations are far more cordial than they were two decades ago . indeed , the thriving environment has proved a boon for another industry . " more than two million guests a year spend vacation on the north sea coast of schleswig holstein , " said konstanze hoefling-hoff of the north sea tourism service . " we know from polls and headcounts that more than a million of them stop at the visitors- stations of the national parks , " with popular activities including " guided hikes on the mud flats and other excursions . " to prevent the region from being loved-to-death by over-eager visitors , the wadden sea has a unique partnership program , which ties together the national park service , volunteers , and conservation groups . the german branch of the world wildlife fund fro nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- praises the partnership . it says nature has been able to recuperate , as a result , and that at least in the tidal mud flats , species have ceased to die out . the north sea is also cleaner , and the animals in the mud flats are less frightened than they once were , according to hans-ulrich roesner , a spokesman for the wwf in husum , in northern germany . oil on the horizon ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservation stations have done their job well yet the wwf also says causes for concern remain . " the biggest blot on the national park is the oil exploration which is still taking place in the mittelplate oil field , in the southern part of the region , " roesner said , claiming that this disrupts wild geese in their molting areas , and can leave them unable to fly in summer . unsustainable levels of commercial fishing are an ongoing problem too , from wwf 's perspective , and on this score " something needs to change soon , " roesner says . within germany 's borders , financial considerations also loom . there is n't enough money to go round for rangers , and changes to germany 's system of compulsory military service , mean that there is likely to be a knock on effect for social work , as fewer young men opt for this alternative service – a useful source of labor for everything from medical care to nature conservation . despite these challenges , the wadden sea serves as a useful case-study for others seeking to strike a deal to save nature . author : werner junge , jennifer abramsohn editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the website revealed some 400,000 confidential documents on the iraq war . british deputy prime minister nick clegg called sunday for an investigation into allegations against the british military found in iraq war documents leaked by whistle-blowing wikileaks .
the website on friday published some 400,000 confidential documents on the war in iraq , which suggest negligence on the part of uk military in several cases of civilian death and torture .
" we can bemoan how these leaks occurred , but i think the nature of the allegations made are extraordinarily serious .
they are distressing to read about and they are very serious , " clegg told the bbc in an interview .
condemning wikileaks the comments came after britain 's ministry of defense joined the pentagon in condemning the release of the classified documents , saying they could put the lives of british soldiers at risk .
wikileaks ' publication of the documents will make the job of british and allied troops " more difficult and more dangerous , " the ministry said saturday .
the documents , which wikileaks founder julian assange said reveal 15,000 more civilian deaths than were previously known about , will put britain in a difficult legal position , according to a solicitor working on behalf of iraqis who claim abuse by british forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy pm clegg called for an investigation phil shiner , of public interest lawyers , said there was a " huge and growing body of evidence about the killing , ill treatment and torture of iraqis while in uk custody . "
" some of these deaths will be in circumstances where the uk -lsb- has -rsb- a clear legal responsibility , " he added .
despite condemning publication of the leaked files , the ministry of defense said in a statement that it would " consider " the information if it revealed any new evidence .
denmark vows to scour documents meanwhile , denmark 's military announced sunday it would carefully study the leaked documents to see if they revealed any wrongdoing by danish soldiers . " we want to see the documents for ourselves and compare them to our own information , " said danish defense command spokesman torben kjedsen . danish defense minister gitte lillelund bech said she was pleased with the decision , although danish media report the files reveal negligence on the part of danish soldiers in cases where prisoners were tortured by iraqi police .
us and uk ' turned a blind eye ' british newspaper the guardian , which had the documents in advance of their publication , said the leaks showed " us authorities failed to investigate hundreds of reports of abuse , torture , rape and even murder by iraqi police and soldiers whose conduct appears to be systematic and normally unpunished . " " us and uk officials have insisted that no official record of civilian casualties exists but the logs record 66,081 non-combatant deaths out of a total of 109,000 fatalities , " the newspaper stated . the guardian speculated that wikileaks had received the material from the " same dissident us army intelligence analyst " who leaked material on afghanistan , which the site published in july .
wikileaks , however , has not revealed its source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange said the documents revealed war crimes wikileaks founder defends the release julian assange defended his site 's release of confidential documents against condemnation from us and uk authorities , saying " this disclosure is about the truth . "
" the first casualty of war is the truth .
we hope to correct some of that attack on the truth that occurred before the war , during the war , and which has continued on since the war officially concluded , " he said .
assange said the documents showed evidence of war crimes .
he also told al jazeera television the documents provided enough material for 40 wrongful killing lawsuits .
" the lessons of iraq can be applied to afghanistan and to other countries western governments may choose to invade , " said assange , who vowed to continue publishing leaked documents .
the death toll in iraq now stands at 150,000 , 80 percent of which were civilians , according to the organization iraq body count , which cooperated in the analysis of the released material .
the civilian deaths revealed by the leaked documents occurred as a result of " small incidents " occurring daily during the conflict , the organization 's head , john sloboda , said .
he added that the vast majority of civilian deaths had been caused by " internal violence " among iraqi factions .

this year is the first time in the award 's ten year history that it has been given to a rock musician .
during the presentation ceremony at the guildhall in kassel , central germany , journalist and publicist matthias matussek praised lindenberg and said his song lyrics proved he had learned much about the german language .
the jury , in naming lindenberg as this year 's winner , concluded that he was the " most influential and successful german rock musician of the last 40 years " and , in that time , had more than proven that music in german could be successful internationally , the rheinische post reported on sunday .
lindenburg , who first entered the business in the late 60s as a drummer and went on to have hits with " sonderzug nach pankow " -lrb- special train to pankow -rrb- , " airport " and " geh nicht weg " -lrb- do n't go away -rrb- , said that the jury 's decision was " cool . "
jacob grimm , after whom the award is named , was one half of germany 's famous grimm brothers , who rose to prominence in the early 1800s for their collection of now world-famous fairytales .
the prize which bears jacob 's name is awarded to someone who works to promote the “ recognition , further development and support of german as a cultural language . ”
for his faithfulness to his mother tongue , lindenberg also receives 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 42,000 -rrb- prize money .

some 200 protestors seized control of the depot at fos-sur-mer , believed to be the largest in southern france , as riot police looked on , according to news agency agence-presse france .
meanwhile , a depot in central france , at saint-pierre-des corps , was freed after a week of paralysis when around 30 demonstrators walked away from the site without incident .
strikes in the country 's oil industry and blockades of fuel depots have left 35 percent of gas stations in the paris area completely dry or out of at least one kind of fuel , a transport ministry spokeswoman said .
about one-third of gas stations in western france were in " real difficulty " and 10 to 15 percent in the rest of the country were empty , she added .
unions have already called for two more days of strikes , and university students are planning nationwide marches on tuesday in last-ditch efforts to stop the pension reform before a reconciliation between the two houses of parliament and a final vote by the national assembly expected wednesday .

but the opposition socialists say if they win presidential elections in 2012 , their candidate will restore the retirement age to 60 .
polls suggest a majority of french voters support or sympathize with the strikers , but jean-francois cope , leader of sarkozy 's ump party in parliament , blamed the widespread disruption on the work of a minority .
" strikes , protests , yes , but taking the economy hostage is intolerable , " he said in an interview with le parisien newspaper .
" most of the country is paralyzed by the actions of a handful of extremists .
everyone should understand that we have no other choice . "
as the unpopular pension reform plan moves closer to becoming law , sarkozy 's approval rating has dropped to an all-time low , dashing hopes that the legislative achievement could bring him a political comeback .
a poll conducted by the ifop institute and published in the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday showed only 29 percent of respondents were satisfied with sarkozy 's job performance .
that was down three points from september , and was a new low for the president since he took office in 2007 .
sarkozy and his allies are hoping that the ongoing protest and strike movement in opposition to the pension reform will die down as families leave their homes for the mid-term school holiday this week .

a rapid border intervention team is expected to be deployed . a rapid intervention team from the eu border agency , frontex , will be deployed for the first time to greece to help shore up the country 's porous border with turkey , the european commission has said in a statement .
the move comes after greece put out an emergency call for the border team , which is to act under greek authority .
eu internal affairs commissioner cecilia malmstroem said she had " immediately activated the mechanism to liaise with frontex and to communicate among all interested partners , so as to handle this emergency situation in the most expeditious and efficient way . "
" the situation at the greek land border with turkey is increasingly worrying , " she said .

an overwhelming majority of the refugees use greece as an entry point to other european union countries , and arrivals by land have increased by more than a third in a year .
last week , turkey pledged to cooperate with greece in a bid to control the flow of irregular immigrants making their way into europe , in exchange for greece 's help in easing visa rules for turks .

instead , the government will be advised to cut desk jobs in the defense ministry . a german government commission is to urge caution on plans to radically reduction the number of service personnel numbers within the country 's armed forces .
findings of the inquiry are instead to recommend a dramatic scaling back of office staff in the defense ministry from 3,090 positions to just 1,600 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg said troop numbers could fall to 164,000 " as i see it , they need half the number of employees as they currently have at most , " frank-juergen weise , who chairs the commission , told the public television broadcaster ard on sunday .
chancellor angela merkel 's government has been investigating ways to save money on the armed forced , with up to 240,000 people currently in uniform .
defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenburg has said that this total could be slashed to 164,000 troops in the future , with an end to the current german policy of military conscription . however , the commission is expected to recommend that the figure be reduced to between 180,000 and 190,000 , with further cuts being deemed impracticable .
savings within ministry savings would instead be made at the ministry , which has its main base in the western city of bonn - where 2,570 people are employed - and a smaller section in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle welcomed the inquiry 's findings the six-strong commission is to hand over its 114-page report to zu guttenberg on tuesday , advising that remaining resources be concentrated in berlin .
they said that the dual location of the ministry meant that it suffered from " fragmentation " and that a move to the capital move would allow more central control .
civic leaders in bonn , the former capital of west germany , have warned that major lay-offs there would lead to protests .
foreign minister guido westerwelle welcomed the report on behalf of his free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- party , junior partners in the ruling coalition , saying that greater efficiency was necessary .
speaking to ard , westerwelle added that the end of conscription to make way for a fully professional army was a " long-standing desire " of the fdp .

at the very latest , since abu ghraib , the international community had come to the realization that the war in iraq was a ‘ dirty war ' .
there were killings .
there was torture .
mercenaries operated as brutal aggressors .
shi 'ites and sunnis took turns massacring each other .
that one of the most barbarous dictators was overthrown in the process has practically been forgotten .

some 200 protestors seized control of the depot at fos-sur-mer , believed to be the largest in southern france , as riot police looked on , according to news agency agence-presse france .
meanwhile , a depot in central france , at saint-pierre-des corps , was freed after a week of paralysis when around 30 demonstrators walked away from the site without incident .
strikes in the country 's oil industry and blockades of fuel depots have left 35 percent of gas stations in the paris area completely dry or out of at least one kind of fuel , a transport ministry spokeswoman said .
about one-third of gas stations in western france were in " real difficulty " and 10 to 15 percent in the rest of the country were empty , she added .
unions have already called for two more days of strikes , and university students are planning nationwide marches on tuesday in last-ditch efforts to stop the pension reform before a reconciliation between the two houses of parliament and a final vote by the national assembly expected wednesday .
sarkozy popularity suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has n't been able to stop protests - or his sinking approval sarkozy 's government insists that the pension reform , which will raise the minimum retirement age to 62 from 60 , is " inevitable " and the only way to fill an expected pension budget gap and reduce the country 's growing deficit .
but the opposition socialists say if they win presidential elections in 2012 , their candidate will restore the retirement age to 60 .
polls suggest a majority of french voters support or sympathize with the strikers , but jean-francois cope , leader of sarkozy 's ump party in parliament , blamed the widespread disruption on the work of a minority .
" strikes , protests , yes , but taking the economy hostage is intolerable , " he said in an interview with le parisien newspaper .
" most of the country is paralyzed by the actions of a handful of extremists .
everyone should understand that we have no other choice . "
as the unpopular pension reform plan moves closer to becoming law , sarkozy 's approval rating has dropped to an all-time low , dashing hopes that the legislative achievement could bring him a political comeback .
a poll conducted by the ifop institute and published in the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday showed only 29 percent of respondents were satisfied with sarkozy 's job performance .
that was down three points from september , and was a new low for the president since he took office in 2007 .
sarkozy and his allies are hoping that the ongoing protest and strike movement in opposition to the pension reform will die down as families leave their homes for the mid-term school holiday this week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 25.10.2010 germany 's almost legal drug : cannabis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis use is n't completely tolerated in germany legalizing cannabis in germany is only a political side issue , but the topic persistently finds its way back into the conversation and the headlines .
as california votes on the issue , dw looks at the german situation . when the left party recently campaigned in state elections in north-rhine westphalia under the slogan " right to smoke , " their idea to legalize cannabis made headlines in germany .
the same principal has been in the green party 's program for 10 years .
and back in the mid-90s , the social democrats ' otto schily suggested making personal cannabis use legal .
but the question did n't come up again when schily later became interior minister .
efforts to decriminalize marijuana use for the estimated two million germans who smoke it , similar to measures in the neighboring netherlands and czech republic , have been gridlocked for some time .
only the greens and the left are still actively throwing themselves into the fray .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : possession laws vary across germany " it 's a so-called ' soft drug , " ' said gregor gysi , the left party 's parliamentary leader .
" that means its effects are no better or worse than those of alcohol , und just because it is associated with another culture , we treat it differently . "
" what we actually need with cannabis is , first of all , strict controls for minors .
but for adults business should be open for two reasons : first , it would reduce crime associated with buying and second it would end the practice of large amounts of money being made through cannabis sales . "
hazy laws currently in germany , smoking marijuana itself is not a crime , but growing , possessing and selling it is .
the federal constitutional court recommends not enforcing a penalty for possession of small amounts of cannabis for personal use , as long as the possessor is not near a school and poses no threat to the public .
but germany 's 16 states do n't have the same laws for what constitutes a " small amount " of cannabis .
in berlin it is up to 15 grams -lrb- half an ounce -rrb- ; in munich it 's six grams .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffeeshops selling cannabis are across the border in the netherlands authorities in the state of bavaria have warned of " increasing ignorance of guilt regarding cannabis consumption " and have started to crack down on smokers , so much that the german hemp association has made calls online for letters of protest .
raphael gassmann , head of the german center for addiction issues , is n't sure that taking a hard line is the best approach .
" anyone who thinks hard cannabis legislation - in germany or internationally - will lead to less consumption is , experience tells us , wrong , " said gassmann .
" in comparative law studies we have n't once seen a serious indication that punishing cannabis consumption drastically raises or significantly lowers the practice . "
gassmann said one result of going after marijuana users is that they become criminalized .
he adds that can have a devastating effect on their lives if they lose their jobs because of the crime , for example .
mixed support in any case , there seems to be conflicting feelings regarding the problem among the german population .
in a survey of the german hemp association conducted this year , just over 50 percent of germans approve of a liberal approach with regard to cannabis consumers .
but only a quarter of those surveyed support legalizing growing and personal consumption of cannabis , as well as a government regulation of the drug .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medicinal marijuana rules could change soon the social democrats ' parliamentary drug expert , angelika graf , considers legalizing cannabis the wrong signal to send .
she points out the difficult fight against two other legal drugs , alcohol and tobacco .
" i do n't think we 're doing ourselves any favors when we try and reign in use of legal drugs on the one hand and legalize a new drug on the other , " she said .
" that does n't work . "
no one seriously thinks that germany 's current government coalition of christian democrats and free democrats will loosen the country 's cannabis laws .
but , the coalition did recently agree that doctors in germany will soon be able to prescribe pain medication containing cannabis to seriously sick patients , without applying for special approval every time .

as the world struggles with agreements to reverse biodiversity loss , the wadden sea shines as an example of transnational conservation . the wadden sea is one of central europe 's most important nature reserves . the strip of north sea coast is home to the biggest contiguous area of mudflats in the world , and stretches from den helder in the netherlands to esbjerg in denmark via three german states . much of the wadden sea was listed as a unesco world heritage site in 2009 because it serves as a flourishing habitat for some 3,200 species of animals , provides an important way-station for migratory birds , supports a wide variety of plants among its salt marshes and has played a crucial role in restoring seal populations over the past two decades . today the wadden sea is seen as a model for promoting cross-border conservation , but the road to success was not straight forward . road to riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal populations are recovering thanks to a nurturing environment the wadden sea national park is really three parks divided between the german states of schleswig holstein , lower saxony and the city-state of hamburg . the oldest is the park established in germany 's northernmost state , schleswig-holstein , in 1985 . it was prompted by a dawning awareness that piecemeal legislation was proving inadequate at dealing with the growing impacts of industrial and agricultural waste , development and commercial expoitation on the region . at first , proposals for a park met with stiff resistance from locals , who feared for their hunting and fishing rights , resented impositions on their freedom to use the area and worried about an influx of tourists . yet through a mixture of compromise and consensus-building , the state 's then premier , uwe barschel , managed to build enough support to pass legislation . " it sounds crude , but we were just trying to get people on board , " recalls detlef hansen , the head of the national park . " we formed working groups with fishermen , with shepherds , with hunters , and let them have a say in the decision making . " in the end , it was conservationists who felt they were getting the short end of the stick and initially dismissed barschel 's plan as a sham . yet over the years , protection was extended : in 1990 a deal was struck to protect seal populations in the wadden sea – the first accord signed under the bonn convention on migratory species . today , that accord between germany , the netherlands and denmark is held up as a model for multilateral species protection programs . success has boiled down to " defining common objectives " and " working together " with all stakeholders , said jens enemark , secretary of the common wadden sea secretariat - the international organization tasked with facilitating cooperation in the wadden sea . this has meant identifying and mitigating the main human threats to the region , namely pollution , disturbance and habitat destruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the tide is out , visitors enjoy walking on the sea bed local dividends and it 's not just seals that have reaped the rewards , says detlef hansen . " today , you stand on the dike and you realize that it has become a quiet , peaceful place - there 's no more bird hunting , no low-flying planes , and military maneuvers are history .
visitors , and also the inhabitants , can enjoy the blooming salt marshes , " hansen said . locals now overwhelmingly support the national park , and while jens enemark says conservation authorities continue to have different priorities to fishermen and others who depend upon the region for their livelihood , relations are far more cordial than they were two decades ago . indeed , the thriving environment has proved a boon for another industry . " more than two million guests a year spend vacation on the north sea coast of schleswig holstein , " said konstanze hoefling-hoff of the north sea tourism service . " we know from polls and headcounts that more than a million of them stop at the visitors- stations of the national parks , " with popular activities including " guided hikes on the mud flats and other excursions . " to prevent the region from being loved-to-death by over-eager visitors , the wadden sea has a unique partnership program , which ties together the national park service , volunteers , and conservation groups . the german branch of the world wildlife fund fro nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- praises the partnership . it says nature has been able to recuperate , as a result , and that at least in the tidal mud flats , species have ceased to die out . the north sea is also cleaner , and the animals in the mud flats are less frightened than they once were , according to hans-ulrich roesner , a spokesman for the wwf in husum , in northern germany . oil on the horizon ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservation stations have done their job well yet the wwf also says causes for concern remain . " the biggest blot on the national park is the oil exploration which is still taking place in the mittelplate oil field , in the southern part of the region , " roesner said , claiming that this disrupts wild geese in their molting areas , and can leave them unable to fly in summer . unsustainable levels of commercial fishing are an ongoing problem too , from wwf 's perspective , and on this score " something needs to change soon , " roesner says . within germany 's borders , financial considerations also loom . there is n't enough money to go round for rangers , and changes to germany 's system of compulsory military service , mean that there is likely to be a knock on effect for social work , as fewer young men opt for this alternative service – a useful source of labor for everything from medical care to nature conservation . despite these challenges , the wadden sea serves as a useful case-study for others seeking to strike a deal to save nature . author : werner junge , jennifer abramsohn editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's clear from those inspections that while most of the data is fragmentary , in some instances entire emails and urls were captured , as well as passwords , " wrote alan eustace , google 's senior vice president of engineering and research , in a post published late friday on google 's public policy blog . this is the first time that google has revealed the full extent of the privacy breach , which it had previously blamed on a coding error . the company said it plans delete the data " as soon as possible " and wants to make improvements to its policies . this follows a previous announcement in may , prompted by investigations by german privacy officials , that the company had mistakenly collected unencrypted wifi payload data -lrb- information sent over networks -rrb- using its street view cars . the cars are used for google 's mapping service and take panoramic photos of streets in various countries around the world . situation merits further examination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google plans to add germany 's 20 largest cities to street view by the end of 2010 the latest revelations failed to surprise johannes caspar , hamburg 's commissioner for data protection and freedom of information , and the leading authority in the german google investigation . " this just confirms what we expected , " he told deutsche welle .
" it could already have been predicted a few months ago . " according to caspar , germany will continue with its enquiry as planned , aiming for an independent assessment before " we think about taking further action . "
following the may privacy invasion scandal , hard drives of computers involved are being inspected .
should google 's statement be proven true , caspar says the company may be fined . according to ulrich boerger , a hamburg-based privacy lawyer , evidence of password and email leaks would add another dimension to the privacy debate in germany , but " it 's difficult to talk about any concrete consequences at this stage . " similar reaction in the uk google 's latest revelations have also not altered the general course of action for uk authorities , despite having cleared google of the charge of having collected " meaningful personal details " earlier this year . " we will be making enquires to see whether this information relates to the data inadvertently captured in the uk , before deciding on the necessary course of action , including a consideration of the need to use our enforcement powers , " wrote the information commissioner 's office , great britain 's data protection agency , in a statement published on its website . google has previously said it did not realize that kismet , a free software program it uses to detect wireless networks , was also recording snippets of emails and web pages .

the same principal has been in the green party 's program for 10 years .
and back in the mid-90s , the social democrats ' otto schily suggested making personal cannabis use legal .
but the question did n't come up again when schily later became interior minister .
efforts to decriminalize marijuana use for the estimated two million germans who smoke it , similar to measures in the neighboring netherlands and czech republic , have been gridlocked for some time .
only the greens and the left are still actively throwing themselves into the fray .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : possession laws vary across germany " it 's a so-called ' soft drug , " ' said gregor gysi , the left party 's parliamentary leader .
" that means its effects are no better or worse than those of alcohol , und just because it is associated with another culture , we treat it differently . "

the federal constitutional court recommends not enforcing a penalty for possession of small amounts of cannabis for personal use , as long as the possessor is not near a school and poses no threat to the public .

raphael gassmann , head of the german center for addiction issues , is n't sure that taking a hard line is the best approach .
" anyone who thinks hard cannabis legislation - in germany or internationally - will lead to less consumption is , experience tells us , wrong , " said gassmann .
" in comparative law studies we have n't once seen a serious indication that punishing cannabis consumption drastically raises or significantly lowers the practice . "
gassmann said one result of going after marijuana users is that they become criminalized .
he adds that can have a devastating effect on their lives if they lose their jobs because of the crime , for example .
mixed support in any case , there seems to be conflicting feelings regarding the problem among the german population .
in a survey of the german hemp association conducted this year , just over 50 percent of germans approve of a liberal approach with regard to cannabis consumers .
but only a quarter of those surveyed support legalizing growing and personal consumption of cannabis , as well as a government regulation of the drug .

as the world struggles with agreements to reverse biodiversity loss , the wadden sea shines as an example of transnational conservation . the wadden sea is one of central europe 's most important nature reserves . the strip of north sea coast is home to the biggest contiguous area of mudflats in the world , and stretches from den helder in the netherlands to esbjerg in denmark via three german states . much of the wadden sea was listed as a unesco world heritage site in 2009 because it serves as a flourishing habitat for some 3,200 species of animals , provides an important way-station for migratory birds , supports a wide variety of plants among its salt marshes and has played a crucial role in restoring seal populations over the past two decades . today the wadden sea is seen as a model for promoting cross-border conservation , but the road to success was not straight forward . road to riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal populations are recovering thanks to a nurturing environment the wadden sea national park is really three parks divided between the german states of schleswig holstein , lower saxony and the city-state of hamburg . the oldest is the park established in germany 's northernmost state , schleswig-holstein , in 1985 . it was prompted by a dawning awareness that piecemeal legislation was proving inadequate at dealing with the growing impacts of industrial and agricultural waste , development and commercial expoitation on the region . at first , proposals for a park met with stiff resistance from locals , who feared for their hunting and fishing rights , resented impositions on their freedom to use the area and worried about an influx of tourists . yet through a mixture of compromise and consensus-building , the state 's then premier , uwe barschel , managed to build enough support to pass legislation . " it sounds crude , but we were just trying to get people on board , " recalls detlef hansen , the head of the national park . " we formed working groups with fishermen , with shepherds , with hunters , and let them have a say in the decision making . " in the end , it was conservationists who felt they were getting the short end of the stick and initially dismissed barschel 's plan as a sham . yet over the years , protection was extended : in 1990 a deal was struck to protect seal populations in the wadden sea – the first accord signed under the bonn convention on migratory species . today , that accord between germany , the netherlands and denmark is held up as a model for multilateral species protection programs . success has boiled down to " defining common objectives " and " working together " with all stakeholders , said jens enemark , secretary of the common wadden sea secretariat - the international organization tasked with facilitating cooperation in the wadden sea . this has meant identifying and mitigating the main human threats to the region , namely pollution , disturbance and habitat destruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the tide is out , visitors enjoy walking on the sea bed local dividends and it 's not just seals that have reaped the rewards , says detlef hansen . " today , you stand on the dike and you realize that it has become a quiet , peaceful place - there 's no more bird hunting , no low-flying planes , and military maneuvers are history .
visitors , and also the inhabitants , can enjoy the blooming salt marshes , " hansen said . locals now overwhelmingly support the national park , and while jens enemark says conservation authorities continue to have different priorities to fishermen and others who depend upon the region for their livelihood , relations are far more cordial than they were two decades ago . indeed , the thriving environment has proved a boon for another industry . " more than two million guests a year spend vacation on the north sea coast of schleswig holstein , " said konstanze hoefling-hoff of the north sea tourism service . " we know from polls and headcounts that more than a million of them stop at the visitors- stations of the national parks , " with popular activities including " guided hikes on the mud flats and other excursions . " to prevent the region from being loved-to-death by over-eager visitors , the wadden sea has a unique partnership program , which ties together the national park service , volunteers , and conservation groups . the german branch of the world wildlife fund fro nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- praises the partnership . it says nature has been able to recuperate , as a result , and that at least in the tidal mud flats , species have ceased to die out . the north sea is also cleaner , and the animals in the mud flats are less frightened than they once were , according to hans-ulrich roesner , a spokesman for the wwf in husum , in northern germany . oil on the horizon ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservation stations have done their job well yet the wwf also says causes for concern remain . " the biggest blot on the national park is the oil exploration which is still taking place in the mittelplate oil field , in the southern part of the region , " roesner said , claiming that this disrupts wild geese in their molting areas , and can leave them unable to fly in summer . unsustainable levels of commercial fishing are an ongoing problem too , from wwf 's perspective , and on this score " something needs to change soon , " roesner says . within germany 's borders , financial considerations also loom . there is n't enough money to go round for rangers , and changes to germany 's system of compulsory military service , mean that there is likely to be a knock on effect for social work , as fewer young men opt for this alternative service – a useful source of labor for everything from medical care to nature conservation . despite these challenges , the wadden sea serves as a useful case-study for others seeking to strike a deal to save nature . author : werner junge , jennifer abramsohn editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de taxes -pipe- 25.10.2010 smokers to cough up more for cigarettes as industry gets tax break großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers would be made to fork out more for cigarettes the german government says it wants to cancel plans to make heavy industry pay more for polluting .
instead it will hike the price of cigarettes through a new tobacco tax . the german government says it favors raising the price of cigarettes through a new tobacco tax rather than taxing heavy industry as originally envisaged in the government 's economic austerity program .
following a meeting at the chancellery on sunday , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and economics minister rainer bruederle said the move would see the financial burden on energy-intensive industries eased by nullifying previous plans to slash a rebate such companies were entitled to on a so-called " eco-tax . "
the measure is expected to spare heavy industry from having to fork out around 600 million euros -lrb- $ 841 million -rrb- each year for the eco-tax .
the ministers stressed , however , that the replacement tobacco tax was not yet set in stone and was still only a proposal .
they said it would be put to parliamentary groups for discussion on monday .
news agency reuters reported that any such tax would seek to bring in around 200 million euros in additional revenue for 2011 , with this figure rising to 800 million euros by 2014 .
industry lobby victory ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy industry will view the tax reversal as a success birgit homburger , leader of the parliamentary group of junior coalition partners the free democrats , said easing the eco-tax burden would help secure jobs and aid germany in maintaining its reputation as an attractive location for energy-intensive industries .
however , the move is likely to anger green and leftist groups .
the left party has already voiced opposition to easing the tax burden on industry .
the decision by the german government serves the " lobbying interests of the corporations " and places the costs of the financial crisis on those who are not responsible for it , said left party taxation spokeswoman barbara hoell on monday .
industry groups had heaped pressure on the government over the eco-tax , arguing that slashing eco-tax rebates could endanger up to 870,000 jobs and complicate operations for medium-size businesses .
hans-peter keitel , president of the federation of german industries , said that reducing the rebate would threaten stability in the country 's entire industrial sector .
also to come from the meeting at the chancellery was confirmation of a plan to simplify german taxes from 2012 .
the scheme would save german taxpayers around 500 million euros , ministers said , and could be partially retroactive for 2011 .
it would also mean tax returns would only have to be filed every two years .

but no such luck .
economics minister rainer bruederle said that although he would like to see the company 's headquarters remain on german turf , he was not willing to intervene in the market process .
and chancellor angela merkel agreed on both counts .
that was the end of that , but not the end of the story .
on sunday , germany 's weekly news magazine der spiegel reported that hochtief is now in talks with qatar , thanks , no less , to mrs merkel .
a spokeswoman for the coveted construction company told reporters that during an industry leaders dinner at berlin 's presidential palace , the german chancellor had taken the opportunity to introduce hochtief chief executive herbert luetkestratkoetter to the qatari economics minister .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel does not want to see hochtief split up should qatar decide to get on board with its sovereign wealth fund , it would be as a ' white-knight ' investor , a role it has played in the past for the volkswagen group .
australian assistance but hochtief is not leaving its fate solely in the lap of the middle east .
the company is also looking to australia , home of its hugely successful subsidiary leighton holdings , to bolster its defenses .
last week , the german company applied to the australian takeovers panel to try and force acs to make a fully priced bid for outstanding shares in leighton , which contributes some 80 percent of hochtief 's total earnings and is therefore particularly attractive to the heavily indebted spanish bidder .
on monday , leighton upped the pressure by making its own application to the panel to block the all-share bid on the grounds that it would rob the company of its independence .
" although hochtief owns 54.5 percent of leighton , leighton is not in the normal position of a controlled ' downstream ' entity , " leighton chairman david mortimer said in a statement .
under the current governance arrangements between the german company and its australian subsidiary , leighton has an independent board and management .
protecting minority shareholders furthermore mortimer said that to allow a takeover by acs - which currently holds a 29 percent stake in hochtief - without a commitment to retain leighton 's independence status or any obligation to make a cash bid for the subsidiary would not be in the interests of shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is looking to australian regulators for support " leighton 's independent directors are concerned that german takeover law does not provide the same level of protection for the interests of minority shareholders that investors expect of companies listed on the australian securities exchange , " he said .
the australian takeovers panel has three weeks to decide whether the spanish bid for hochtief is in actual fact a bid for leighton , and whether minority shareholders would be disadvantaged a successful takeover .
if the regulators find in favor of leighton , it could double the money acs would need to buy a controlling stake in the german company .

" it 's clear from those inspections that while most of the data is fragmentary , in some instances entire emails and urls were captured , as well as passwords , " wrote alan eustace , google 's senior vice president of engineering and research , in a post published late friday on google 's public policy blog . this is the first time that google has revealed the full extent of the privacy breach , which it had previously blamed on a coding error . the company said it plans delete the data " as soon as possible " and wants to make improvements to its policies . this follows a previous announcement in may , prompted by investigations by german privacy officials , that the company had mistakenly collected unencrypted wifi payload data -lrb- information sent over networks -rrb- using its street view cars . the cars are used for google 's mapping service and take panoramic photos of streets in various countries around the world . situation merits further examination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google plans to add germany 's 20 largest cities to street view by the end of 2010 the latest revelations failed to surprise johannes caspar , hamburg 's commissioner for data protection and freedom of information , and the leading authority in the german google investigation .

" it could already have been predicted a few months ago . " according to caspar , germany will continue with its enquiry as planned , aiming for an independent assessment before " we think about taking further action . "
following the may privacy invasion scandal , hard drives of computers involved are being inspected .
should google 's statement be proven true , caspar says the company may be fined . according to ulrich boerger , a hamburg-based privacy lawyer , evidence of password and email leaks would add another dimension to the privacy debate in germany , but " it 's difficult to talk about any concrete consequences at this stage . " similar reaction in the uk google 's latest revelations have also not altered the general course of action for uk authorities , despite having cleared google of the charge of having collected " meaningful personal details " earlier this year . " we will be making enquires to see whether this information relates to the data inadvertently captured in the uk , before deciding on the necessary course of action , including a consideration of the need to use our enforcement powers , " wrote the information commissioner 's office , great britain 's data protection agency , in a statement published on its website . google has previously said it did not realize that kismet , a free software program it uses to detect wireless networks , was also recording snippets of emails and web pages .

many shipping lines are turning to private security firms for protection . when it comes to global shipping , there is no avoiding the gulf of aden , which leads between the failed state of somalia and yemen - a nation security analysts describe as at-risk .
these waters carry a significant share of the world 's wealth , including 11 percent of the world 's seaborne oil .
the 25,000 cargo ships that pass through the gulf of aden every year are tempting targets for heavily armed groups in somalia , who claim overfishing by foreign vessels has robbed them of their livelihoods . earlier this year the international maritime bureau warned that attacks on merchant shipping are on the rise .
european defense officials say somali pirates are currently holding 20 ships and more than 400 crew for ransom off the horn of africa .
more attacks , more attention with media attention snowballing and insurance premiums sky-rocketing , more and more shipping companies are turning to private security firms for protection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some companies believe there is little political will to deal with piracy one of them is international bodyguard and security agency -lrb- ibs -rrb- - a company founded by horst ruetten , formally of the german navy .
from his office in the port city of hamburg , ruetten delivers an impressive sales pitch : " we offer everything from risk assessment for ships through to advice about equipment – razor-wire and bullet-proof blankets , everything that can help protect the crew - all the way to training . "
ruetten also sends out teams of between five and seven men to guard the ships personally .
they are armed with what he describes as " lethal " and / or " non-lethal " weapons , depending on the shipping company 's wishes .
these teams cost several thousand euros a day .
operation atalanta there is of course a state military presence off the coast of somalia – operation atalanta , the official eu naval mission that occasionally makes the news when it storms hijacked ships and arrests pirates .
but juergen strohsal , of the hamburg-based cargo brokering company teutonia , says that the political will behind this intervention is too weak .
" there is support , but not sufficient , " he told deutsche welle .
" there are no results .
if they get some of the pirates , no-one really punishes them , and they come back in force .
i think the politicians have to do more about this , especially in our country . "
horst ruetten agrees , and points out something seldom mentioned in media reports about captured pirates : atalanta 's official mission is to protect world food program ships carrying aid to africa .
it is not meant to be a nautical police force for the gulf of aden , and generally intervenes only once a hijacking has taken place .
this has undoubtedly had a preventative effect , but prevention is not its purpose .
" in the anti-piracy conferences that happen every now and then , a lot of atalanta spokesmen have told shipping companies ' you have to do something about it .
we ca n't be everywhere at once , " ' ruetten says .
" so the shipping companies have to ask themselves what they can do .
that does n't happen enough . "
bildunterschrift : operation atalanta 's mission is to protect food shipments to somalia all mannequins on deck !
a recent survey of 110 german shipping companies by pwc -lrb- formerly pricewaterhouse coopers -rrb- found that 12 used private security agencies in some capacity .
ruetten believes this is not nearly enough , and that too many companies rely on improvised defense measures like strapping mannequins to strategic positions on deck to make a ship look like it is being guarded .
but the official line in the shipping industry is very cautious .
max johns , spokesman for the association of german ship-owners -lrb- vdr -rrb- , says that shipping companies are advised not introduce armed escorts on to their ships .
" by the law of the sea , only military personnel should act against pirates .
that is the first point , " johns says . " secondly we do n't know these private security teams .
we do n't know how good they are , and we do n't who to trust and who not to trust .
they might have a fire-fight with the pirates - our crews are not trained to act in a military or semi-military conflict . "
the fear is that if a security guard killed an innocent somali fisherman , it would cause a damaging legal headache for the shipping industry .
johns also questions how effective mercenaries really are when push comes to shove .
" they have n't proven successful , " he says .
" there were quite a few of those teams on board ships , and we had some incidents when those ships were boarded by pirates , and those people did n't help at all . " " " they did n't make any difference .
they even jumped overboard , because they did n't want to get caught by pirates , and they were picked up then later out of the water by the navy . "
johns is optimistic that vulnerable merchant vessels will soon have eu military personnel on board , but until then ruetten and his team of professionals will continue making profits by running the gauntlet in the gulf of aden .

we ca n't be everywhere at once , " ' ruetten says .
" so the shipping companies have to ask themselves what they can do .
that does n't happen enough . "
bildunterschrift : operation atalanta 's mission is to protect food shipments to somalia all mannequins on deck !
a recent survey of 110 german shipping companies by pwc -lrb- formerly pricewaterhouse coopers -rrb- found that 12 used private security agencies in some capacity .
ruetten believes this is not nearly enough , and that too many companies rely on improvised defense measures like strapping mannequins to strategic positions on deck to make a ship look like it is being guarded .
but the official line in the shipping industry is very cautious .
max johns , spokesman for the association of german ship-owners -lrb- vdr -rrb- , says that shipping companies are advised not introduce armed escorts on to their ships .
" by the law of the sea , only military personnel should act against pirates .
that is the first point , " johns says . " secondly we do n't know these private security teams .
we do n't know how good they are , and we do n't who to trust and who not to trust .
they might have a fire-fight with the pirates - our crews are not trained to act in a military or semi-military conflict . "
the fear is that if a security guard killed an innocent somali fisherman , it would cause a damaging legal headache for the shipping industry .
johns also questions how effective mercenaries really are when push comes to shove .
" they have n't proven successful , " he says .
" there were quite a few of those teams on board ships , and we had some incidents when those ships were boarded by pirates , and those people did n't help at all . " " " they did n't make any difference .
they even jumped overboard , because they did n't want to get caught by pirates , and they were picked up then later out of the water by the navy . "
johns is optimistic that vulnerable merchant vessels will soon have eu military personnel on board , but until then ruetten and his team of professionals will continue making profits by running the gauntlet in the gulf of aden .

these waters carry a significant share of the world 's wealth , including 11 percent of the world 's seaborne oil .
the 25,000 cargo ships that pass through the gulf of aden every year are tempting targets for heavily armed groups in somalia , who claim overfishing by foreign vessels has robbed them of their livelihoods . earlier this year the international maritime bureau warned that attacks on merchant shipping are on the rise .
european defense officials say somali pirates are currently holding 20 ships and more than 400 crew for ransom off the horn of africa .

from his office in the port city of hamburg , ruetten delivers an impressive sales pitch : " we offer everything from risk assessment for ships through to advice about equipment – razor-wire and bullet-proof blankets , everything that can help protect the crew - all the way to training . "

" there are no results .
if they get some of the pirates , no-one really punishes them , and they come back in force .
i think the politicians have to do more about this , especially in our country . "
horst ruetten agrees , and points out something seldom mentioned in media reports about captured pirates : atalanta 's official mission is to protect world food program ships carrying aid to africa .
it is not meant to be a nautical police force for the gulf of aden , and generally intervenes only once a hijacking has taken place .
this has undoubtedly had a preventative effect , but prevention is not its purpose .
" in the anti-piracy conferences that happen every now and then , a lot of atalanta spokesmen have told shipping companies ' you have to do something about it .

" so the shipping companies have to ask themselves what they can do .

bildunterschrift : operation atalanta 's mission is to protect food shipments to somalia all mannequins on deck !
a recent survey of 110 german shipping companies by pwc -lrb- formerly pricewaterhouse coopers -rrb- found that 12 used private security agencies in some capacity .
ruetten believes this is not nearly enough , and that too many companies rely on improvised defense measures like strapping mannequins to strategic positions on deck to make a ship look like it is being guarded .
but the official line in the shipping industry is very cautious .
max johns , spokesman for the association of german ship-owners -lrb- vdr -rrb- , says that shipping companies are advised not introduce armed escorts on to their ships .
" by the law of the sea , only military personnel should act against pirates .
that is the first point , " johns says . " secondly we do n't know these private security teams .
we do n't know how good they are , and we do n't who to trust and who not to trust .
they might have a fire-fight with the pirates - our crews are not trained to act in a military or semi-military conflict . "
the fear is that if a security guard killed an innocent somali fisherman , it would cause a damaging legal headache for the shipping industry .
johns also questions how effective mercenaries really are when push comes to shove .
" they have n't proven successful , " he says .
" there were quite a few of those teams on board ships , and we had some incidents when those ships were boarded by pirates , and those people did n't help at all . " " " they did n't make any difference .
they even jumped overboard , because they did n't want to get caught by pirates , and they were picked up then later out of the water by the navy . "
johns is optimistic that vulnerable merchant vessels will soon have eu military personnel on board , but until then ruetten and his team of professionals will continue making profits by running the gauntlet in the gulf of aden .

the 25,000 cargo ships that pass through the gulf of aden every year are tempting targets for heavily armed groups in somalia , who claim overfishing by foreign vessels has robbed them of their livelihoods . earlier this year the international maritime bureau warned that attacks on merchant shipping are on the rise .
european defense officials say somali pirates are currently holding 20 ships and more than 400 crew for ransom off the horn of africa .

ruetten also sends out teams of between five and seven men to guard the ships personally .

horst ruetten agrees , and points out something seldom mentioned in media reports about captured pirates : atalanta 's official mission is to protect world food program ships carrying aid to africa .
it is not meant to be a nautical police force for the gulf of aden , and generally intervenes only once a hijacking has taken place .
this has undoubtedly had a preventative effect , but prevention is not its purpose .
" in the anti-piracy conferences that happen every now and then , a lot of atalanta spokesmen have told shipping companies ' you have to do something about it .

a recent survey of 110 german shipping companies by pwc -lrb- formerly pricewaterhouse coopers -rrb- found that 12 used private security agencies in some capacity .
ruetten believes this is not nearly enough , and that too many companies rely on improvised defense measures like strapping mannequins to strategic positions on deck to make a ship look like it is being guarded .

max johns , spokesman for the association of german ship-owners -lrb- vdr -rrb- , says that shipping companies are advised not introduce armed escorts on to their ships .

the fear is that if a security guard killed an innocent somali fisherman , it would cause a damaging legal headache for the shipping industry .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some companies believe there is little political will to deal with piracy one of them is international bodyguard and security agency -lrb- ibs -rrb- - a company founded by horst ruetten , formally of the german navy .
from his office in the port city of hamburg , ruetten delivers an impressive sales pitch : " we offer everything from risk assessment for ships through to advice about equipment – razor-wire and bullet-proof blankets , everything that can help protect the crew - all the way to training . "
ruetten also sends out teams of between five and seven men to guard the ships personally .
they are armed with what he describes as " lethal " and / or " non-lethal " weapons , depending on the shipping company 's wishes .
these teams cost several thousand euros a day .
operation atalanta there is of course a state military presence off the coast of somalia – operation atalanta , the official eu naval mission that occasionally makes the news when it storms hijacked ships and arrests pirates .
but juergen strohsal , of the hamburg-based cargo brokering company teutonia , says that the political will behind this intervention is too weak .
" there is support , but not sufficient , " he told deutsche welle .
" there are no results .
if they get some of the pirates , no-one really punishes them , and they come back in force .
i think the politicians have to do more about this , especially in our country . "
horst ruetten agrees , and points out something seldom mentioned in media reports about captured pirates : atalanta 's official mission is to protect world food program ships carrying aid to africa .
it is not meant to be a nautical police force for the gulf of aden , and generally intervenes only once a hijacking has taken place .
this has undoubtedly had a preventative effect , but prevention is not its purpose .
" in the anti-piracy conferences that happen every now and then , a lot of atalanta spokesmen have told shipping companies ' you have to do something about it .
we ca n't be everywhere at once , " ' ruetten says .
" so the shipping companies have to ask themselves what they can do .
that does n't happen enough . "
bildunterschrift : operation atalanta 's mission is to protect food shipments to somalia all mannequins on deck !
a recent survey of 110 german shipping companies by pwc -lrb- formerly pricewaterhouse coopers -rrb- found that 12 used private security agencies in some capacity .
ruetten believes this is not nearly enough , and that too many companies rely on improvised defense measures like strapping mannequins to strategic positions on deck to make a ship look like it is being guarded .
but the official line in the shipping industry is very cautious .
max johns , spokesman for the association of german ship-owners -lrb- vdr -rrb- , says that shipping companies are advised not introduce armed escorts on to their ships .
" by the law of the sea , only military personnel should act against pirates .
that is the first point , " johns says . " secondly we do n't know these private security teams .
we do n't know how good they are , and we do n't who to trust and who not to trust .
they might have a fire-fight with the pirates - our crews are not trained to act in a military or semi-military conflict . "
the fear is that if a security guard killed an innocent somali fisherman , it would cause a damaging legal headache for the shipping industry .
johns also questions how effective mercenaries really are when push comes to shove .
" they have n't proven successful , " he says .
" there were quite a few of those teams on board ships , and we had some incidents when those ships were boarded by pirates , and those people did n't help at all . " " " they did n't make any difference .
they even jumped overboard , because they did n't want to get caught by pirates , and they were picked up then later out of the water by the navy . "
johns is optimistic that vulnerable merchant vessels will soon have eu military personnel on board , but until then ruetten and his team of professionals will continue making profits by running the gauntlet in the gulf of aden .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 25.10.2010 germany 's almost legal drug : cannabis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis use is n't completely tolerated in germany legalizing cannabis in germany is only a political side issue , but the topic persistently finds its way back into the conversation and the headlines .
as california votes on the issue , dw looks at the german situation . when the left party recently campaigned in state elections in north-rhine westphalia under the slogan " right to smoke , " their idea to legalize cannabis made headlines in germany .
the same principal has been in the green party 's program for 10 years .
and back in the mid-90s , the social democrats ' otto schily suggested making personal cannabis use legal .
but the question did n't come up again when schily later became interior minister .
efforts to decriminalize marijuana use for the estimated two million germans who smoke it , similar to measures in the neighboring netherlands and czech republic , have been gridlocked for some time .
only the greens and the left are still actively throwing themselves into the fray .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : possession laws vary across germany " it 's a so-called ' soft drug , " ' said gregor gysi , the left party 's parliamentary leader .
" that means its effects are no better or worse than those of alcohol , und just because it is associated with another culture , we treat it differently . "
" what we actually need with cannabis is , first of all , strict controls for minors .
but for adults business should be open for two reasons : first , it would reduce crime associated with buying and second it would end the practice of large amounts of money being made through cannabis sales . "
hazy laws currently in germany , smoking marijuana itself is not a crime , but growing , possessing and selling it is .
the federal constitutional court recommends not enforcing a penalty for possession of small amounts of cannabis for personal use , as long as the possessor is not near a school and poses no threat to the public .
but germany 's 16 states do n't have the same laws for what constitutes a " small amount " of cannabis .
in berlin it is up to 15 grams -lrb- half an ounce -rrb- ; in munich it 's six grams .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffeeshops selling cannabis are across the border in the netherlands authorities in the state of bavaria have warned of " increasing ignorance of guilt regarding cannabis consumption " and have started to crack down on smokers , so much that the german hemp association has made calls online for letters of protest .
raphael gassmann , head of the german center for addiction issues , is n't sure that taking a hard line is the best approach .
" anyone who thinks hard cannabis legislation - in germany or internationally - will lead to less consumption is , experience tells us , wrong , " said gassmann .
" in comparative law studies we have n't once seen a serious indication that punishing cannabis consumption drastically raises or significantly lowers the practice . "
gassmann said one result of going after marijuana users is that they become criminalized .
he adds that can have a devastating effect on their lives if they lose their jobs because of the crime , for example .
mixed support in any case , there seems to be conflicting feelings regarding the problem among the german population .
in a survey of the german hemp association conducted this year , just over 50 percent of germans approve of a liberal approach with regard to cannabis consumers .
but only a quarter of those surveyed support legalizing growing and personal consumption of cannabis , as well as a government regulation of the drug .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medicinal marijuana rules could change soon the social democrats ' parliamentary drug expert , angelika graf , considers legalizing cannabis the wrong signal to send .
she points out the difficult fight against two other legal drugs , alcohol and tobacco .
" i do n't think we 're doing ourselves any favors when we try and reign in use of legal drugs on the one hand and legalize a new drug on the other , " she said .
" that does n't work . "
no one seriously thinks that germany 's current government coalition of christian democrats and free democrats will loosen the country 's cannabis laws .
but , the coalition did recently agree that doctors in germany will soon be able to prescribe pain medication containing cannabis to seriously sick patients , without applying for special approval every time .

some 200 protestors seized control of the depot at fos-sur-mer , believed to be the largest in southern france , as riot police looked on , according to news agency agence-presse france .
meanwhile , a depot in central france , at saint-pierre-des corps , was freed after a week of paralysis when around 30 demonstrators walked away from the site without incident .
strikes in the country 's oil industry and blockades of fuel depots have left 35 percent of gas stations in the paris area completely dry or out of at least one kind of fuel , a transport ministry spokeswoman said .
about one-third of gas stations in western france were in " real difficulty " and 10 to 15 percent in the rest of the country were empty , she added .
unions have already called for two more days of strikes , and university students are planning nationwide marches on tuesday in last-ditch efforts to stop the pension reform before a reconciliation between the two houses of parliament and a final vote by the national assembly expected wednesday .
sarkozy popularity suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has n't been able to stop protests - or his sinking approval sarkozy 's government insists that the pension reform , which will raise the minimum retirement age to 62 from 60 , is " inevitable " and the only way to fill an expected pension budget gap and reduce the country 's growing deficit .
but the opposition socialists say if they win presidential elections in 2012 , their candidate will restore the retirement age to 60 .
polls suggest a majority of french voters support or sympathize with the strikers , but jean-francois cope , leader of sarkozy 's ump party in parliament , blamed the widespread disruption on the work of a minority .
" strikes , protests , yes , but taking the economy hostage is intolerable , " he said in an interview with le parisien newspaper .
" most of the country is paralyzed by the actions of a handful of extremists .
everyone should understand that we have no other choice . "
as the unpopular pension reform plan moves closer to becoming law , sarkozy 's approval rating has dropped to an all-time low , dashing hopes that the legislative achievement could bring him a political comeback .
a poll conducted by the ifop institute and published in the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday showed only 29 percent of respondents were satisfied with sarkozy 's job performance .
that was down three points from september , and was a new low for the president since he took office in 2007 .
sarkozy and his allies are hoping that the ongoing protest and strike movement in opposition to the pension reform will die down as families leave their homes for the mid-term school holiday this week .

the website revealed some 400,000 confidential documents on the iraq war . british deputy prime minister nick clegg called sunday for an investigation into allegations against the british military found in iraq war documents leaked by whistle-blowing wikileaks .
the website on friday published some 400,000 confidential documents on the war in iraq , which suggest negligence on the part of uk military in several cases of civilian death and torture .
" we can bemoan how these leaks occurred , but i think the nature of the allegations made are extraordinarily serious .
they are distressing to read about and they are very serious , " clegg told the bbc in an interview .
condemning wikileaks the comments came after britain 's ministry of defense joined the pentagon in condemning the release of the classified documents , saying they could put the lives of british soldiers at risk .
wikileaks ' publication of the documents will make the job of british and allied troops " more difficult and more dangerous , " the ministry said saturday .
the documents , which wikileaks founder julian assange said reveal 15,000 more civilian deaths than were previously known about , will put britain in a difficult legal position , according to a solicitor working on behalf of iraqis who claim abuse by british forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy pm clegg called for an investigation phil shiner , of public interest lawyers , said there was a " huge and growing body of evidence about the killing , ill treatment and torture of iraqis while in uk custody . "
" some of these deaths will be in circumstances where the uk -lsb- has -rsb- a clear legal responsibility , " he added .
despite condemning publication of the leaked files , the ministry of defense said in a statement that it would " consider " the information if it revealed any new evidence .

" " us and uk officials have insisted that no official record of civilian casualties exists but the logs record 66,081 non-combatant deaths out of a total of 109,000 fatalities , " the newspaper stated . the guardian speculated that wikileaks had received the material from the " same dissident us army intelligence analyst " who leaked material on afghanistan , which the site published in july .
wikileaks , however , has not revealed its source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange said the documents revealed war crimes wikileaks founder defends the release julian assange defended his site 's release of confidential documents against condemnation from us and uk authorities , saying " this disclosure is about the truth .

" the first casualty of war is the truth .
we hope to correct some of that attack on the truth that occurred before the war , during the war , and which has continued on since the war officially concluded , " he said .
assange said the documents showed evidence of war crimes .
he also told al jazeera television the documents provided enough material for 40 wrongful killing lawsuits .
" the lessons of iraq can be applied to afghanistan and to other countries western governments may choose to invade , " said assange , who vowed to continue publishing leaked documents .
the death toll in iraq now stands at 150,000 , 80 percent of which were civilians , according to the organization iraq body count , which cooperated in the analysis of the released material .
the civilian deaths revealed by the leaked documents occurred as a result of " small incidents " occurring daily during the conflict , the organization 's head , john sloboda , said .
he added that the vast majority of civilian deaths had been caused by " internal violence " among iraqi factions .

" " us and uk officials have insisted that no official record of civilian casualties exists but the logs record 66,081 non-combatant deaths out of a total of 109,000 fatalities , " the newspaper stated . the guardian speculated that wikileaks had received the material from the " same dissident us army intelligence analyst " who leaked material on afghanistan , which the site published in july .
wikileaks , however , has not revealed its source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange said the documents revealed war crimes wikileaks founder defends the release julian assange defended his site 's release of confidential documents against condemnation from us and uk authorities , saying " this disclosure is about the truth . "
" the first casualty of war is the truth .
we hope to correct some of that attack on the truth that occurred before the war , during the war , and which has continued on since the war officially concluded , " he said .
assange said the documents showed evidence of war crimes .
he also told al jazeera television the documents provided enough material for 40 wrongful killing lawsuits .
" the lessons of iraq can be applied to afghanistan and to other countries western governments may choose to invade , " said assange , who vowed to continue publishing leaked documents .
the death toll in iraq now stands at 150,000 , 80 percent of which were civilians , according to the organization iraq body count , which cooperated in the analysis of the released material .
the civilian deaths revealed by the leaked documents occurred as a result of " small incidents " occurring daily during the conflict , the organization 's head , john sloboda , said .
he added that the vast majority of civilian deaths had been caused by " internal violence " among iraqi factions .

some 200 protestors seized control of the depot at fos-sur-mer , believed to be the largest in southern france , as riot police looked on , according to news agency agence-presse france .
meanwhile , a depot in central france , at saint-pierre-des corps , was freed after a week of paralysis when around 30 demonstrators walked away from the site without incident .
strikes in the country 's oil industry and blockades of fuel depots have left 35 percent of gas stations in the paris area completely dry or out of at least one kind of fuel , a transport ministry spokeswoman said .
about one-third of gas stations in western france were in " real difficulty " and 10 to 15 percent in the rest of the country were empty , she added .
unions have already called for two more days of strikes , and university students are planning nationwide marches on tuesday in last-ditch efforts to stop the pension reform before a reconciliation between the two houses of parliament and a final vote by the national assembly expected wednesday .

but the opposition socialists say if they win presidential elections in 2012 , their candidate will restore the retirement age to 60 .
polls suggest a majority of french voters support or sympathize with the strikers , but jean-francois cope , leader of sarkozy 's ump party in parliament , blamed the widespread disruption on the work of a minority .
" strikes , protests , yes , but taking the economy hostage is intolerable , " he said in an interview with le parisien newspaper .
" most of the country is paralyzed by the actions of a handful of extremists .
everyone should understand that we have no other choice . "
as the unpopular pension reform plan moves closer to becoming law , sarkozy 's approval rating has dropped to an all-time low , dashing hopes that the legislative achievement could bring him a political comeback .
a poll conducted by the ifop institute and published in the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday showed only 29 percent of respondents were satisfied with sarkozy 's job performance .
that was down three points from september , and was a new low for the president since he took office in 2007 .
sarkozy and his allies are hoping that the ongoing protest and strike movement in opposition to the pension reform will die down as families leave their homes for the mid-term school holiday this week .

instead , the government will be advised to cut desk jobs in the defense ministry . a german government commission is to urge caution on plans to radically reduction the number of service personnel numbers within the country 's armed forces .
findings of the inquiry are instead to recommend a dramatic scaling back of office staff in the defense ministry from 3,090 positions to just 1,600 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg said troop numbers could fall to 164,000 " as i see it , they need half the number of employees as they currently have at most , " frank-juergen weise , who chairs the commission , told the public television broadcaster ard on sunday .
chancellor angela merkel 's government has been investigating ways to save money on the armed forced , with up to 240,000 people currently in uniform .
defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenburg has said that this total could be slashed to 164,000 troops in the future , with an end to the current german policy of military conscription . however , the commission is expected to recommend that the figure be reduced to between 180,000 and 190,000 , with further cuts being deemed impracticable .
savings within ministry savings would instead be made at the ministry , which has its main base in the western city of bonn - where 2,570 people are employed - and a smaller section in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle welcomed the inquiry 's findings the six-strong commission is to hand over its 114-page report to zu guttenberg on tuesday , advising that remaining resources be concentrated in berlin .
they said that the dual location of the ministry meant that it suffered from " fragmentation " and that a move to the capital move would allow more central control .
civic leaders in bonn , the former capital of west germany , have warned that major lay-offs there would lead to protests .
foreign minister guido westerwelle welcomed the report on behalf of his free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- party , junior partners in the ruling coalition , saying that greater efficiency was necessary .
speaking to ard , westerwelle added that the end of conscription to make way for a fully professional army was a " long-standing desire " of the fdp .

on sunday , the cargo ship became the second vessel with german crew members in two days to be attacked by somali pirates .
the pirates gave up their attack after the crew shut down their boat . a german cargo ship seized by somali pirates off the coast of kenya is now free , according the vessel 's owners .
verena beckhusen , spokeswoman for the bremen-based shipping company beluga-reederei , said the cargo ship beluga fortune was free monday , a day after being taken hostage in the indian ocean , some 1,200 miles -lrb- 1,930 kilometers -rrb- east of mombasa , kenya .
the ship and its crew , including two german citizens , were continuing their planned journey to south africa , beckhusen said .
no crew members were injured , and the ship sustained only minor damage .
pirates had already given up pirates had already left the ship by the time british frigate montrose arrived at the scene monday after steaming 15 hours to beluga fortune 's aid .
all 16 crewmembers were safe , the beluga shipping company told the newspaper weser kurier .
the beluga fortune is now a success story of german shipping companies ' standard procedures of shutting down all power and hiding the crew when a ship is attacked .
the ship 's crew radioed at 7 a.m. on sunday that pirates were attempting to board .
they then immediately stopped the engine , blocked the fuel line and switched off all systems on the bridge - making it impossible for the pirates to move the ship .
" the cool-headed behavior ... of the beluga crew on board and the quick action of navy units ... left the pirates no other option than to give up their dream of a million -lsb- -euro -rsb- ransom and to flee , " beluga shipping said in a statement .
beluga shipping 's executive partner niels stolberg stressed that the crew 's training in handling stressful situations such as pirate takeovers had paid off .
" our precautions and concentrated training of the crew worked out very well , " stolberg said , adding , " our colleagues on board have gotten off lightly from this attack and have escaped with no more than a fright . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greek-owned gas tanker york remains in pirate hands somali pirates a continued threat germany 's foreign office reacted to the news on monday , saying that the fight against somali pirate attacks had to address the " roots of piracy . "
the ministry called for support for the somali interim government to train security forces .
the greek-owned ship york meanwhile remains in the hands of somali pirates .
the flag , captained by a german citizen under a singapore flag , was taken by pirates on saturday off the kenyan coast .
so far this year , pirates have boarded at least 130 ships and fired at over 50 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de taxes -pipe- 25.10.2010 smokers to cough up more for cigarettes as industry gets tax break großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers would be made to fork out more for cigarettes the german government says it wants to cancel plans to make heavy industry pay more for polluting .
instead it will hike the price of cigarettes through a new tobacco tax . the german government says it favors raising the price of cigarettes through a new tobacco tax rather than taxing heavy industry as originally envisaged in the government 's economic austerity program .
following a meeting at the chancellery on sunday , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and economics minister rainer bruederle said the move would see the financial burden on energy-intensive industries eased by nullifying previous plans to slash a rebate such companies were entitled to on a so-called " eco-tax . "
the measure is expected to spare heavy industry from having to fork out around 600 million euros -lrb- $ 841 million -rrb- each year for the eco-tax .
the ministers stressed , however , that the replacement tobacco tax was not yet set in stone and was still only a proposal .
they said it would be put to parliamentary groups for discussion on monday .
news agency reuters reported that any such tax would seek to bring in around 200 million euros in additional revenue for 2011 , with this figure rising to 800 million euros by 2014 .
industry lobby victory ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heavy industry will view the tax reversal as a success birgit homburger , leader of the parliamentary group of junior coalition partners the free democrats , said easing the eco-tax burden would help secure jobs and aid germany in maintaining its reputation as an attractive location for energy-intensive industries .

instead it will hike the price of cigarettes through a new tobacco tax . the german government says it favors raising the price of cigarettes through a new tobacco tax rather than taxing heavy industry as originally envisaged in the government 's economic austerity program .
following a meeting at the chancellery on sunday , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and economics minister rainer bruederle said the move would see the financial burden on energy-intensive industries eased by nullifying previous plans to slash a rebate such companies were entitled to on a so-called " eco-tax . "
the measure is expected to spare heavy industry from having to fork out around 600 million euros -lrb- $ 841 million -rrb- each year for the eco-tax .
the ministers stressed , however , that the replacement tobacco tax was not yet set in stone and was still only a proposal .
they said it would be put to parliamentary groups for discussion on monday .
news agency reuters reported that any such tax would seek to bring in around 200 million euros in additional revenue for 2011 , with this figure rising to 800 million euros by 2014 .

economics minister rainer bruederle said that although he would like to see the company 's headquarters remain on german turf , he was not willing to intervene in the market process .

that was the end of that , but not the end of the story .
on sunday , germany 's weekly news magazine der spiegel reported that hochtief is now in talks with qatar , thanks , no less , to mrs merkel .

last week , the german company applied to the australian takeovers panel to try and force acs to make a fully priced bid for outstanding shares in leighton , which contributes some 80 percent of hochtief 's total earnings and is therefore particularly attractive to the heavily indebted spanish bidder .
on monday , leighton upped the pressure by making its own application to the panel to block the all-share bid on the grounds that it would rob the company of its independence .
" although hochtief owns 54.5 percent of leighton , leighton is not in the normal position of a controlled ' downstream ' entity , " leighton chairman david mortimer said in a statement .
under the current governance arrangements between the german company and its australian subsidiary , leighton has an independent board and management .
protecting minority shareholders furthermore mortimer said that to allow a takeover by acs - which currently holds a 29 percent stake in hochtief - without a commitment to retain leighton 's independence status or any obligation to make a cash bid for the subsidiary would not be in the interests of shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is looking to australian regulators for support " leighton 's independent directors are concerned that german takeover law does not provide the same level of protection for the interests of minority shareholders that investors expect of companies listed on the australian securities exchange , " he said .
the australian takeovers panel has three weeks to decide whether the spanish bid for hochtief is in actual fact a bid for leighton , and whether minority shareholders would be disadvantaged a successful takeover .
if the regulators find in favor of leighton , it could double the money acs would need to buy a controlling stake in the german company .

at the very latest , since abu ghraib , the international community had come to the realization that the war in iraq was a ‘ dirty war ' .
there were killings .
there was torture .
mercenaries operated as brutal aggressors .
shi 'ites and sunnis took turns massacring each other .
that one of the most barbarous dictators was overthrown in the process has practically been forgotten .
instead , the image of a dirty war has now been even more enduringly anchored in our collective consciousness .
thanks to the disclosures made by wikileaks , we have perhaps been given a more accurate insight into the course of events and a more precise figure on the brutal human rights violations and number of deaths .
according to the files , more than 150,000 people were killed in iraq between 2004 and 2009 , if we can believe the documents from us military sources . # b # documents appear to be credible can we believe them ?
yes , we can .
the documents appear , in principle , to be credible .
however , it is important to treat them for what they are : one source among many , and a one-sided one at that , originally intended for internal , domestic consumption .
not everything in these documents can be characterized as a bitter truth intended to be camouflaged from public view .
this or that bit of information could be a half truth or ‘ pseudo-fact ' ; for example , when the person reporting draws the wrong conclusions due to their subjective perspective , or wishes to hide personal lapses or errors from superiors .
few things in life are more regularly “ air brushed ” or openly manipulated than reports to supervising superiors , and this is very probably no different for the us army in iraq .
wikileaks also needs monitoring critical questions , therefore , are certainly permissible : did wikileaks do everything possible when vetting the documents to ensure that no human lives will be put at risk ?
we can only hope and wait .
and , by the way : where are the checks and balances on wikileaks ?
the group is going to have to accept questions like these - just as traditional mass media or outlets like facebook and youtube have done - in view of the fact that its political muscle has grown significantly .
they all shoulder a major responsibility , without ever having been elected .
of course , it also depends on who is asking the question and with what motive .
the criticism of wikileaks , expressed by washington and baghdad , is hypocritical .
both are concerned about their reputations .
us president barack obama only appears to be in a comfortable position .
he can not really sit back and claim that all the missteps and consequences are the fault of his predecessor , george w. bush .
in the selective perceptions of many people – and not just in the arab world – the united states is once again on the pillory .
files dicey for iraqi leader the publication of the documents , however , is just as much of a blow to iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki .
he now stands there in public as a political leader who condones torture , including the abuse of supporters of political and religious groups , whom , for the last seven months , he has been trying to win over as coalition partners in a new government .
not surprisingly , al-maliki suspects intrigue behind the wikileak revelations .
he knows that the publication of new , shocking details could cost him his political career .
in as far as the documents are not proven to be forgeries or seriously flawed – for which there is no evidence at the moment – then the blame for them lies with him and george w. bush – and not with wikileaks .
as with vietnam decades ago , the same holds true for the war in iraq today : dirty details need to be thoroughly evaluated and dirty truths brought to light with no holds barred .
the people of iraq , in particular , deserve nothing less .

instead , the government will be advised to cut desk jobs in the defense ministry . a german government commission is to urge caution on plans to radically reduction the number of service personnel numbers within the country 's armed forces .
findings of the inquiry are instead to recommend a dramatic scaling back of office staff in the defense ministry from 3,090 positions to just 1,600 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg said troop numbers could fall to 164,000 " as i see it , they need half the number of employees as they currently have at most , " frank-juergen weise , who chairs the commission , told the public television broadcaster ard on sunday .
chancellor angela merkel 's government has been investigating ways to save money on the armed forced , with up to 240,000 people currently in uniform .
defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenburg has said that this total could be slashed to 164,000 troops in the future , with an end to the current german policy of military conscription . however , the commission is expected to recommend that the figure be reduced to between 180,000 and 190,000 , with further cuts being deemed impracticable .
savings within ministry savings would instead be made at the ministry , which has its main base in the western city of bonn - where 2,570 people are employed - and a smaller section in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle welcomed the inquiry 's findings the six-strong commission is to hand over its 114-page report to zu guttenberg on tuesday , advising that remaining resources be concentrated in berlin .
they said that the dual location of the ministry meant that it suffered from " fragmentation " and that a move to the capital move would allow more central control .
civic leaders in bonn , the former capital of west germany , have warned that major lay-offs there would lead to protests .
foreign minister guido westerwelle welcomed the report on behalf of his free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- party , junior partners in the ruling coalition , saying that greater efficiency was necessary .
speaking to ard , westerwelle added that the end of conscription to make way for a fully professional army was a " long-standing desire " of the fdp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 25.10.2010 twenty-five-year conservation effort pays off on germany 's north sea coast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many bird species are at home in the protected mud flats and salt marshes germany 's wadden sea national park , along the north sea coast , turned 25 this month .
as the world struggles with agreements to reverse biodiversity loss , the wadden sea shines as an example of transnational conservation . the wadden sea is one of central europe 's most important nature reserves . the strip of north sea coast is home to the biggest contiguous area of mudflats in the world , and stretches from den helder in the netherlands to esbjerg in denmark via three german states . much of the wadden sea was listed as a unesco world heritage site in 2009 because it serves as a flourishing habitat for some 3,200 species of animals , provides an important way-station for migratory birds , supports a wide variety of plants among its salt marshes and has played a crucial role in restoring seal populations over the past two decades . today the wadden sea is seen as a model for promoting cross-border conservation , but the road to success was not straight forward . road to riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal populations are recovering thanks to a nurturing environment the wadden sea national park is really three parks divided between the german states of schleswig holstein , lower saxony and the city-state of hamburg . the oldest is the park established in germany 's northernmost state , schleswig-holstein , in 1985 . it was prompted by a dawning awareness that piecemeal legislation was proving inadequate at dealing with the growing impacts of industrial and agricultural waste , development and commercial expoitation on the region . at first , proposals for a park met with stiff resistance from locals , who feared for their hunting and fishing rights , resented impositions on their freedom to use the area and worried about an influx of tourists . yet through a mixture of compromise and consensus-building , the state 's then premier , uwe barschel , managed to build enough support to pass legislation . " it sounds crude , but we were just trying to get people on board , " recalls detlef hansen , the head of the national park . " we formed working groups with fishermen , with shepherds , with hunters , and let them have a say in the decision making . " in the end , it was conservationists who felt they were getting the short end of the stick and initially dismissed barschel 's plan as a sham . yet over the years , protection was extended : in 1990 a deal was struck to protect seal populations in the wadden sea – the first accord signed under the bonn convention on migratory species . today , that accord between germany , the netherlands and denmark is held up as a model for multilateral species protection programs . success has boiled down to " defining common objectives " and " working together " with all stakeholders , said jens enemark , secretary of the common wadden sea secretariat - the international organization tasked with facilitating cooperation in the wadden sea . this has meant identifying and mitigating the main human threats to the region , namely pollution , disturbance and habitat destruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the tide is out , visitors enjoy walking on the sea bed local dividends and it 's not just seals that have reaped the rewards , says detlef hansen . " today , you stand on the dike and you realize that it has become a quiet , peaceful place - there 's no more bird hunting , no low-flying planes , and military maneuvers are history .
visitors , and also the inhabitants , can enjoy the blooming salt marshes , " hansen said . locals now overwhelmingly support the national park , and while jens enemark says conservation authorities continue to have different priorities to fishermen and others who depend upon the region for their livelihood , relations are far more cordial than they were two decades ago . indeed , the thriving environment has proved a boon for another industry . " more than two million guests a year spend vacation on the north sea coast of schleswig holstein , " said konstanze hoefling-hoff of the north sea tourism service . " we know from polls and headcounts that more than a million of them stop at the visitors- stations of the national parks , " with popular activities including " guided hikes on the mud flats and other excursions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 25.10.2010 two venerable clubs chart divergent courses out of crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer is the new man in the cologne hot seat fc cologne and borussia moenchengladbach are both off to disastrous starts in the bundesliga .
one has panicked and fired its coach , the other plans to stay the course . in the bundesliga , if you go six straight games without a win , or have only one three-pointer to your credit nine games into the season , you are liable to get fired .
like stuttgart 's ex-coach christian gross before him , fc cologne 's zvonimir soldo learned that lesson on sunday .
the billy goats parted ways with their croatian coach of a year-and-a-half at roughly the same time that they landed in last place , courtesy of the former cellar-dwellers stuttgart 's win over st. pauli .
now , news of a last place club sacking its coach rarely comes as a surprise , but when viewed alongside the goings on at another presently hapless club , borussia moenchengladbach , cologne 's move to let soldo go seems rash .
perhaps cologne can learn a lesson from their old rival .
gladbach is one rung higher up the bundesliga ladder than cologne at the moment , with six points from nine matches , but that does n't really tell the whole story .
the foals are , if anything , looking even worse than cologne at the moment .
the awfulness of gladbach 's defense is threatening to take on historic proportion .
with 27 goals allowed thus far , they are very nearly on pace to break tasmania berlin 's record of 108 for the season - a record that has stood for 45 years , and one that most assumed would never , ever be broken .
still , michael frontzeck is not out of a job .
the coach is scarcely even looking over his shoulder , and the fans are standing behind him .
deep-running roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- has been a loyal soldier at borussia moenchengladbach that he is sitting as pretty as he is , even in the midst of gladbach 's ugly form , is mostly down to his roots .
frontzeck 's managerial record - not only at gladbach , but in his prior stints at aachen and bielefeld as well - has been patchy .
but he was born in moenchengladbach , played nine seasons in three stints with the club , and understands how much borussia means to its fans .
frontzeck showed guts , and demonstrated how well he knows his club , after saturday 's humbling home loss to bremen .
gladbach 's hardcore support was baying for blood after the 4-1 loss , and many a manager would have tuned the jeers out and headed for the locker room .
frontzeck , though , saw an opportunity to circle the wagons , and climbed into the stands to hold an impromptu 15-minute question-and-answer session .
afterward , he told reporters that it had been a " comfortable conversation , " and not at all one where fans were " just looking for someone to blame . "
“ we all agreed that we can only get out of this situation together , ” he said .
“ that the fans are standing behind us is a good feeling . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiny bald head in the middle of this picture ?
that 's frontzeck the contrast with cologne could not be starker .
soldo came to the club as a rising managerial star , on the back of a croatian title with dinamo zagreb , but also as an outsider - one who seemed miscast from the start , in that he never seemed to care about the club 's history or understand the club 's special relationship to its fans .
history 's burden perhaps more than any other clubs in the bundesliga , cologne and gladbach supporters are obsessed with history .
that 's because it 's just about all they 've got . gladbach 's rich past is well-known .
they won five league titles in the 1970s , and made it to another five european finals in that golden era for german football .
for many years , though , cologne too fielded a consistently good team .
in the first quarter-century of the bundesliga , the billy goats won the league twice and finished in the top eight all but four times .
then , in the 1990s , things began to fall apart at both clubs .
cologne finished second in 1990 , and made it to the german cup final in 1991 .
gladbach won the cup in 1995 .
since then , no titles at all , for either club .
moreover , gladbach has been relegated twice , and cologne four times in the past 13 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the haircuts show it 's been some time since cologne were in a cup final falling so far , so fast , and so hard has brought on a certain delusion among both sets of fans .
the older ones still think of their club as big and important , and the younger supporters have grown up in their elders ' echo chamber , weaned on the glories of yesteryear and expectant of a return to glory any minute now .
both clubs attract tens of thousands of fans to home matches irrespective of the side 's current form , and both are followed assiduously in the local press - who are only too happy to talk up a finish in the european places after two wins in a row , and call two straight losses a crisis .
the fishbowl atmosphere can overwhelm a coach who 's not prepared to play along , as the aggressively mild-mannered soldo never was .
but for a coach who 's " one of their own , " like frontzeck or christoph daum in his recent run at cologne , it 's a perfect fit - even if they do n't win anything .
holding fast supporters seem to have determined that the base price of entry to coaching at their club is genuflection at the altar of tradition , a sort of fundamentalist fandom that seeks to purify the club of corrosive outside influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer 's cologne bona fides are unquestioned in this respect , cologne 's interim coach frank schaefer is off to a stellar start .
he has never led a senior side before , but fan darling lukas podolski pronounced his onetime youth team coach " a cologne man through and through . "
-lrb- it 's true - the 46-year-old schaefer has been working as a youth or reserve team coach at cologne for 20 of the past 26 years . -rrb-
for good measure , schaefer himself opened his maiden press conference by stating that he was " a cologne lad and fc guy too . "
he also chose as his assistant coach dirk lottner , a cologne native who played six seasons at the club and has worked with schaefer in the youth system since retiring in 2007 .
cologne 's local tabloid express cooed that " you ca n't get much more cologne than that ! "
the club says it 's not ruling out a higher-profile hire , but holding onto schaefer for a while at least has to be the best play at the moment .
the fans want cologne natives on the touchline , and so they shall have them .
let 's hope they can coach a little as well .

one has panicked and fired its coach , the other plans to stay the course . in the bundesliga , if you go six straight games without a win , or have only one three-pointer to your credit nine games into the season , you are liable to get fired .
like stuttgart 's ex-coach christian gross before him , fc cologne 's zvonimir soldo learned that lesson on sunday .
the billy goats parted ways with their croatian coach of a year-and-a-half at roughly the same time that they landed in last place , courtesy of the former cellar-dwellers stuttgart 's win over st. pauli .
now , news of a last place club sacking its coach rarely comes as a surprise , but when viewed alongside the goings on at another presently hapless club , borussia moenchengladbach , cologne 's move to let soldo go seems rash .
perhaps cologne can learn a lesson from their old rival .
gladbach is one rung higher up the bundesliga ladder than cologne at the moment , with six points from nine matches , but that does n't really tell the whole story .
the foals are , if anything , looking even worse than cologne at the moment .
the awfulness of gladbach 's defense is threatening to take on historic proportion .
with 27 goals allowed thus far , they are very nearly on pace to break tasmania berlin 's record of 108 for the season - a record that has stood for 45 years , and one that most assumed would never , ever be broken .
still , michael frontzeck is not out of a job .
the coach is scarcely even looking over his shoulder , and the fans are standing behind him .
deep-running roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- has been a loyal soldier at borussia moenchengladbach that he is sitting as pretty as he is , even in the midst of gladbach 's ugly form , is mostly down to his roots .
frontzeck 's managerial record - not only at gladbach , but in his prior stints at aachen and bielefeld as well - has been patchy .
but he was born in moenchengladbach , played nine seasons in three stints with the club , and understands how much borussia means to its fans .
frontzeck showed guts , and demonstrated how well he knows his club , after saturday 's humbling home loss to bremen .
gladbach 's hardcore support was baying for blood after the 4-1 loss , and many a manager would have tuned the jeers out and headed for the locker room .
frontzeck , though , saw an opportunity to circle the wagons , and climbed into the stands to hold an impromptu 15-minute question-and-answer session .
afterward , he told reporters that it had been a " comfortable conversation , " and not at all one where fans were " just looking for someone to blame . "
“ we all agreed that we can only get out of this situation together , ” he said .
“ that the fans are standing behind us is a good feeling . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiny bald head in the middle of this picture ?
that 's frontzeck the contrast with cologne could not be starker .
soldo came to the club as a rising managerial star , on the back of a croatian title with dinamo zagreb , but also as an outsider - one who seemed miscast from the start , in that he never seemed to care about the club 's history or understand the club 's special relationship to its fans .
history 's burden perhaps more than any other clubs in the bundesliga , cologne and gladbach supporters are obsessed with history .
that 's because it 's just about all they 've got . gladbach 's rich past is well-known .
they won five league titles in the 1970s , and made it to another five european finals in that golden era for german football .
for many years , though , cologne too fielded a consistently good team .
in the first quarter-century of the bundesliga , the billy goats won the league twice and finished in the top eight all but four times .
then , in the 1990s , things began to fall apart at both clubs .
cologne finished second in 1990 , and made it to the german cup final in 1991 .
gladbach won the cup in 1995 .
since then , no titles at all , for either club .
moreover , gladbach has been relegated twice , and cologne four times in the past 13 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the haircuts show it 's been some time since cologne were in a cup final falling so far , so fast , and so hard has brought on a certain delusion among both sets of fans .
the older ones still think of their club as big and important , and the younger supporters have grown up in their elders ' echo chamber , weaned on the glories of yesteryear and expectant of a return to glory any minute now .
both clubs attract tens of thousands of fans to home matches irrespective of the side 's current form , and both are followed assiduously in the local press - who are only too happy to talk up a finish in the european places after two wins in a row , and call two straight losses a crisis .
the fishbowl atmosphere can overwhelm a coach who 's not prepared to play along , as the aggressively mild-mannered soldo never was .
but for a coach who 's " one of their own , " like frontzeck or christoph daum in his recent run at cologne , it 's a perfect fit - even if they do n't win anything .
holding fast supporters seem to have determined that the base price of entry to coaching at their club is genuflection at the altar of tradition , a sort of fundamentalist fandom that seeks to purify the club of corrosive outside influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer 's cologne bona fides are unquestioned in this respect , cologne 's interim coach frank schaefer is off to a stellar start .
he has never led a senior side before , but fan darling lukas podolski pronounced his onetime youth team coach " a cologne man through and through . "
-lrb- it 's true - the 46-year-old schaefer has been working as a youth or reserve team coach at cologne for 20 of the past 26 years . -rrb-
for good measure , schaefer himself opened his maiden press conference by stating that he was " a cologne lad and fc guy too . "
he also chose as his assistant coach dirk lottner , a cologne native who played six seasons at the club and has worked with schaefer in the youth system since retiring in 2007 .
cologne 's local tabloid express cooed that " you ca n't get much more cologne than that ! "
the club says it 's not ruling out a higher-profile hire , but holding onto schaefer for a while at least has to be the best play at the moment .
the fans want cologne natives on the touchline , and so they shall have them .
let 's hope they can coach a little as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 25.10.2010 germany 's almost legal drug : cannabis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis use is n't completely tolerated in germany legalizing cannabis in germany is only a political side issue , but the topic persistently finds its way back into the conversation and the headlines .
as california votes on the issue , dw looks at the german situation . when the left party recently campaigned in state elections in north-rhine westphalia under the slogan " right to smoke , " their idea to legalize cannabis made headlines in germany .
the same principal has been in the green party 's program for 10 years .
and back in the mid-90s , the social democrats ' otto schily suggested making personal cannabis use legal .
but the question did n't come up again when schily later became interior minister .
efforts to decriminalize marijuana use for the estimated two million germans who smoke it , similar to measures in the neighboring netherlands and czech republic , have been gridlocked for some time .
only the greens and the left are still actively throwing themselves into the fray .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : possession laws vary across germany " it 's a so-called ' soft drug , " ' said gregor gysi , the left party 's parliamentary leader .
" that means its effects are no better or worse than those of alcohol , und just because it is associated with another culture , we treat it differently . "
" what we actually need with cannabis is , first of all , strict controls for minors .
but for adults business should be open for two reasons : first , it would reduce crime associated with buying and second it would end the practice of large amounts of money being made through cannabis sales . "
hazy laws currently in germany , smoking marijuana itself is not a crime , but growing , possessing and selling it is .
the federal constitutional court recommends not enforcing a penalty for possession of small amounts of cannabis for personal use , as long as the possessor is not near a school and poses no threat to the public .
but germany 's 16 states do n't have the same laws for what constitutes a " small amount " of cannabis .
in berlin it is up to 15 grams -lrb- half an ounce -rrb- ; in munich it 's six grams .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffeeshops selling cannabis are across the border in the netherlands authorities in the state of bavaria have warned of " increasing ignorance of guilt regarding cannabis consumption " and have started to crack down on smokers , so much that the german hemp association has made calls online for letters of protest .
raphael gassmann , head of the german center for addiction issues , is n't sure that taking a hard line is the best approach .
" anyone who thinks hard cannabis legislation - in germany or internationally - will lead to less consumption is , experience tells us , wrong , " said gassmann .
" in comparative law studies we have n't once seen a serious indication that punishing cannabis consumption drastically raises or significantly lowers the practice . "
gassmann said one result of going after marijuana users is that they become criminalized .
he adds that can have a devastating effect on their lives if they lose their jobs because of the crime , for example .
mixed support in any case , there seems to be conflicting feelings regarding the problem among the german population .
in a survey of the german hemp association conducted this year , just over 50 percent of germans approve of a liberal approach with regard to cannabis consumers .
but only a quarter of those surveyed support legalizing growing and personal consumption of cannabis , as well as a government regulation of the drug .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medicinal marijuana rules could change soon the social democrats ' parliamentary drug expert , angelika graf , considers legalizing cannabis the wrong signal to send .
she points out the difficult fight against two other legal drugs , alcohol and tobacco .
" i do n't think we 're doing ourselves any favors when we try and reign in use of legal drugs on the one hand and legalize a new drug on the other , " she said .
" that does n't work . "
no one seriously thinks that germany 's current government coalition of christian democrats and free democrats will loosen the country 's cannabis laws .
but , the coalition did recently agree that doctors in germany will soon be able to prescribe pain medication containing cannabis to seriously sick patients , without applying for special approval every time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 25.10.2010 two venerable clubs chart divergent courses out of crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer is the new man in the cologne hot seat fc cologne and borussia moenchengladbach are both off to disastrous starts in the bundesliga .
one has panicked and fired its coach , the other plans to stay the course . in the bundesliga , if you go six straight games without a win , or have only one three-pointer to your credit nine games into the season , you are liable to get fired .
like stuttgart 's ex-coach christian gross before him , fc cologne 's zvonimir soldo learned that lesson on sunday .
the billy goats parted ways with their croatian coach of a year-and-a-half at roughly the same time that they landed in last place , courtesy of the former cellar-dwellers stuttgart 's win over st. pauli .
now , news of a last place club sacking its coach rarely comes as a surprise , but when viewed alongside the goings on at another presently hapless club , borussia moenchengladbach , cologne 's move to let soldo go seems rash .
perhaps cologne can learn a lesson from their old rival .
gladbach is one rung higher up the bundesliga ladder than cologne at the moment , with six points from nine matches , but that does n't really tell the whole story .
the foals are , if anything , looking even worse than cologne at the moment .
the awfulness of gladbach 's defense is threatening to take on historic proportion .
with 27 goals allowed thus far , they are very nearly on pace to break tasmania berlin 's record of 108 for the season - a record that has stood for 45 years , and one that most assumed would never , ever be broken .
still , michael frontzeck is not out of a job .
the coach is scarcely even looking over his shoulder , and the fans are standing behind him .
deep-running roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- has been a loyal soldier at borussia moenchengladbach that he is sitting as pretty as he is , even in the midst of gladbach 's ugly form , is mostly down to his roots .
frontzeck 's managerial record - not only at gladbach , but in his prior stints at aachen and bielefeld as well - has been patchy .
but he was born in moenchengladbach , played nine seasons in three stints with the club , and understands how much borussia means to its fans .
frontzeck showed guts , and demonstrated how well he knows his club , after saturday 's humbling home loss to bremen .
gladbach 's hardcore support was baying for blood after the 4-1 loss , and many a manager would have tuned the jeers out and headed for the locker room .
frontzeck , though , saw an opportunity to circle the wagons , and climbed into the stands to hold an impromptu 15-minute question-and-answer session .
afterward , he told reporters that it had been a " comfortable conversation , " and not at all one where fans were " just looking for someone to blame . "
“ we all agreed that we can only get out of this situation together , ” he said .
“ that the fans are standing behind us is a good feeling . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiny bald head in the middle of this picture ?
that 's frontzeck the contrast with cologne could not be starker .
soldo came to the club as a rising managerial star , on the back of a croatian title with dinamo zagreb , but also as an outsider - one who seemed miscast from the start , in that he never seemed to care about the club 's history or understand the club 's special relationship to its fans .
history 's burden perhaps more than any other clubs in the bundesliga , cologne and gladbach supporters are obsessed with history .
that 's because it 's just about all they 've got . gladbach 's rich past is well-known .
they won five league titles in the 1970s , and made it to another five european finals in that golden era for german football .
for many years , though , cologne too fielded a consistently good team .
in the first quarter-century of the bundesliga , the billy goats won the league twice and finished in the top eight all but four times .
then , in the 1990s , things began to fall apart at both clubs .
cologne finished second in 1990 , and made it to the german cup final in 1991 .
gladbach won the cup in 1995 .
since then , no titles at all , for either club .
moreover , gladbach has been relegated twice , and cologne four times in the past 13 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the haircuts show it 's been some time since cologne were in a cup final falling so far , so fast , and so hard has brought on a certain delusion among both sets of fans .
the older ones still think of their club as big and important , and the younger supporters have grown up in their elders ' echo chamber , weaned on the glories of yesteryear and expectant of a return to glory any minute now .
both clubs attract tens of thousands of fans to home matches irrespective of the side 's current form , and both are followed assiduously in the local press - who are only too happy to talk up a finish in the european places after two wins in a row , and call two straight losses a crisis .
the fishbowl atmosphere can overwhelm a coach who 's not prepared to play along , as the aggressively mild-mannered soldo never was .
but for a coach who 's " one of their own , " like frontzeck or christoph daum in his recent run at cologne , it 's a perfect fit - even if they do n't win anything .
holding fast supporters seem to have determined that the base price of entry to coaching at their club is genuflection at the altar of tradition , a sort of fundamentalist fandom that seeks to purify the club of corrosive outside influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer 's cologne bona fides are unquestioned in this respect , cologne 's interim coach frank schaefer is off to a stellar start .

-lrb- it 's true - the 46-year-old schaefer has been working as a youth or reserve team coach at cologne for 20 of the past 26 years . -rrb-
for good measure , schaefer himself opened his maiden press conference by stating that he was " a cologne lad and fc guy too . "
he also chose as his assistant coach dirk lottner , a cologne native who played six seasons at the club and has worked with schaefer in the youth system since retiring in 2007 .
cologne 's local tabloid express cooed that " you ca n't get much more cologne than that ! "
the club says it 's not ruling out a higher-profile hire , but holding onto schaefer for a while at least has to be the best play at the moment .
the fans want cologne natives on the touchline , and so they shall have them .
let 's hope they can coach a little as well .

one has panicked and fired its coach , the other plans to stay the course . in the bundesliga , if you go six straight games without a win , or have only one three-pointer to your credit nine games into the season , you are liable to get fired .
like stuttgart 's ex-coach christian gross before him , fc cologne 's zvonimir soldo learned that lesson on sunday .
the billy goats parted ways with their croatian coach of a year-and-a-half at roughly the same time that they landed in last place , courtesy of the former cellar-dwellers stuttgart 's win over st. pauli .
now , news of a last place club sacking its coach rarely comes as a surprise , but when viewed alongside the goings on at another presently hapless club , borussia moenchengladbach , cologne 's move to let soldo go seems rash .
perhaps cologne can learn a lesson from their old rival .
gladbach is one rung higher up the bundesliga ladder than cologne at the moment , with six points from nine matches , but that does n't really tell the whole story .
the foals are , if anything , looking even worse than cologne at the moment .
the awfulness of gladbach 's defense is threatening to take on historic proportion .
with 27 goals allowed thus far , they are very nearly on pace to break tasmania berlin 's record of 108 for the season - a record that has stood for 45 years , and one that most assumed would never , ever be broken .
still , michael frontzeck is not out of a job .
the coach is scarcely even looking over his shoulder , and the fans are standing behind him .
deep-running roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- has been a loyal soldier at borussia moenchengladbach that he is sitting as pretty as he is , even in the midst of gladbach 's ugly form , is mostly down to his roots .
frontzeck 's managerial record - not only at gladbach , but in his prior stints at aachen and bielefeld as well - has been patchy .
but he was born in moenchengladbach , played nine seasons in three stints with the club , and understands how much borussia means to its fans .
frontzeck showed guts , and demonstrated how well he knows his club , after saturday 's humbling home loss to bremen .
gladbach 's hardcore support was baying for blood after the 4-1 loss , and many a manager would have tuned the jeers out and headed for the locker room .
frontzeck , though , saw an opportunity to circle the wagons , and climbed into the stands to hold an impromptu 15-minute question-and-answer session .
afterward , he told reporters that it had been a " comfortable conversation , " and not at all one where fans were " just looking for someone to blame . "
“ we all agreed that we can only get out of this situation together , ” he said .
“ that the fans are standing behind us is a good feeling . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiny bald head in the middle of this picture ?
that 's frontzeck the contrast with cologne could not be starker .
soldo came to the club as a rising managerial star , on the back of a croatian title with dinamo zagreb , but also as an outsider - one who seemed miscast from the start , in that he never seemed to care about the club 's history or understand the club 's special relationship to its fans .
history 's burden perhaps more than any other clubs in the bundesliga , cologne and gladbach supporters are obsessed with history .
that 's because it 's just about all they 've got . gladbach 's rich past is well-known .
they won five league titles in the 1970s , and made it to another five european finals in that golden era for german football .
for many years , though , cologne too fielded a consistently good team .
in the first quarter-century of the bundesliga , the billy goats won the league twice and finished in the top eight all but four times .
then , in the 1990s , things began to fall apart at both clubs .
cologne finished second in 1990 , and made it to the german cup final in 1991 .
gladbach won the cup in 1995 .
since then , no titles at all , for either club .
moreover , gladbach has been relegated twice , and cologne four times in the past 13 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the haircuts show it 's been some time since cologne were in a cup final falling so far , so fast , and so hard has brought on a certain delusion among both sets of fans .
the older ones still think of their club as big and important , and the younger supporters have grown up in their elders ' echo chamber , weaned on the glories of yesteryear and expectant of a return to glory any minute now .
both clubs attract tens of thousands of fans to home matches irrespective of the side 's current form , and both are followed assiduously in the local press - who are only too happy to talk up a finish in the european places after two wins in a row , and call two straight losses a crisis .
the fishbowl atmosphere can overwhelm a coach who 's not prepared to play along , as the aggressively mild-mannered soldo never was .
but for a coach who 's " one of their own , " like frontzeck or christoph daum in his recent run at cologne , it 's a perfect fit - even if they do n't win anything .
holding fast supporters seem to have determined that the base price of entry to coaching at their club is genuflection at the altar of tradition , a sort of fundamentalist fandom that seeks to purify the club of corrosive outside influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer 's cologne bona fides are unquestioned in this respect , cologne 's interim coach frank schaefer is off to a stellar start .

some 200 protestors seized control of the depot at fos-sur-mer , believed to be the largest in southern france , as riot police looked on , according to news agency agence-presse france .
meanwhile , a depot in central france , at saint-pierre-des corps , was freed after a week of paralysis when around 30 demonstrators walked away from the site without incident .
strikes in the country 's oil industry and blockades of fuel depots have left 35 percent of gas stations in the paris area completely dry or out of at least one kind of fuel , a transport ministry spokeswoman said .
about one-third of gas stations in western france were in " real difficulty " and 10 to 15 percent in the rest of the country were empty , she added .
unions have already called for two more days of strikes , and university students are planning nationwide marches on tuesday in last-ditch efforts to stop the pension reform before a reconciliation between the two houses of parliament and a final vote by the national assembly expected wednesday .
sarkozy popularity suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has n't been able to stop protests - or his sinking approval sarkozy 's government insists that the pension reform , which will raise the minimum retirement age to 62 from 60 , is " inevitable " and the only way to fill an expected pension budget gap and reduce the country 's growing deficit .
but the opposition socialists say if they win presidential elections in 2012 , their candidate will restore the retirement age to 60 .
polls suggest a majority of french voters support or sympathize with the strikers , but jean-francois cope , leader of sarkozy 's ump party in parliament , blamed the widespread disruption on the work of a minority .
" strikes , protests , yes , but taking the economy hostage is intolerable , " he said in an interview with le parisien newspaper .
" most of the country is paralyzed by the actions of a handful of extremists .
everyone should understand that we have no other choice . "
as the unpopular pension reform plan moves closer to becoming law , sarkozy 's approval rating has dropped to an all-time low , dashing hopes that the legislative achievement could bring him a political comeback .
a poll conducted by the ifop institute and published in the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday showed only 29 percent of respondents were satisfied with sarkozy 's job performance .
that was down three points from september , and was a new low for the president since he took office in 2007 .
sarkozy and his allies are hoping that the ongoing protest and strike movement in opposition to the pension reform will die down as families leave their homes for the mid-term school holiday this week .

some 200 protestors seized control of the depot at fos-sur-mer , believed to be the largest in southern france , as riot police looked on , according to news agency agence-presse france .
meanwhile , a depot in central france , at saint-pierre-des corps , was freed after a week of paralysis when around 30 demonstrators walked away from the site without incident .
strikes in the country 's oil industry and blockades of fuel depots have left 35 percent of gas stations in the paris area completely dry or out of at least one kind of fuel , a transport ministry spokeswoman said .
about one-third of gas stations in western france were in " real difficulty " and 10 to 15 percent in the rest of the country were empty , she added .
unions have already called for two more days of strikes , and university students are planning nationwide marches on tuesday in last-ditch efforts to stop the pension reform before a reconciliation between the two houses of parliament and a final vote by the national assembly expected wednesday .
sarkozy popularity suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has n't been able to stop protests - or his sinking approval sarkozy 's government insists that the pension reform , which will raise the minimum retirement age to 62 from 60 , is " inevitable " and the only way to fill an expected pension budget gap and reduce the country 's growing deficit .
but the opposition socialists say if they win presidential elections in 2012 , their candidate will restore the retirement age to 60 .
polls suggest a majority of french voters support or sympathize with the strikers , but jean-francois cope , leader of sarkozy 's ump party in parliament , blamed the widespread disruption on the work of a minority .
" strikes , protests , yes , but taking the economy hostage is intolerable , " he said in an interview with le parisien newspaper .
" most of the country is paralyzed by the actions of a handful of extremists .
everyone should understand that we have no other choice . "
as the unpopular pension reform plan moves closer to becoming law , sarkozy 's approval rating has dropped to an all-time low , dashing hopes that the legislative achievement could bring him a political comeback .
a poll conducted by the ifop institute and published in the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday showed only 29 percent of respondents were satisfied with sarkozy 's job performance .
that was down three points from september , and was a new low for the president since he took office in 2007 .
sarkozy and his allies are hoping that the ongoing protest and strike movement in opposition to the pension reform will die down as families leave their homes for the mid-term school holiday this week .

both factions of the hurriyat conference have called for a boycott of their first visit to the kashmir valley . the decision to have a group of interlocutors was originally part of an eight-point initiative announced by the indian government to engage with the people of jammu and kashmir and move forward to find a solution to the crisis . the group , which has a one-year mandate and will report after monthly trips to the valley , is supposed to cover views from all three regions of jammu , ladakh and kashmir . the three-member team of dilip padgaonkar , radha kumar and m.m. ansari - a journalist , an academic and an educationist – was set up earlier this month in the wake of renewed unrest in the kashmir valley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hurriyat conference leader syed ali shah geelani has called on delhi to accept his five-point proposal " we will engage with every section of opinion , " dilip padgaonkar explained .
" why do we have this dialogue ?
so that we can have a permanent comprehensive political settlement to the kashmir dispute .
that has to be tried out .
it is a complex problem . " separatists refuse to meet interlocutors however , the interlocutors have got a somewhat hostile reception , with the separatists refusing to meet them . an ardent supporter of the state 's merger with pakistan , hard-line hurriyat conference leader syed ali shah geelani said dialogue with new delhi would only be possible if the government accepted his five-point proposal that includes accepting kashmir as an international dispute . mirwaiz umar farooq , who heads another faction of the conference , described the appointment of the interlocutors as a mere wastage of time .
he said that the lingering dispute should be resolved through tripartite talks between pakistan , india and the " real " kashmiri leadership . pessimism about group 's success nonetheless , the team tried to get on with the task at hand , interacting with young people , visiting jails , calling on politicians , and also praying for the success of their mission at the holy muslim shrine of hazratbal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interlocutors want to talk with all sections of society including angry youths iqbal nazir , a lecturer at the amir singh college in srinagar , was not very optimistic : " this does not seem like a healthy initiative taken by india given that we have seen commissions and working groups being created before .
their recommendations did not reach any conclusion .
and these interlocutors seem to be meeting the same fate . " for sana altaf , an educationist , the prospects seemed equally bleak : " the visit of the interlocutors at this time is not going to be beneficial .
the central government should carve out a situation in which people can lead a normal life , after business , schools and education have been restored .
the interlocutors may have long-term results but as of now they are not accessing the ground situation which is very important for the common man of kashmir . " last december , the government 's move to engage separatist leaders in " quiet diplomacy " failed . author : murali krishnan editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 25.10.2010 hochtief seeks overseas allies in takeover battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief workers fear a buyout will cost them their jobs following the german government 's decision not to step in and help hochtief stave off a hostile takeover bid from spanish rival acs , the construction giant has begun looking for help further afield . until last week , essen-based hochtief had been hopeful that the german government would protect it from a takeover bid by spain 's actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- , by changing existing securities laws .
but no such luck .
economics minister rainer bruederle said that although he would like to see the company 's headquarters remain on german turf , he was not willing to intervene in the market process .
and chancellor angela merkel agreed on both counts .
that was the end of that , but not the end of the story .
on sunday , germany 's weekly news magazine der spiegel reported that hochtief is now in talks with qatar , thanks , no less , to mrs merkel .
a spokeswoman for the coveted construction company told reporters that during an industry leaders dinner at berlin 's presidential palace , the german chancellor had taken the opportunity to introduce hochtief chief executive herbert luetkestratkoetter to the qatari economics minister .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel does not want to see hochtief split up should qatar decide to get on board with its sovereign wealth fund , it would be as a ' white-knight ' investor , a role it has played in the past for the volkswagen group .
australian assistance but hochtief is not leaving its fate solely in the lap of the middle east .
the company is also looking to australia , home of its hugely successful subsidiary leighton holdings , to bolster its defenses .
last week , the german company applied to the australian takeovers panel to try and force acs to make a fully priced bid for outstanding shares in leighton , which contributes some 80 percent of hochtief 's total earnings and is therefore particularly attractive to the heavily indebted spanish bidder .
on monday , leighton upped the pressure by making its own application to the panel to block the all-share bid on the grounds that it would rob the company of its independence .
" although hochtief owns 54.5 percent of leighton , leighton is not in the normal position of a controlled ' downstream ' entity , " leighton chairman david mortimer said in a statement .
under the current governance arrangements between the german company and its australian subsidiary , leighton has an independent board and management .
protecting minority shareholders furthermore mortimer said that to allow a takeover by acs - which currently holds a 29 percent stake in hochtief - without a commitment to retain leighton 's independence status or any obligation to make a cash bid for the subsidiary would not be in the interests of shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is looking to australian regulators for support " leighton 's independent directors are concerned that german takeover law does not provide the same level of protection for the interests of minority shareholders that investors expect of companies listed on the australian securities exchange , " he said .
the australian takeovers panel has three weeks to decide whether the spanish bid for hochtief is in actual fact a bid for leighton , and whether minority shareholders would be disadvantaged a successful takeover .
if the regulators find in favor of leighton , it could double the money acs would need to buy a controlling stake in the german company .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : wikileaks disclosures wikileaks exposes shell 's infiltration of nigeria 's government opinion : wikileaks is a test of us commitment to free press wikileaks cables show consistent us foreign policy , say experts wikileaks release could lead to shift from transparency to secrecy iraq -pipe- 25.10.2010 wikileaks and our perceptions of a ‘ dirty war ’ großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the criticism coming out of washington and baghdad aimed at the publication by wikileaks of secret iraq war documents is hypocritical , writes rainer sollich of dw ’ s africa / middle east program . actually the secret files made public by wikileaks offer little new information .
at the very latest , since abu ghraib , the international community had come to the realization that the war in iraq was a ‘ dirty war ' .
there were killings .
there was torture .
mercenaries operated as brutal aggressors .
shi 'ites and sunnis took turns massacring each other .
that one of the most barbarous dictators was overthrown in the process has practically been forgotten .
instead , the image of a dirty war has now been even more enduringly anchored in our collective consciousness .
thanks to the disclosures made by wikileaks , we have perhaps been given a more accurate insight into the course of events and a more precise figure on the brutal human rights violations and number of deaths .
according to the files , more than 150,000 people were killed in iraq between 2004 and 2009 , if we can believe the documents from us military sources . # b # documents appear to be credible can we believe them ?
yes , we can .
the documents appear , in principle , to be credible .
however , it is important to treat them for what they are : one source among many , and a one-sided one at that , originally intended for internal , domestic consumption .
not everything in these documents can be characterized as a bitter truth intended to be camouflaged from public view .
this or that bit of information could be a half truth or ‘ pseudo-fact ' ; for example , when the person reporting draws the wrong conclusions due to their subjective perspective , or wishes to hide personal lapses or errors from superiors .
few things in life are more regularly “ air brushed ” or openly manipulated than reports to supervising superiors , and this is very probably no different for the us army in iraq .
wikileaks also needs monitoring critical questions , therefore , are certainly permissible : did wikileaks do everything possible when vetting the documents to ensure that no human lives will be put at risk ?
we can only hope and wait .
and , by the way : where are the checks and balances on wikileaks ?
the group is going to have to accept questions like these - just as traditional mass media or outlets like facebook and youtube have done - in view of the fact that its political muscle has grown significantly .
they all shoulder a major responsibility , without ever having been elected .
of course , it also depends on who is asking the question and with what motive .
the criticism of wikileaks , expressed by washington and baghdad , is hypocritical .
both are concerned about their reputations .
us president barack obama only appears to be in a comfortable position .
he can not really sit back and claim that all the missteps and consequences are the fault of his predecessor , george w. bush .
in the selective perceptions of many people – and not just in the arab world – the united states is once again on the pillory .
files dicey for iraqi leader the publication of the documents , however , is just as much of a blow to iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki .
he now stands there in public as a political leader who condones torture , including the abuse of supporters of political and religious groups , whom , for the last seven months , he has been trying to win over as coalition partners in a new government .
not surprisingly , al-maliki suspects intrigue behind the wikileak revelations .
he knows that the publication of new , shocking details could cost him his political career .
in as far as the documents are not proven to be forgeries or seriously flawed – for which there is no evidence at the moment – then the blame for them lies with him and george w. bush – and not with wikileaks .
as with vietnam decades ago , the same holds true for the war in iraq today : dirty details need to be thoroughly evaluated and dirty truths brought to light with no holds barred .
the people of iraq , in particular , deserve nothing less .

a rapid border intervention team is expected to be deployed . a rapid intervention team from the eu border agency , frontex , will be deployed for the first time to greece to help shore up the country 's porous border with turkey , the european commission has said in a statement .
the move comes after greece put out an emergency call for the border team , which is to act under greek authority .
eu internal affairs commissioner cecilia malmstroem said she had " immediately activated the mechanism to liaise with frontex and to communicate among all interested partners , so as to handle this emergency situation in the most expeditious and efficient way . "
" the situation at the greek land border with turkey is increasingly worrying , " she said .
" the flows of people crossing the border irregularly have reached alarming proportions and greece is manifestly not able to face this situation alone … i am very concerned about the humanitarian situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions inside many of europe 's detention centers are considered poor according to the united nations , an estimated 300-400 illegal immigrants enter greece every day , many of whom come from africa and afghanistan .
the un last week called on eu states to do more to lighten the migrant burden on greece , which it said has created " catastrophic " conditions for refugees .
un special rapporteur on torture manfred nowak described conditions inside greece 's overcrowded detention centers as " inhumane . "
an overwhelming majority of the refugees use greece as an entry point to other european union countries , and arrivals by land have increased by more than a third in a year .
last week , turkey pledged to cooperate with greece in a bid to control the flow of irregular immigrants making their way into europe , in exchange for greece 's help in easing visa rules for turks .

a rapid border intervention team is expected to be deployed . a rapid intervention team from the eu border agency , frontex , will be deployed for the first time to greece to help shore up the country 's porous border with turkey , the european commission has said in a statement .
the move comes after greece put out an emergency call for the border team , which is to act under greek authority .
eu internal affairs commissioner cecilia malmstroem said she had " immediately activated the mechanism to liaise with frontex and to communicate among all interested partners , so as to handle this emergency situation in the most expeditious and efficient way . "
" the situation at the greek land border with turkey is increasingly worrying , " she said .

the un last week called on eu states to do more to lighten the migrant burden on greece , which it said has created " catastrophic " conditions for refugees .
un special rapporteur on torture manfred nowak described conditions inside greece 's overcrowded detention centers as " inhumane . "
an overwhelming majority of the refugees use greece as an entry point to other european union countries , and arrivals by land have increased by more than a third in a year .
last week , turkey pledged to cooperate with greece in a bid to control the flow of irregular immigrants making their way into europe , in exchange for greece 's help in easing visa rules for turks .

but no such luck .
economics minister rainer bruederle said that although he would like to see the company 's headquarters remain on german turf , he was not willing to intervene in the market process .
and chancellor angela merkel agreed on both counts .
that was the end of that , but not the end of the story .
on sunday , germany 's weekly news magazine der spiegel reported that hochtief is now in talks with qatar , thanks , no less , to mrs merkel .
a spokeswoman for the coveted construction company told reporters that during an industry leaders dinner at berlin 's presidential palace , the german chancellor had taken the opportunity to introduce hochtief chief executive herbert luetkestratkoetter to the qatari economics minister .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel does not want to see hochtief split up should qatar decide to get on board with its sovereign wealth fund , it would be as a ' white-knight ' investor , a role it has played in the past for the volkswagen group .
australian assistance but hochtief is not leaving its fate solely in the lap of the middle east .
the company is also looking to australia , home of its hugely successful subsidiary leighton holdings , to bolster its defenses .
last week , the german company applied to the australian takeovers panel to try and force acs to make a fully priced bid for outstanding shares in leighton , which contributes some 80 percent of hochtief 's total earnings and is therefore particularly attractive to the heavily indebted spanish bidder .
on monday , leighton upped the pressure by making its own application to the panel to block the all-share bid on the grounds that it would rob the company of its independence .
" although hochtief owns 54.5 percent of leighton , leighton is not in the normal position of a controlled ' downstream ' entity , " leighton chairman david mortimer said in a statement .
under the current governance arrangements between the german company and its australian subsidiary , leighton has an independent board and management .
protecting minority shareholders furthermore mortimer said that to allow a takeover by acs - which currently holds a 29 percent stake in hochtief - without a commitment to retain leighton 's independence status or any obligation to make a cash bid for the subsidiary would not be in the interests of shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is looking to australian regulators for support " leighton 's independent directors are concerned that german takeover law does not provide the same level of protection for the interests of minority shareholders that investors expect of companies listed on the australian securities exchange , " he said .
the australian takeovers panel has three weeks to decide whether the spanish bid for hochtief is in actual fact a bid for leighton , and whether minority shareholders would be disadvantaged a successful takeover .
if the regulators find in favor of leighton , it could double the money acs would need to buy a controlling stake in the german company .

both factions of the hurriyat conference have called for a boycott of their first visit to the kashmir valley . the decision to have a group of interlocutors was originally part of an eight-point initiative announced by the indian government to engage with the people of jammu and kashmir and move forward to find a solution to the crisis . the group , which has a one-year mandate and will report after monthly trips to the valley , is supposed to cover views from all three regions of jammu , ladakh and kashmir . the three-member team of dilip padgaonkar , radha kumar and m.m. ansari - a journalist , an academic and an educationist – was set up earlier this month in the wake of renewed unrest in the kashmir valley .

" it 's clear from those inspections that while most of the data is fragmentary , in some instances entire emails and urls were captured , as well as passwords , " wrote alan eustace , google 's senior vice president of engineering and research , in a post published late friday on google 's public policy blog . this is the first time that google has revealed the full extent of the privacy breach , which it had previously blamed on a coding error . the company said it plans delete the data " as soon as possible " and wants to make improvements to its policies . this follows a previous announcement in may , prompted by investigations by german privacy officials , that the company had mistakenly collected unencrypted wifi payload data -lrb- information sent over networks -rrb- using its street view cars . the cars are used for google 's mapping service and take panoramic photos of streets in various countries around the world . situation merits further examination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google plans to add germany 's 20 largest cities to street view by the end of 2010 the latest revelations failed to surprise johannes caspar , hamburg 's commissioner for data protection and freedom of information , and the leading authority in the german google investigation . " this just confirms what we expected , " he told deutsche welle .
" it could already have been predicted a few months ago . " according to caspar , germany will continue with its enquiry as planned , aiming for an independent assessment before " we think about taking further action . "
following the may privacy invasion scandal , hard drives of computers involved are being inspected .
should google 's statement be proven true , caspar says the company may be fined . according to ulrich boerger , a hamburg-based privacy lawyer , evidence of password and email leaks would add another dimension to the privacy debate in germany , but " it 's difficult to talk about any concrete consequences at this stage . " similar reaction in the uk google 's latest revelations have also not altered the general course of action for uk authorities , despite having cleared google of the charge of having collected " meaningful personal details " earlier this year . " we will be making enquires to see whether this information relates to the data inadvertently captured in the uk , before deciding on the necessary course of action , including a consideration of the need to use our enforcement powers , " wrote the information commissioner 's office , great britain 's data protection agency , in a statement published on its website . google has previously said it did not realize that kismet , a free software program it uses to detect wireless networks , was also recording snippets of emails and web pages .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 25.10.2010 twenty-five-year conservation effort pays off on germany 's north sea coast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many bird species are at home in the protected mud flats and salt marshes germany 's wadden sea national park , along the north sea coast , turned 25 this month .
as the world struggles with agreements to reverse biodiversity loss , the wadden sea shines as an example of transnational conservation . the wadden sea is one of central europe 's most important nature reserves . the strip of north sea coast is home to the biggest contiguous area of mudflats in the world , and stretches from den helder in the netherlands to esbjerg in denmark via three german states . much of the wadden sea was listed as a unesco world heritage site in 2009 because it serves as a flourishing habitat for some 3,200 species of animals , provides an important way-station for migratory birds , supports a wide variety of plants among its salt marshes and has played a crucial role in restoring seal populations over the past two decades . today the wadden sea is seen as a model for promoting cross-border conservation , but the road to success was not straight forward . road to riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal populations are recovering thanks to a nurturing environment the wadden sea national park is really three parks divided between the german states of schleswig holstein , lower saxony and the city-state of hamburg . the oldest is the park established in germany 's northernmost state , schleswig-holstein , in 1985 . it was prompted by a dawning awareness that piecemeal legislation was proving inadequate at dealing with the growing impacts of industrial and agricultural waste , development and commercial expoitation on the region . at first , proposals for a park met with stiff resistance from locals , who feared for their hunting and fishing rights , resented impositions on their freedom to use the area and worried about an influx of tourists . yet through a mixture of compromise and consensus-building , the state 's then premier , uwe barschel , managed to build enough support to pass legislation . " it sounds crude , but we were just trying to get people on board , " recalls detlef hansen , the head of the national park . " we formed working groups with fishermen , with shepherds , with hunters , and let them have a say in the decision making . " in the end , it was conservationists who felt they were getting the short end of the stick and initially dismissed barschel 's plan as a sham . yet over the years , protection was extended : in 1990 a deal was struck to protect seal populations in the wadden sea – the first accord signed under the bonn convention on migratory species . today , that accord between germany , the netherlands and denmark is held up as a model for multilateral species protection programs . success has boiled down to " defining common objectives " and " working together " with all stakeholders , said jens enemark , secretary of the common wadden sea secretariat - the international organization tasked with facilitating cooperation in the wadden sea . this has meant identifying and mitigating the main human threats to the region , namely pollution , disturbance and habitat destruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the tide is out , visitors enjoy walking on the sea bed local dividends and it 's not just seals that have reaped the rewards , says detlef hansen . " today , you stand on the dike and you realize that it has become a quiet , peaceful place - there 's no more bird hunting , no low-flying planes , and military maneuvers are history .
visitors , and also the inhabitants , can enjoy the blooming salt marshes , " hansen said . locals now overwhelmingly support the national park , and while jens enemark says conservation authorities continue to have different priorities to fishermen and others who depend upon the region for their livelihood , relations are far more cordial than they were two decades ago . indeed , the thriving environment has proved a boon for another industry . " more than two million guests a year spend vacation on the north sea coast of schleswig holstein , " said konstanze hoefling-hoff of the north sea tourism service . " we know from polls and headcounts that more than a million of them stop at the visitors- stations of the national parks , " with popular activities including " guided hikes on the mud flats and other excursions . " to prevent the region from being loved-to-death by over-eager visitors , the wadden sea has a unique partnership program , which ties together the national park service , volunteers , and conservation groups . the german branch of the world wildlife fund fro nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- praises the partnership . it says nature has been able to recuperate , as a result , and that at least in the tidal mud flats , species have ceased to die out . the north sea is also cleaner , and the animals in the mud flats are less frightened than they once were , according to hans-ulrich roesner , a spokesman for the wwf in husum , in northern germany . oil on the horizon ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservation stations have done their job well yet the wwf also says causes for concern remain . " the biggest blot on the national park is the oil exploration which is still taking place in the mittelplate oil field , in the southern part of the region , " roesner said , claiming that this disrupts wild geese in their molting areas , and can leave them unable to fly in summer . unsustainable levels of commercial fishing are an ongoing problem too , from wwf 's perspective , and on this score " something needs to change soon , " roesner says . within germany 's borders , financial considerations also loom . there is n't enough money to go round for rangers , and changes to germany 's system of compulsory military service , mean that there is likely to be a knock on effect for social work , as fewer young men opt for this alternative service – a useful source of labor for everything from medical care to nature conservation . despite these challenges , the wadden sea serves as a useful case-study for others seeking to strike a deal to save nature . author : werner junge , jennifer abramsohn editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's clear from those inspections that while most of the data is fragmentary , in some instances entire emails and urls were captured , as well as passwords , " wrote alan eustace , google 's senior vice president of engineering and research , in a post published late friday on google 's public policy blog . this is the first time that google has revealed the full extent of the privacy breach , which it had previously blamed on a coding error . the company said it plans delete the data " as soon as possible " and wants to make improvements to its policies . this follows a previous announcement in may , prompted by investigations by german privacy officials , that the company had mistakenly collected unencrypted wifi payload data -lrb- information sent over networks -rrb- using its street view cars . the cars are used for google 's mapping service and take panoramic photos of streets in various countries around the world . situation merits further examination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google plans to add germany 's 20 largest cities to street view by the end of 2010 the latest revelations failed to surprise johannes caspar , hamburg 's commissioner for data protection and freedom of information , and the leading authority in the german google investigation . " this just confirms what we expected , " he told deutsche welle .
" it could already have been predicted a few months ago . " according to caspar , germany will continue with its enquiry as planned , aiming for an independent assessment before " we think about taking further action . "
following the may privacy invasion scandal , hard drives of computers involved are being inspected .
should google 's statement be proven true , caspar says the company may be fined . according to ulrich boerger , a hamburg-based privacy lawyer , evidence of password and email leaks would add another dimension to the privacy debate in germany , but " it 's difficult to talk about any concrete consequences at this stage . " similar reaction in the uk google 's latest revelations have also not altered the general course of action for uk authorities , despite having cleared google of the charge of having collected " meaningful personal details " earlier this year . " we will be making enquires to see whether this information relates to the data inadvertently captured in the uk , before deciding on the necessary course of action , including a consideration of the need to use our enforcement powers , " wrote the information commissioner 's office , great britain 's data protection agency , in a statement published on its website . google has previously said it did not realize that kismet , a free software program it uses to detect wireless networks , was also recording snippets of emails and web pages .

this year is the first time in the award 's ten year history that it has been given to a rock musician .
during the presentation ceremony at the guildhall in kassel , central germany , journalist and publicist matthias matussek praised lindenberg and said his song lyrics proved he had learned much about the german language .
the jury , in naming lindenberg as this year 's winner , concluded that he was the " most influential and successful german rock musician of the last 40 years " and , in that time , had more than proven that music in german could be successful internationally , the rheinische post reported on sunday .
lindenburg , who first entered the business in the late 60s as a drummer and went on to have hits with " sonderzug nach pankow " -lrb- special train to pankow -rrb- , " airport " and " geh nicht weg " -lrb- do n't go away -rrb- , said that the jury 's decision was " cool . "
jacob grimm , after whom the award is named , was one half of germany 's famous grimm brothers , who rose to prominence in the early 1800s for their collection of now world-famous fairytales .
the prize which bears jacob 's name is awarded to someone who works to promote the “ recognition , further development and support of german as a cultural language . ”
for his faithfulness to his mother tongue , lindenberg also receives 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 42,000 -rrb- prize money .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 25.10.2010 two venerable clubs chart divergent courses out of crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer is the new man in the cologne hot seat fc cologne and borussia moenchengladbach are both off to disastrous starts in the bundesliga .
one has panicked and fired its coach , the other plans to stay the course . in the bundesliga , if you go six straight games without a win , or have only one three-pointer to your credit nine games into the season , you are liable to get fired .
like stuttgart 's ex-coach christian gross before him , fc cologne 's zvonimir soldo learned that lesson on sunday .
the billy goats parted ways with their croatian coach of a year-and-a-half at roughly the same time that they landed in last place , courtesy of the former cellar-dwellers stuttgart 's win over st. pauli .
now , news of a last place club sacking its coach rarely comes as a surprise , but when viewed alongside the goings on at another presently hapless club , borussia moenchengladbach , cologne 's move to let soldo go seems rash .
perhaps cologne can learn a lesson from their old rival .
gladbach is one rung higher up the bundesliga ladder than cologne at the moment , with six points from nine matches , but that does n't really tell the whole story .
the foals are , if anything , looking even worse than cologne at the moment .
the awfulness of gladbach 's defense is threatening to take on historic proportion .
with 27 goals allowed thus far , they are very nearly on pace to break tasmania berlin 's record of 108 for the season - a record that has stood for 45 years , and one that most assumed would never , ever be broken .
still , michael frontzeck is not out of a job .
the coach is scarcely even looking over his shoulder , and the fans are standing behind him .
deep-running roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- has been a loyal soldier at borussia moenchengladbach that he is sitting as pretty as he is , even in the midst of gladbach 's ugly form , is mostly down to his roots .
frontzeck 's managerial record - not only at gladbach , but in his prior stints at aachen and bielefeld as well - has been patchy .
but he was born in moenchengladbach , played nine seasons in three stints with the club , and understands how much borussia means to its fans .
frontzeck showed guts , and demonstrated how well he knows his club , after saturday 's humbling home loss to bremen .
gladbach 's hardcore support was baying for blood after the 4-1 loss , and many a manager would have tuned the jeers out and headed for the locker room .
frontzeck , though , saw an opportunity to circle the wagons , and climbed into the stands to hold an impromptu 15-minute question-and-answer session .
afterward , he told reporters that it had been a " comfortable conversation , " and not at all one where fans were " just looking for someone to blame . "
“ we all agreed that we can only get out of this situation together , ” he said .
“ that the fans are standing behind us is a good feeling . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiny bald head in the middle of this picture ?
that 's frontzeck the contrast with cologne could not be starker .
soldo came to the club as a rising managerial star , on the back of a croatian title with dinamo zagreb , but also as an outsider - one who seemed miscast from the start , in that he never seemed to care about the club 's history or understand the club 's special relationship to its fans .
history 's burden perhaps more than any other clubs in the bundesliga , cologne and gladbach supporters are obsessed with history .
that 's because it 's just about all they 've got . gladbach 's rich past is well-known .
they won five league titles in the 1970s , and made it to another five european finals in that golden era for german football .
for many years , though , cologne too fielded a consistently good team .
in the first quarter-century of the bundesliga , the billy goats won the league twice and finished in the top eight all but four times .
then , in the 1990s , things began to fall apart at both clubs .
cologne finished second in 1990 , and made it to the german cup final in 1991 .
gladbach won the cup in 1995 .
since then , no titles at all , for either club .
moreover , gladbach has been relegated twice , and cologne four times in the past 13 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the haircuts show it 's been some time since cologne were in a cup final falling so far , so fast , and so hard has brought on a certain delusion among both sets of fans .
the older ones still think of their club as big and important , and the younger supporters have grown up in their elders ' echo chamber , weaned on the glories of yesteryear and expectant of a return to glory any minute now .
both clubs attract tens of thousands of fans to home matches irrespective of the side 's current form , and both are followed assiduously in the local press - who are only too happy to talk up a finish in the european places after two wins in a row , and call two straight losses a crisis .
the fishbowl atmosphere can overwhelm a coach who 's not prepared to play along , as the aggressively mild-mannered soldo never was .
but for a coach who 's " one of their own , " like frontzeck or christoph daum in his recent run at cologne , it 's a perfect fit - even if they do n't win anything .
holding fast supporters seem to have determined that the base price of entry to coaching at their club is genuflection at the altar of tradition , a sort of fundamentalist fandom that seeks to purify the club of corrosive outside influence .

cologne 's local tabloid express cooed that " you ca n't get much more cologne than that ! "
the club says it 's not ruling out a higher-profile hire , but holding onto schaefer for a while at least has to be the best play at the moment .

one has panicked and fired its coach , the other plans to stay the course . in the bundesliga , if you go six straight games without a win , or have only one three-pointer to your credit nine games into the season , you are liable to get fired .
like stuttgart 's ex-coach christian gross before him , fc cologne 's zvonimir soldo learned that lesson on sunday .
the billy goats parted ways with their croatian coach of a year-and-a-half at roughly the same time that they landed in last place , courtesy of the former cellar-dwellers stuttgart 's win over st. pauli .
now , news of a last place club sacking its coach rarely comes as a surprise , but when viewed alongside the goings on at another presently hapless club , borussia moenchengladbach , cologne 's move to let soldo go seems rash .
perhaps cologne can learn a lesson from their old rival .
gladbach is one rung higher up the bundesliga ladder than cologne at the moment , with six points from nine matches , but that does n't really tell the whole story .
the foals are , if anything , looking even worse than cologne at the moment .
the awfulness of gladbach 's defense is threatening to take on historic proportion .
with 27 goals allowed thus far , they are very nearly on pace to break tasmania berlin 's record of 108 for the season - a record that has stood for 45 years , and one that most assumed would never , ever be broken .
still , michael frontzeck is not out of a job .
the coach is scarcely even looking over his shoulder , and the fans are standing behind him .
deep-running roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- has been a loyal soldier at borussia moenchengladbach that he is sitting as pretty as he is , even in the midst of gladbach 's ugly form , is mostly down to his roots .
frontzeck 's managerial record - not only at gladbach , but in his prior stints at aachen and bielefeld as well - has been patchy .
but he was born in moenchengladbach , played nine seasons in three stints with the club , and understands how much borussia means to its fans .
frontzeck showed guts , and demonstrated how well he knows his club , after saturday 's humbling home loss to bremen .
gladbach 's hardcore support was baying for blood after the 4-1 loss , and many a manager would have tuned the jeers out and headed for the locker room .
frontzeck , though , saw an opportunity to circle the wagons , and climbed into the stands to hold an impromptu 15-minute question-and-answer session .
afterward , he told reporters that it had been a " comfortable conversation , " and not at all one where fans were " just looking for someone to blame . "
“ we all agreed that we can only get out of this situation together , ” he said .
“ that the fans are standing behind us is a good feeling . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiny bald head in the middle of this picture ?
that 's frontzeck the contrast with cologne could not be starker .
soldo came to the club as a rising managerial star , on the back of a croatian title with dinamo zagreb , but also as an outsider - one who seemed miscast from the start , in that he never seemed to care about the club 's history or understand the club 's special relationship to its fans .
history 's burden perhaps more than any other clubs in the bundesliga , cologne and gladbach supporters are obsessed with history .
that 's because it 's just about all they 've got . gladbach 's rich past is well-known .
they won five league titles in the 1970s , and made it to another five european finals in that golden era for german football .
for many years , though , cologne too fielded a consistently good team .
in the first quarter-century of the bundesliga , the billy goats won the league twice and finished in the top eight all but four times .
then , in the 1990s , things began to fall apart at both clubs .
cologne finished second in 1990 , and made it to the german cup final in 1991 .
gladbach won the cup in 1995 .
since then , no titles at all , for either club .
moreover , gladbach has been relegated twice , and cologne four times in the past 13 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the haircuts show it 's been some time since cologne were in a cup final falling so far , so fast , and so hard has brought on a certain delusion among both sets of fans .
the older ones still think of their club as big and important , and the younger supporters have grown up in their elders ' echo chamber , weaned on the glories of yesteryear and expectant of a return to glory any minute now .
both clubs attract tens of thousands of fans to home matches irrespective of the side 's current form , and both are followed assiduously in the local press - who are only too happy to talk up a finish in the european places after two wins in a row , and call two straight losses a crisis .
the fishbowl atmosphere can overwhelm a coach who 's not prepared to play along , as the aggressively mild-mannered soldo never was .
but for a coach who 's " one of their own , " like frontzeck or christoph daum in his recent run at cologne , it 's a perfect fit - even if they do n't win anything .
holding fast supporters seem to have determined that the base price of entry to coaching at their club is genuflection at the altar of tradition , a sort of fundamentalist fandom that seeks to purify the club of corrosive outside influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer 's cologne bona fides are unquestioned in this respect , cologne 's interim coach frank schaefer is off to a stellar start .
he has never led a senior side before , but fan darling lukas podolski pronounced his onetime youth team coach " a cologne man through and through . "

both factions of the hurriyat conference have called for a boycott of their first visit to the kashmir valley . the decision to have a group of interlocutors was originally part of an eight-point initiative announced by the indian government to engage with the people of jammu and kashmir and move forward to find a solution to the crisis . the group , which has a one-year mandate and will report after monthly trips to the valley , is supposed to cover views from all three regions of jammu , ladakh and kashmir . the three-member team of dilip padgaonkar , radha kumar and m.m. ansari - a journalist , an academic and an educationist – was set up earlier this month in the wake of renewed unrest in the kashmir valley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hurriyat conference leader syed ali shah geelani has called on delhi to accept his five-point proposal " we will engage with every section of opinion , " dilip padgaonkar explained .
" why do we have this dialogue ?
so that we can have a permanent comprehensive political settlement to the kashmir dispute .
that has to be tried out .
it is a complex problem . " separatists refuse to meet interlocutors however , the interlocutors have got a somewhat hostile reception , with the separatists refusing to meet them . an ardent supporter of the state 's merger with pakistan , hard-line hurriyat conference leader syed ali shah geelani said dialogue with new delhi would only be possible if the government accepted his five-point proposal that includes accepting kashmir as an international dispute . mirwaiz umar farooq , who heads another faction of the conference , described the appointment of the interlocutors as a mere wastage of time .
he said that the lingering dispute should be resolved through tripartite talks between pakistan , india and the " real " kashmiri leadership . pessimism about group 's success nonetheless , the team tried to get on with the task at hand , interacting with young people , visiting jails , calling on politicians , and also praying for the success of their mission at the holy muslim shrine of hazratbal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interlocutors want to talk with all sections of society including angry youths iqbal nazir , a lecturer at the amir singh college in srinagar , was not very optimistic : " this does not seem like a healthy initiative taken by india given that we have seen commissions and working groups being created before .
their recommendations did not reach any conclusion .
and these interlocutors seem to be meeting the same fate . " for sana altaf , an educationist , the prospects seemed equally bleak : " the visit of the interlocutors at this time is not going to be beneficial .
the central government should carve out a situation in which people can lead a normal life , after business , schools and education have been restored .
the interlocutors may have long-term results but as of now they are not accessing the ground situation which is very important for the common man of kashmir . " last december , the government 's move to engage separatist leaders in " quiet diplomacy " failed . author : murali krishnan editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but no such luck .
economics minister rainer bruederle said that although he would like to see the company 's headquarters remain on german turf , he was not willing to intervene in the market process .
and chancellor angela merkel agreed on both counts .
that was the end of that , but not the end of the story .
on sunday , germany 's weekly news magazine der spiegel reported that hochtief is now in talks with qatar , thanks , no less , to mrs merkel .
a spokeswoman for the coveted construction company told reporters that during an industry leaders dinner at berlin 's presidential palace , the german chancellor had taken the opportunity to introduce hochtief chief executive herbert luetkestratkoetter to the qatari economics minister .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel does not want to see hochtief split up should qatar decide to get on board with its sovereign wealth fund , it would be as a ' white-knight ' investor , a role it has played in the past for the volkswagen group .
australian assistance but hochtief is not leaving its fate solely in the lap of the middle east .
the company is also looking to australia , home of its hugely successful subsidiary leighton holdings , to bolster its defenses .
last week , the german company applied to the australian takeovers panel to try and force acs to make a fully priced bid for outstanding shares in leighton , which contributes some 80 percent of hochtief 's total earnings and is therefore particularly attractive to the heavily indebted spanish bidder .
on monday , leighton upped the pressure by making its own application to the panel to block the all-share bid on the grounds that it would rob the company of its independence .
" although hochtief owns 54.5 percent of leighton , leighton is not in the normal position of a controlled ' downstream ' entity , " leighton chairman david mortimer said in a statement .
under the current governance arrangements between the german company and its australian subsidiary , leighton has an independent board and management .
protecting minority shareholders furthermore mortimer said that to allow a takeover by acs - which currently holds a 29 percent stake in hochtief - without a commitment to retain leighton 's independence status or any obligation to make a cash bid for the subsidiary would not be in the interests of shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is looking to australian regulators for support " leighton 's independent directors are concerned that german takeover law does not provide the same level of protection for the interests of minority shareholders that investors expect of companies listed on the australian securities exchange , " he said .
the australian takeovers panel has three weeks to decide whether the spanish bid for hochtief is in actual fact a bid for leighton , and whether minority shareholders would be disadvantaged a successful takeover .
if the regulators find in favor of leighton , it could double the money acs would need to buy a controlling stake in the german company .

some 200 protestors seized control of the depot at fos-sur-mer , believed to be the largest in southern france , as riot police looked on , according to news agency agence-presse france .
meanwhile , a depot in central france , at saint-pierre-des corps , was freed after a week of paralysis when around 30 demonstrators walked away from the site without incident .
strikes in the country 's oil industry and blockades of fuel depots have left 35 percent of gas stations in the paris area completely dry or out of at least one kind of fuel , a transport ministry spokeswoman said .
about one-third of gas stations in western france were in " real difficulty " and 10 to 15 percent in the rest of the country were empty , she added .
unions have already called for two more days of strikes , and university students are planning nationwide marches on tuesday in last-ditch efforts to stop the pension reform before a reconciliation between the two houses of parliament and a final vote by the national assembly expected wednesday .
sarkozy popularity suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has n't been able to stop protests - or his sinking approval sarkozy 's government insists that the pension reform , which will raise the minimum retirement age to 62 from 60 , is " inevitable " and the only way to fill an expected pension budget gap and reduce the country 's growing deficit .
but the opposition socialists say if they win presidential elections in 2012 , their candidate will restore the retirement age to 60 .
polls suggest a majority of french voters support or sympathize with the strikers , but jean-francois cope , leader of sarkozy 's ump party in parliament , blamed the widespread disruption on the work of a minority .
" strikes , protests , yes , but taking the economy hostage is intolerable , " he said in an interview with le parisien newspaper .
" most of the country is paralyzed by the actions of a handful of extremists .
everyone should understand that we have no other choice . "
as the unpopular pension reform plan moves closer to becoming law , sarkozy 's approval rating has dropped to an all-time low , dashing hopes that the legislative achievement could bring him a political comeback .
a poll conducted by the ifop institute and published in the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday showed only 29 percent of respondents were satisfied with sarkozy 's job performance .
that was down three points from september , and was a new low for the president since he took office in 2007 .
sarkozy and his allies are hoping that the ongoing protest and strike movement in opposition to the pension reform will die down as families leave their homes for the mid-term school holiday this week .

the website revealed some 400,000 confidential documents on the iraq war . british deputy prime minister nick clegg called sunday for an investigation into allegations against the british military found in iraq war documents leaked by whistle-blowing wikileaks .
the website on friday published some 400,000 confidential documents on the war in iraq , which suggest negligence on the part of uk military in several cases of civilian death and torture .
" we can bemoan how these leaks occurred , but i think the nature of the allegations made are extraordinarily serious .
they are distressing to read about and they are very serious , " clegg told the bbc in an interview .
condemning wikileaks the comments came after britain 's ministry of defense joined the pentagon in condemning the release of the classified documents , saying they could put the lives of british soldiers at risk .
wikileaks ' publication of the documents will make the job of british and allied troops " more difficult and more dangerous , " the ministry said saturday .
the documents , which wikileaks founder julian assange said reveal 15,000 more civilian deaths than were previously known about , will put britain in a difficult legal position , according to a solicitor working on behalf of iraqis who claim abuse by british forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy pm clegg called for an investigation phil shiner , of public interest lawyers , said there was a " huge and growing body of evidence about the killing , ill treatment and torture of iraqis while in uk custody . "
" some of these deaths will be in circumstances where the uk -lsb- has -rsb- a clear legal responsibility , " he added .
despite condemning publication of the leaked files , the ministry of defense said in a statement that it would " consider " the information if it revealed any new evidence .
denmark vows to scour documents meanwhile , denmark 's military announced sunday it would carefully study the leaked documents to see if they revealed any wrongdoing by danish soldiers . " we want to see the documents for ourselves and compare them to our own information , " said danish defense command spokesman torben kjedsen . danish defense minister gitte lillelund bech said she was pleased with the decision , although danish media report the files reveal negligence on the part of danish soldiers in cases where prisoners were tortured by iraqi police .
us and uk ' turned a blind eye ' british newspaper the guardian , which had the documents in advance of their publication , said the leaks showed " us authorities failed to investigate hundreds of reports of abuse , torture , rape and even murder by iraqi police and soldiers whose conduct appears to be systematic and normally unpunished . " " us and uk officials have insisted that no official record of civilian casualties exists but the logs record 66,081 non-combatant deaths out of a total of 109,000 fatalities , " the newspaper stated . the guardian speculated that wikileaks had received the material from the " same dissident us army intelligence analyst " who leaked material on afghanistan , which the site published in july .
wikileaks , however , has not revealed its source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange said the documents revealed war crimes wikileaks founder defends the release julian assange defended his site 's release of confidential documents against condemnation from us and uk authorities , saying " this disclosure is about the truth . "
" the first casualty of war is the truth .
we hope to correct some of that attack on the truth that occurred before the war , during the war , and which has continued on since the war officially concluded , " he said .
assange said the documents showed evidence of war crimes .
he also told al jazeera television the documents provided enough material for 40 wrongful killing lawsuits .
" the lessons of iraq can be applied to afghanistan and to other countries western governments may choose to invade , " said assange , who vowed to continue publishing leaked documents .
the death toll in iraq now stands at 150,000 , 80 percent of which were civilians , according to the organization iraq body count , which cooperated in the analysis of the released material .
the civilian deaths revealed by the leaked documents occurred as a result of " small incidents " occurring daily during the conflict , the organization 's head , john sloboda , said .
he added that the vast majority of civilian deaths had been caused by " internal violence " among iraqi factions .

at the very latest , since abu ghraib , the international community had come to the realization that the war in iraq was a ‘ dirty war ' .
there were killings .
there was torture .
mercenaries operated as brutal aggressors .
shi 'ites and sunnis took turns massacring each other .
that one of the most barbarous dictators was overthrown in the process has practically been forgotten .
instead , the image of a dirty war has now been even more enduringly anchored in our collective consciousness .
thanks to the disclosures made by wikileaks , we have perhaps been given a more accurate insight into the course of events and a more precise figure on the brutal human rights violations and number of deaths .
according to the files , more than 150,000 people were killed in iraq between 2004 and 2009 , if we can believe the documents from us military sources . # b # documents appear to be credible can we believe them ?
yes , we can .
the documents appear , in principle , to be credible .
however , it is important to treat them for what they are : one source among many , and a one-sided one at that , originally intended for internal , domestic consumption .
not everything in these documents can be characterized as a bitter truth intended to be camouflaged from public view .
this or that bit of information could be a half truth or ‘ pseudo-fact ' ; for example , when the person reporting draws the wrong conclusions due to their subjective perspective , or wishes to hide personal lapses or errors from superiors .
few things in life are more regularly “ air brushed ” or openly manipulated than reports to supervising superiors , and this is very probably no different for the us army in iraq .
wikileaks also needs monitoring critical questions , therefore , are certainly permissible : did wikileaks do everything possible when vetting the documents to ensure that no human lives will be put at risk ?
we can only hope and wait .
and , by the way : where are the checks and balances on wikileaks ?
the group is going to have to accept questions like these - just as traditional mass media or outlets like facebook and youtube have done - in view of the fact that its political muscle has grown significantly .
they all shoulder a major responsibility , without ever having been elected .
of course , it also depends on who is asking the question and with what motive .
the criticism of wikileaks , expressed by washington and baghdad , is hypocritical .
both are concerned about their reputations .
us president barack obama only appears to be in a comfortable position .
he can not really sit back and claim that all the missteps and consequences are the fault of his predecessor , george w. bush .
in the selective perceptions of many people – and not just in the arab world – the united states is once again on the pillory .
files dicey for iraqi leader the publication of the documents , however , is just as much of a blow to iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki .
he now stands there in public as a political leader who condones torture , including the abuse of supporters of political and religious groups , whom , for the last seven months , he has been trying to win over as coalition partners in a new government .
not surprisingly , al-maliki suspects intrigue behind the wikileak revelations .
he knows that the publication of new , shocking details could cost him his political career .
in as far as the documents are not proven to be forgeries or seriously flawed – for which there is no evidence at the moment – then the blame for them lies with him and george w. bush – and not with wikileaks .
as with vietnam decades ago , the same holds true for the war in iraq today : dirty details need to be thoroughly evaluated and dirty truths brought to light with no holds barred .
the people of iraq , in particular , deserve nothing less .

one has panicked and fired its coach , the other plans to stay the course . in the bundesliga , if you go six straight games without a win , or have only one three-pointer to your credit nine games into the season , you are liable to get fired .
like stuttgart 's ex-coach christian gross before him , fc cologne 's zvonimir soldo learned that lesson on sunday .
the billy goats parted ways with their croatian coach of a year-and-a-half at roughly the same time that they landed in last place , courtesy of the former cellar-dwellers stuttgart 's win over st. pauli .
now , news of a last place club sacking its coach rarely comes as a surprise , but when viewed alongside the goings on at another presently hapless club , borussia moenchengladbach , cologne 's move to let soldo go seems rash .
perhaps cologne can learn a lesson from their old rival .
gladbach is one rung higher up the bundesliga ladder than cologne at the moment , with six points from nine matches , but that does n't really tell the whole story .
the foals are , if anything , looking even worse than cologne at the moment .
the awfulness of gladbach 's defense is threatening to take on historic proportion .
with 27 goals allowed thus far , they are very nearly on pace to break tasmania berlin 's record of 108 for the season - a record that has stood for 45 years , and one that most assumed would never , ever be broken .
still , michael frontzeck is not out of a job .
the coach is scarcely even looking over his shoulder , and the fans are standing behind him .
deep-running roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- has been a loyal soldier at borussia moenchengladbach that he is sitting as pretty as he is , even in the midst of gladbach 's ugly form , is mostly down to his roots .
frontzeck 's managerial record - not only at gladbach , but in his prior stints at aachen and bielefeld as well - has been patchy .
but he was born in moenchengladbach , played nine seasons in three stints with the club , and understands how much borussia means to its fans .
frontzeck showed guts , and demonstrated how well he knows his club , after saturday 's humbling home loss to bremen .
gladbach 's hardcore support was baying for blood after the 4-1 loss , and many a manager would have tuned the jeers out and headed for the locker room .
frontzeck , though , saw an opportunity to circle the wagons , and climbed into the stands to hold an impromptu 15-minute question-and-answer session .
afterward , he told reporters that it had been a " comfortable conversation , " and not at all one where fans were " just looking for someone to blame . "
“ we all agreed that we can only get out of this situation together , ” he said .
“ that the fans are standing behind us is a good feeling . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiny bald head in the middle of this picture ?
that 's frontzeck the contrast with cologne could not be starker .
soldo came to the club as a rising managerial star , on the back of a croatian title with dinamo zagreb , but also as an outsider - one who seemed miscast from the start , in that he never seemed to care about the club 's history or understand the club 's special relationship to its fans .
history 's burden perhaps more than any other clubs in the bundesliga , cologne and gladbach supporters are obsessed with history .
that 's because it 's just about all they 've got . gladbach 's rich past is well-known .
they won five league titles in the 1970s , and made it to another five european finals in that golden era for german football .
for many years , though , cologne too fielded a consistently good team .
in the first quarter-century of the bundesliga , the billy goats won the league twice and finished in the top eight all but four times .
then , in the 1990s , things began to fall apart at both clubs .
cologne finished second in 1990 , and made it to the german cup final in 1991 .
gladbach won the cup in 1995 .
since then , no titles at all , for either club .
moreover , gladbach has been relegated twice , and cologne four times in the past 13 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the haircuts show it 's been some time since cologne were in a cup final falling so far , so fast , and so hard has brought on a certain delusion among both sets of fans .
the older ones still think of their club as big and important , and the younger supporters have grown up in their elders ' echo chamber , weaned on the glories of yesteryear and expectant of a return to glory any minute now .
both clubs attract tens of thousands of fans to home matches irrespective of the side 's current form , and both are followed assiduously in the local press - who are only too happy to talk up a finish in the european places after two wins in a row , and call two straight losses a crisis .
the fishbowl atmosphere can overwhelm a coach who 's not prepared to play along , as the aggressively mild-mannered soldo never was .
but for a coach who 's " one of their own , " like frontzeck or christoph daum in his recent run at cologne , it 's a perfect fit - even if they do n't win anything .
holding fast supporters seem to have determined that the base price of entry to coaching at their club is genuflection at the altar of tradition , a sort of fundamentalist fandom that seeks to purify the club of corrosive outside influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer 's cologne bona fides are unquestioned in this respect , cologne 's interim coach frank schaefer is off to a stellar start .
he has never led a senior side before , but fan darling lukas podolski pronounced his onetime youth team coach " a cologne man through and through . "
-lrb- it 's true - the 46-year-old schaefer has been working as a youth or reserve team coach at cologne for 20 of the past 26 years . -rrb-
for good measure , schaefer himself opened his maiden press conference by stating that he was " a cologne lad and fc guy too . "
he also chose as his assistant coach dirk lottner , a cologne native who played six seasons at the club and has worked with schaefer in the youth system since retiring in 2007 .
cologne 's local tabloid express cooed that " you ca n't get much more cologne than that ! "
the club says it 's not ruling out a higher-profile hire , but holding onto schaefer for a while at least has to be the best play at the moment .
the fans want cologne natives on the touchline , and so they shall have them .
let 's hope they can coach a little as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 25.10.2010 hochtief seeks overseas allies in takeover battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief workers fear a buyout will cost them their jobs following the german government 's decision not to step in and help hochtief stave off a hostile takeover bid from spanish rival acs , the construction giant has begun looking for help further afield . until last week , essen-based hochtief had been hopeful that the german government would protect it from a takeover bid by spain 's actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- , by changing existing securities laws .
but no such luck .
economics minister rainer bruederle said that although he would like to see the company 's headquarters remain on german turf , he was not willing to intervene in the market process .
and chancellor angela merkel agreed on both counts .
that was the end of that , but not the end of the story .
on sunday , germany 's weekly news magazine der spiegel reported that hochtief is now in talks with qatar , thanks , no less , to mrs merkel .
a spokeswoman for the coveted construction company told reporters that during an industry leaders dinner at berlin 's presidential palace , the german chancellor had taken the opportunity to introduce hochtief chief executive herbert luetkestratkoetter to the qatari economics minister .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel does not want to see hochtief split up should qatar decide to get on board with its sovereign wealth fund , it would be as a ' white-knight ' investor , a role it has played in the past for the volkswagen group .
australian assistance but hochtief is not leaving its fate solely in the lap of the middle east .
the company is also looking to australia , home of its hugely successful subsidiary leighton holdings , to bolster its defenses .
last week , the german company applied to the australian takeovers panel to try and force acs to make a fully priced bid for outstanding shares in leighton , which contributes some 80 percent of hochtief 's total earnings and is therefore particularly attractive to the heavily indebted spanish bidder .
on monday , leighton upped the pressure by making its own application to the panel to block the all-share bid on the grounds that it would rob the company of its independence .
" although hochtief owns 54.5 percent of leighton , leighton is not in the normal position of a controlled ' downstream ' entity , " leighton chairman david mortimer said in a statement .
under the current governance arrangements between the german company and its australian subsidiary , leighton has an independent board and management .
protecting minority shareholders furthermore mortimer said that to allow a takeover by acs - which currently holds a 29 percent stake in hochtief - without a commitment to retain leighton 's independence status or any obligation to make a cash bid for the subsidiary would not be in the interests of shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is looking to australian regulators for support " leighton 's independent directors are concerned that german takeover law does not provide the same level of protection for the interests of minority shareholders that investors expect of companies listed on the australian securities exchange , " he said .
the australian takeovers panel has three weeks to decide whether the spanish bid for hochtief is in actual fact a bid for leighton , and whether minority shareholders would be disadvantaged a successful takeover .
if the regulators find in favor of leighton , it could double the money acs would need to buy a controlling stake in the german company .

a rapid border intervention team is expected to be deployed . a rapid intervention team from the eu border agency , frontex , will be deployed for the first time to greece to help shore up the country 's porous border with turkey , the european commission has said in a statement .
the move comes after greece put out an emergency call for the border team , which is to act under greek authority .
eu internal affairs commissioner cecilia malmstroem said she had " immediately activated the mechanism to liaise with frontex and to communicate among all interested partners , so as to handle this emergency situation in the most expeditious and efficient way . "
" the situation at the greek land border with turkey is increasingly worrying , " she said .
" the flows of people crossing the border irregularly have reached alarming proportions and greece is manifestly not able to face this situation alone … i am very concerned about the humanitarian situation . "

un special rapporteur on torture manfred nowak described conditions inside greece 's overcrowded detention centers as " inhumane . "
an overwhelming majority of the refugees use greece as an entry point to other european union countries , and arrivals by land have increased by more than a third in a year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 25.10.2010 anti-piracy measures for sale in hamburg großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naval forces are often called to rescue hijacked cargo vessels the hijacking of two ships over the weekend highlights the difficulties western navies face combating piracy off the coast of somalia .
many shipping lines are turning to private security firms for protection . when it comes to global shipping , there is no avoiding the gulf of aden , which leads between the failed state of somalia and yemen - a nation security analysts describe as at-risk .
these waters carry a significant share of the world 's wealth , including 11 percent of the world 's seaborne oil .
the 25,000 cargo ships that pass through the gulf of aden every year are tempting targets for heavily armed groups in somalia , who claim overfishing by foreign vessels has robbed them of their livelihoods . earlier this year the international maritime bureau warned that attacks on merchant shipping are on the rise .
european defense officials say somali pirates are currently holding 20 ships and more than 400 crew for ransom off the horn of africa .
more attacks , more attention with media attention snowballing and insurance premiums sky-rocketing , more and more shipping companies are turning to private security firms for protection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some companies believe there is little political will to deal with piracy one of them is international bodyguard and security agency -lrb- ibs -rrb- - a company founded by horst ruetten , formally of the german navy .
from his office in the port city of hamburg , ruetten delivers an impressive sales pitch : " we offer everything from risk assessment for ships through to advice about equipment – razor-wire and bullet-proof blankets , everything that can help protect the crew - all the way to training . "
ruetten also sends out teams of between five and seven men to guard the ships personally .
they are armed with what he describes as " lethal " and / or " non-lethal " weapons , depending on the shipping company 's wishes .
these teams cost several thousand euros a day .
operation atalanta there is of course a state military presence off the coast of somalia – operation atalanta , the official eu naval mission that occasionally makes the news when it storms hijacked ships and arrests pirates .
but juergen strohsal , of the hamburg-based cargo brokering company teutonia , says that the political will behind this intervention is too weak .
" there is support , but not sufficient , " he told deutsche welle .
" there are no results .
if they get some of the pirates , no-one really punishes them , and they come back in force .
i think the politicians have to do more about this , especially in our country . "
horst ruetten agrees , and points out something seldom mentioned in media reports about captured pirates : atalanta 's official mission is to protect world food program ships carrying aid to africa .
it is not meant to be a nautical police force for the gulf of aden , and generally intervenes only once a hijacking has taken place .
this has undoubtedly had a preventative effect , but prevention is not its purpose .
" in the anti-piracy conferences that happen every now and then , a lot of atalanta spokesmen have told shipping companies ' you have to do something about it .
we ca n't be everywhere at once , " ' ruetten says .
" so the shipping companies have to ask themselves what they can do .
that does n't happen enough . "
bildunterschrift : operation atalanta 's mission is to protect food shipments to somalia all mannequins on deck !
a recent survey of 110 german shipping companies by pwc -lrb- formerly pricewaterhouse coopers -rrb- found that 12 used private security agencies in some capacity .
ruetten believes this is not nearly enough , and that too many companies rely on improvised defense measures like strapping mannequins to strategic positions on deck to make a ship look like it is being guarded .
but the official line in the shipping industry is very cautious .
max johns , spokesman for the association of german ship-owners -lrb- vdr -rrb- , says that shipping companies are advised not introduce armed escorts on to their ships .
" by the law of the sea , only military personnel should act against pirates .
that is the first point , " johns says . " secondly we do n't know these private security teams .
we do n't know how good they are , and we do n't who to trust and who not to trust .
they might have a fire-fight with the pirates - our crews are not trained to act in a military or semi-military conflict . "
the fear is that if a security guard killed an innocent somali fisherman , it would cause a damaging legal headache for the shipping industry .
johns also questions how effective mercenaries really are when push comes to shove .
" they have n't proven successful , " he says .
" there were quite a few of those teams on board ships , and we had some incidents when those ships were boarded by pirates , and those people did n't help at all . " " " they did n't make any difference .
they even jumped overboard , because they did n't want to get caught by pirates , and they were picked up then later out of the water by the navy . "
johns is optimistic that vulnerable merchant vessels will soon have eu military personnel on board , but until then ruetten and his team of professionals will continue making profits by running the gauntlet in the gulf of aden .

the website revealed some 400,000 confidential documents on the iraq war . british deputy prime minister nick clegg called sunday for an investigation into allegations against the british military found in iraq war documents leaked by whistle-blowing wikileaks .
the website on friday published some 400,000 confidential documents on the war in iraq , which suggest negligence on the part of uk military in several cases of civilian death and torture .
" we can bemoan how these leaks occurred , but i think the nature of the allegations made are extraordinarily serious .
they are distressing to read about and they are very serious , " clegg told the bbc in an interview .
condemning wikileaks the comments came after britain 's ministry of defense joined the pentagon in condemning the release of the classified documents , saying they could put the lives of british soldiers at risk .
wikileaks ' publication of the documents will make the job of british and allied troops " more difficult and more dangerous , " the ministry said saturday .
the documents , which wikileaks founder julian assange said reveal 15,000 more civilian deaths than were previously known about , will put britain in a difficult legal position , according to a solicitor working on behalf of iraqis who claim abuse by british forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy pm clegg called for an investigation phil shiner , of public interest lawyers , said there was a " huge and growing body of evidence about the killing , ill treatment and torture of iraqis while in uk custody . "
" some of these deaths will be in circumstances where the uk -lsb- has -rsb- a clear legal responsibility , " he added .
despite condemning publication of the leaked files , the ministry of defense said in a statement that it would " consider " the information if it revealed any new evidence .
denmark vows to scour documents meanwhile , denmark 's military announced sunday it would carefully study the leaked documents to see if they revealed any wrongdoing by danish soldiers . " we want to see the documents for ourselves and compare them to our own information , " said danish defense command spokesman torben kjedsen . danish defense minister gitte lillelund bech said she was pleased with the decision , although danish media report the files reveal negligence on the part of danish soldiers in cases where prisoners were tortured by iraqi police .
us and uk ' turned a blind eye ' british newspaper the guardian , which had the documents in advance of their publication , said the leaks showed " us authorities failed to investigate hundreds of reports of abuse , torture , rape and even murder by iraqi police and soldiers whose conduct appears to be systematic and normally unpunished . " " us and uk officials have insisted that no official record of civilian casualties exists but the logs record 66,081 non-combatant deaths out of a total of 109,000 fatalities , " the newspaper stated . the guardian speculated that wikileaks had received the material from the " same dissident us army intelligence analyst " who leaked material on afghanistan , which the site published in july .
wikileaks , however , has not revealed its source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange said the documents revealed war crimes wikileaks founder defends the release julian assange defended his site 's release of confidential documents against condemnation from us and uk authorities , saying " this disclosure is about the truth . "
" the first casualty of war is the truth .
we hope to correct some of that attack on the truth that occurred before the war , during the war , and which has continued on since the war officially concluded , " he said .
assange said the documents showed evidence of war crimes .
he also told al jazeera television the documents provided enough material for 40 wrongful killing lawsuits .
" the lessons of iraq can be applied to afghanistan and to other countries western governments may choose to invade , " said assange , who vowed to continue publishing leaked documents .
the death toll in iraq now stands at 150,000 , 80 percent of which were civilians , according to the organization iraq body count , which cooperated in the analysis of the released material .
the civilian deaths revealed by the leaked documents occurred as a result of " small incidents " occurring daily during the conflict , the organization 's head , john sloboda , said .
he added that the vast majority of civilian deaths had been caused by " internal violence " among iraqi factions .

protecting minority shareholders furthermore mortimer said that to allow a takeover by acs - which currently holds a 29 percent stake in hochtief - without a commitment to retain leighton 's independence status or any obligation to make a cash bid for the subsidiary would not be in the interests of shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is looking to australian regulators for support " leighton 's independent directors are concerned that german takeover law does not provide the same level of protection for the interests of minority shareholders that investors expect of companies listed on the australian securities exchange , " he said .
the australian takeovers panel has three weeks to decide whether the spanish bid for hochtief is in actual fact a bid for leighton , and whether minority shareholders would be disadvantaged a successful takeover .
if the regulators find in favor of leighton , it could double the money acs would need to buy a controlling stake in the german company .

some 200 protestors seized control of the depot at fos-sur-mer , believed to be the largest in southern france , as riot police looked on , according to news agency agence-presse france .
meanwhile , a depot in central france , at saint-pierre-des corps , was freed after a week of paralysis when around 30 demonstrators walked away from the site without incident .
strikes in the country 's oil industry and blockades of fuel depots have left 35 percent of gas stations in the paris area completely dry or out of at least one kind of fuel , a transport ministry spokeswoman said .
about one-third of gas stations in western france were in " real difficulty " and 10 to 15 percent in the rest of the country were empty , she added .
unions have already called for two more days of strikes , and university students are planning nationwide marches on tuesday in last-ditch efforts to stop the pension reform before a reconciliation between the two houses of parliament and a final vote by the national assembly expected wednesday .
sarkozy popularity suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has n't been able to stop protests - or his sinking approval sarkozy 's government insists that the pension reform , which will raise the minimum retirement age to 62 from 60 , is " inevitable " and the only way to fill an expected pension budget gap and reduce the country 's growing deficit .
but the opposition socialists say if they win presidential elections in 2012 , their candidate will restore the retirement age to 60 .
polls suggest a majority of french voters support or sympathize with the strikers , but jean-francois cope , leader of sarkozy 's ump party in parliament , blamed the widespread disruption on the work of a minority .
" strikes , protests , yes , but taking the economy hostage is intolerable , " he said in an interview with le parisien newspaper .
" most of the country is paralyzed by the actions of a handful of extremists .
everyone should understand that we have no other choice . "
as the unpopular pension reform plan moves closer to becoming law , sarkozy 's approval rating has dropped to an all-time low , dashing hopes that the legislative achievement could bring him a political comeback .
a poll conducted by the ifop institute and published in the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday showed only 29 percent of respondents were satisfied with sarkozy 's job performance .
that was down three points from september , and was a new low for the president since he took office in 2007 .
sarkozy and his allies are hoping that the ongoing protest and strike movement in opposition to the pension reform will die down as families leave their homes for the mid-term school holiday this week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 25.10.2010 two venerable clubs chart divergent courses out of crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer is the new man in the cologne hot seat fc cologne and borussia moenchengladbach are both off to disastrous starts in the bundesliga .
one has panicked and fired its coach , the other plans to stay the course . in the bundesliga , if you go six straight games without a win , or have only one three-pointer to your credit nine games into the season , you are liable to get fired .
like stuttgart 's ex-coach christian gross before him , fc cologne 's zvonimir soldo learned that lesson on sunday .
the billy goats parted ways with their croatian coach of a year-and-a-half at roughly the same time that they landed in last place , courtesy of the former cellar-dwellers stuttgart 's win over st. pauli .
now , news of a last place club sacking its coach rarely comes as a surprise , but when viewed alongside the goings on at another presently hapless club , borussia moenchengladbach , cologne 's move to let soldo go seems rash .
perhaps cologne can learn a lesson from their old rival .
gladbach is one rung higher up the bundesliga ladder than cologne at the moment , with six points from nine matches , but that does n't really tell the whole story .
the foals are , if anything , looking even worse than cologne at the moment .
the awfulness of gladbach 's defense is threatening to take on historic proportion .
with 27 goals allowed thus far , they are very nearly on pace to break tasmania berlin 's record of 108 for the season - a record that has stood for 45 years , and one that most assumed would never , ever be broken .
still , michael frontzeck is not out of a job .
the coach is scarcely even looking over his shoulder , and the fans are standing behind him .
deep-running roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- has been a loyal soldier at borussia moenchengladbach that he is sitting as pretty as he is , even in the midst of gladbach 's ugly form , is mostly down to his roots .
frontzeck 's managerial record - not only at gladbach , but in his prior stints at aachen and bielefeld as well - has been patchy .
but he was born in moenchengladbach , played nine seasons in three stints with the club , and understands how much borussia means to its fans .
frontzeck showed guts , and demonstrated how well he knows his club , after saturday 's humbling home loss to bremen .
gladbach 's hardcore support was baying for blood after the 4-1 loss , and many a manager would have tuned the jeers out and headed for the locker room .
frontzeck , though , saw an opportunity to circle the wagons , and climbed into the stands to hold an impromptu 15-minute question-and-answer session .
afterward , he told reporters that it had been a " comfortable conversation , " and not at all one where fans were " just looking for someone to blame . "
“ we all agreed that we can only get out of this situation together , ” he said .
“ that the fans are standing behind us is a good feeling . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiny bald head in the middle of this picture ?
that 's frontzeck the contrast with cologne could not be starker .
soldo came to the club as a rising managerial star , on the back of a croatian title with dinamo zagreb , but also as an outsider - one who seemed miscast from the start , in that he never seemed to care about the club 's history or understand the club 's special relationship to its fans .
history 's burden perhaps more than any other clubs in the bundesliga , cologne and gladbach supporters are obsessed with history .
that 's because it 's just about all they 've got . gladbach 's rich past is well-known .
they won five league titles in the 1970s , and made it to another five european finals in that golden era for german football .
for many years , though , cologne too fielded a consistently good team .
in the first quarter-century of the bundesliga , the billy goats won the league twice and finished in the top eight all but four times .
then , in the 1990s , things began to fall apart at both clubs .
cologne finished second in 1990 , and made it to the german cup final in 1991 .
gladbach won the cup in 1995 .
since then , no titles at all , for either club .
moreover , gladbach has been relegated twice , and cologne four times in the past 13 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the haircuts show it 's been some time since cologne were in a cup final falling so far , so fast , and so hard has brought on a certain delusion among both sets of fans .
the older ones still think of their club as big and important , and the younger supporters have grown up in their elders ' echo chamber , weaned on the glories of yesteryear and expectant of a return to glory any minute now .
both clubs attract tens of thousands of fans to home matches irrespective of the side 's current form , and both are followed assiduously in the local press - who are only too happy to talk up a finish in the european places after two wins in a row , and call two straight losses a crisis .
the fishbowl atmosphere can overwhelm a coach who 's not prepared to play along , as the aggressively mild-mannered soldo never was .
but for a coach who 's " one of their own , " like frontzeck or christoph daum in his recent run at cologne , it 's a perfect fit - even if they do n't win anything .
holding fast supporters seem to have determined that the base price of entry to coaching at their club is genuflection at the altar of tradition , a sort of fundamentalist fandom that seeks to purify the club of corrosive outside influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer 's cologne bona fides are unquestioned in this respect , cologne 's interim coach frank schaefer is off to a stellar start .
he has never led a senior side before , but fan darling lukas podolski pronounced his onetime youth team coach " a cologne man through and through . "
-lrb- it 's true - the 46-year-old schaefer has been working as a youth or reserve team coach at cologne for 20 of the past 26 years . -rrb-
for good measure , schaefer himself opened his maiden press conference by stating that he was " a cologne lad and fc guy too . "
he also chose as his assistant coach dirk lottner , a cologne native who played six seasons at the club and has worked with schaefer in the youth system since retiring in 2007 .
cologne 's local tabloid express cooed that " you ca n't get much more cologne than that ! "
the club says it 's not ruling out a higher-profile hire , but holding onto schaefer for a while at least has to be the best play at the moment .
the fans want cologne natives on the touchline , and so they shall have them .
let 's hope they can coach a little as well .

one has panicked and fired its coach , the other plans to stay the course . in the bundesliga , if you go six straight games without a win , or have only one three-pointer to your credit nine games into the season , you are liable to get fired .
like stuttgart 's ex-coach christian gross before him , fc cologne 's zvonimir soldo learned that lesson on sunday .
the billy goats parted ways with their croatian coach of a year-and-a-half at roughly the same time that they landed in last place , courtesy of the former cellar-dwellers stuttgart 's win over st. pauli .
now , news of a last place club sacking its coach rarely comes as a surprise , but when viewed alongside the goings on at another presently hapless club , borussia moenchengladbach , cologne 's move to let soldo go seems rash .
perhaps cologne can learn a lesson from their old rival .
gladbach is one rung higher up the bundesliga ladder than cologne at the moment , with six points from nine matches , but that does n't really tell the whole story .
the foals are , if anything , looking even worse than cologne at the moment .
the awfulness of gladbach 's defense is threatening to take on historic proportion .
with 27 goals allowed thus far , they are very nearly on pace to break tasmania berlin 's record of 108 for the season - a record that has stood for 45 years , and one that most assumed would never , ever be broken .
still , michael frontzeck is not out of a job .
the coach is scarcely even looking over his shoulder , and the fans are standing behind him .
deep-running roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- has been a loyal soldier at borussia moenchengladbach that he is sitting as pretty as he is , even in the midst of gladbach 's ugly form , is mostly down to his roots .
frontzeck 's managerial record - not only at gladbach , but in his prior stints at aachen and bielefeld as well - has been patchy .
but he was born in moenchengladbach , played nine seasons in three stints with the club , and understands how much borussia means to its fans .
frontzeck showed guts , and demonstrated how well he knows his club , after saturday 's humbling home loss to bremen .
gladbach 's hardcore support was baying for blood after the 4-1 loss , and many a manager would have tuned the jeers out and headed for the locker room .
frontzeck , though , saw an opportunity to circle the wagons , and climbed into the stands to hold an impromptu 15-minute question-and-answer session .
afterward , he told reporters that it had been a " comfortable conversation , " and not at all one where fans were " just looking for someone to blame . "
“ we all agreed that we can only get out of this situation together , ” he said .
“ that the fans are standing behind us is a good feeling . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiny bald head in the middle of this picture ?
that 's frontzeck the contrast with cologne could not be starker .
soldo came to the club as a rising managerial star , on the back of a croatian title with dinamo zagreb , but also as an outsider - one who seemed miscast from the start , in that he never seemed to care about the club 's history or understand the club 's special relationship to its fans .
history 's burden perhaps more than any other clubs in the bundesliga , cologne and gladbach supporters are obsessed with history .
that 's because it 's just about all they 've got . gladbach 's rich past is well-known .
they won five league titles in the 1970s , and made it to another five european finals in that golden era for german football .
for many years , though , cologne too fielded a consistently good team .
in the first quarter-century of the bundesliga , the billy goats won the league twice and finished in the top eight all but four times .
then , in the 1990s , things began to fall apart at both clubs .
cologne finished second in 1990 , and made it to the german cup final in 1991 .
gladbach won the cup in 1995 .
since then , no titles at all , for either club .
moreover , gladbach has been relegated twice , and cologne four times in the past 13 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the haircuts show it 's been some time since cologne were in a cup final falling so far , so fast , and so hard has brought on a certain delusion among both sets of fans .
the older ones still think of their club as big and important , and the younger supporters have grown up in their elders ' echo chamber , weaned on the glories of yesteryear and expectant of a return to glory any minute now .
both clubs attract tens of thousands of fans to home matches irrespective of the side 's current form , and both are followed assiduously in the local press - who are only too happy to talk up a finish in the european places after two wins in a row , and call two straight losses a crisis .
the fishbowl atmosphere can overwhelm a coach who 's not prepared to play along , as the aggressively mild-mannered soldo never was .
but for a coach who 's " one of their own , " like frontzeck or christoph daum in his recent run at cologne , it 's a perfect fit - even if they do n't win anything .
holding fast supporters seem to have determined that the base price of entry to coaching at their club is genuflection at the altar of tradition , a sort of fundamentalist fandom that seeks to purify the club of corrosive outside influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer 's cologne bona fides are unquestioned in this respect , cologne 's interim coach frank schaefer is off to a stellar start .
he has never led a senior side before , but fan darling lukas podolski pronounced his onetime youth team coach " a cologne man through and through . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 25.10.2010 hochtief seeks overseas allies in takeover battle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief workers fear a buyout will cost them their jobs following the german government 's decision not to step in and help hochtief stave off a hostile takeover bid from spanish rival acs , the construction giant has begun looking for help further afield . until last week , essen-based hochtief had been hopeful that the german government would protect it from a takeover bid by spain 's actividades de construccion y servicios -lrb- acs -rrb- , by changing existing securities laws .
but no such luck .
economics minister rainer bruederle said that although he would like to see the company 's headquarters remain on german turf , he was not willing to intervene in the market process .
and chancellor angela merkel agreed on both counts .
that was the end of that , but not the end of the story .
on sunday , germany 's weekly news magazine der spiegel reported that hochtief is now in talks with qatar , thanks , no less , to mrs merkel .
a spokeswoman for the coveted construction company told reporters that during an industry leaders dinner at berlin 's presidential palace , the german chancellor had taken the opportunity to introduce hochtief chief executive herbert luetkestratkoetter to the qatari economics minister .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel does not want to see hochtief split up should qatar decide to get on board with its sovereign wealth fund , it would be as a ' white-knight ' investor , a role it has played in the past for the volkswagen group .
australian assistance but hochtief is not leaving its fate solely in the lap of the middle east .
the company is also looking to australia , home of its hugely successful subsidiary leighton holdings , to bolster its defenses .
last week , the german company applied to the australian takeovers panel to try and force acs to make a fully priced bid for outstanding shares in leighton , which contributes some 80 percent of hochtief 's total earnings and is therefore particularly attractive to the heavily indebted spanish bidder .
on monday , leighton upped the pressure by making its own application to the panel to block the all-share bid on the grounds that it would rob the company of its independence .
" although hochtief owns 54.5 percent of leighton , leighton is not in the normal position of a controlled ' downstream ' entity , " leighton chairman david mortimer said in a statement .
under the current governance arrangements between the german company and its australian subsidiary , leighton has an independent board and management .
protecting minority shareholders furthermore mortimer said that to allow a takeover by acs - which currently holds a 29 percent stake in hochtief - without a commitment to retain leighton 's independence status or any obligation to make a cash bid for the subsidiary would not be in the interests of shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is looking to australian regulators for support " leighton 's independent directors are concerned that german takeover law does not provide the same level of protection for the interests of minority shareholders that investors expect of companies listed on the australian securities exchange , " he said .
the australian takeovers panel has three weeks to decide whether the spanish bid for hochtief is in actual fact a bid for leighton , and whether minority shareholders would be disadvantaged a successful takeover .
if the regulators find in favor of leighton , it could double the money acs would need to buy a controlling stake in the german company .

both factions of the hurriyat conference have called for a boycott of their first visit to the kashmir valley . the decision to have a group of interlocutors was originally part of an eight-point initiative announced by the indian government to engage with the people of jammu and kashmir and move forward to find a solution to the crisis . the group , which has a one-year mandate and will report after monthly trips to the valley , is supposed to cover views from all three regions of jammu , ladakh and kashmir . the three-member team of dilip padgaonkar , radha kumar and m.m. ansari - a journalist , an academic and an educationist – was set up earlier this month in the wake of renewed unrest in the kashmir valley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hurriyat conference leader syed ali shah geelani has called on delhi to accept his five-point proposal " we will engage with every section of opinion , " dilip padgaonkar explained .
" why do we have this dialogue ?
so that we can have a permanent comprehensive political settlement to the kashmir dispute .
that has to be tried out .
it is a complex problem . " separatists refuse to meet interlocutors however , the interlocutors have got a somewhat hostile reception , with the separatists refusing to meet them . an ardent supporter of the state 's merger with pakistan , hard-line hurriyat conference leader syed ali shah geelani said dialogue with new delhi would only be possible if the government accepted his five-point proposal that includes accepting kashmir as an international dispute . mirwaiz umar farooq , who heads another faction of the conference , described the appointment of the interlocutors as a mere wastage of time .
he said that the lingering dispute should be resolved through tripartite talks between pakistan , india and the " real " kashmiri leadership . pessimism about group 's success nonetheless , the team tried to get on with the task at hand , interacting with young people , visiting jails , calling on politicians , and also praying for the success of their mission at the holy muslim shrine of hazratbal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interlocutors want to talk with all sections of society including angry youths iqbal nazir , a lecturer at the amir singh college in srinagar , was not very optimistic : " this does not seem like a healthy initiative taken by india given that we have seen commissions and working groups being created before .
their recommendations did not reach any conclusion .
and these interlocutors seem to be meeting the same fate . " for sana altaf , an educationist , the prospects seemed equally bleak : " the visit of the interlocutors at this time is not going to be beneficial .
the central government should carve out a situation in which people can lead a normal life , after business , schools and education have been restored .
the interlocutors may have long-term results but as of now they are not accessing the ground situation which is very important for the common man of kashmir . " last december , the government 's move to engage separatist leaders in " quiet diplomacy " failed . author : murali krishnan editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 25.10.2010 germany 's almost legal drug : cannabis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis use is n't completely tolerated in germany legalizing cannabis in germany is only a political side issue , but the topic persistently finds its way back into the conversation and the headlines .
as california votes on the issue , dw looks at the german situation . when the left party recently campaigned in state elections in north-rhine westphalia under the slogan " right to smoke , " their idea to legalize cannabis made headlines in germany .
the same principal has been in the green party 's program for 10 years .
and back in the mid-90s , the social democrats ' otto schily suggested making personal cannabis use legal .
but the question did n't come up again when schily later became interior minister .
efforts to decriminalize marijuana use for the estimated two million germans who smoke it , similar to measures in the neighboring netherlands and czech republic , have been gridlocked for some time .
only the greens and the left are still actively throwing themselves into the fray .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : possession laws vary across germany " it 's a so-called ' soft drug , " ' said gregor gysi , the left party 's parliamentary leader .
" that means its effects are no better or worse than those of alcohol , und just because it is associated with another culture , we treat it differently . "
" what we actually need with cannabis is , first of all , strict controls for minors .
but for adults business should be open for two reasons : first , it would reduce crime associated with buying and second it would end the practice of large amounts of money being made through cannabis sales . "
hazy laws currently in germany , smoking marijuana itself is not a crime , but growing , possessing and selling it is .
the federal constitutional court recommends not enforcing a penalty for possession of small amounts of cannabis for personal use , as long as the possessor is not near a school and poses no threat to the public .
but germany 's 16 states do n't have the same laws for what constitutes a " small amount " of cannabis .
in berlin it is up to 15 grams -lrb- half an ounce -rrb- ; in munich it 's six grams .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffeeshops selling cannabis are across the border in the netherlands authorities in the state of bavaria have warned of " increasing ignorance of guilt regarding cannabis consumption " and have started to crack down on smokers , so much that the german hemp association has made calls online for letters of protest .
raphael gassmann , head of the german center for addiction issues , is n't sure that taking a hard line is the best approach .
" anyone who thinks hard cannabis legislation - in germany or internationally - will lead to less consumption is , experience tells us , wrong , " said gassmann .
" in comparative law studies we have n't once seen a serious indication that punishing cannabis consumption drastically raises or significantly lowers the practice . "
gassmann said one result of going after marijuana users is that they become criminalized .
he adds that can have a devastating effect on their lives if they lose their jobs because of the crime , for example .
mixed support in any case , there seems to be conflicting feelings regarding the problem among the german population .
in a survey of the german hemp association conducted this year , just over 50 percent of germans approve of a liberal approach with regard to cannabis consumers .
but only a quarter of those surveyed support legalizing growing and personal consumption of cannabis , as well as a government regulation of the drug .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medicinal marijuana rules could change soon the social democrats ' parliamentary drug expert , angelika graf , considers legalizing cannabis the wrong signal to send .
she points out the difficult fight against two other legal drugs , alcohol and tobacco .
" i do n't think we 're doing ourselves any favors when we try and reign in use of legal drugs on the one hand and legalize a new drug on the other , " she said .
" that does n't work . "
no one seriously thinks that germany 's current government coalition of christian democrats and free democrats will loosen the country 's cannabis laws .
but , the coalition did recently agree that doctors in germany will soon be able to prescribe pain medication containing cannabis to seriously sick patients , without applying for special approval every time .

as the world struggles with agreements to reverse biodiversity loss , the wadden sea shines as an example of transnational conservation . the wadden sea is one of central europe 's most important nature reserves . the strip of north sea coast is home to the biggest contiguous area of mudflats in the world , and stretches from den helder in the netherlands to esbjerg in denmark via three german states . much of the wadden sea was listed as a unesco world heritage site in 2009 because it serves as a flourishing habitat for some 3,200 species of animals , provides an important way-station for migratory birds , supports a wide variety of plants among its salt marshes and has played a crucial role in restoring seal populations over the past two decades . today the wadden sea is seen as a model for promoting cross-border conservation , but the road to success was not straight forward . road to riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal populations are recovering thanks to a nurturing environment the wadden sea national park is really three parks divided between the german states of schleswig holstein , lower saxony and the city-state of hamburg . the oldest is the park established in germany 's northernmost state , schleswig-holstein , in 1985 . it was prompted by a dawning awareness that piecemeal legislation was proving inadequate at dealing with the growing impacts of industrial and agricultural waste , development and commercial expoitation on the region . at first , proposals for a park met with stiff resistance from locals , who feared for their hunting and fishing rights , resented impositions on their freedom to use the area and worried about an influx of tourists . yet through a mixture of compromise and consensus-building , the state 's then premier , uwe barschel , managed to build enough support to pass legislation . " it sounds crude , but we were just trying to get people on board , " recalls detlef hansen , the head of the national park . " we formed working groups with fishermen , with shepherds , with hunters , and let them have a say in the decision making . " in the end , it was conservationists who felt they were getting the short end of the stick and initially dismissed barschel 's plan as a sham . yet over the years , protection was extended : in 1990 a deal was struck to protect seal populations in the wadden sea – the first accord signed under the bonn convention on migratory species . today , that accord between germany , the netherlands and denmark is held up as a model for multilateral species protection programs . success has boiled down to " defining common objectives " and " working together " with all stakeholders , said jens enemark , secretary of the common wadden sea secretariat - the international organization tasked with facilitating cooperation in the wadden sea . this has meant identifying and mitigating the main human threats to the region , namely pollution , disturbance and habitat destruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the tide is out , visitors enjoy walking on the sea bed local dividends and it 's not just seals that have reaped the rewards , says detlef hansen . " today , you stand on the dike and you realize that it has become a quiet , peaceful place - there 's no more bird hunting , no low-flying planes , and military maneuvers are history .
visitors , and also the inhabitants , can enjoy the blooming salt marshes , " hansen said . locals now overwhelmingly support the national park , and while jens enemark says conservation authorities continue to have different priorities to fishermen and others who depend upon the region for their livelihood , relations are far more cordial than they were two decades ago . indeed , the thriving environment has proved a boon for another industry . " more than two million guests a year spend vacation on the north sea coast of schleswig holstein , " said konstanze hoefling-hoff of the north sea tourism service . " we know from polls and headcounts that more than a million of them stop at the visitors- stations of the national parks , " with popular activities including " guided hikes on the mud flats and other excursions . " to prevent the region from being loved-to-death by over-eager visitors , the wadden sea has a unique partnership program , which ties together the national park service , volunteers , and conservation groups . the german branch of the world wildlife fund fro nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- praises the partnership . it says nature has been able to recuperate , as a result , and that at least in the tidal mud flats , species have ceased to die out . the north sea is also cleaner , and the animals in the mud flats are less frightened than they once were , according to hans-ulrich roesner , a spokesman for the wwf in husum , in northern germany . oil on the horizon ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservation stations have done their job well yet the wwf also says causes for concern remain . " the biggest blot on the national park is the oil exploration which is still taking place in the mittelplate oil field , in the southern part of the region , " roesner said , claiming that this disrupts wild geese in their molting areas , and can leave them unable to fly in summer . unsustainable levels of commercial fishing are an ongoing problem too , from wwf 's perspective , and on this score " something needs to change soon , " roesner says . within germany 's borders , financial considerations also loom . there is n't enough money to go round for rangers , and changes to germany 's system of compulsory military service , mean that there is likely to be a knock on effect for social work , as fewer young men opt for this alternative service – a useful source of labor for everything from medical care to nature conservation . despite these challenges , the wadden sea serves as a useful case-study for others seeking to strike a deal to save nature . author : werner junge , jennifer abramsohn editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead , the government will be advised to cut desk jobs in the defense ministry . a german government commission is to urge caution on plans to radically reduction the number of service personnel numbers within the country 's armed forces .
findings of the inquiry are instead to recommend a dramatic scaling back of office staff in the defense ministry from 3,090 positions to just 1,600 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg said troop numbers could fall to 164,000 " as i see it , they need half the number of employees as they currently have at most , " frank-juergen weise , who chairs the commission , told the public television broadcaster ard on sunday .
chancellor angela merkel 's government has been investigating ways to save money on the armed forced , with up to 240,000 people currently in uniform .
defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenburg has said that this total could be slashed to 164,000 troops in the future , with an end to the current german policy of military conscription . however , the commission is expected to recommend that the figure be reduced to between 180,000 and 190,000 , with further cuts being deemed impracticable .
savings within ministry savings would instead be made at the ministry , which has its main base in the western city of bonn - where 2,570 people are employed - and a smaller section in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle welcomed the inquiry 's findings the six-strong commission is to hand over its 114-page report to zu guttenberg on tuesday , advising that remaining resources be concentrated in berlin .
they said that the dual location of the ministry meant that it suffered from " fragmentation " and that a move to the capital move would allow more central control .
civic leaders in bonn , the former capital of west germany , have warned that major lay-offs there would lead to protests .
foreign minister guido westerwelle welcomed the report on behalf of his free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- party , junior partners in the ruling coalition , saying that greater efficiency was necessary .
speaking to ard , westerwelle added that the end of conscription to make way for a fully professional army was a " long-standing desire " of the fdp .

some 200 protestors seized control of the depot at fos-sur-mer , believed to be the largest in southern france , as riot police looked on , according to news agency agence-presse france .
meanwhile , a depot in central france , at saint-pierre-des corps , was freed after a week of paralysis when around 30 demonstrators walked away from the site without incident .
strikes in the country 's oil industry and blockades of fuel depots have left 35 percent of gas stations in the paris area completely dry or out of at least one kind of fuel , a transport ministry spokeswoman said .
about one-third of gas stations in western france were in " real difficulty " and 10 to 15 percent in the rest of the country were empty , she added .
unions have already called for two more days of strikes , and university students are planning nationwide marches on tuesday in last-ditch efforts to stop the pension reform before a reconciliation between the two houses of parliament and a final vote by the national assembly expected wednesday .
sarkozy popularity suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has n't been able to stop protests - or his sinking approval sarkozy 's government insists that the pension reform , which will raise the minimum retirement age to 62 from 60 , is " inevitable " and the only way to fill an expected pension budget gap and reduce the country 's growing deficit .
but the opposition socialists say if they win presidential elections in 2012 , their candidate will restore the retirement age to 60 .
polls suggest a majority of french voters support or sympathize with the strikers , but jean-francois cope , leader of sarkozy 's ump party in parliament , blamed the widespread disruption on the work of a minority .
" strikes , protests , yes , but taking the economy hostage is intolerable , " he said in an interview with le parisien newspaper .
" most of the country is paralyzed by the actions of a handful of extremists .
everyone should understand that we have no other choice . "
as the unpopular pension reform plan moves closer to becoming law , sarkozy 's approval rating has dropped to an all-time low , dashing hopes that the legislative achievement could bring him a political comeback .
a poll conducted by the ifop institute and published in the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday showed only 29 percent of respondents were satisfied with sarkozy 's job performance .
that was down three points from september , and was a new low for the president since he took office in 2007 .
sarkozy and his allies are hoping that the ongoing protest and strike movement in opposition to the pension reform will die down as families leave their homes for the mid-term school holiday this week .

unions have already called for two more days of strikes , and university students are planning nationwide marches on tuesday in last-ditch efforts to stop the pension reform before a reconciliation between the two houses of parliament and a final vote by the national assembly expected wednesday .
sarkozy popularity suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has n't been able to stop protests - or his sinking approval sarkozy 's government insists that the pension reform , which will raise the minimum retirement age to 62 from 60 , is " inevitable " and the only way to fill an expected pension budget gap and reduce the country 's growing deficit .
but the opposition socialists say if they win presidential elections in 2012 , their candidate will restore the retirement age to 60 .
polls suggest a majority of french voters support or sympathize with the strikers , but jean-francois cope , leader of sarkozy 's ump party in parliament , blamed the widespread disruption on the work of a minority .
" strikes , protests , yes , but taking the economy hostage is intolerable , " he said in an interview with le parisien newspaper .
" most of the country is paralyzed by the actions of a handful of extremists .
everyone should understand that we have no other choice . "
as the unpopular pension reform plan moves closer to becoming law , sarkozy 's approval rating has dropped to an all-time low , dashing hopes that the legislative achievement could bring him a political comeback .
a poll conducted by the ifop institute and published in the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday showed only 29 percent of respondents were satisfied with sarkozy 's job performance .
that was down three points from september , and was a new low for the president since he took office in 2007 .
sarkozy and his allies are hoping that the ongoing protest and strike movement in opposition to the pension reform will die down as families leave their homes for the mid-term school holiday this week .

a rapid border intervention team is expected to be deployed . a rapid intervention team from the eu border agency , frontex , will be deployed for the first time to greece to help shore up the country 's porous border with turkey , the european commission has said in a statement .
the move comes after greece put out an emergency call for the border team , which is to act under greek authority .
eu internal affairs commissioner cecilia malmstroem said she had " immediately activated the mechanism to liaise with frontex and to communicate among all interested partners , so as to handle this emergency situation in the most expeditious and efficient way . "
" the situation at the greek land border with turkey is increasingly worrying , " she said .
" the flows of people crossing the border irregularly have reached alarming proportions and greece is manifestly not able to face this situation alone … i am very concerned about the humanitarian situation . "

the un last week called on eu states to do more to lighten the migrant burden on greece , which it said has created " catastrophic " conditions for refugees .
un special rapporteur on torture manfred nowak described conditions inside greece 's overcrowded detention centers as " inhumane . "
an overwhelming majority of the refugees use greece as an entry point to other european union countries , and arrivals by land have increased by more than a third in a year .
last week , turkey pledged to cooperate with greece in a bid to control the flow of irregular immigrants making their way into europe , in exchange for greece 's help in easing visa rules for turks .

at the very latest , since abu ghraib , the international community had come to the realization that the war in iraq was a ‘ dirty war ' .
there were killings .
there was torture .
mercenaries operated as brutal aggressors .
shi 'ites and sunnis took turns massacring each other .
that one of the most barbarous dictators was overthrown in the process has practically been forgotten .
instead , the image of a dirty war has now been even more enduringly anchored in our collective consciousness .
thanks to the disclosures made by wikileaks , we have perhaps been given a more accurate insight into the course of events and a more precise figure on the brutal human rights violations and number of deaths .
according to the files , more than 150,000 people were killed in iraq between 2004 and 2009 , if we can believe the documents from us military sources . # b # documents appear to be credible can we believe them ?
yes , we can .
the documents appear , in principle , to be credible .
however , it is important to treat them for what they are : one source among many , and a one-sided one at that , originally intended for internal , domestic consumption .
not everything in these documents can be characterized as a bitter truth intended to be camouflaged from public view .
this or that bit of information could be a half truth or ‘ pseudo-fact ' ; for example , when the person reporting draws the wrong conclusions due to their subjective perspective , or wishes to hide personal lapses or errors from superiors .
few things in life are more regularly “ air brushed ” or openly manipulated than reports to supervising superiors , and this is very probably no different for the us army in iraq .
wikileaks also needs monitoring critical questions , therefore , are certainly permissible : did wikileaks do everything possible when vetting the documents to ensure that no human lives will be put at risk ?
we can only hope and wait .
and , by the way : where are the checks and balances on wikileaks ?
the group is going to have to accept questions like these - just as traditional mass media or outlets like facebook and youtube have done - in view of the fact that its political muscle has grown significantly .
they all shoulder a major responsibility , without ever having been elected .
of course , it also depends on who is asking the question and with what motive .
the criticism of wikileaks , expressed by washington and baghdad , is hypocritical .
both are concerned about their reputations .
us president barack obama only appears to be in a comfortable position .
he can not really sit back and claim that all the missteps and consequences are the fault of his predecessor , george w. bush .
in the selective perceptions of many people – and not just in the arab world – the united states is once again on the pillory .
files dicey for iraqi leader the publication of the documents , however , is just as much of a blow to iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki .
he now stands there in public as a political leader who condones torture , including the abuse of supporters of political and religious groups , whom , for the last seven months , he has been trying to win over as coalition partners in a new government .
not surprisingly , al-maliki suspects intrigue behind the wikileak revelations .
he knows that the publication of new , shocking details could cost him his political career .
in as far as the documents are not proven to be forgeries or seriously flawed – for which there is no evidence at the moment – then the blame for them lies with him and george w. bush – and not with wikileaks .
as with vietnam decades ago , the same holds true for the war in iraq today : dirty details need to be thoroughly evaluated and dirty truths brought to light with no holds barred .
the people of iraq , in particular , deserve nothing less .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 25.10.2010 germany 's almost legal drug : cannabis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis use is n't completely tolerated in germany legalizing cannabis in germany is only a political side issue , but the topic persistently finds its way back into the conversation and the headlines .
as california votes on the issue , dw looks at the german situation . when the left party recently campaigned in state elections in north-rhine westphalia under the slogan " right to smoke , " their idea to legalize cannabis made headlines in germany .
the same principal has been in the green party 's program for 10 years .
and back in the mid-90s , the social democrats ' otto schily suggested making personal cannabis use legal .
but the question did n't come up again when schily later became interior minister .
efforts to decriminalize marijuana use for the estimated two million germans who smoke it , similar to measures in the neighboring netherlands and czech republic , have been gridlocked for some time .
only the greens and the left are still actively throwing themselves into the fray .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : possession laws vary across germany " it 's a so-called ' soft drug , " ' said gregor gysi , the left party 's parliamentary leader .
" that means its effects are no better or worse than those of alcohol , und just because it is associated with another culture , we treat it differently . "
" what we actually need with cannabis is , first of all , strict controls for minors .
but for adults business should be open for two reasons : first , it would reduce crime associated with buying and second it would end the practice of large amounts of money being made through cannabis sales . "
hazy laws currently in germany , smoking marijuana itself is not a crime , but growing , possessing and selling it is .
the federal constitutional court recommends not enforcing a penalty for possession of small amounts of cannabis for personal use , as long as the possessor is not near a school and poses no threat to the public .
but germany 's 16 states do n't have the same laws for what constitutes a " small amount " of cannabis .
in berlin it is up to 15 grams -lrb- half an ounce -rrb- ; in munich it 's six grams .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffeeshops selling cannabis are across the border in the netherlands authorities in the state of bavaria have warned of " increasing ignorance of guilt regarding cannabis consumption " and have started to crack down on smokers , so much that the german hemp association has made calls online for letters of protest .
raphael gassmann , head of the german center for addiction issues , is n't sure that taking a hard line is the best approach .
" anyone who thinks hard cannabis legislation - in germany or internationally - will lead to less consumption is , experience tells us , wrong , " said gassmann .
" in comparative law studies we have n't once seen a serious indication that punishing cannabis consumption drastically raises or significantly lowers the practice . "
gassmann said one result of going after marijuana users is that they become criminalized .
he adds that can have a devastating effect on their lives if they lose their jobs because of the crime , for example .
mixed support in any case , there seems to be conflicting feelings regarding the problem among the german population .
in a survey of the german hemp association conducted this year , just over 50 percent of germans approve of a liberal approach with regard to cannabis consumers .
but only a quarter of those surveyed support legalizing growing and personal consumption of cannabis , as well as a government regulation of the drug .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medicinal marijuana rules could change soon the social democrats ' parliamentary drug expert , angelika graf , considers legalizing cannabis the wrong signal to send .
she points out the difficult fight against two other legal drugs , alcohol and tobacco .
" i do n't think we 're doing ourselves any favors when we try and reign in use of legal drugs on the one hand and legalize a new drug on the other , " she said .
" that does n't work . "
no one seriously thinks that germany 's current government coalition of christian democrats and free democrats will loosen the country 's cannabis laws .
but , the coalition did recently agree that doctors in germany will soon be able to prescribe pain medication containing cannabis to seriously sick patients , without applying for special approval every time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 25.10.2010 two venerable clubs chart divergent courses out of crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer is the new man in the cologne hot seat fc cologne and borussia moenchengladbach are both off to disastrous starts in the bundesliga .
one has panicked and fired its coach , the other plans to stay the course . in the bundesliga , if you go six straight games without a win , or have only one three-pointer to your credit nine games into the season , you are liable to get fired .
like stuttgart 's ex-coach christian gross before him , fc cologne 's zvonimir soldo learned that lesson on sunday .
the billy goats parted ways with their croatian coach of a year-and-a-half at roughly the same time that they landed in last place , courtesy of the former cellar-dwellers stuttgart 's win over st. pauli .
now , news of a last place club sacking its coach rarely comes as a surprise , but when viewed alongside the goings on at another presently hapless club , borussia moenchengladbach , cologne 's move to let soldo go seems rash .
perhaps cologne can learn a lesson from their old rival .
gladbach is one rung higher up the bundesliga ladder than cologne at the moment , with six points from nine matches , but that does n't really tell the whole story .
the foals are , if anything , looking even worse than cologne at the moment .
the awfulness of gladbach 's defense is threatening to take on historic proportion .
with 27 goals allowed thus far , they are very nearly on pace to break tasmania berlin 's record of 108 for the season - a record that has stood for 45 years , and one that most assumed would never , ever be broken .
still , michael frontzeck is not out of a job .
the coach is scarcely even looking over his shoulder , and the fans are standing behind him .
deep-running roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- has been a loyal soldier at borussia moenchengladbach that he is sitting as pretty as he is , even in the midst of gladbach 's ugly form , is mostly down to his roots .
frontzeck 's managerial record - not only at gladbach , but in his prior stints at aachen and bielefeld as well - has been patchy .
but he was born in moenchengladbach , played nine seasons in three stints with the club , and understands how much borussia means to its fans .
frontzeck showed guts , and demonstrated how well he knows his club , after saturday 's humbling home loss to bremen .
gladbach 's hardcore support was baying for blood after the 4-1 loss , and many a manager would have tuned the jeers out and headed for the locker room .
frontzeck , though , saw an opportunity to circle the wagons , and climbed into the stands to hold an impromptu 15-minute question-and-answer session .
afterward , he told reporters that it had been a " comfortable conversation , " and not at all one where fans were " just looking for someone to blame . "
“ we all agreed that we can only get out of this situation together , ” he said .
“ that the fans are standing behind us is a good feeling . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiny bald head in the middle of this picture ?
that 's frontzeck the contrast with cologne could not be starker .
soldo came to the club as a rising managerial star , on the back of a croatian title with dinamo zagreb , but also as an outsider - one who seemed miscast from the start , in that he never seemed to care about the club 's history or understand the club 's special relationship to its fans .
history 's burden perhaps more than any other clubs in the bundesliga , cologne and gladbach supporters are obsessed with history .
that 's because it 's just about all they 've got . gladbach 's rich past is well-known .
they won five league titles in the 1970s , and made it to another five european finals in that golden era for german football .
for many years , though , cologne too fielded a consistently good team .
in the first quarter-century of the bundesliga , the billy goats won the league twice and finished in the top eight all but four times .
then , in the 1990s , things began to fall apart at both clubs .
cologne finished second in 1990 , and made it to the german cup final in 1991 .
gladbach won the cup in 1995 .
since then , no titles at all , for either club .
moreover , gladbach has been relegated twice , and cologne four times in the past 13 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the haircuts show it 's been some time since cologne were in a cup final falling so far , so fast , and so hard has brought on a certain delusion among both sets of fans .
the older ones still think of their club as big and important , and the younger supporters have grown up in their elders ' echo chamber , weaned on the glories of yesteryear and expectant of a return to glory any minute now .
both clubs attract tens of thousands of fans to home matches irrespective of the side 's current form , and both are followed assiduously in the local press - who are only too happy to talk up a finish in the european places after two wins in a row , and call two straight losses a crisis .
the fishbowl atmosphere can overwhelm a coach who 's not prepared to play along , as the aggressively mild-mannered soldo never was .
but for a coach who 's " one of their own , " like frontzeck or christoph daum in his recent run at cologne , it 's a perfect fit - even if they do n't win anything .
holding fast supporters seem to have determined that the base price of entry to coaching at their club is genuflection at the altar of tradition , a sort of fundamentalist fandom that seeks to purify the club of corrosive outside influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer 's cologne bona fides are unquestioned in this respect , cologne 's interim coach frank schaefer is off to a stellar start .
he has never led a senior side before , but fan darling lukas podolski pronounced his onetime youth team coach " a cologne man through and through . "
-lrb- it 's true - the 46-year-old schaefer has been working as a youth or reserve team coach at cologne for 20 of the past 26 years . -rrb-
for good measure , schaefer himself opened his maiden press conference by stating that he was " a cologne lad and fc guy too . "
he also chose as his assistant coach dirk lottner , a cologne native who played six seasons at the club and has worked with schaefer in the youth system since retiring in 2007 .
cologne 's local tabloid express cooed that " you ca n't get much more cologne than that ! "
the club says it 's not ruling out a higher-profile hire , but holding onto schaefer for a while at least has to be the best play at the moment .
the fans want cologne natives on the touchline , and so they shall have them .
let 's hope they can coach a little as well .

following a meeting at the chancellery on sunday , finance minister wolfgang schaeuble and economics minister rainer bruederle said the move would see the financial burden on energy-intensive industries eased by nullifying previous plans to slash a rebate such companies were entitled to on a so-called " eco-tax .

but no such luck .
economics minister rainer bruederle said that although he would like to see the company 's headquarters remain on german turf , he was not willing to intervene in the market process .
and chancellor angela merkel agreed on both counts .
that was the end of that , but not the end of the story .
on sunday , germany 's weekly news magazine der spiegel reported that hochtief is now in talks with qatar , thanks , no less , to mrs merkel .
a spokeswoman for the coveted construction company told reporters that during an industry leaders dinner at berlin 's presidential palace , the german chancellor had taken the opportunity to introduce hochtief chief executive herbert luetkestratkoetter to the qatari economics minister .

australian assistance but hochtief is not leaving its fate solely in the lap of the middle east .
the company is also looking to australia , home of its hugely successful subsidiary leighton holdings , to bolster its defenses .
last week , the german company applied to the australian takeovers panel to try and force acs to make a fully priced bid for outstanding shares in leighton , which contributes some 80 percent of hochtief 's total earnings and is therefore particularly attractive to the heavily indebted spanish bidder .
on monday , leighton upped the pressure by making its own application to the panel to block the all-share bid on the grounds that it would rob the company of its independence .
" although hochtief owns 54.5 percent of leighton , leighton is not in the normal position of a controlled ' downstream ' entity , " leighton chairman david mortimer said in a statement .
under the current governance arrangements between the german company and its australian subsidiary , leighton has an independent board and management .
protecting minority shareholders furthermore mortimer said that to allow a takeover by acs - which currently holds a 29 percent stake in hochtief - without a commitment to retain leighton 's independence status or any obligation to make a cash bid for the subsidiary would not be in the interests of shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is looking to australian regulators for support " leighton 's independent directors are concerned that german takeover law does not provide the same level of protection for the interests of minority shareholders that investors expect of companies listed on the australian securities exchange , " he said .
the australian takeovers panel has three weeks to decide whether the spanish bid for hochtief is in actual fact a bid for leighton , and whether minority shareholders would be disadvantaged a successful takeover .
if the regulators find in favor of leighton , it could double the money acs would need to buy a controlling stake in the german company .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 25.10.2010 germany 's almost legal drug : cannabis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis use is n't completely tolerated in germany legalizing cannabis in germany is only a political side issue , but the topic persistently finds its way back into the conversation and the headlines .
as california votes on the issue , dw looks at the german situation . when the left party recently campaigned in state elections in north-rhine westphalia under the slogan " right to smoke , " their idea to legalize cannabis made headlines in germany .
the same principal has been in the green party 's program for 10 years .
and back in the mid-90s , the social democrats ' otto schily suggested making personal cannabis use legal .
but the question did n't come up again when schily later became interior minister .
efforts to decriminalize marijuana use for the estimated two million germans who smoke it , similar to measures in the neighboring netherlands and czech republic , have been gridlocked for some time .
only the greens and the left are still actively throwing themselves into the fray .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : possession laws vary across germany " it 's a so-called ' soft drug , " ' said gregor gysi , the left party 's parliamentary leader .
" that means its effects are no better or worse than those of alcohol , und just because it is associated with another culture , we treat it differently . "
" what we actually need with cannabis is , first of all , strict controls for minors .
but for adults business should be open for two reasons : first , it would reduce crime associated with buying and second it would end the practice of large amounts of money being made through cannabis sales . "
hazy laws currently in germany , smoking marijuana itself is not a crime , but growing , possessing and selling it is .
the federal constitutional court recommends not enforcing a penalty for possession of small amounts of cannabis for personal use , as long as the possessor is not near a school and poses no threat to the public .
but germany 's 16 states do n't have the same laws for what constitutes a " small amount " of cannabis .
in berlin it is up to 15 grams -lrb- half an ounce -rrb- ; in munich it 's six grams .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffeeshops selling cannabis are across the border in the netherlands authorities in the state of bavaria have warned of " increasing ignorance of guilt regarding cannabis consumption " and have started to crack down on smokers , so much that the german hemp association has made calls online for letters of protest .
raphael gassmann , head of the german center for addiction issues , is n't sure that taking a hard line is the best approach .
" anyone who thinks hard cannabis legislation - in germany or internationally - will lead to less consumption is , experience tells us , wrong , " said gassmann .
" in comparative law studies we have n't once seen a serious indication that punishing cannabis consumption drastically raises or significantly lowers the practice . "
gassmann said one result of going after marijuana users is that they become criminalized .
he adds that can have a devastating effect on their lives if they lose their jobs because of the crime , for example .
mixed support in any case , there seems to be conflicting feelings regarding the problem among the german population .
in a survey of the german hemp association conducted this year , just over 50 percent of germans approve of a liberal approach with regard to cannabis consumers .
but only a quarter of those surveyed support legalizing growing and personal consumption of cannabis , as well as a government regulation of the drug .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medicinal marijuana rules could change soon the social democrats ' parliamentary drug expert , angelika graf , considers legalizing cannabis the wrong signal to send .
she points out the difficult fight against two other legal drugs , alcohol and tobacco .
" i do n't think we 're doing ourselves any favors when we try and reign in use of legal drugs on the one hand and legalize a new drug on the other , " she said .
" that does n't work . "
no one seriously thinks that germany 's current government coalition of christian democrats and free democrats will loosen the country 's cannabis laws .
but , the coalition did recently agree that doctors in germany will soon be able to prescribe pain medication containing cannabis to seriously sick patients , without applying for special approval every time .

as california votes on the issue , dw looks at the german situation . when the left party recently campaigned in state elections in north-rhine westphalia under the slogan " right to smoke , " their idea to legalize cannabis made headlines in germany .
the same principal has been in the green party 's program for 10 years .
and back in the mid-90s , the social democrats ' otto schily suggested making personal cannabis use legal .
but the question did n't come up again when schily later became interior minister .
efforts to decriminalize marijuana use for the estimated two million germans who smoke it , similar to measures in the neighboring netherlands and czech republic , have been gridlocked for some time .
only the greens and the left are still actively throwing themselves into the fray .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : possession laws vary across germany " it 's a so-called ' soft drug , " ' said gregor gysi , the left party 's parliamentary leader .
" that means its effects are no better or worse than those of alcohol , und just because it is associated with another culture , we treat it differently . "
" what we actually need with cannabis is , first of all , strict controls for minors .
but for adults business should be open for two reasons : first , it would reduce crime associated with buying and second it would end the practice of large amounts of money being made through cannabis sales . "
hazy laws currently in germany , smoking marijuana itself is not a crime , but growing , possessing and selling it is .
the federal constitutional court recommends not enforcing a penalty for possession of small amounts of cannabis for personal use , as long as the possessor is not near a school and poses no threat to the public .
but germany 's 16 states do n't have the same laws for what constitutes a " small amount " of cannabis .
in berlin it is up to 15 grams -lrb- half an ounce -rrb- ; in munich it 's six grams .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffeeshops selling cannabis are across the border in the netherlands authorities in the state of bavaria have warned of " increasing ignorance of guilt regarding cannabis consumption " and have started to crack down on smokers , so much that the german hemp association has made calls online for letters of protest .
raphael gassmann , head of the german center for addiction issues , is n't sure that taking a hard line is the best approach .
" anyone who thinks hard cannabis legislation - in germany or internationally - will lead to less consumption is , experience tells us , wrong , " said gassmann .
" in comparative law studies we have n't once seen a serious indication that punishing cannabis consumption drastically raises or significantly lowers the practice . "
gassmann said one result of going after marijuana users is that they become criminalized .
he adds that can have a devastating effect on their lives if they lose their jobs because of the crime , for example .
mixed support in any case , there seems to be conflicting feelings regarding the problem among the german population .
in a survey of the german hemp association conducted this year , just over 50 percent of germans approve of a liberal approach with regard to cannabis consumers .
but only a quarter of those surveyed support legalizing growing and personal consumption of cannabis , as well as a government regulation of the drug .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medicinal marijuana rules could change soon the social democrats ' parliamentary drug expert , angelika graf , considers legalizing cannabis the wrong signal to send .
she points out the difficult fight against two other legal drugs , alcohol and tobacco .
" i do n't think we 're doing ourselves any favors when we try and reign in use of legal drugs on the one hand and legalize a new drug on the other , " she said .
" that does n't work . "
no one seriously thinks that germany 's current government coalition of christian democrats and free democrats will loosen the country 's cannabis laws .
but , the coalition did recently agree that doctors in germany will soon be able to prescribe pain medication containing cannabis to seriously sick patients , without applying for special approval every time .

and chancellor angela merkel agreed on both counts .
that was the end of that , but not the end of the story .
on sunday , germany 's weekly news magazine der spiegel reported that hochtief is now in talks with qatar , thanks , no less , to mrs merkel .
a spokeswoman for the coveted construction company told reporters that during an industry leaders dinner at berlin 's presidential palace , the german chancellor had taken the opportunity to introduce hochtief chief executive herbert luetkestratkoetter to the qatari economics minister .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel does not want to see hochtief split up should qatar decide to get on board with its sovereign wealth fund , it would be as a ' white-knight ' investor , a role it has played in the past for the volkswagen group .
australian assistance but hochtief is not leaving its fate solely in the lap of the middle east .
the company is also looking to australia , home of its hugely successful subsidiary leighton holdings , to bolster its defenses .
last week , the german company applied to the australian takeovers panel to try and force acs to make a fully priced bid for outstanding shares in leighton , which contributes some 80 percent of hochtief 's total earnings and is therefore particularly attractive to the heavily indebted spanish bidder .
on monday , leighton upped the pressure by making its own application to the panel to block the all-share bid on the grounds that it would rob the company of its independence .
" although hochtief owns 54.5 percent of leighton , leighton is not in the normal position of a controlled ' downstream ' entity , " leighton chairman david mortimer said in a statement .
under the current governance arrangements between the german company and its australian subsidiary , leighton has an independent board and management .
protecting minority shareholders furthermore mortimer said that to allow a takeover by acs - which currently holds a 29 percent stake in hochtief - without a commitment to retain leighton 's independence status or any obligation to make a cash bid for the subsidiary would not be in the interests of shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief is looking to australian regulators for support " leighton 's independent directors are concerned that german takeover law does not provide the same level of protection for the interests of minority shareholders that investors expect of companies listed on the australian securities exchange , " he said .
the australian takeovers panel has three weeks to decide whether the spanish bid for hochtief is in actual fact a bid for leighton , and whether minority shareholders would be disadvantaged a successful takeover .
if the regulators find in favor of leighton , it could double the money acs would need to buy a controlling stake in the german company .

at the very latest , since abu ghraib , the international community had come to the realization that the war in iraq was a ‘ dirty war ' .
there were killings .
there was torture .
mercenaries operated as brutal aggressors .
shi 'ites and sunnis took turns massacring each other .
that one of the most barbarous dictators was overthrown in the process has practically been forgotten .
instead , the image of a dirty war has now been even more enduringly anchored in our collective consciousness .
thanks to the disclosures made by wikileaks , we have perhaps been given a more accurate insight into the course of events and a more precise figure on the brutal human rights violations and number of deaths .
according to the files , more than 150,000 people were killed in iraq between 2004 and 2009 , if we can believe the documents from us military sources . # b # documents appear to be credible can we believe them ?
yes , we can .
the documents appear , in principle , to be credible .
however , it is important to treat them for what they are : one source among many , and a one-sided one at that , originally intended for internal , domestic consumption .
not everything in these documents can be characterized as a bitter truth intended to be camouflaged from public view .
this or that bit of information could be a half truth or ‘ pseudo-fact ' ; for example , when the person reporting draws the wrong conclusions due to their subjective perspective , or wishes to hide personal lapses or errors from superiors .
few things in life are more regularly “ air brushed ” or openly manipulated than reports to supervising superiors , and this is very probably no different for the us army in iraq .
wikileaks also needs monitoring critical questions , therefore , are certainly permissible : did wikileaks do everything possible when vetting the documents to ensure that no human lives will be put at risk ?
we can only hope and wait .
and , by the way : where are the checks and balances on wikileaks ?
the group is going to have to accept questions like these - just as traditional mass media or outlets like facebook and youtube have done - in view of the fact that its political muscle has grown significantly .
they all shoulder a major responsibility , without ever having been elected .
of course , it also depends on who is asking the question and with what motive .
the criticism of wikileaks , expressed by washington and baghdad , is hypocritical .
both are concerned about their reputations .
us president barack obama only appears to be in a comfortable position .
he can not really sit back and claim that all the missteps and consequences are the fault of his predecessor , george w. bush .
in the selective perceptions of many people – and not just in the arab world – the united states is once again on the pillory .
files dicey for iraqi leader the publication of the documents , however , is just as much of a blow to iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki .
he now stands there in public as a political leader who condones torture , including the abuse of supporters of political and religious groups , whom , for the last seven months , he has been trying to win over as coalition partners in a new government .
not surprisingly , al-maliki suspects intrigue behind the wikileak revelations .
he knows that the publication of new , shocking details could cost him his political career .
in as far as the documents are not proven to be forgeries or seriously flawed – for which there is no evidence at the moment – then the blame for them lies with him and george w. bush – and not with wikileaks .
as with vietnam decades ago , the same holds true for the war in iraq today : dirty details need to be thoroughly evaluated and dirty truths brought to light with no holds barred .
the people of iraq , in particular , deserve nothing less .

at the very latest , since abu ghraib , the international community had come to the realization that the war in iraq was a ‘ dirty war ' .
there were killings .
there was torture .
mercenaries operated as brutal aggressors .
shi 'ites and sunnis took turns massacring each other .
that one of the most barbarous dictators was overthrown in the process has practically been forgotten .
instead , the image of a dirty war has now been even more enduringly anchored in our collective consciousness .
thanks to the disclosures made by wikileaks , we have perhaps been given a more accurate insight into the course of events and a more precise figure on the brutal human rights violations and number of deaths .
according to the files , more than 150,000 people were killed in iraq between 2004 and 2009 , if we can believe the documents from us military sources . # b # documents appear to be credible can we believe them ?
yes , we can .
the documents appear , in principle , to be credible .
however , it is important to treat them for what they are : one source among many , and a one-sided one at that , originally intended for internal , domestic consumption .
not everything in these documents can be characterized as a bitter truth intended to be camouflaged from public view .
this or that bit of information could be a half truth or ‘ pseudo-fact ' ; for example , when the person reporting draws the wrong conclusions due to their subjective perspective , or wishes to hide personal lapses or errors from superiors .
few things in life are more regularly “ air brushed ” or openly manipulated than reports to supervising superiors , and this is very probably no different for the us army in iraq .
wikileaks also needs monitoring critical questions , therefore , are certainly permissible : did wikileaks do everything possible when vetting the documents to ensure that no human lives will be put at risk ?
we can only hope and wait .
and , by the way : where are the checks and balances on wikileaks ?
the group is going to have to accept questions like these - just as traditional mass media or outlets like facebook and youtube have done - in view of the fact that its political muscle has grown significantly .
they all shoulder a major responsibility , without ever having been elected .
of course , it also depends on who is asking the question and with what motive .

this year is the first time in the award 's ten year history that it has been given to a rock musician .
during the presentation ceremony at the guildhall in kassel , central germany , journalist and publicist matthias matussek praised lindenberg and said his song lyrics proved he had learned much about the german language .
the jury , in naming lindenberg as this year 's winner , concluded that he was the " most influential and successful german rock musician of the last 40 years " and , in that time , had more than proven that music in german could be successful internationally , the rheinische post reported on sunday .
lindenburg , who first entered the business in the late 60s as a drummer and went on to have hits with " sonderzug nach pankow " -lrb- special train to pankow -rrb- , " airport " and " geh nicht weg " -lrb- do n't go away -rrb- , said that the jury 's decision was " cool . "
jacob grimm , after whom the award is named , was one half of germany 's famous grimm brothers , who rose to prominence in the early 1800s for their collection of now world-famous fairytales .
the prize which bears jacob 's name is awarded to someone who works to promote the “ recognition , further development and support of german as a cultural language . ”
for his faithfulness to his mother tongue , lindenberg also receives 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 42,000 -rrb- prize money .

the race got off to a wet start for the 24 drivers and a delay caused by the rain made it one of the longest races in history . if you watch an f1 race on television , you probably get a better view than from on the grandstand but some fans say you do not go to a race for the view but for the noise . around 80,000 spectators braved the on and off downpour to watch south korea ’ s first formula one race at a new circuit in yeongnam , 320 km south of seoul . the 220 million dollar korea international circuit is f1 's newest venue and the fifth in asia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was work being done on the track until the very last minute ferrari ’ s fernando alonso won the race sitting in the stands overlooking the starting line , fans such as 16-year-old kim jin-suk were excited that f1 had finally made it to their country .
" i really like these fast cars .
i 've been a fan for about three years but it ’ s the first time i 've gotten to see the races in person , " he said enthusiastically . after an hour-long rain delay , kim and the other spectators finally got to see what they had come for . water sprayed out from behind the race-cars as they zipped down the 5.6 kilometer long track .
the wet surface and 18 turns may have been responsible for several crashes with 9 out of 24 drivers not completing the race . bildunterschrift : the race was one of the longest in formula one history because of a rain delay at the end , ferrari 's fernando alonso stood atop the highest podium . formula one not that popular yet in south korea south korea does not have a large formula one following and for many in the crowd it was a completely new experience . the 20-year old noh sung hyun , who volunteered as a guide , said she did " not know that much about f1 before .
but i really hope to come back now that i have had the chance to work here . " adrian kim , a project director at the korean tourism organization , wants noh and many other f1 fans to come back again . " one way of promoting tourism to korea via f1 racing is by providing shuttle air service from several locations in asia as well as by targeting markets in europe with special formula one travel packages , " he explained .
" but this year we did not get permission from the circuit and fell short of our goals . " better luck next year kim said this was not the only problem regarding the international competition .
it was not even certain until a few weeks ago that construction of the circuit would be ready in time .
work was still being done on the facility up into the final hours .

instead , the government will be advised to cut desk jobs in the defense ministry . a german government commission is to urge caution on plans to radically reduction the number of service personnel numbers within the country 's armed forces .
findings of the inquiry are instead to recommend a dramatic scaling back of office staff in the defense ministry from 3,090 positions to just 1,600 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg said troop numbers could fall to 164,000 " as i see it , they need half the number of employees as they currently have at most , " frank-juergen weise , who chairs the commission , told the public television broadcaster ard on sunday .
chancellor angela merkel 's government has been investigating ways to save money on the armed forced , with up to 240,000 people currently in uniform .
defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenburg has said that this total could be slashed to 164,000 troops in the future , with an end to the current german policy of military conscription . however , the commission is expected to recommend that the figure be reduced to between 180,000 and 190,000 , with further cuts being deemed impracticable .
savings within ministry savings would instead be made at the ministry , which has its main base in the western city of bonn - where 2,570 people are employed - and a smaller section in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle welcomed the inquiry 's findings the six-strong commission is to hand over its 114-page report to zu guttenberg on tuesday , advising that remaining resources be concentrated in berlin .
they said that the dual location of the ministry meant that it suffered from " fragmentation " and that a move to the capital move would allow more central control .
civic leaders in bonn , the former capital of west germany , have warned that major lay-offs there would lead to protests .
foreign minister guido westerwelle welcomed the report on behalf of his free democrat -lrb- fdp -rrb- party , junior partners in the ruling coalition , saying that greater efficiency was necessary .
speaking to ard , westerwelle added that the end of conscription to make way for a fully professional army was a " long-standing desire " of the fdp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 25.10.2010 two venerable clubs chart divergent courses out of crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer is the new man in the cologne hot seat fc cologne and borussia moenchengladbach are both off to disastrous starts in the bundesliga .
one has panicked and fired its coach , the other plans to stay the course . in the bundesliga , if you go six straight games without a win , or have only one three-pointer to your credit nine games into the season , you are liable to get fired .
like stuttgart 's ex-coach christian gross before him , fc cologne 's zvonimir soldo learned that lesson on sunday .
the billy goats parted ways with their croatian coach of a year-and-a-half at roughly the same time that they landed in last place , courtesy of the former cellar-dwellers stuttgart 's win over st. pauli .
now , news of a last place club sacking its coach rarely comes as a surprise , but when viewed alongside the goings on at another presently hapless club , borussia moenchengladbach , cologne 's move to let soldo go seems rash .
perhaps cologne can learn a lesson from their old rival .
gladbach is one rung higher up the bundesliga ladder than cologne at the moment , with six points from nine matches , but that does n't really tell the whole story .
the foals are , if anything , looking even worse than cologne at the moment .
the awfulness of gladbach 's defense is threatening to take on historic proportion .
with 27 goals allowed thus far , they are very nearly on pace to break tasmania berlin 's record of 108 for the season - a record that has stood for 45 years , and one that most assumed would never , ever be broken .
still , michael frontzeck is not out of a job .
the coach is scarcely even looking over his shoulder , and the fans are standing behind him .
deep-running roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- has been a loyal soldier at borussia moenchengladbach that he is sitting as pretty as he is , even in the midst of gladbach 's ugly form , is mostly down to his roots .
frontzeck 's managerial record - not only at gladbach , but in his prior stints at aachen and bielefeld as well - has been patchy .
but he was born in moenchengladbach , played nine seasons in three stints with the club , and understands how much borussia means to its fans .
frontzeck showed guts , and demonstrated how well he knows his club , after saturday 's humbling home loss to bremen .
gladbach 's hardcore support was baying for blood after the 4-1 loss , and many a manager would have tuned the jeers out and headed for the locker room .
frontzeck , though , saw an opportunity to circle the wagons , and climbed into the stands to hold an impromptu 15-minute question-and-answer session .
afterward , he told reporters that it had been a " comfortable conversation , " and not at all one where fans were " just looking for someone to blame . "
“ we all agreed that we can only get out of this situation together , ” he said .
“ that the fans are standing behind us is a good feeling . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiny bald head in the middle of this picture ?
that 's frontzeck the contrast with cologne could not be starker .
soldo came to the club as a rising managerial star , on the back of a croatian title with dinamo zagreb , but also as an outsider - one who seemed miscast from the start , in that he never seemed to care about the club 's history or understand the club 's special relationship to its fans .
history 's burden perhaps more than any other clubs in the bundesliga , cologne and gladbach supporters are obsessed with history .
that 's because it 's just about all they 've got . gladbach 's rich past is well-known .
they won five league titles in the 1970s , and made it to another five european finals in that golden era for german football .
for many years , though , cologne too fielded a consistently good team .
in the first quarter-century of the bundesliga , the billy goats won the league twice and finished in the top eight all but four times .
then , in the 1990s , things began to fall apart at both clubs .
cologne finished second in 1990 , and made it to the german cup final in 1991 .
gladbach won the cup in 1995 .
since then , no titles at all , for either club .
moreover , gladbach has been relegated twice , and cologne four times in the past 13 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the haircuts show it 's been some time since cologne were in a cup final falling so far , so fast , and so hard has brought on a certain delusion among both sets of fans .
the older ones still think of their club as big and important , and the younger supporters have grown up in their elders ' echo chamber , weaned on the glories of yesteryear and expectant of a return to glory any minute now .
both clubs attract tens of thousands of fans to home matches irrespective of the side 's current form , and both are followed assiduously in the local press - who are only too happy to talk up a finish in the european places after two wins in a row , and call two straight losses a crisis .
the fishbowl atmosphere can overwhelm a coach who 's not prepared to play along , as the aggressively mild-mannered soldo never was .
but for a coach who 's " one of their own , " like frontzeck or christoph daum in his recent run at cologne , it 's a perfect fit - even if they do n't win anything .
holding fast supporters seem to have determined that the base price of entry to coaching at their club is genuflection at the altar of tradition , a sort of fundamentalist fandom that seeks to purify the club of corrosive outside influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer 's cologne bona fides are unquestioned in this respect , cologne 's interim coach frank schaefer is off to a stellar start .
he has never led a senior side before , but fan darling lukas podolski pronounced his onetime youth team coach " a cologne man through and through . "
-lrb- it 's true - the 46-year-old schaefer has been working as a youth or reserve team coach at cologne for 20 of the past 26 years . -rrb-
for good measure , schaefer himself opened his maiden press conference by stating that he was " a cologne lad and fc guy too . "
he also chose as his assistant coach dirk lottner , a cologne native who played six seasons at the club and has worked with schaefer in the youth system since retiring in 2007 .
cologne 's local tabloid express cooed that " you ca n't get much more cologne than that ! "
the club says it 's not ruling out a higher-profile hire , but holding onto schaefer for a while at least has to be the best play at the moment .
the fans want cologne natives on the touchline , and so they shall have them .
let 's hope they can coach a little as well .

let 's hope they can coach a little as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 25.10.2010 two venerable clubs chart divergent courses out of crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer is the new man in the cologne hot seat fc cologne and borussia moenchengladbach are both off to disastrous starts in the bundesliga .
one has panicked and fired its coach , the other plans to stay the course . in the bundesliga , if you go six straight games without a win , or have only one three-pointer to your credit nine games into the season , you are liable to get fired .
like stuttgart 's ex-coach christian gross before him , fc cologne 's zvonimir soldo learned that lesson on sunday .
the billy goats parted ways with their croatian coach of a year-and-a-half at roughly the same time that they landed in last place , courtesy of the former cellar-dwellers stuttgart 's win over st. pauli .
now , news of a last place club sacking its coach rarely comes as a surprise , but when viewed alongside the goings on at another presently hapless club , borussia moenchengladbach , cologne 's move to let soldo go seems rash .
perhaps cologne can learn a lesson from their old rival .
gladbach is one rung higher up the bundesliga ladder than cologne at the moment , with six points from nine matches , but that does n't really tell the whole story .
the foals are , if anything , looking even worse than cologne at the moment .
the awfulness of gladbach 's defense is threatening to take on historic proportion .
with 27 goals allowed thus far , they are very nearly on pace to break tasmania berlin 's record of 108 for the season - a record that has stood for 45 years , and one that most assumed would never , ever be broken .
still , michael frontzeck is not out of a job .
the coach is scarcely even looking over his shoulder , and the fans are standing behind him .
deep-running roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- has been a loyal soldier at borussia moenchengladbach that he is sitting as pretty as he is , even in the midst of gladbach 's ugly form , is mostly down to his roots .
frontzeck 's managerial record - not only at gladbach , but in his prior stints at aachen and bielefeld as well - has been patchy .
but he was born in moenchengladbach , played nine seasons in three stints with the club , and understands how much borussia means to its fans .
frontzeck showed guts , and demonstrated how well he knows his club , after saturday 's humbling home loss to bremen .
gladbach 's hardcore support was baying for blood after the 4-1 loss , and many a manager would have tuned the jeers out and headed for the locker room .
frontzeck , though , saw an opportunity to circle the wagons , and climbed into the stands to hold an impromptu 15-minute question-and-answer session .
afterward , he told reporters that it had been a " comfortable conversation , " and not at all one where fans were " just looking for someone to blame . "
“ we all agreed that we can only get out of this situation together , ” he said .
“ that the fans are standing behind us is a good feeling . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiny bald head in the middle of this picture ?
that 's frontzeck the contrast with cologne could not be starker .
soldo came to the club as a rising managerial star , on the back of a croatian title with dinamo zagreb , but also as an outsider - one who seemed miscast from the start , in that he never seemed to care about the club 's history or understand the club 's special relationship to its fans .
history 's burden perhaps more than any other clubs in the bundesliga , cologne and gladbach supporters are obsessed with history .
that 's because it 's just about all they 've got . gladbach 's rich past is well-known .
they won five league titles in the 1970s , and made it to another five european finals in that golden era for german football .
for many years , though , cologne too fielded a consistently good team .
in the first quarter-century of the bundesliga , the billy goats won the league twice and finished in the top eight all but four times .
then , in the 1990s , things began to fall apart at both clubs .
cologne finished second in 1990 , and made it to the german cup final in 1991 .
gladbach won the cup in 1995 .
since then , no titles at all , for either club .
moreover , gladbach has been relegated twice , and cologne four times in the past 13 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the haircuts show it 's been some time since cologne were in a cup final falling so far , so fast , and so hard has brought on a certain delusion among both sets of fans .
the older ones still think of their club as big and important , and the younger supporters have grown up in their elders ' echo chamber , weaned on the glories of yesteryear and expectant of a return to glory any minute now .
both clubs attract tens of thousands of fans to home matches irrespective of the side 's current form , and both are followed assiduously in the local press - who are only too happy to talk up a finish in the european places after two wins in a row , and call two straight losses a crisis .
the fishbowl atmosphere can overwhelm a coach who 's not prepared to play along , as the aggressively mild-mannered soldo never was .
but for a coach who 's " one of their own , " like frontzeck or christoph daum in his recent run at cologne , it 's a perfect fit - even if they do n't win anything .
holding fast supporters seem to have determined that the base price of entry to coaching at their club is genuflection at the altar of tradition , a sort of fundamentalist fandom that seeks to purify the club of corrosive outside influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer 's cologne bona fides are unquestioned in this respect , cologne 's interim coach frank schaefer is off to a stellar start .
he has never led a senior side before , but fan darling lukas podolski pronounced his onetime youth team coach " a cologne man through and through . "
-lrb- it 's true - the 46-year-old schaefer has been working as a youth or reserve team coach at cologne for 20 of the past 26 years . -rrb-
for good measure , schaefer himself opened his maiden press conference by stating that he was " a cologne lad and fc guy too . "
he also chose as his assistant coach dirk lottner , a cologne native who played six seasons at the club and has worked with schaefer in the youth system since retiring in 2007 .
cologne 's local tabloid express cooed that " you ca n't get much more cologne than that ! "
the club says it 's not ruling out a higher-profile hire , but holding onto schaefer for a while at least has to be the best play at the moment .
the fans want cologne natives on the touchline , and so they shall have them .
let 's hope they can coach a little as well .

but for a coach who 's " one of their own , " like frontzeck or christoph daum in his recent run at cologne , it 's a perfect fit - even if they do n't win anything .
holding fast supporters seem to have determined that the base price of entry to coaching at their club is genuflection at the altar of tradition , a sort of fundamentalist fandom that seeks to purify the club of corrosive outside influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaefer 's cologne bona fides are unquestioned in this respect , cologne 's interim coach frank schaefer is off to a stellar start .
he has never led a senior side before , but fan darling lukas podolski pronounced his onetime youth team coach " a cologne man through and through . "
-lrb- it 's true - the 46-year-old schaefer has been working as a youth or reserve team coach at cologne for 20 of the past 26 years . -rrb-
for good measure , schaefer himself opened his maiden press conference by stating that he was " a cologne lad and fc guy too . "
he also chose as his assistant coach dirk lottner , a cologne native who played six seasons at the club and has worked with schaefer in the youth system since retiring in 2007 .
cologne 's local tabloid express cooed that " you ca n't get much more cologne than that ! "
the club says it 's not ruling out a higher-profile hire , but holding onto schaefer for a while at least has to be the best play at the moment .
the fans want cologne natives on the touchline , and so they shall have them .
let 's hope they can coach a little as well .

one has panicked and fired its coach , the other plans to stay the course . in the bundesliga , if you go six straight games without a win , or have only one three-pointer to your credit nine games into the season , you are liable to get fired .
like stuttgart 's ex-coach christian gross before him , fc cologne 's zvonimir soldo learned that lesson on sunday .
the billy goats parted ways with their croatian coach of a year-and-a-half at roughly the same time that they landed in last place , courtesy of the former cellar-dwellers stuttgart 's win over st. pauli .
now , news of a last place club sacking its coach rarely comes as a surprise , but when viewed alongside the goings on at another presently hapless club , borussia moenchengladbach , cologne 's move to let soldo go seems rash .
perhaps cologne can learn a lesson from their old rival .
gladbach is one rung higher up the bundesliga ladder than cologne at the moment , with six points from nine matches , but that does n't really tell the whole story .
the foals are , if anything , looking even worse than cologne at the moment .
the awfulness of gladbach 's defense is threatening to take on historic proportion .
with 27 goals allowed thus far , they are very nearly on pace to break tasmania berlin 's record of 108 for the season - a record that has stood for 45 years , and one that most assumed would never , ever be broken .
still , michael frontzeck is not out of a job .
the coach is scarcely even looking over his shoulder , and the fans are standing behind him .
deep-running roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frontzeck -lrb- r . -rrb- has been a loyal soldier at borussia moenchengladbach that he is sitting as pretty as he is , even in the midst of gladbach 's ugly form , is mostly down to his roots .
frontzeck 's managerial record - not only at gladbach , but in his prior stints at aachen and bielefeld as well - has been patchy .
but he was born in moenchengladbach , played nine seasons in three stints with the club , and understands how much borussia means to its fans .
frontzeck showed guts , and demonstrated how well he knows his club , after saturday 's humbling home loss to bremen .
gladbach 's hardcore support was baying for blood after the 4-1 loss , and many a manager would have tuned the jeers out and headed for the locker room .
frontzeck , though , saw an opportunity to circle the wagons , and climbed into the stands to hold an impromptu 15-minute question-and-answer session .
afterward , he told reporters that it had been a " comfortable conversation , " and not at all one where fans were " just looking for someone to blame . "
“ we all agreed that we can only get out of this situation together , ” he said .
“ that the fans are standing behind us is a good feeling . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tiny bald head in the middle of this picture ?
that 's frontzeck the contrast with cologne could not be starker .
soldo came to the club as a rising managerial star , on the back of a croatian title with dinamo zagreb , but also as an outsider - one who seemed miscast from the start , in that he never seemed to care about the club 's history or understand the club 's special relationship to its fans .
history 's burden perhaps more than any other clubs in the bundesliga , cologne and gladbach supporters are obsessed with history .
that 's because it 's just about all they 've got . gladbach 's rich past is well-known .
they won five league titles in the 1970s , and made it to another five european finals in that golden era for german football .
for many years , though , cologne too fielded a consistently good team .
in the first quarter-century of the bundesliga , the billy goats won the league twice and finished in the top eight all but four times .
then , in the 1990s , things began to fall apart at both clubs .
cologne finished second in 1990 , and made it to the german cup final in 1991 .
gladbach won the cup in 1995 .
since then , no titles at all , for either club .
moreover , gladbach has been relegated twice , and cologne four times in the past 13 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the haircuts show it 's been some time since cologne were in a cup final falling so far , so fast , and so hard has brought on a certain delusion among both sets of fans .
the older ones still think of their club as big and important , and the younger supporters have grown up in their elders ' echo chamber , weaned on the glories of yesteryear and expectant of a return to glory any minute now .
both clubs attract tens of thousands of fans to home matches irrespective of the side 's current form , and both are followed assiduously in the local press - who are only too happy to talk up a finish in the european places after two wins in a row , and call two straight losses a crisis .
the fishbowl atmosphere can overwhelm a coach who 's not prepared to play along , as the aggressively mild-mannered soldo never was .
but for a coach who 's " one of their own , " like frontzeck or christoph daum in his recent run at cologne , it 's a perfect fit - even if they do n't win anything .
holding fast supporters seem to have determined that the base price of entry to coaching at their club is genuflection at the altar of tradition , a sort of fundamentalist fandom that seeks to purify the club of corrosive outside influence .

on sunday , the cargo ship became the second vessel with german crew members in two days to be attacked by somali pirates .
the pirates gave up their attack after the crew shut down their boat . a german cargo ship seized by somali pirates off the coast of kenya is now free , according the vessel 's owners .
verena beckhusen , spokeswoman for the bremen-based shipping company beluga-reederei , said the cargo ship beluga fortune was free monday , a day after being taken hostage in the indian ocean , some 1,200 miles -lrb- 1,930 kilometers -rrb- east of mombasa , kenya .
the ship and its crew , including two german citizens , were continuing their planned journey to south africa , beckhusen said .
no crew members were injured , and the ship sustained only minor damage .
pirates had already given up pirates had already left the ship by the time british frigate montrose arrived at the scene monday after steaming 15 hours to beluga fortune 's aid .
all 16 crewmembers were safe , the beluga shipping company told the newspaper weser kurier .
the beluga fortune is now a success story of german shipping companies ' standard procedures of shutting down all power and hiding the crew when a ship is attacked .
the ship 's crew radioed at 7 a.m. on sunday that pirates were attempting to board .
they then immediately stopped the engine , blocked the fuel line and switched off all systems on the bridge - making it impossible for the pirates to move the ship .
" the cool-headed behavior ... of the beluga crew on board and the quick action of navy units ... left the pirates no other option than to give up their dream of a million -lsb- -euro -rsb- ransom and to flee , " beluga shipping said in a statement .
beluga shipping 's executive partner niels stolberg stressed that the crew 's training in handling stressful situations such as pirate takeovers had paid off .
" our precautions and concentrated training of the crew worked out very well , " stolberg said , adding , " our colleagues on board have gotten off lightly from this attack and have escaped with no more than a fright . "

some 200 protestors seized control of the depot at fos-sur-mer , believed to be the largest in southern france , as riot police looked on , according to news agency agence-presse france .
meanwhile , a depot in central france , at saint-pierre-des corps , was freed after a week of paralysis when around 30 demonstrators walked away from the site without incident .
strikes in the country 's oil industry and blockades of fuel depots have left 35 percent of gas stations in the paris area completely dry or out of at least one kind of fuel , a transport ministry spokeswoman said .
about one-third of gas stations in western france were in " real difficulty " and 10 to 15 percent in the rest of the country were empty , she added .
unions have already called for two more days of strikes , and university students are planning nationwide marches on tuesday in last-ditch efforts to stop the pension reform before a reconciliation between the two houses of parliament and a final vote by the national assembly expected wednesday .
sarkozy popularity suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has n't been able to stop protests - or his sinking approval sarkozy 's government insists that the pension reform , which will raise the minimum retirement age to 62 from 60 , is " inevitable " and the only way to fill an expected pension budget gap and reduce the country 's growing deficit .
but the opposition socialists say if they win presidential elections in 2012 , their candidate will restore the retirement age to 60 .
polls suggest a majority of french voters support or sympathize with the strikers , but jean-francois cope , leader of sarkozy 's ump party in parliament , blamed the widespread disruption on the work of a minority .
" strikes , protests , yes , but taking the economy hostage is intolerable , " he said in an interview with le parisien newspaper .
" most of the country is paralyzed by the actions of a handful of extremists .
everyone should understand that we have no other choice . "
as the unpopular pension reform plan moves closer to becoming law , sarkozy 's approval rating has dropped to an all-time low , dashing hopes that the legislative achievement could bring him a political comeback .
a poll conducted by the ifop institute and published in the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday showed only 29 percent of respondents were satisfied with sarkozy 's job performance .
that was down three points from september , and was a new low for the president since he took office in 2007 .
sarkozy and his allies are hoping that the ongoing protest and strike movement in opposition to the pension reform will die down as families leave their homes for the mid-term school holiday this week .

some 200 protestors seized control of the depot at fos-sur-mer , believed to be the largest in southern france , as riot police looked on , according to news agency agence-presse france .
meanwhile , a depot in central france , at saint-pierre-des corps , was freed after a week of paralysis when around 30 demonstrators walked away from the site without incident .
strikes in the country 's oil industry and blockades of fuel depots have left 35 percent of gas stations in the paris area completely dry or out of at least one kind of fuel , a transport ministry spokeswoman said .
about one-third of gas stations in western france were in " real difficulty " and 10 to 15 percent in the rest of the country were empty , she added .
unions have already called for two more days of strikes , and university students are planning nationwide marches on tuesday in last-ditch efforts to stop the pension reform before a reconciliation between the two houses of parliament and a final vote by the national assembly expected wednesday .
sarkozy popularity suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has n't been able to stop protests - or his sinking approval sarkozy 's government insists that the pension reform , which will raise the minimum retirement age to 62 from 60 , is " inevitable " and the only way to fill an expected pension budget gap and reduce the country 's growing deficit .
but the opposition socialists say if they win presidential elections in 2012 , their candidate will restore the retirement age to 60 .
polls suggest a majority of french voters support or sympathize with the strikers , but jean-francois cope , leader of sarkozy 's ump party in parliament , blamed the widespread disruption on the work of a minority .
" strikes , protests , yes , but taking the economy hostage is intolerable , " he said in an interview with le parisien newspaper .
" most of the country is paralyzed by the actions of a handful of extremists .
everyone should understand that we have no other choice . "
as the unpopular pension reform plan moves closer to becoming law , sarkozy 's approval rating has dropped to an all-time low , dashing hopes that the legislative achievement could bring him a political comeback .
a poll conducted by the ifop institute and published in the journal du dimanche newspaper on sunday showed only 29 percent of respondents were satisfied with sarkozy 's job performance .
that was down three points from september , and was a new low for the president since he took office in 2007 .
sarkozy and his allies are hoping that the ongoing protest and strike movement in opposition to the pension reform will die down as families leave their homes for the mid-term school holiday this week .

the website revealed some 400,000 confidential documents on the iraq war . british deputy prime minister nick clegg called sunday for an investigation into allegations against the british military found in iraq war documents leaked by whistle-blowing wikileaks .
the website on friday published some 400,000 confidential documents on the war in iraq , which suggest negligence on the part of uk military in several cases of civilian death and torture .
" we can bemoan how these leaks occurred , but i think the nature of the allegations made are extraordinarily serious .
they are distressing to read about and they are very serious , " clegg told the bbc in an interview .
condemning wikileaks the comments came after britain 's ministry of defense joined the pentagon in condemning the release of the classified documents , saying they could put the lives of british soldiers at risk .
wikileaks ' publication of the documents will make the job of british and allied troops " more difficult and more dangerous , " the ministry said saturday .
the documents , which wikileaks founder julian assange said reveal 15,000 more civilian deaths than were previously known about , will put britain in a difficult legal position , according to a solicitor working on behalf of iraqis who claim abuse by british forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy pm clegg called for an investigation phil shiner , of public interest lawyers , said there was a " huge and growing body of evidence about the killing , ill treatment and torture of iraqis while in uk custody . "
" some of these deaths will be in circumstances where the uk -lsb- has -rsb- a clear legal responsibility , " he added .
despite condemning publication of the leaked files , the ministry of defense said in a statement that it would " consider " the information if it revealed any new evidence .
denmark vows to scour documents meanwhile , denmark 's military announced sunday it would carefully study the leaked documents to see if they revealed any wrongdoing by danish soldiers . " we want to see the documents for ourselves and compare them to our own information , " said danish defense command spokesman torben kjedsen . danish defense minister gitte lillelund bech said she was pleased with the decision , although danish media report the files reveal negligence on the part of danish soldiers in cases where prisoners were tortured by iraqi police .

" " us and uk officials have insisted that no official record of civilian casualties exists but the logs record 66,081 non-combatant deaths out of a total of 109,000 fatalities , " the newspaper stated . the guardian speculated that wikileaks had received the material from the " same dissident us army intelligence analyst " who leaked material on afghanistan , which the site published in july .
wikileaks , however , has not revealed its source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange said the documents revealed war crimes wikileaks founder defends the release julian assange defended his site 's release of confidential documents against condemnation from us and uk authorities , saying " this disclosure is about the truth . "
" the first casualty of war is the truth .
we hope to correct some of that attack on the truth that occurred before the war , during the war , and which has continued on since the war officially concluded , " he said .
assange said the documents showed evidence of war crimes .
he also told al jazeera television the documents provided enough material for 40 wrongful killing lawsuits .
" the lessons of iraq can be applied to afghanistan and to other countries western governments may choose to invade , " said assange , who vowed to continue publishing leaked documents .
the death toll in iraq now stands at 150,000 , 80 percent of which were civilians , according to the organization iraq body count , which cooperated in the analysis of the released material .
the civilian deaths revealed by the leaked documents occurred as a result of " small incidents " occurring daily during the conflict , the organization 's head , john sloboda , said .
he added that the vast majority of civilian deaths had been caused by " internal violence " among iraqi factions .

the website revealed some 400,000 confidential documents on the iraq war . british deputy prime minister nick clegg called sunday for an investigation into allegations against the british military found in iraq war documents leaked by whistle-blowing wikileaks .
the website on friday published some 400,000 confidential documents on the war in iraq , which suggest negligence on the part of uk military in several cases of civilian death and torture .
" we can bemoan how these leaks occurred , but i think the nature of the allegations made are extraordinarily serious .
they are distressing to read about and they are very serious , " clegg told the bbc in an interview .
condemning wikileaks the comments came after britain 's ministry of defense joined the pentagon in condemning the release of the classified documents , saying they could put the lives of british soldiers at risk .
wikileaks ' publication of the documents will make the job of british and allied troops " more difficult and more dangerous , " the ministry said saturday .
the documents , which wikileaks founder julian assange said reveal 15,000 more civilian deaths than were previously known about , will put britain in a difficult legal position , according to a solicitor working on behalf of iraqis who claim abuse by british forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy pm clegg called for an investigation phil shiner , of public interest lawyers , said there was a " huge and growing body of evidence about the killing , ill treatment and torture of iraqis while in uk custody . "
" some of these deaths will be in circumstances where the uk -lsb- has -rsb- a clear legal responsibility , " he added .
despite condemning publication of the leaked files , the ministry of defense said in a statement that it would " consider " the information if it revealed any new evidence .
denmark vows to scour documents meanwhile , denmark 's military announced sunday it would carefully study the leaked documents to see if they revealed any wrongdoing by danish soldiers . " we want to see the documents for ourselves and compare them to our own information , " said danish defense command spokesman torben kjedsen . danish defense minister gitte lillelund bech said she was pleased with the decision , although danish media report the files reveal negligence on the part of danish soldiers in cases where prisoners were tortured by iraqi police .
us and uk ' turned a blind eye ' british newspaper the guardian , which had the documents in advance of their publication , said the leaks showed " us authorities failed to investigate hundreds of reports of abuse , torture , rape and even murder by iraqi police and soldiers whose conduct appears to be systematic and normally unpunished . " " us and uk officials have insisted that no official record of civilian casualties exists but the logs record 66,081 non-combatant deaths out of a total of 109,000 fatalities , " the newspaper stated . the guardian speculated that wikileaks had received the material from the " same dissident us army intelligence analyst " who leaked material on afghanistan , which the site published in july .
wikileaks , however , has not revealed its source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange said the documents revealed war crimes wikileaks founder defends the release julian assange defended his site 's release of confidential documents against condemnation from us and uk authorities , saying " this disclosure is about the truth . "
" the first casualty of war is the truth .
we hope to correct some of that attack on the truth that occurred before the war , during the war , and which has continued on since the war officially concluded , " he said .
assange said the documents showed evidence of war crimes .
he also told al jazeera television the documents provided enough material for 40 wrongful killing lawsuits .
" the lessons of iraq can be applied to afghanistan and to other countries western governments may choose to invade , " said assange , who vowed to continue publishing leaked documents .
the death toll in iraq now stands at 150,000 , 80 percent of which were civilians , according to the organization iraq body count , which cooperated in the analysis of the released material .
the civilian deaths revealed by the leaked documents occurred as a result of " small incidents " occurring daily during the conflict , the organization 's head , john sloboda , said .
he added that the vast majority of civilian deaths had been caused by " internal violence " among iraqi factions .

" it sounds crude , but we were just trying to get people on board , " recalls detlef hansen , the head of the national park . " we formed working groups with fishermen , with shepherds , with hunters , and let them have a say in the decision making . " in the end , it was conservationists who felt they were getting the short end of the stick and initially dismissed barschel 's plan as a sham . yet over the years , protection was extended : in 1990 a deal was struck to protect seal populations in the wadden sea – the first accord signed under the bonn convention on migratory species . today , that accord between germany , the netherlands and denmark is held up as a model for multilateral species protection programs . success has boiled down to " defining common objectives " and " working together " with all stakeholders , said jens enemark , secretary of the common wadden sea secretariat - the international organization tasked with facilitating cooperation in the wadden sea . this has meant identifying and mitigating the main human threats to the region , namely pollution , disturbance and habitat destruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the tide is out , visitors enjoy walking on the sea bed local dividends and it 's not just seals that have reaped the rewards , says detlef hansen .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservation stations have done their job well yet the wwf also says causes for concern remain . " the biggest blot on the national park is the oil exploration which is still taking place in the mittelplate oil field , in the southern part of the region , " roesner said , claiming that this disrupts wild geese in their molting areas , and can leave them unable to fly in summer . unsustainable levels of commercial fishing are an ongoing problem too , from wwf 's perspective , and on this score " something needs to change soon , " roesner says . within germany 's borders , financial considerations also loom . there is n't enough money to go round for rangers , and changes to germany 's system of compulsory military service , mean that there is likely to be a knock on effect for social work , as fewer young men opt for this alternative service – a useful source of labor for everything from medical care to nature conservation . despite these challenges , the wadden sea serves as a useful case-study for others seeking to strike a deal to save nature . author : werner junge , jennifer abramsohn editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the world struggles with agreements to reverse biodiversity loss , the wadden sea shines as an example of transnational conservation . the wadden sea is one of central europe 's most important nature reserves . the strip of north sea coast is home to the biggest contiguous area of mudflats in the world , and stretches from den helder in the netherlands to esbjerg in denmark via three german states . much of the wadden sea was listed as a unesco world heritage site in 2009 because it serves as a flourishing habitat for some 3,200 species of animals , provides an important way-station for migratory birds , supports a wide variety of plants among its salt marshes and has played a crucial role in restoring seal populations over the past two decades . today the wadden sea is seen as a model for promoting cross-border conservation , but the road to success was not straight forward . road to riches bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal populations are recovering thanks to a nurturing environment the wadden sea national park is really three parks divided between the german states of schleswig holstein , lower saxony and the city-state of hamburg . the oldest is the park established in germany 's northernmost state , schleswig-holstein , in 1985 . it was prompted by a dawning awareness that piecemeal legislation was proving inadequate at dealing with the growing impacts of industrial and agricultural waste , development and commercial expoitation on the region . at first , proposals for a park met with stiff resistance from locals , who feared for their hunting and fishing rights , resented impositions on their freedom to use the area and worried about an influx of tourists . yet through a mixture of compromise and consensus-building , the state 's then premier , uwe barschel , managed to build enough support to pass legislation . " it sounds crude , but we were just trying to get people on board , " recalls detlef hansen , the head of the national park . " we formed working groups with fishermen , with shepherds , with hunters , and let them have a say in the decision making . " in the end , it was conservationists who felt they were getting the short end of the stick and initially dismissed barschel 's plan as a sham . yet over the years , protection was extended : in 1990 a deal was struck to protect seal populations in the wadden sea – the first accord signed under the bonn convention on migratory species . today , that accord between germany , the netherlands and denmark is held up as a model for multilateral species protection programs . success has boiled down to " defining common objectives " and " working together " with all stakeholders , said jens enemark , secretary of the common wadden sea secretariat - the international organization tasked with facilitating cooperation in the wadden sea . this has meant identifying and mitigating the main human threats to the region , namely pollution , disturbance and habitat destruction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the tide is out , visitors enjoy walking on the sea bed local dividends and it 's not just seals that have reaped the rewards , says detlef hansen . " today , you stand on the dike and you realize that it has become a quiet , peaceful place - there 's no more bird hunting , no low-flying planes , and military maneuvers are history .
visitors , and also the inhabitants , can enjoy the blooming salt marshes , " hansen said . locals now overwhelmingly support the national park , and while jens enemark says conservation authorities continue to have different priorities to fishermen and others who depend upon the region for their livelihood , relations are far more cordial than they were two decades ago . indeed , the thriving environment has proved a boon for another industry . " more than two million guests a year spend vacation on the north sea coast of schleswig holstein , " said konstanze hoefling-hoff of the north sea tourism service . " we know from polls and headcounts that more than a million of them stop at the visitors- stations of the national parks , " with popular activities including " guided hikes on the mud flats and other excursions . " to prevent the region from being loved-to-death by over-eager visitors , the wadden sea has a unique partnership program , which ties together the national park service , volunteers , and conservation groups . the german branch of the world wildlife fund fro nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- praises the partnership . it says nature has been able to recuperate , as a result , and that at least in the tidal mud flats , species have ceased to die out . the north sea is also cleaner , and the animals in the mud flats are less frightened than they once were , according to hans-ulrich roesner , a spokesman for the wwf in husum , in northern germany . oil on the horizon ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservation stations have done their job well yet the wwf also says causes for concern remain . " the biggest blot on the national park is the oil exploration which is still taking place in the mittelplate oil field , in the southern part of the region , " roesner said , claiming that this disrupts wild geese in their molting areas , and can leave them unable to fly in summer . unsustainable levels of commercial fishing are an ongoing problem too , from wwf 's perspective , and on this score " something needs to change soon , " roesner says . within germany 's borders , financial considerations also loom . there is n't enough money to go round for rangers , and changes to germany 's system of compulsory military service , mean that there is likely to be a knock on effect for social work , as fewer young men opt for this alternative service – a useful source of labor for everything from medical care to nature conservation . despite these challenges , the wadden sea serves as a useful case-study for others seeking to strike a deal to save nature . author : werner junge , jennifer abramsohn editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many shipping lines are turning to private security firms for protection . when it comes to global shipping , there is no avoiding the gulf of aden , which leads between the failed state of somalia and yemen - a nation security analysts describe as at-risk .
these waters carry a significant share of the world 's wealth , including 11 percent of the world 's seaborne oil .
the 25,000 cargo ships that pass through the gulf of aden every year are tempting targets for heavily armed groups in somalia , who claim overfishing by foreign vessels has robbed them of their livelihoods . earlier this year the international maritime bureau warned that attacks on merchant shipping are on the rise .
european defense officials say somali pirates are currently holding 20 ships and more than 400 crew for ransom off the horn of africa .
more attacks , more attention with media attention snowballing and insurance premiums sky-rocketing , more and more shipping companies are turning to private security firms for protection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some companies believe there is little political will to deal with piracy one of them is international bodyguard and security agency -lrb- ibs -rrb- - a company founded by horst ruetten , formally of the german navy .
from his office in the port city of hamburg , ruetten delivers an impressive sales pitch : " we offer everything from risk assessment for ships through to advice about equipment – razor-wire and bullet-proof blankets , everything that can help protect the crew - all the way to training . "
ruetten also sends out teams of between five and seven men to guard the ships personally .
they are armed with what he describes as " lethal " and / or " non-lethal " weapons , depending on the shipping company 's wishes .
these teams cost several thousand euros a day .
operation atalanta there is of course a state military presence off the coast of somalia – operation atalanta , the official eu naval mission that occasionally makes the news when it storms hijacked ships and arrests pirates .
but juergen strohsal , of the hamburg-based cargo brokering company teutonia , says that the political will behind this intervention is too weak .
" there is support , but not sufficient , " he told deutsche welle .
" there are no results .
if they get some of the pirates , no-one really punishes them , and they come back in force .
i think the politicians have to do more about this , especially in our country . "
horst ruetten agrees , and points out something seldom mentioned in media reports about captured pirates : atalanta 's official mission is to protect world food program ships carrying aid to africa .
it is not meant to be a nautical police force for the gulf of aden , and generally intervenes only once a hijacking has taken place .
this has undoubtedly had a preventative effect , but prevention is not its purpose .
" in the anti-piracy conferences that happen every now and then , a lot of atalanta spokesmen have told shipping companies ' you have to do something about it .
we ca n't be everywhere at once , " ' ruetten says .
" so the shipping companies have to ask themselves what they can do .
that does n't happen enough . "
bildunterschrift : operation atalanta 's mission is to protect food shipments to somalia all mannequins on deck !
a recent survey of 110 german shipping companies by pwc -lrb- formerly pricewaterhouse coopers -rrb- found that 12 used private security agencies in some capacity .
ruetten believes this is not nearly enough , and that too many companies rely on improvised defense measures like strapping mannequins to strategic positions on deck to make a ship look like it is being guarded .
but the official line in the shipping industry is very cautious .
max johns , spokesman for the association of german ship-owners -lrb- vdr -rrb- , says that shipping companies are advised not introduce armed escorts on to their ships .
" by the law of the sea , only military personnel should act against pirates .
that is the first point , " johns says . " secondly we do n't know these private security teams .
we do n't know how good they are , and we do n't who to trust and who not to trust .
they might have a fire-fight with the pirates - our crews are not trained to act in a military or semi-military conflict . "
the fear is that if a security guard killed an innocent somali fisherman , it would cause a damaging legal headache for the shipping industry .
johns also questions how effective mercenaries really are when push comes to shove .
" they have n't proven successful , " he says .
" there were quite a few of those teams on board ships , and we had some incidents when those ships were boarded by pirates , and those people did n't help at all . " " " they did n't make any difference .
they even jumped overboard , because they did n't want to get caught by pirates , and they were picked up then later out of the water by the navy . "
johns is optimistic that vulnerable merchant vessels will soon have eu military personnel on board , but until then ruetten and his team of professionals will continue making profits by running the gauntlet in the gulf of aden .
