program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 26.07.2010 change is possible after all : reforming the united nations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has overcome differences to establish a new agency for women rich and poor nations showed this year that they could overcome deep divisions to create a long-overdue institution for women , writes silke weinlich .
the test now is whether it can perform to expectations . in early july 2010 the united nations -lrb- un -rrb- created a new entity for gender equality and the empowerment of women – to be known as un women .
it also adopted important resolutions aimed at improving the un organizations ' development cooperation .
the first you 've heard of it ?
that is a shame because these achievements show that the organization is capable of instituting reform and that multilateral action among 192 countries remains possible .
so what 's it all about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un chief ban ki-moon has come in for heavy criticism of his leadership recently un organizations like the development program -lrb- undp -rrb- , the children 's program -lrb- unicef -rrb- or the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- – to name but the three largest – are important multilateral actors .
they have a key role to play when it comes to implementing universally valid norms such as , for instance , human rights , gender equality and environmental standards .
along with their global , operative tasks they also contribute research studies to the development discourse -lrb- for example , the annual undp human development report -rrb- and engage in advocacy work on behalf of the most disadvantaged .
the fact that developing countries are involved on equal terms in the governance of un organizations means they are regarded as especially legitimate .
and that is why they are in a better position to engage in sensitive policy fields .
nevertheless , the un system is highly fragmented .
the numerous organizations often do not work well together , their fields of activity overlap and they ought to bring their individual strengths more to the fore .
these were the conclusions drawn in a report submitted by a high-level panel of experts in 2006 that recommended that the un should " deliver as one . "
the experts also felt that the un 's structures should be simplified , among other things in the fields of women and gender equality .
they recommended that the four institutions dealing with these issues should be combined to form a new organization in order to make them more visible and better able to assert themselves by bringing together resources and mandates .
slow process while western industrialized nations backed ideas to simplify un structures and to concentrate their areas of activity , some key developing countries and emerging economies regarded these plans with suspicion from the very outset .
in their eyes these steps would weaken the un , which on paper at least has a comprehensive mandate for economic and financial issues .
they feared that development policy would suffer further cuts in favor of the security agenda endorsed by the west , and emphasized that it was the un 's institutional and thematic variety that set it apart .
in view of their dissent as to the content of the majority of the experts ' suggestions , they insisted that the negotiations - and thus any possible compromises - should cover all issues .
the establishment of the new women 's organization , which many developing countries also backed , thus became dependent on consensus in other areas .
decisions , decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major developing nations are demanding a greater say in international affairs the most important decision that has been taken is that to establish un women .
the entity aims to be up and running by january 2011 .
its work will on the one hand be normative , that is it will continue developing existing international obligations and ensure they are observed and implemented across the world .
on the other hand , it will run operational programs for which it will have a budget of 500 million us dollars at its disposal .
other decisions are less spectacular but nevertheless important , namely those on improving the governance of the un development system , on harmonizing administrative procedures across the entire system , guaranteeing a reliable funding base in the future and in regard to an ongoing reform initiative in which the un family delivers as one in eight pilot countries .
reaching agreement the resolution was preceded by four years of negotiations .
it quickly became clear that no radical restructuring exercise would be possible , as consensus could only be reached on implementing successive small-scale reforms .
although the line of conflict traditionally ran between developing countries -lrb- g-77 -rrb- and industrialized nations , clear differences became apparent .
smaller , poorer countries like rwanda and tanzania as well as middle-income countries like vietnam and uruguay , in which bilateral development aid is gradually tapering off , have a particular interest in more coherent and effective cooperation with un organizations .
the positions adopted by a few ideologically- , motivated countries like cuba or emerging economies like india and egypt were primarily based on power politics and their attempts to prevent changes or achieve concessions .
the industrialized nations ' positions were more homogeneous .
during the very last phase of negotiations , however , the united states irritated the other countries by going it alone and making concessions on the new un women supervisory board .
ultimately , however , no-one wanted to stand in the way of the creation of an organization that had long been overdue .
what next ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 is losing ground to the g20 in terms of significance the resolution set an important milestone on the road to the reform of un development cooperation .
however , un women must now prove that it can be more than the sum of its individual parts .
appointing a well-known and authoritative personality from the south to the leadership position will play a key role when it comes to gaining acceptance for the organization 's work in developing countries , as well as for the generosity donor countries will now have to show .
despite the need to tighten budgetary belts , germany should contribute financially .
not only in order to increase its chances of being elected onto the security council in october 2010 , but also , in view of the recently announced cuts in contributions , to demonstrate that the un is still an important partner for germany .
the un remains an indispensable consensus-reaching and decision-making forum when it comes to pressing global challenges .
in countries of the south , the world organization 's development activities are key to gaining acceptance for its activities in the areas of security , or norm and standard setting .
also in the age of the g-20 , strengthening the un continues to be in germany 's interest .

french anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- chief pierre bordry has criticized the way tests are run .
" they are organized in such a way that the riders know about them beforehand , " he said .
the afld shadowed uci ’ s testing processes in 2009 , and accused world cycling 's governing body of showing favoritism towards the leading riders , like winner alberto contador .
bordry 's organization made a request to carry out its own drug tests on this year 's tour , which was turned down by wada .

the uci has sought to tighten up the testing procedure , employing chaperons to watch over riders from the finish line until after they have provided urine or blood samples .
cycling ’ s governing body also began a biological passport scheme in 2008 , where certain blood markers were monitored in every rider .

a spokesman for the uci refused to comment on criticism of its testing procedures .

the death toll now stands at 20 , and more than 500 people are still being treated for their injuries after panic broke out in a tunnel leading to the festival grounds on saturday afternoon .
duisburg mayor adolf sauerland , who defended what he called a " solid " security plan at a news conference on sunday and was pelted with rubbish by angry bystanders , has faced scathing criticism from several media outlets .
he resisted calls for his immediate resignation on monday and told public broadcaster wdr that he would address that issue when the time was right .
" i will be asking myself this question , there 's no doubt about that , " he said , adding that the main issue now was explaining saturday 's tragedy .
" and when we know what happened there , then we will answer this question .
that i promise . "
" if the city is guilty of anything then we will assume responsibility , " he said in a statement .
sauerland said a condolence book would remain available through the end of the month and that the city was working with church officials to plan a memorial service .
' consequences must be drawn urgently ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerland , right , has defended the city 's " solid " security plan on monday , german chancellor angela merkel said she expected a " scrupulously thorough " investigation into the tragedy , according to her spokesman ulrich wilhelm . " a full picture and a proper analysis of what happened and what mistakes were possibly made can however only be done once the investigation is completed , " he added . " consequences must be drawn urgently ...
i think it 's clear the security plans were not good , " said hannelore kraft , the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , in an interview on ard television . earlier monday , german prosecutors seized documents relating to the security planning of the event . rolf haferkamp , spokesman for the duisburg state prosecutors ' office , said he could not speak about the content of the numerous documents that were seized , but said the investigation of possible negligent manslaughter was ongoing . who 's to blame ? one theoretical explanation for the accident that quickly emerged in the press was that duisburg , a city in the former coal-mining ruhr region , was desperate to gain from the prestige of the love parade , and that city officials did not take security concerns seriously . the ruhr 2010 european capital of culture program has taken the lead in attracting such events and the program 's chief organizer , fritz pleitgen , said he felt " jointly responsible , but more in a moral sense . " " -lsb- the love parade -rsb- was offered to us as a project for the capital of culture program , " he told zdf public television .
" we accepted that , but we were not involved in financing or organizing the event . " the cologne-based daily newspaper koelner stadt-anzeiger also reported that the chief of the duisburg fire department told sauerland in writing that the location for the event - the city 's former freight rail station - was too small for the expected number of visitors . and the online edition of the news magazine der spiegel reported that an official document issued by the city of duisburg authorized only 250,000 people for the event - far short of the estimated 1.4 million who attended .
it also reportedly exempted the organizers from the minimal width of escape routes and from having fire brigade provisions .
bildunterschrift : organizers said the love parade would never take place again police unions point finger rainer wendt , head of the national police union , said police warnings about the dangers of holding the festival in duisburg were not heeded .
" i warned them a year ago that duisburg was not a suitable location for the love parade .
it 's too small and too cramped , " said wendt .
" but i was called a killjoy and a security fanatic . "
a report in the koelner stadt-anzeiger said that mayor sauerland gave the go-ahead for the event just hours before the start , despite concerns from police and fire officials .
however , frank richter , head of the state-level north rhine-westphalia police trade union , said there was currently no proof that city officials had ignored security concerns .
in an interview with deutschlandfunk radio , richter placed the blame on the event 's organizers .
" i find it unacceptable that those who are responsible for this event , like the organizer -lsb- rainer schaller -rsb- , said in the press conference that there would just be no more love parades , as if he had nothing to do with this whole thing . "

now the entrepreneur has become the obejct of public scrutiny . after a mass panic killed 19 people at the love parade techno music festival in duisburg on saturday , one of germany 's less conventional entrepreneurs has found himself in the public spotlight .
rainer schaller , who took over love parade in 2006 , owns a successful chain of fitness studios .
mcfit , as schaller 's chain is called , boasts prices as low as 16,90 euros per month .
it has 118 throughout germany , some 900,000 members , and a turnover of 134 million euros .
love parade was intended to serve as a marketing tool for the company , which plans to expand across europe .
41-year-old schaller 's success can in part be explained by his willingness to take risks .
according to the handelsblatt daily newspaper , schaller 's first fitness studio was an illegal operation which he kept amongst friends and operated in an attic above his parents ' supermarket outside of nuremberg .
he comes from a family of grocers who taught him the " mathematics and accounting " of running a business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 500 people were injured during the love parade mass panic self-made entrepreneur when schaller opened the first mcfit in wurzburg in 1997 , he did every job in the new business himself , from cleaning to training and administration tasks .
he advertised the new mcfit studio as being " now also in wurzburg , " giving the impression that it was part of a large , successful chain .
unlike most fitness chains in germany , mcfit 's strategy is to offer a barebones gym with limited classes and training staff and no extra amenities such as saunas .
customers have around-the-clock access to the machines , but showers cost 50 cents extra .
the concept proved popular , and schaller opened his second studio in 1998 .
in 2008 , the chain recruited ukrainian celebrity boxers vladimir und vitali klitschko to represent it , and in 2009 it opened its first studios in austria and spain .
in 2009 , he told the handelsblatt newspaper that mcfit 's interest in love parade was to " use a relatively small budget to gain a high recognition factor .
we spent a lot of time thinking about what kind of crazy thing we could do to make ourselves more well-known .
we chose love parade . "
condolences expressed schaller expressed his condolences at a press conference sunday , reading from a text and visibly upset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcfit was the main sponsor of the ill-fated love parade " the love parade was always a peaceful and joyous party that will now forever be overshadowed by yesterday 's tragic events .
out of respect for the victims , families and friends , we will discontinue the event .
the love parade is no more .
words are not enough to describe the extent of the shock i feel , " he said .
love parade was founded in 1989 by berlin dj matthias roeingh , also known as dr motte .
in some years it drew more than a million visitors , but planning and financing issues caused it to be cancelled in 2004 and 2005 .
the event was revived and relocated to the ruhr region in 2006 by lopavent , a schaller-owned company .
mcfit has sponsored it with 3 million euros per year ever since .

now the entrepreneur has become the obejct of public scrutiny . after a mass panic killed 19 people at the love parade techno music festival in duisburg on saturday , one of germany 's less conventional entrepreneurs has found himself in the public spotlight .
rainer schaller , who took over love parade in 2006 , owns a successful chain of fitness studios .
mcfit , as schaller 's chain is called , boasts prices as low as 16,90 euros per month .
it has 118 throughout germany , some 900,000 members , and a turnover of 134 million euros .
love parade was intended to serve as a marketing tool for the company , which plans to expand across europe .
41-year-old schaller 's success can in part be explained by his willingness to take risks .
according to the handelsblatt daily newspaper , schaller 's first fitness studio was an illegal operation which he kept amongst friends and operated in an attic above his parents ' supermarket outside of nuremberg .
he comes from a family of grocers who taught him the " mathematics and accounting " of running a business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 500 people were injured during the love parade mass panic self-made entrepreneur when schaller opened the first mcfit in wurzburg in 1997 , he did every job in the new business himself , from cleaning to training and administration tasks .
he advertised the new mcfit studio as being " now also in wurzburg , " giving the impression that it was part of a large , successful chain .
unlike most fitness chains in germany , mcfit 's strategy is to offer a barebones gym with limited classes and training staff and no extra amenities such as saunas .
customers have around-the-clock access to the machines , but showers cost 50 cents extra .
the concept proved popular , and schaller opened his second studio in 1998 .
in 2008 , the chain recruited ukrainian celebrity boxers vladimir und vitali klitschko to represent it , and in 2009 it opened its first studios in austria and spain .
in 2009 , he told the handelsblatt newspaper that mcfit 's interest in love parade was to " use a relatively small budget to gain a high recognition factor .
we spent a lot of time thinking about what kind of crazy thing we could do to make ourselves more well-known .
we chose love parade . "
condolences expressed schaller expressed his condolences at a press conference sunday , reading from a text and visibly upset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcfit was the main sponsor of the ill-fated love parade " the love parade was always a peaceful and joyous party that will now forever be overshadowed by yesterday 's tragic events .
out of respect for the victims , families and friends , we will discontinue the event .
the love parade is no more .
words are not enough to describe the extent of the shock i feel , " he said .
love parade was founded in 1989 by berlin dj matthias roeingh , also known as dr motte .
in some years it drew more than a million visitors , but planning and financing issues caused it to be cancelled in 2004 and 2005 .
the event was revived and relocated to the ruhr region in 2006 by lopavent , a schaller-owned company .
mcfit has sponsored it with 3 million euros per year ever since .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 26.07.2010 eu tackles e-waste anew through legislation , entrepreneurship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computers like these often end up in developing countries , including china , ghana , and other parts of sub-saharan africa brussels is spearheading a new effort to crackdown on loopholes in electronic waste management , while a new belgian tech company has become the first to receive fair-trade certification . no matter how cherished an electronic item is in life , most electronic gadgets end up at the dump - or , as they call it in belgium , at the container park . here , electronic waste - or e-waste - gets sorted into categories and theoretically gets taken apart , with hazardous substances removed by well-trained workers in protective gear .
the recyclable components are melted down and anything biodegradable gets sent off to be composted .
but the problem is that only a fraction of cast-off electronics in the european union actually see that fate .
european officials take up stronger measures a new report by the european parliament shows about 65 percent of the total amount of e-waste generated in the bloc gets turned in and sorted correctly , but after that things go downhill .
besides existing eu laws requiring collection and treatment , all eu member states have signed the basel convention , which outlaws the export of hazardous waste and requires e-waste to be treated as close to its origin as possible . but through loopholes , by claiming items are donations or functioning second-hand goods for re-sale - or by simply breaking the law - middlemen are making millions and making impoverished nations pay the price .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while currently holding the eu presidency , belgium is leading moves to tighten regulations on e-waste " we 've been clearly negligent because we have n't sent the right resources to fight illegal shipments , " said stephane arditi of the european environmental bureau , a brussels-based ngo .
" and that is something everybody is aware of , probably also ashamed of . "
she added that tightening existing laws will help , but it 's enforcement that 's really needed from the developed world .
mike anane , president of the league of environmental journalists in ghana , told researchers from the danish watchdog organization danwatch that his country is clearly being used as a convenient landfill for europe .
he noted the mountains of discarded computers , monitors and televisions that ghana has no way to recycle .
" some come under the guise of donations but when you examine the items , they do n't work , " anane said .
" it 's just a way to get rid of these computers from europe to africa . "
' of importance to all of us ' one of anane 's colleagues , maren swart is currently in accra , where she is investigating the levels of e-waste shipped to ghana either illegally or through the second-hand item loopholes .
" we have found computers from danish companies before in accra , " she said .
" they had a tag on them showing that they were from a school in denmark . "
the european parliament 's environment committee is now proposing more stringent standards that would require each member state to collect 85 percent of the waste it generates and to prove that the majority of the waste is treated within the country .
the full legislature will vote on the proposed changes in september .
belgium currently holds the eu presidency and has made sustainable materials management , including ethical waste treatment , a priority for the next six months .
joke schauvliege , the flemish environment minister , said the entire lifecycle of products needs to be considered . when possible , she said , the " cradle to cradle principle " should be applied , meaning that waste is used to create new products , rather than mountains of non-functioning monitors .
" this is a societal challenge on a large scale , " she said in dutch .
" these are things of importance to all of us .
it 's not just governments that need to deal with this , it 's also the business world , citizens and also think tanks , experts .
we need free-thinkers , forerunners . "
actually , schauvliege has some free-thinkers and forerunners right at home in belgium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united pepper sells these webcams made of kapok , cotton and mekong delta sand , all of which are natural products .
webcam casing created with natural fibers their names are marc aelbrecht , jean-pierre d 'haese and xavier petre and they left companies like alcatel and cisco to create united pepper .
now they design items like webcams and usb hubs that are largely biodegradable , with a cotton casing filled with a natural fiber called kapok and weighted with sand from the mekong river in vietnam , where the company 's manufacturing sites are located .
they 're awaiting the day when even the lens and cable can be made of natural materials , the men say , but for now they ensure that the non-green components are kept to a bare minimum and that every step of the process is transparent . xavier petre noted consumers are increasingly demanding that kind of information for ethical decision-making .
" when you put 50 euros on the table to buy a webcam you should know who is behind it and you should know what kind of material is used , " he said .
united pepper is also the first electronics producer in the world to be certified as " fair trade , " meaning it upholds standards of sustainability both in the components of its products and the workforce putting them together .
this type of certification , perhaps best known in agricultural and beauty products and clothing , does n't even exist yet in the electronics industry , so united pepper asked the uk-based ngo traidcraft to audit the company in order to document that the company 's practices meet a high ethical and environmental standard .
" we are becoming entrepreneurs in a new kind of economy , " d 'haese said .
" now is the time to make the values accepted by our market . "
and once you remove the tiny lens and cable from a united pepper webcam , the only " dirty " part of the disposal is the bed of mekong sand in which seeds in the natural kapok filling have been known to sprout .
so the user could then grow more kapok in his or her backyard .

besides existing eu laws requiring collection and treatment , all eu member states have signed the basel convention , which outlaws the export of hazardous waste and requires e-waste to be treated as close to its origin as possible . but through loopholes , by claiming items are donations or functioning second-hand goods for re-sale - or by simply breaking the law - middlemen are making millions and making impoverished nations pay the price .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while currently holding the eu presidency , belgium is leading moves to tighten regulations on e-waste " we 've been clearly negligent because we have n't sent the right resources to fight illegal shipments , " said stephane arditi of the european environmental bureau , a brussels-based ngo .
" and that is something everybody is aware of , probably also ashamed of . "
she added that tightening existing laws will help , but it 's enforcement that 's really needed from the developed world .
mike anane , president of the league of environmental journalists in ghana , told researchers from the danish watchdog organization danwatch that his country is clearly being used as a convenient landfill for europe .
he noted the mountains of discarded computers , monitors and televisions that ghana has no way to recycle .
" some come under the guise of donations but when you examine the items , they do n't work , " anane said .
" it 's just a way to get rid of these computers from europe to africa . "
' of importance to all of us ' one of anane 's colleagues , maren swart is currently in accra , where she is investigating the levels of e-waste shipped to ghana either illegally or through the second-hand item loopholes .
" we have found computers from danish companies before in accra , " she said .
" they had a tag on them showing that they were from a school in denmark . "
the european parliament 's environment committee is now proposing more stringent standards that would require each member state to collect 85 percent of the waste it generates and to prove that the majority of the waste is treated within the country .
the full legislature will vote on the proposed changes in september .
belgium currently holds the eu presidency and has made sustainable materials management , including ethical waste treatment , a priority for the next six months .
joke schauvliege , the flemish environment minister , said the entire lifecycle of products needs to be considered . when possible , she said , the " cradle to cradle principle " should be applied , meaning that waste is used to create new products , rather than mountains of non-functioning monitors .
" this is a societal challenge on a large scale , " she said in dutch .
" these are things of importance to all of us .
it 's not just governments that need to deal with this , it 's also the business world , citizens and also think tanks , experts .
we need free-thinkers , forerunners . "
actually , schauvliege has some free-thinkers and forerunners right at home in belgium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united pepper sells these webcams made of kapok , cotton and mekong delta sand , all of which are natural products .
webcam casing created with natural fibers their names are marc aelbrecht , jean-pierre d 'haese and xavier petre and they left companies like alcatel and cisco to create united pepper .
now they design items like webcams and usb hubs that are largely biodegradable , with a cotton casing filled with a natural fiber called kapok and weighted with sand from the mekong river in vietnam , where the company 's manufacturing sites are located .
they 're awaiting the day when even the lens and cable can be made of natural materials , the men say , but for now they ensure that the non-green components are kept to a bare minimum and that every step of the process is transparent . xavier petre noted consumers are increasingly demanding that kind of information for ethical decision-making .
" when you put 50 euros on the table to buy a webcam you should know who is behind it and you should know what kind of material is used , " he said .
united pepper is also the first electronics producer in the world to be certified as " fair trade , " meaning it upholds standards of sustainability both in the components of its products and the workforce putting them together .
this type of certification , perhaps best known in agricultural and beauty products and clothing , does n't even exist yet in the electronics industry , so united pepper asked the uk-based ngo traidcraft to audit the company in order to document that the company 's practices meet a high ethical and environmental standard .
" we are becoming entrepreneurs in a new kind of economy , " d 'haese said .
" now is the time to make the values accepted by our market . "
and , he added , once a webcam owner removes the tiny lens and cable from a united pepper webcam , the only " dirty " part of the disposal is the bed of mekong sand in which seeds in the natural kapok filling have been known to sprout .

but on its 200th birthday , the future of the industry is now under threat . in 2001 , uk foreign secretary robin cook proclaimed chicken tikka masala , a lightly-spiced , creamy , tomato based stew a " true british national dish " .
the south asian curry has earned a lot of fans in britain .
annually , curry sales in britain are estimated at around 3.5 billion pounds .
but new government immigration rules introduced last week under the conservative-liberal coalition could spell the end of the local curry house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chicken tikka masala is very popular in britain the new immigration rule is a five-tier immigration system . it is similar to the australian system , where the visa applicants must have certain number of points to enter the country .
the points are ascertained by the applicants ' qualifications , their earning potential and their english speaking skills .
under this new system it would be difficult for unskilled foreign workers to get a visa . unemployment for thousands it would now be very hard to get foreign staff for these restaurants , as bajloor rashid , president of the bangladesh caterers association explains .
" at the moment we are not running at full capacity , " he says .
" for the last five years we have had an acute shortage of 30,000 skilled workers in our curry industry .
we have been lobbying the government for so long so that we can get more and more skilled staff from south asia .
and now the government is putting a cap on it .
so it will seriously damage our industry and there will be lot of job losses as well . " the curry industry relies on foreign cooks , mostly from bangladesh .
the bangladesh caterers association employs 100,000 people and has about 12,000 bangladeshi restaurants in britain .
rashid says cooking curry is a special art and one can not simply employ local staff in curry houses .
" there is a cultural barrier , " he says .
" when they work with bengali or hindi speaking people there is a language problem .
they can not take the curry smell as much as we can .
i mean we love curry and the smell of curry , but they think the smell of curry makes their clothes stink . "

how can they put a limitation ?
we are going to lobby the government as much as we can and make sure that the government does not go for that rule . " prof. christian dustmann , head of the center for research and analysis of migration in london , explains the motive behind the cap : " the uk had experienced a period of very high immigration in the years between 2003 and 2008 .
and the period of high immigration was at the same time a period of unprecedented economic growth .
over that period the uk grew by about 3 percent .
the uk has since then been through recession .
however when the uk comes out of recession then the existence of a cap may prove detrimental to expanding the industries and the uk economy .

the test now is whether it can perform to expectations . in early july 2010 the united nations -lrb- un -rrb- created a new entity for gender equality and the empowerment of women – to be known as un women .
it also adopted important resolutions aimed at improving the un organizations ' development cooperation .
the first you 've heard of it ?
that is a shame because these achievements show that the organization is capable of instituting reform and that multilateral action among 192 countries remains possible .
so what 's it all about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un chief ban ki-moon has come in for heavy criticism of his leadership recently un organizations like the development program -lrb- undp -rrb- , the children 's program -lrb- unicef -rrb- or the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- – to name but the three largest – are important multilateral actors .
they have a key role to play when it comes to implementing universally valid norms such as , for instance , human rights , gender equality and environmental standards .
along with their global , operative tasks they also contribute research studies to the development discourse -lrb- for example , the annual undp human development report -rrb- and engage in advocacy work on behalf of the most disadvantaged .
the fact that developing countries are involved on equal terms in the governance of un organizations means they are regarded as especially legitimate .
and that is why they are in a better position to engage in sensitive policy fields .
nevertheless , the un system is highly fragmented .
the numerous organizations often do not work well together , their fields of activity overlap and they ought to bring their individual strengths more to the fore .
these were the conclusions drawn in a report submitted by a high-level panel of experts in 2006 that recommended that the un should " deliver as one . "
the experts also felt that the un 's structures should be simplified , among other things in the fields of women and gender equality .
they recommended that the four institutions dealing with these issues should be combined to form a new organization in order to make them more visible and better able to assert themselves by bringing together resources and mandates .
slow process while western industrialized nations backed ideas to simplify un structures and to concentrate their areas of activity , some key developing countries and emerging economies regarded these plans with suspicion from the very outset .
in their eyes these steps would weaken the un , which on paper at least has a comprehensive mandate for economic and financial issues .
they feared that development policy would suffer further cuts in favor of the security agenda endorsed by the west , and emphasized that it was the un 's institutional and thematic variety that set it apart .
in view of their dissent as to the content of the majority of the experts ' suggestions , they insisted that the negotiations - and thus any possible compromises - should cover all issues .
the establishment of the new women 's organization , which many developing countries also backed , thus became dependent on consensus in other areas .
decisions , decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major developing nations are demanding a greater say in international affairs the most important decision that has been taken is that to establish un women .
the entity aims to be up and running by january 2011 .
its work will on the one hand be normative , that is it will continue developing existing international obligations and ensure they are observed and implemented across the world .
on the other hand , it will run operational programs for which it will have a budget of 500 million us dollars at its disposal .
other decisions are less spectacular but nevertheless important , namely those on improving the governance of the un development system , on harmonizing administrative procedures across the entire system , guaranteeing a reliable funding base in the future and in regard to an ongoing reform initiative in which the un family delivers as one in eight pilot countries .
reaching agreement the resolution was preceded by four years of negotiations .
it quickly became clear that no radical restructuring exercise would be possible , as consensus could only be reached on implementing successive small-scale reforms .
although the line of conflict traditionally ran between developing countries -lrb- g-77 -rrb- and industrialized nations , clear differences became apparent .
smaller , poorer countries like rwanda and tanzania as well as middle-income countries like vietnam and uruguay , in which bilateral development aid is gradually tapering off , have a particular interest in more coherent and effective cooperation with un organizations .
the positions adopted by a few ideologically- , motivated countries like cuba or emerging economies like india and egypt were primarily based on power politics and their attempts to prevent changes or achieve concessions .
the industrialized nations ' positions were more homogeneous .
during the very last phase of negotiations , however , the united states irritated the other countries by going it alone and making concessions on the new un women supervisory board .
ultimately , however , no-one wanted to stand in the way of the creation of an organization that had long been overdue .
what next ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 is losing ground to the g20 in terms of significance the resolution set an important milestone on the road to the reform of un development cooperation .
however , un women must now prove that it can be more than the sum of its individual parts .
appointing a well-known and authoritative personality from the south to the leadership position will play a key role when it comes to gaining acceptance for the organization 's work in developing countries , as well as for the generosity donor countries will now have to show .
despite the need to tighten budgetary belts , germany should contribute financially .
not only in order to increase its chances of being elected onto the security council in october 2010 , but also , in view of the recently announced cuts in contributions , to demonstrate that the un is still an important partner for germany .
the un remains an indispensable consensus-reaching and decision-making forum when it comes to pressing global challenges .
in countries of the south , the world organization 's development activities are key to gaining acceptance for its activities in the areas of security , or norm and standard setting .
also in the age of the g-20 , strengthening the un continues to be in germany 's interest .

but this year ’ s love parade in duisburg ended in disaster , with 19 people killed and hundreds of others injured .
two days on , many questions are left unanswered . german prosecutors are continuing to look into allegations about lax safety measures at saturday 's love parade in duisburg , where 19 people died and hundreds of others were injured in a crush near a tunnel leading to the festival grounds .
survivors are demanding explanations for why security plans , described by duisburg mayor adolf sauerland as “ solid ” , went wrong .
only 250,000 visitors authorized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors are asking why organizers said just hours before the event started that 1.4 million revelers were expected .
but in its online edition , the german magazine spiegel cites an internal document saying that the festival had authorization only for 250,000 visitors .
another newspaper , the koelner stadt-anzeiger , reports that the mayor had ignored written warnings in october 2009 saying the grounds were too narrow for the expected crowds .
the head of germany 's police union , rainer wendt , told the mass circulation newspaper bild that he warned authorities a year ago of duisburg 's unsuitability as a venue for the love parade , as the city was too small and narrow .
how many were there ?
but there are conflicting reports on how many people were actually in duisburg to visit the festival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former cargo train station : too small as a venue ?
police have so far only confirmed that 105,000 visitors arrived by train .
an official in charge of emergency response , wolfgang rabe , said the site , the former cargo train station , had a capacity of up to 300,000 people and that it was never full at any time during the event .
however , as the last three love parades , in berlin , essen and dortmund , have all had more than a million visitors , some argue that there was no reason to expect fewer this year .
who or whatever was to blame for the catastrophe , however , one thing seems certain : the love parade , which began in 1989 in berlin , has taken place for the last time .
organizer rainer schaller told a news conference in duisburg on sunday that the event would be discontinued out of respect for the victims , their families and friends .
but what will go on for a long time to come are questions about how such a tragedy could occur – and how to prevent something like it from ever happening again .

however , as the last three love parades , in berlin , essen and dortmund , have all had more than a million visitors , some argue that there was no reason to expect fewer this year .
who or whatever was to blame for the catastrophe , however , one thing seems certain : the love parade , which began in 1989 in berlin , has taken place for the last time .
organizer rainer schaller told a news conference in duisburg on sunday that the event would be discontinued out of respect for the victims , their families and friends .

opinion is also divided within chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union . german chancellor angela merkel 's governing coalition has been put on notice that it will face a fight over any change to the law on nuclear energy without approval from the country 's upper house of parliament .
green party leader claudia roth threatened on sunday to press for a judicial review at the germany 's constitutional court if the government moved to extend the operational lifetimes of nuclear power plants without consent from the bundesrat .
speaking to public broadcaster ard , roth said that a number of germany 's state governments were unhappy about a proposed delay to the closure dates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leader roth says several states oppose a change the deputy premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , sylvia loehrmann , also said that the government could expect what she described as " bitter resistance " from that state 's coalition , which is made up of the spd and her green party .
" we will exhaust every legal possibility , right up to the constitutional court , " the green party 's loehrmann told the tagesspiegel newspaper on sunday .
according to a law passed in 2002 by the then-ruling spd and the green coalition , all of germany 's nuclear power plants are to go off line by 2022 .
chancellor merkel 's government has said that it intends to extend the deadline by a period that has yet to be determined .

environment minister norbert roettgen of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , argued for a new limited nuclear plant extension in the monday edition of bremen 's weser kurier , stressing that nuclear power was only needed until alternatives could be found .
" it is a very rational approach , which is linked with enormous economic opportunities for germany .
people in germany understand that , better apparently than so many critics . "
in the same newspaper 's online edition on sunday , baden wuertemberg 's cdu premier , stephan mappus , who wants to see the final shut down date extended by 15 years , criticized roettgen for not adopting a clearer line in favor of an extension .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 26.07.2010 eu tackles e-waste anew through legislation , entrepreneurship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computers like these often end up in developing countries , including china , ghana , and other parts of sub-saharan africa brussels is spearheading a new effort to crackdown on loopholes in electronic waste management , while a new belgian tech company has become the first to receive fair-trade certification . no matter how cherished an electronic item is in life , most electronic gadgets end up at the dump - or , as they call it in belgium , at the container park . here , electronic waste - or e-waste - gets sorted into categories and theoretically gets taken apart , with hazardous substances removed by well-trained workers in protective gear .
the recyclable components are melted down and anything biodegradable gets sent off to be composted .
but the problem is that only a fraction of cast-off electronics in the european union actually see that fate .
european officials take up stronger measures a new report by the european parliament shows about 65 percent of the total amount of e-waste generated in the bloc gets turned in and sorted correctly , but after that things go downhill .
besides existing eu laws requiring collection and treatment , all eu member states have signed the basel convention , which outlaws the export of hazardous waste and requires e-waste to be treated as close to its origin as possible . but through loopholes , by claiming items are donations or functioning second-hand goods for re-sale - or by simply breaking the law - middlemen are making millions and making impoverished nations pay the price .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while currently holding the eu presidency , belgium is leading moves to tighten regulations on e-waste " we 've been clearly negligent because we have n't sent the right resources to fight illegal shipments , " said stephane arditi of the european environmental bureau , a brussels-based ngo .
" and that is something everybody is aware of , probably also ashamed of . "
she added that tightening existing laws will help , but it 's enforcement that 's really needed from the developed world .
mike anane , president of the league of environmental journalists in ghana , told researchers from the danish watchdog organization danwatch that his country is clearly being used as a convenient landfill for europe .
he noted the mountains of discarded computers , monitors and televisions that ghana has no way to recycle .
" some come under the guise of donations but when you examine the items , they do n't work , " anane said .
" it 's just a way to get rid of these computers from europe to africa . "
' of importance to all of us ' one of anane 's colleagues , maren swart is currently in accra , where she is investigating the levels of e-waste shipped to ghana either illegally or through the second-hand item loopholes .
" we have found computers from danish companies before in accra , " she said .
" they had a tag on them showing that they were from a school in denmark . "
the european parliament 's environment committee is now proposing more stringent standards that would require each member state to collect 85 percent of the waste it generates and to prove that the majority of the waste is treated within the country .
the full legislature will vote on the proposed changes in september .
belgium currently holds the eu presidency and has made sustainable materials management , including ethical waste treatment , a priority for the next six months .
joke schauvliege , the flemish environment minister , said the entire lifecycle of products needs to be considered . when possible , she said , the " cradle to cradle principle " should be applied , meaning that waste is used to create new products , rather than mountains of non-functioning monitors .
" this is a societal challenge on a large scale , " she said in dutch .
" these are things of importance to all of us .
it 's not just governments that need to deal with this , it 's also the business world , citizens and also think tanks , experts .
we need free-thinkers , forerunners . "
actually , schauvliege has some free-thinkers and forerunners right at home in belgium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united pepper sells these webcams made of kapok , cotton and mekong delta sand , all of which are natural products .
webcam casing created with natural fibers their names are marc aelbrecht , jean-pierre d 'haese and xavier petre and they left companies like alcatel and cisco to create united pepper .
now they design items like webcams and usb hubs that are largely biodegradable , with a cotton casing filled with a natural fiber called kapok and weighted with sand from the mekong river in vietnam , where the company 's manufacturing sites are located .
they 're awaiting the day when even the lens and cable can be made of natural materials , the men say , but for now they ensure that the non-green components are kept to a bare minimum and that every step of the process is transparent . xavier petre noted consumers are increasingly demanding that kind of information for ethical decision-making .
" when you put 50 euros on the table to buy a webcam you should know who is behind it and you should know what kind of material is used , " he said .
united pepper is also the first electronics producer in the world to be certified as " fair trade , " meaning it upholds standards of sustainability both in the components of its products and the workforce putting them together .
this type of certification , perhaps best known in agricultural and beauty products and clothing , does n't even exist yet in the electronics industry , so united pepper asked the uk-based ngo traidcraft to audit the company in order to document that the company 's practices meet a high ethical and environmental standard .
" we are becoming entrepreneurs in a new kind of economy , " d 'haese said .
" now is the time to make the values accepted by our market . "
and once you remove the tiny lens and cable from a united pepper webcam , the only " dirty " part of the disposal is the bed of mekong sand in which seeds in the natural kapok filling have been known to sprout .
so the user could then grow more kapok in his or her backyard .

opinion is also divided within chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union . german chancellor angela merkel 's governing coalition has been put on notice that it will face a fight over any change to the law on nuclear energy without approval from the country 's upper house of parliament .
green party leader claudia roth threatened on sunday to press for a judicial review at the germany 's constitutional court if the government moved to extend the operational lifetimes of nuclear power plants without consent from the bundesrat .
speaking to public broadcaster ard , roth said that a number of germany 's state governments were unhappy about a proposed delay to the closure dates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leader roth says several states oppose a change the deputy premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , sylvia loehrmann , also said that the government could expect what she described as " bitter resistance " from that state 's coalition , which is made up of the spd and her green party .
" we will exhaust every legal possibility , right up to the constitutional court , " the green party 's loehrmann told the tagesspiegel newspaper on sunday .
according to a law passed in 2002 by the then-ruling spd and the green coalition , all of germany 's nuclear power plants are to go off line by 2022 .
chancellor merkel 's government has said that it intends to extend the deadline by a period that has yet to be determined .
until recently , it had been thought that any legal change would need to be approved by the bundesrat , germany 's upper house , which represents country 's 16 states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court may ultimately decide the matter however , after the may election in north rhine-westphalia , the center-right coalition lost its majority in the upper chamber .
soon afterward , merkel 's chief of staff , ronald pofalla , announced possible plans to bypass the bundesrat entirely - infuriating opposition parties .
whether or not the government needs the agreement of the bundesrat is not clear . dissent within coalition opinion within merkel 's cdu is also divided . the cdu premier of the state of saarland , peter mueller , has questioned the need for an extension .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister norbert roettgen is seeking a consensus " we need an energy supply that is safe , sustainable and affordable , " mueller said in sunday 's edition of the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" i believe that we would be able to achieve that without the extension of the lifetimes of nuclear power plants . "
environment minister norbert roettgen of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , argued for a new limited nuclear plant extension in the monday edition of bremen 's weser kurier , stressing that nuclear power was only needed until alternatives could be found .
" it is a very rational approach , which is linked with enormous economic opportunities for germany .
people in germany understand that , better apparently than so many critics . "
in the same newspaper 's online edition on sunday , baden wuertemberg 's cdu premier , stephan mappus , who wants to see the final shut down date extended by 15 years , criticized roettgen for not adopting a clearer line in favor of an extension .

love parade tragedy news of the deaths at the love parade honestly made me sad .
i offer my condolences to chancellor merkel , her fellow germans and everyone else affected by the tragedy . - paul , us unfortunately the blame must lie with organizers , council and police and whoever signed off on an entrance via a huge tunnel .
surely the crowd could have been channelled far more easily via fencing through there than just letting them into the whole width of it - which meant people had nowhere to go .
if the entrance was actually at the other end of the tunnel , this would n't have happened once the venue filled up and the crowd could have been stopped before entering .
such a tragedy at an amazing event meant to celebrate music and peace . - simon , australia clearly the authorities are to blame for this tragedy .
it is they who have the expertise , the total authority and legal responsibility to decide if a festival venue is safe for the public to attend .
this is not within the expertise of commercial festival organizers .
the final decision is with city and police experts .
there is already ample evidence that the authorities were more interested in corralling the crowd into a small area , the usual state control freak mentality , than planning for crowd overflow and emergency exits and entrances .
it is a disgrace that parallels the inexcusable mistakes at duesseldorf airport 's fire where the rigid application of rules instead of common sense prevented the airport fire service from attending the fire and the subsequent loss of life .
no doubt the blame shall be pushed on to others as it was after duesseldorf , a hapless welder , there as i recall .
i speak with some authority as the uk is riddled with the same over-organized incompetence .
i hope heads roll over this disaster , resignations should be called for .
i was personally closer to this tragedy than was comfortable as my german son was at the festival but , upon seeing the potential for disaster given the mass overcrowding , decided to leave as thankfully did his friends .
in closing , i do not wish this to be vindictive of those involved , but hope with respect to all those people who lost their lives that we can learn from this tragedy to prevent its recurrence . - j. north , great britain i 'm a big fan of germany , but if an investigation is not launched into how a festival of 1 million in an open space that was held in berlin was transferred to a backwater that has experience of mostly classical music events and has a population of just 500,000 in a confined space that holds just 500,000 then germany will be deservedly a laughing stock .
germany needs to seriously question the city authorities that licensed this set up .
words fail me .
it 's not what we expect of germany at all .
to me it seems a disaster that was waiting to happen . - fergal barry via facebook it 's the organizers fault .
in 10 days the heavy metal event " wacken " will take place in wacken .
let 's hope they will organize it much better . - markus , via facebook from germany this is good that the investigation has started and i am sure that soon someone will be officially guilty .
but this is only the administration part .
we all need to ask ourselves : who will bring back the people who are dead now ?
i would like to send my appeal to all organizers for such events , please take this case in seriously and do not let it happen again . - mesar via facebook i think it 's the fault of the organizers and the people as well .
they should n't have used a tunnel for letting thousands of people through it , and people do not know when to stop pushing when they are moving forward in large groups .
people get trapped in a closed space , start panicking , and thus , the result .
wacken is much better organized because it 's at an open space , if something happens people can simply jump over the fences , and they 're off .

i offer my condolences to chancellor merkel , her fellow germans and everyone else affected by the tragedy . - paul , us unfortunately the blame must lie with organizers , council and police and whoever signed off on an entrance via a huge tunnel .
surely the crowd could have been channelled far more easily via fencing through there than just letting them into the whole width of it - which meant people had nowhere to go .
if the entrance was actually at the other end of the tunnel , this would n't have happened once the venue filled up and the crowd could have been stopped before entering .
such a tragedy at an amazing event meant to celebrate music and peace . - simon , australia clearly the authorities are to blame for this tragedy .
it is they who have the expertise , the total authority and legal responsibility to decide if a festival venue is safe for the public to attend .
this is not within the expertise of commercial festival organizers .
the final decision is with city and police experts .
there is already ample evidence that the authorities were more interested in corralling the crowd into a small area , the usual state control freak mentality , than planning for crowd overflow and emergency exits and entrances .
it is a disgrace that parallels the inexcusable mistakes at duesseldorf airport 's fire where the rigid application of rules instead of common sense prevented the airport fire service from attending the fire and the subsequent loss of life .
no doubt the blame shall be pushed on to others as it was after duesseldorf , a hapless welder , there as i recall .
i speak with some authority as the uk is riddled with the same over-organized incompetence .
i hope heads roll over this disaster , resignations should be called for .
i was personally closer to this tragedy than was comfortable as my german son was at the festival but , upon seeing the potential for disaster given the mass overcrowding , decided to leave as thankfully did his friends .
in closing , i do not wish this to be vindictive of those involved , but hope with respect to all those people who lost their lives that we can learn from this tragedy to prevent its recurrence . - j. north , great britain i 'm a big fan of germany , but if an investigation is not launched into how a festival of 1 million in an open space that was held in berlin was transferred to a backwater that has experience of mostly classical music events and has a population of just 500,000 in a confined space that holds just 500,000 then germany will be deservedly a laughing stock .
germany needs to seriously question the city authorities that licensed this set up .
words fail me .
it 's not what we expect of germany at all .
to me it seems a disaster that was waiting to happen . - fergal barry via facebook it 's the organizers fault .
in 10 days the heavy metal event " wacken " will take place in wacken .
let 's hope they will organize it much better . - markus , via facebook from germany this is good that the investigation has started and i am sure that soon someone will be officially guilty .
but this is only the administration part .
we all need to ask ourselves : who will bring back the people who are dead now ?
i would like to send my appeal to all organizers for such events , please take this case in seriously and do not let it happen again . - mesar via facebook i think it 's the fault of the organizers and the people as well .
they should n't have used a tunnel for letting thousands of people through it , and people do not know when to stop pushing when they are moving forward in large groups .
people get trapped in a closed space , start panicking , and thus , the result .
wacken is much better organized because it 's at an open space , if something happens people can simply jump over the fences , and they 're off .
unlike a tunnel where they are trapped . - lena , the netherlands compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but there are still security concerns and plans to investigate . the german defense ministry on monday criticized the leak of around 92,000 classified us military documents on the afghanistan war , but said the news value was rather limited .
the german news magazine spiegel as well as the new york times and the guardian newspapers at the weekend printed excerpts of the documents , which were released by the wikileaks website .
" obtaining and releasing documents , some of them secret , on such a scale is a highly questionable practice since it could affect the national security of nato allies and the whole nato mission , " defense ministry spokesman christian dienst said . " we 're in the process of analyzing the material so as to find out whether the security of our german troops on the ground is affected in any way . "
german foreign minister guido westerwelle also called for further scrutiny of the documents .
at an eu foreign ministers ’ meeting in brussels , westerwelle said the documents , which contain claims of concealed civilian casualties , had given him " comfort in my position , which consisted of never talking up the situation in afghanistan , which is exceptionally serious . "
attacks on the rise dienst confirmed that reports about a drastic increase of taliban attacks on allied troops were true .
he said that in the course of this year alone there had been close to 60 armed attacks on the german isaf contingent alone – almost triple the the figures available for 2007 and the years before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers are based largely in northern afghanistan wikileaks claimed that us and nato forces had increasingly been confined to reacting to the taleban 's operations and strategy rather than actively pursuing a policy of their own .
the joint leader of germany 's opposition green party , claudia roth , told the media on monday she did n't sense an often-cited new strategy of the allied forces in afghanistan at all .
killing a priority ?
" the wikileaks documents bear out just how dramatic the situation in afghanistan is , " roth said .
" but they also show the range of means the allies resort to in their fight for more stability . "
roth referred to classified documents highlighting the us special forces ' capture-and-kill operations , including manhunts where the killing of innocent people is seen as mere collateral damage .
according to the documents , 300 soldiers from the elite us 373 task force are located in the german camp at masar-i-sharif in the north of afghanistan .
their major task is the killing of high-ranking taliban leaders .
the sources available to wikileaks do not specify whether any german officers are involved in the planning or implementing of such targeted killings .
and the defense ministry in berlin was unwilling to shed any light on this issue .
" as far as the us task force is concerned , it 's in the nature of things that their operations remain secret , " christian dienst said .
" this means that only a very small circle of people is in the know about any details of these operations . "
everything said before ?
wikileaks knows that much of the information provided is not totally new .
but it claims it has got hold of the most comprehensive description of an armed conflict ever .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spiegel has looked into us special forces ' operations before wikileaks is a web platform which claims to be the first intelligence agency of the people .
since its founding in december 2006 it has called on potential whistleblowers from all over the world to make anonymous contributions and provide mostly classified information .
so far , people have sent about 1.2 million such documents to the web platform .
among wikileaks ' best-known scoops was the posting of a video depicting a us helicopter strike in baghdad in 2007 .
the footage showed how about a dozen civilians were gunned down , among them two employees from the reuters news agency .
in 2009 , the website first acquired international recognition when it published secret documents from a multinational shipping company , implicating the firm in toxic waste dumping in the ivory coast .

but there are still security concerns and plans to investigate . the german defense ministry on monday criticized the leak of around 92,000 classified us military documents on the afghanistan war , but said the news value was rather limited .
the german news magazine spiegel as well as the new york times and the guardian newspapers at the weekend printed excerpts of the documents , which were released by the wikileaks website .
" obtaining and releasing documents , some of them secret , on such a scale is a highly questionable practice since it could affect the national security of nato allies and the whole nato mission , " defense ministry spokesman christian dienst said . " we 're in the process of analyzing the material so as to find out whether the security of our german troops on the ground is affected in any way . "
german foreign minister guido westerwelle also called for further scrutiny of the documents .
at an eu foreign ministers ’ meeting in brussels , westerwelle said the documents , which contain claims of concealed civilian casualties , had given him " comfort in my position , which consisted of never talking up the situation in afghanistan , which is exceptionally serious . "
attacks on the rise dienst confirmed that reports about a drastic increase of taliban attacks on allied troops were true .
he said that in the course of this year alone there had been close to 60 armed attacks on the german isaf contingent alone – almost triple the the figures available for 2007 and the years before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers are based largely in northern afghanistan wikileaks claimed that us and nato forces had increasingly been confined to reacting to the taleban 's operations and strategy rather than actively pursuing a policy of their own .
the joint leader of germany 's opposition green party , claudia roth , told the media on monday she did n't sense an often-cited new strategy of the allied forces in afghanistan at all .
killing a priority ?
" the wikileaks documents bear out just how dramatic the situation in afghanistan is , " roth said .
" but they also show the range of means the allies resort to in their fight for more stability . "
roth referred to classified documents highlighting the us special forces ' capture-and-kill operations , including manhunts where the killing of innocent people is seen as mere collateral damage .
according to the documents , 300 soldiers from the elite us 373 task force are located in the german camp at masar-i-sharif in the north of afghanistan .
their major task is the killing of high-ranking taliban leaders .
the sources available to wikileaks do not specify whether any german officers are involved in the planning or implementing of such targeted killings .
and the defense ministry in berlin was unwilling to shed any light on this issue .
" as far as the us task force is concerned , it 's in the nature of things that their operations remain secret , " christian dienst said .
" this means that only a very small circle of people is in the know about any details of these operations . "
everything said before ?
wikileaks knows that much of the information provided is not totally new .
but it claims it has got hold of the most comprehensive description of an armed conflict ever .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spiegel has looked into us special forces ' operations before wikileaks is a web platform which claims to be the first intelligence agency of the people .
since its founding in december 2006 it has called on potential whistleblowers from all over the world to make anonymous contributions and provide mostly classified information .
so far , people have sent about 1.2 million such documents to the web platform .
among wikileaks ' best-known scoops was the posting of a video depicting a us helicopter strike in baghdad in 2007 .
the footage showed how about a dozen civilians were gunned down , among them two employees from the reuters news agency .
in 2009 , the website first acquired international recognition when it published secret documents from a multinational shipping company , implicating the firm in toxic waste dumping in the ivory coast .

tehran has condemned the measures but at the same time signalled it was willing to resume negotiations over its nuclear program . european union foreign ministers meeting in brussels monday have approved new sanctions on iran over its nuclear program .
in a surprise move , tehran shortly afterwards said it was prepared to return to negotiations without conditions , according to the country 's official news agency . at the heart of the sanctions is the concern that iran 's controversial uranium enrichment programme is not - as tehran claims - for civilian purpose , but rather intended to develop nuclear weapons . " today we sent quite a powerful message to iran that their nuclear programme is a cause for serious and growing concern to us , " the eu 's foreign policy chief , catherine ashton said . an obligation for transparency the new restrictions are likely to hit the backbone of iran 's economy - foreign trade , financial services and the oil and gas sector .
officials have described the measures as the toughest sanctions the european union has ever adopted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle said iran needs to comply with international calls for more transparency the measures are intended to block oil and gas investment and undermine tehran 's refining and natural gas capabilities .
they also ban the export to iran of dual-use goods that can be used both for civilian and military purposes . the sanctions will also further limit the activities of iranian trading banks and insurers , including restrictions on money transfers to iran . " of course iran has the right to use nuclear technology for civilian purposes , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle said . " but that also means that of course there is an obligation for transparency .
a nuclear armed iran is something that we can not accept . " iran prepared to resume talks iran has denounced the new sanctions as confrontational and said they would only further damage the already difficult relations with brussels . but tehran has at the same time signalled willingness to return to negotiations .
the country 's envoy to the iaea in vienna on monday suggested talks should be resumed . the eu 's catherine ashton welcomed the announcement but said she wanted to see the details first . " as far as i can see this is to be welcomed ... but we need to study the details , " she told reporters at a news briefing . the last high-level talks between iran and the six world powers – germany , britain , china , france , russia and the us – were held in geneva in october 2009 .

opinion is also divided within chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union . german chancellor angela merkel 's governing coalition has been put on notice that it will face a fight over any change to the law on nuclear energy without approval from the country 's upper house of parliament .
green party leader claudia roth threatened on sunday to press for a judicial review at the germany 's constitutional court if the government moved to extend the operational lifetimes of nuclear power plants without consent from the bundesrat .
speaking to public broadcaster ard , roth said that a number of germany 's state governments were unhappy about a proposed delay to the closure dates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leader roth says several states oppose a change the deputy premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , sylvia loehrmann , also said that the government could expect what she described as " bitter resistance " from that state 's coalition , which is made up of the spd and her green party .
" we will exhaust every legal possibility , right up to the constitutional court , " the green party 's loehrmann told the tagesspiegel newspaper on sunday .
according to a law passed in 2002 by the then-ruling spd and the green coalition , all of germany 's nuclear power plants are to go off line by 2022 .
chancellor merkel 's government has said that it intends to extend the deadline by a period that has yet to be determined .
until recently , it had been thought that any legal change would need to be approved by the bundesrat , germany 's upper house , which represents country 's 16 states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court may ultimately decide the matter however , after the may election in north rhine-westphalia , the center-right coalition lost its majority in the upper chamber .
soon afterward , merkel 's chief of staff , ronald pofalla , announced possible plans to bypass the bundesrat entirely - infuriating opposition parties .
whether or not the government needs the agreement of the bundesrat is not clear . dissent within coalition opinion within merkel 's cdu is also divided . the cdu premier of the state of saarland , peter mueller , has questioned the need for an extension .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister norbert roettgen is seeking a consensus " we need an energy supply that is safe , sustainable and affordable , " mueller said in sunday 's edition of the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" i believe that we would be able to achieve that without the extension of the lifetimes of nuclear power plants . "
environment minister norbert roettgen of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , argued for a new limited nuclear plant extension in the monday edition of bremen 's weser kurier , stressing that nuclear power was only needed until alternatives could be found .
" it is a very rational approach , which is linked with enormous economic opportunities for germany .
people in germany understand that , better apparently than so many critics . "
in the same newspaper 's online edition on sunday , baden wuertemberg 's cdu premier , stephan mappus , who wants to see the final shut down date extended by 15 years , criticized roettgen for not adopting a clearer line in favor of an extension .

opinion is also divided within chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union . german chancellor angela merkel 's governing coalition has been put on notice that it will face a fight over any change to the law on nuclear energy without approval from the country 's upper house of parliament .
green party leader claudia roth threatened on sunday to press for a judicial review at the germany 's constitutional court if the government moved to extend the operational lifetimes of nuclear power plants without consent from the bundesrat .
speaking to public broadcaster ard , roth said that a number of germany 's state governments were unhappy about a proposed delay to the closure dates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leader roth says several states oppose a change the deputy premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , sylvia loehrmann , also said that the government could expect what she described as " bitter resistance " from that state 's coalition , which is made up of the spd and her green party .
" we will exhaust every legal possibility , right up to the constitutional court , " the green party 's loehrmann told the tagesspiegel newspaper on sunday .
according to a law passed in 2002 by the then-ruling spd and the green coalition , all of germany 's nuclear power plants are to go off line by 2022 .
chancellor merkel 's government has said that it intends to extend the deadline by a period that has yet to be determined .
until recently , it had been thought that any legal change would need to be approved by the bundesrat , germany 's upper house , which represents country 's 16 states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court may ultimately decide the matter however , after the may election in north rhine-westphalia , the center-right coalition lost its majority in the upper chamber .
soon afterward , merkel 's chief of staff , ronald pofalla , announced possible plans to bypass the bundesrat entirely - infuriating opposition parties .
whether or not the government needs the agreement of the bundesrat is not clear . dissent within coalition opinion within merkel 's cdu is also divided . the cdu premier of the state of saarland , peter mueller , has questioned the need for an extension .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister norbert roettgen is seeking a consensus " we need an energy supply that is safe , sustainable and affordable , " mueller said in sunday 's edition of the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" i believe that we would be able to achieve that without the extension of the lifetimes of nuclear power plants . "
environment minister norbert roettgen of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , argued for a new limited nuclear plant extension in the monday edition of bremen 's weser kurier , stressing that nuclear power was only needed until alternatives could be found .
" it is a very rational approach , which is linked with enormous economic opportunities for germany .
people in germany understand that , better apparently than so many critics . "
in the same newspaper 's online edition on sunday , baden wuertemberg 's cdu premier , stephan mappus , who wants to see the final shut down date extended by 15 years , criticized roettgen for not adopting a clearer line in favor of an extension .

another rare and endangered species native to the country 's rainforest is the golden-mantled tree kangaroo , while a recent discovery was a frog with a pinocchio-like protuberance on its nose that points up when the male is calling and deflates when quiet .
local and global value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird of paradise is the country 's national emblem papua new guinea contains over 5 percent of the world 's biodiversity within less than 1 percent of its total land area .
for now , the rainforests of papua new guinea are still intact .
but although the overall population density of the country remains low , the population is growing slowly but steadily - progressing , according to un estimates , from 5,711,000 in 2003 to a projected population in the year 2015 of 7,169,000 .
these inhabitants depend on the local biological resources to sustain their livelihoods .
but the result , as recent satellite studies of the region show , is that current rates of deforestation will cause more than half of the papua new guinea 's rainforests to be lost or seriously degraded by 2021 .
taking a toll the increase in human population , coupled with the availability of more efficient farming tools , pose a growing threat to biodiversity .
the local agriculture and logging industry are taking their toll on the environment and threatening the natural habitats of valued birds , animals , fish , insects , plants and trees . un experts estimate that 130 species of plants , animals and insects are lost worldwide every single day .
" this is 100 to 1000 times faster than the evolutionary process of the extinction of species and appearance of new ones , " says andrea cederquist , a greenpeace biodiversity expert .
for now , it is unclear as to how exactly biodiversity in papua new guinea is being affected .
" climate change and the loss of species are closely intertwined , and no one can gauge the full effects , " stresses cederquist .
experts agree that these can not be predicted .
but given that the extinction of one species can have knock-on effects , causing further extinctions , not only papua new guinea 's birds of paradise are at stake , but entire ecosystems .
chains of extinction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were ants to die out , the result would be global disaster after all , most living things on earth support others .
the power of the " little creatures that run the world " was spelt out by harvard biologist edward o.wilson and german behavioral biologist bert hoelldobler in their pulitzer prize-winning 1990 study " the ants . " their book reveals how humans would die without the ants ' soil-tilling drudgery that maintains the existence of plant life .
army ants are known to support 100 known species , from beetles to birds .
were they to die out , entire ecosystems would collapse and the result would be global disaster .
" everyone is aware of all this , " says greenpeace expert cederquist . " but no one acts . "
pricing the earth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in papua new guinea , locals are leraning to farm sustainably what might finally spur action is the dawning awareness of the global economic impact of the loss of biodiversity .
under the aegis of the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -lrb- teeb -rrb- project is an international initiative to draw attention to this issue .
in its latest study published in july , it puts the extent of losses of natural capital taking place as a result of deforestation and degradation at between $ 2 - 4.5 trillion per year , every year .
the full report sets out the economic case for biodiversity and ecosystems , describing how even factors such as insect pollination ultimately have a crucial impact on business and society .
against this backdrop , environmentalists are well aware that however local they might seem , conservation efforts in papua new guinea have repercussions for the entire planet .

opinion is also divided within chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union . german chancellor angela merkel 's governing coalition has been put on notice that it will face a fight over any change to the law on nuclear energy without approval from the country 's upper house of parliament .
green party leader claudia roth threatened on sunday to press for a judicial review at the germany 's constitutional court if the government moved to extend the operational lifetimes of nuclear power plants without consent from the bundesrat .
speaking to public broadcaster ard , roth said that a number of germany 's state governments were unhappy about a proposed delay to the closure dates .

" we will exhaust every legal possibility , right up to the constitutional court , " the green party 's loehrmann told the tagesspiegel newspaper on sunday .
according to a law passed in 2002 by the then-ruling spd and the green coalition , all of germany 's nuclear power plants are to go off line by 2022 .

opinion is also divided within chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union . german chancellor angela merkel 's governing coalition has been put on notice that it will face a fight over any change to the law on nuclear energy without approval from the country 's upper house of parliament .
green party leader claudia roth threatened on sunday to press for a judicial review at the germany 's constitutional court if the government moved to extend the operational lifetimes of nuclear power plants without consent from the bundesrat .
speaking to public broadcaster ard , roth said that a number of germany 's state governments were unhappy about a proposed delay to the closure dates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leader roth says several states oppose a change the deputy premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , sylvia loehrmann , also said that the government could expect what she described as " bitter resistance " from that state 's coalition , which is made up of the spd and her green party .
" we will exhaust every legal possibility , right up to the constitutional court , " the green party 's loehrmann told the tagesspiegel newspaper on sunday .
according to a law passed in 2002 by the then-ruling spd and the green coalition , all of germany 's nuclear power plants are to go off line by 2022 .
chancellor merkel 's government has said that it intends to extend the deadline by a period that has yet to be determined .
until recently , it had been thought that any legal change would need to be approved by the bundesrat , germany 's upper house , which represents country 's 16 states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court may ultimately decide the matter however , after the may election in north rhine-westphalia , the center-right coalition lost its majority in the upper chamber .
soon afterward , merkel 's chief of staff , ronald pofalla , announced possible plans to bypass the bundesrat entirely - infuriating opposition parties .
whether or not the government needs the agreement of the bundesrat is not clear . dissent within coalition opinion within merkel 's cdu is also divided . the cdu premier of the state of saarland , peter mueller , has questioned the need for an extension .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister norbert roettgen is seeking a consensus " we need an energy supply that is safe , sustainable and affordable , " mueller said in sunday 's edition of the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" i believe that we would be able to achieve that without the extension of the lifetimes of nuclear power plants . "
environment minister norbert roettgen of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , argued for a new limited nuclear plant extension in the monday edition of bremen 's weser kurier , stressing that nuclear power was only needed until alternatives could be found .
" it is a very rational approach , which is linked with enormous economic opportunities for germany .
people in germany understand that , better apparently than so many critics . "
in the same newspaper 's online edition on sunday , baden wuertemberg 's cdu premier , stephan mappus , who wants to see the final shut down date extended by 15 years , criticized roettgen for not adopting a clearer line in favor of an extension .

only a few months ago a leaked cia memo surfaced outlining strategies to boost german public support for the war in afghanistan . the red cell memorandum entitled " why counting on apathy might not be enough " cites the fragility of european support for the nato-led isaf mission and subsequently sets out clear proposals for the french and german governments to boost support among their respective populations .
in the case of germany the document suggests putting greater emphasis on the humanitarian aspects of the war and dramatizing the consequences of a nato defeat for specific german interests , such as exposure to terrorism , opium and refugees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ultimately it is up to the public to disseminate information for itself for france , it says the best way to proceed would be to highlight the message that isaf is of benefit to afghan citizens by paving the way for girls to get an education they could n't dream of under the taliban .
among other things .
to all intents and purposes , the paper reads like a public relations pitch , which as albert stahel of the strategic studies institute in zurich told deutsche welle , is essentially what it is .
" it 's a marketing concept , " he said .
" and the object of it is to manipulate the public , to sell them a product using a variety of different channels . "
eliminating the competition those channels , he says include important figures in the worlds of academia and media , middle men and journalists .
" you involve a journalist , you say we have some information for you , you hold a press conference , you invite 50 people and so on . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : read all about it " the goal is a little bit more ambitious than that , " the political scientist told deutsche welle .
" it is not only to market a product but to eliminate the competition from the debate , to take control of the entire range of options being discussed by the public . "

" german media has its own tendencies , whether conscious or sub-conscious , they are telling a certain story and over-telling certain parts of the story at the expense of others . "
but tuschhoff says there is no objective truth to be told and disseminated to the public , but that people come to their own conclusions about what holds true .
" there may be parts of the arguments that are more present in one national debate than another , but the public has the right to establish what they want to discuss and what they want to ignore , it 's pretty much up to them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers at the coffin of a comrade killed in afghanistan and strategy , it seems is simply less important to the average german than certain other issues .
" germans are interested from a humanitarian perspective , " stahel said .
" the minds of the german people were transformed after the second world war and they have a strong pacifist feeling . "
transparency is key hence the cia recommendations to recruit afghan women to " serve as messengers in humanizing the isaf role in combating the taliban , " which tuschhoff says were out of place and will not be taken seriously by berlin .
" politicians are skilled at knowing what they should or should not transmit to their audience , " he said , adding that a foreign government or agency ca n't realistically take on that job because they do n't know what the german public is able to digest or reject or accept .
o 'hanlon agrees that the memo was off-key , not so much because it might have hit the wrong note with the european populations for whom it was intended , but because it is not transparent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and karl-theodor zu guttenberg : in tune with their public ?
" instead of beginning with the premise that you want a certain policy outcome , begin with the premise that you want a more fair , open informed public debate . " although that approach would automatically lead to the presentation of biased information , o 'hanlon maintains it would at least remind everyone involved in the effort of what the goal should be .
" and if the war in question is not of a character where you can look at the entire body of evidence and come up with a hopeful story , the public is entitled to know that . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 26.07.2010 eu tackles e-waste anew through legislation , entrepreneurship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computers like these often end up in developing countries , including china , ghana , and other parts of sub-saharan africa brussels is spearheading a new effort to crackdown on loopholes in electronic waste management , while a new belgian tech company has become the first to receive fair-trade certification . no matter how cherished an electronic item is in life , most electronic gadgets end up at the dump - or , as they call it in belgium , at the container park . here , electronic waste - or e-waste - gets sorted into categories and theoretically gets taken apart , with hazardous substances removed by well-trained workers in protective gear .
the recyclable components are melted down and anything biodegradable gets sent off to be composted .
but the problem is that only a fraction of cast-off electronics in the european union actually see that fate .
european officials take up stronger measures a new report by the european parliament shows about 65 percent of the total amount of e-waste generated in the bloc gets turned in and sorted correctly , but after that things go downhill .
besides existing eu laws requiring collection and treatment , all eu member states have signed the basel convention , which outlaws the export of hazardous waste and requires e-waste to be treated as close to its origin as possible . but through loopholes , by claiming items are donations or functioning second-hand goods for re-sale - or by simply breaking the law - middlemen are making millions and making impoverished nations pay the price .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while currently holding the eu presidency , belgium is leading moves to tighten regulations on e-waste " we 've been clearly negligent because we have n't sent the right resources to fight illegal shipments , " said stephane arditi of the european environmental bureau , a brussels-based ngo .
" and that is something everybody is aware of , probably also ashamed of . "
she added that tightening existing laws will help , but it 's enforcement that 's really needed from the developed world .
mike anane , president of the league of environmental journalists in ghana , told researchers from the danish watchdog organization danwatch that his country is clearly being used as a convenient landfill for europe .
he noted the mountains of discarded computers , monitors and televisions that ghana has no way to recycle .
" some come under the guise of donations but when you examine the items , they do n't work , " anane said .
" it 's just a way to get rid of these computers from europe to africa . "
' of importance to all of us ' one of anane 's colleagues , maren swart is currently in accra , where she is investigating the levels of e-waste shipped to ghana either illegally or through the second-hand item loopholes .
" we have found computers from danish companies before in accra , " she said .
" they had a tag on them showing that they were from a school in denmark . "
the european parliament 's environment committee is now proposing more stringent standards that would require each member state to collect 85 percent of the waste it generates and to prove that the majority of the waste is treated within the country .
the full legislature will vote on the proposed changes in september .
belgium currently holds the eu presidency and has made sustainable materials management , including ethical waste treatment , a priority for the next six months .
joke schauvliege , the flemish environment minister , said the entire lifecycle of products needs to be considered . when possible , she said , the " cradle to cradle principle " should be applied , meaning that waste is used to create new products , rather than mountains of non-functioning monitors .
" this is a societal challenge on a large scale , " she said in dutch .
" these are things of importance to all of us .
it 's not just governments that need to deal with this , it 's also the business world , citizens and also think tanks , experts .
we need free-thinkers , forerunners . "
actually , schauvliege has some free-thinkers and forerunners right at home in belgium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united pepper sells these webcams made of kapok , cotton and mekong delta sand , all of which are natural products .
webcam casing created with natural fibers their names are marc aelbrecht , jean-pierre d 'haese and xavier petre and they left companies like alcatel and cisco to create united pepper .
now they design items like webcams and usb hubs that are largely biodegradable , with a cotton casing filled with a natural fiber called kapok and weighted with sand from the mekong river in vietnam , where the company 's manufacturing sites are located .
they 're awaiting the day when even the lens and cable can be made of natural materials , the men say , but for now they ensure that the non-green components are kept to a bare minimum and that every step of the process is transparent . xavier petre noted consumers are increasingly demanding that kind of information for ethical decision-making .
" when you put 50 euros on the table to buy a webcam you should know who is behind it and you should know what kind of material is used , " he said .
united pepper is also the first electronics producer in the world to be certified as " fair trade , " meaning it upholds standards of sustainability both in the components of its products and the workforce putting them together .
this type of certification , perhaps best known in agricultural and beauty products and clothing , does n't even exist yet in the electronics industry , so united pepper asked the uk-based ngo traidcraft to audit the company in order to document that the company 's practices meet a high ethical and environmental standard .
" we are becoming entrepreneurs in a new kind of economy , " d 'haese said .
" now is the time to make the values accepted by our market . "
and , he added , once a webcam owner removes the tiny lens and cable from a united pepper webcam , the only " dirty " part of the disposal is the bed of mekong sand in which seeds in the natural kapok filling have been known to sprout .

in a surprise move , tehran shortly afterwards said it was prepared to return to negotiations without conditions , according to the country 's official news agency . at the heart of the sanctions is the concern that iran 's controversial uranium enrichment programme is not - as tehran claims - for civilian purpose , but rather intended to develop nuclear weapons .

the test now is whether it can perform to expectations . in early july 2010 the united nations -lrb- un -rrb- created a new entity for gender equality and the empowerment of women – to be known as un women .
it also adopted important resolutions aimed at improving the un organizations ' development cooperation .
the first you 've heard of it ?
that is a shame because these achievements show that the organization is capable of instituting reform and that multilateral action among 192 countries remains possible .
so what 's it all about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un chief ban ki-moon has come in for heavy criticism of his leadership recently un organizations like the development program -lrb- undp -rrb- , the children 's program -lrb- unicef -rrb- or the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- – to name but the three largest – are important multilateral actors .
they have a key role to play when it comes to implementing universally valid norms such as , for instance , human rights , gender equality and environmental standards .
along with their global , operative tasks they also contribute research studies to the development discourse -lrb- for example , the annual undp human development report -rrb- and engage in advocacy work on behalf of the most disadvantaged .
the fact that developing countries are involved on equal terms in the governance of un organizations means they are regarded as especially legitimate .
and that is why they are in a better position to engage in sensitive policy fields .
nevertheless , the un system is highly fragmented .
the numerous organizations often do not work well together , their fields of activity overlap and they ought to bring their individual strengths more to the fore .
these were the conclusions drawn in a report submitted by a high-level panel of experts in 2006 that recommended that the un should " deliver as one . "
the experts also felt that the un 's structures should be simplified , among other things in the fields of women and gender equality .
they recommended that the four institutions dealing with these issues should be combined to form a new organization in order to make them more visible and better able to assert themselves by bringing together resources and mandates .
slow process while western industrialized nations backed ideas to simplify un structures and to concentrate their areas of activity , some key developing countries and emerging economies regarded these plans with suspicion from the very outset .
in their eyes these steps would weaken the un , which on paper at least has a comprehensive mandate for economic and financial issues .
they feared that development policy would suffer further cuts in favor of the security agenda endorsed by the west , and emphasized that it was the un 's institutional and thematic variety that set it apart .
in view of their dissent as to the content of the majority of the experts ' suggestions , they insisted that the negotiations - and thus any possible compromises - should cover all issues .
the establishment of the new women 's organization , which many developing countries also backed , thus became dependent on consensus in other areas .
decisions , decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major developing nations are demanding a greater say in international affairs the most important decision that has been taken is that to establish un women .
the entity aims to be up and running by january 2011 .
its work will on the one hand be normative , that is it will continue developing existing international obligations and ensure they are observed and implemented across the world .
on the other hand , it will run operational programs for which it will have a budget of 500 million us dollars at its disposal .
other decisions are less spectacular but nevertheless important , namely those on improving the governance of the un development system , on harmonizing administrative procedures across the entire system , guaranteeing a reliable funding base in the future and in regard to an ongoing reform initiative in which the un family delivers as one in eight pilot countries .
reaching agreement the resolution was preceded by four years of negotiations .
it quickly became clear that no radical restructuring exercise would be possible , as consensus could only be reached on implementing successive small-scale reforms .
although the line of conflict traditionally ran between developing countries -lrb- g-77 -rrb- and industrialized nations , clear differences became apparent .
smaller , poorer countries like rwanda and tanzania as well as middle-income countries like vietnam and uruguay , in which bilateral development aid is gradually tapering off , have a particular interest in more coherent and effective cooperation with un organizations .
the positions adopted by a few ideologically- , motivated countries like cuba or emerging economies like india and egypt were primarily based on power politics and their attempts to prevent changes or achieve concessions .
the industrialized nations ' positions were more homogeneous .
during the very last phase of negotiations , however , the united states irritated the other countries by going it alone and making concessions on the new un women supervisory board .
ultimately , however , no-one wanted to stand in the way of the creation of an organization that had long been overdue .
what next ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 is losing ground to the g20 in terms of significance the resolution set an important milestone on the road to the reform of un development cooperation .
however , un women must now prove that it can be more than the sum of its individual parts .
appointing a well-known and authoritative personality from the south to the leadership position will play a key role when it comes to gaining acceptance for the organization 's work in developing countries , as well as for the generosity donor countries will now have to show .
despite the need to tighten budgetary belts , germany should contribute financially .
not only in order to increase its chances of being elected onto the security council in october 2010 , but also , in view of the recently announced cuts in contributions , to demonstrate that the un is still an important partner for germany .
the un remains an indispensable consensus-reaching and decision-making forum when it comes to pressing global challenges .
in countries of the south , the world organization 's development activities are key to gaining acceptance for its activities in the areas of security , or norm and standard setting .
also in the age of the g-20 , strengthening the un continues to be in germany 's interest .

a team of experts at vall d 'hebron hospital in barcelona had carried out the transplant in late march . in a 24-hour-operation , the 31-year-old patient , identified only as oscar , received new facial muscles , skin , nose , lips , a jaw , teeth , a palate and cheekbones , according to the head of the medical team that carried out the procedure , joan pere barret .
barret said the man would now need between a year and 18 months of physical therapy and would regain up to 90 percent of his facial functions .
a new life " bit by bit he is improving but he nonetheless has a long and difficult road ahead to have intelligible speech like he had before , " barret added .
at the news conference , oscar spoke with considerable difficulty .
he was unable to breathe , swallow , talk normally or eat on his own after accidentally shooting himself in the face five years ago .
now , oscar is able to drink liquids and speak .
hospitals in several countries have carried out face transplants in the past , but these involved only part of the patient 's face .

a team of experts at vall d 'hebron hospital in barcelona had carried out the transplant in late march . in a 24-hour-operation , the 31-year-old patient , identified only as oscar , received new facial muscles , skin , nose , lips , a jaw , teeth , a palate and cheekbones , according to the head of the medical team that carried out the procedure , joan pere barret .
barret said the man would now need between a year and 18 months of physical therapy and would regain up to 90 percent of his facial functions .
a new life " bit by bit he is improving but he nonetheless has a long and difficult road ahead to have intelligible speech like he had before , " barret added .
at the news conference , oscar spoke with considerable difficulty .
he was unable to breathe , swallow , talk normally or eat on his own after accidentally shooting himself in the face five years ago .
now , oscar is able to drink liquids and speak .
hospitals in several countries have carried out face transplants in the past , but these involved only part of the patient 's face .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 26.07.2010 eu tackles e-waste anew through legislation , entrepreneurship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computers like these often end up in developing countries , including china , ghana , and other parts of sub-saharan africa brussels is spearheading a new effort to crackdown on loopholes in electronic waste management , while a new belgian tech company has become the first to receive fair-trade certification . no matter how cherished an electronic item is in life , most electronic gadgets end up at the dump - or , as they call it in belgium , at the container park . here , electronic waste - or e-waste - gets sorted into categories and theoretically gets taken apart , with hazardous substances removed by well-trained workers in protective gear .
the recyclable components are melted down and anything biodegradable gets sent off to be composted .
but the problem is that only a fraction of cast-off electronics in the european union actually see that fate .
european officials take up stronger measures a new report by the european parliament shows about 65 percent of the total amount of e-waste generated in the bloc gets turned in and sorted correctly , but after that things go downhill .
besides existing eu laws requiring collection and treatment , all eu member states have signed the basel convention , which outlaws the export of hazardous waste and requires e-waste to be treated as close to its origin as possible . but through loopholes , by claiming items are donations or functioning second-hand goods for re-sale - or by simply breaking the law - middlemen are making millions and making impoverished nations pay the price .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while currently holding the eu presidency , belgium is leading moves to tighten regulations on e-waste " we 've been clearly negligent because we have n't sent the right resources to fight illegal shipments , " said stephane arditi of the european environmental bureau , a brussels-based ngo .
" and that is something everybody is aware of , probably also ashamed of . "
she added that tightening existing laws will help , but it 's enforcement that 's really needed from the developed world .
mike anane , president of the league of environmental journalists in ghana , told researchers from the danish watchdog organization danwatch that his country is clearly being used as a convenient landfill for europe .
he noted the mountains of discarded computers , monitors and televisions that ghana has no way to recycle .
" some come under the guise of donations but when you examine the items , they do n't work , " anane said .
" it 's just a way to get rid of these computers from europe to africa . "
' of importance to all of us ' one of anane 's colleagues , maren swart is currently in accra , where she is investigating the levels of e-waste shipped to ghana either illegally or through the second-hand item loopholes .
" we have found computers from danish companies before in accra , " she said .
" they had a tag on them showing that they were from a school in denmark . "
the european parliament 's environment committee is now proposing more stringent standards that would require each member state to collect 85 percent of the waste it generates and to prove that the majority of the waste is treated within the country .
the full legislature will vote on the proposed changes in september .
belgium currently holds the eu presidency and has made sustainable materials management , including ethical waste treatment , a priority for the next six months .
joke schauvliege , the flemish environment minister , said the entire lifecycle of products needs to be considered . when possible , she said , the " cradle to cradle principle " should be applied , meaning that waste is used to create new products , rather than mountains of non-functioning monitors .
" this is a societal challenge on a large scale , " she said in dutch .
" these are things of importance to all of us .
it 's not just governments that need to deal with this , it 's also the business world , citizens and also think tanks , experts .
we need free-thinkers , forerunners . "
actually , schauvliege has some free-thinkers and forerunners right at home in belgium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united pepper sells these webcams made of kapok , cotton and mekong delta sand , all of which are natural products .
webcam casing created with natural fibers their names are marc aelbrecht , jean-pierre d 'haese and xavier petre and they left companies like alcatel and cisco to create united pepper .
now they design items like webcams and usb hubs that are largely biodegradable , with a cotton casing filled with a natural fiber called kapok and weighted with sand from the mekong river in vietnam , where the company 's manufacturing sites are located .
they 're awaiting the day when even the lens and cable can be made of natural materials , the men say , but for now they ensure that the non-green components are kept to a bare minimum and that every step of the process is transparent . xavier petre noted consumers are increasingly demanding that kind of information for ethical decision-making .
" when you put 50 euros on the table to buy a webcam you should know who is behind it and you should know what kind of material is used , " he said .
united pepper is also the first electronics producer in the world to be certified as " fair trade , " meaning it upholds standards of sustainability both in the components of its products and the workforce putting them together .
this type of certification , perhaps best known in agricultural and beauty products and clothing , does n't even exist yet in the electronics industry , so united pepper asked the uk-based ngo traidcraft to audit the company in order to document that the company 's practices meet a high ethical and environmental standard .
" we are becoming entrepreneurs in a new kind of economy , " d 'haese said .
" now is the time to make the values accepted by our market . "
and , he added , once a webcam owner removes the tiny lens and cable from a united pepper webcam , the only " dirty " part of the disposal is the bed of mekong sand in which seeds in the natural kapok filling have been known to sprout .

but there are still security concerns and plans to investigate . the german defense ministry on monday criticized the leak of around 92,000 classified us military documents on the afghanistan war , but said the news value was rather limited .
the german news magazine spiegel as well as the new york times and the guardian newspapers at the weekend printed excerpts of the documents , which were released by the wikileaks website .
" obtaining and releasing documents , some of them secret , on such a scale is a highly questionable practice since it could affect the national security of nato allies and the whole nato mission , " defense ministry spokesman christian dienst said . " we 're in the process of analyzing the material so as to find out whether the security of our german troops on the ground is affected in any way . "
german foreign minister guido westerwelle also called for further scrutiny of the documents .
at an eu foreign ministers ’ meeting in brussels , westerwelle said the documents , which contain claims of concealed civilian casualties , had given him " comfort in my position , which consisted of never talking up the situation in afghanistan , which is exceptionally serious . "
attacks on the rise dienst confirmed that reports about a drastic increase of taliban attacks on allied troops were true .
he said that in the course of this year alone there had been close to 60 armed attacks on the german isaf contingent alone – almost triple the the figures available for 2007 and the years before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers are based largely in northern afghanistan wikileaks claimed that us and nato forces had increasingly been confined to reacting to the taleban 's operations and strategy rather than actively pursuing a policy of their own .
the joint leader of germany 's opposition green party , claudia roth , told the media on monday she did n't sense an often-cited new strategy of the allied forces in afghanistan at all .
killing a priority ?
" the wikileaks documents bear out just how dramatic the situation in afghanistan is , " roth said .
" but they also show the range of means the allies resort to in their fight for more stability . "
roth referred to classified documents highlighting the us special forces ' capture-and-kill operations , including manhunts where the killing of innocent people is seen as mere collateral damage .
according to the documents , 300 soldiers from the elite us 373 task force are located in the german camp at masar-i-sharif in the north of afghanistan .
their major task is the killing of high-ranking taliban leaders .
the sources available to wikileaks do not specify whether any german officers are involved in the planning or implementing of such targeted killings .
and the defense ministry in berlin was unwilling to shed any light on this issue .
" as far as the us task force is concerned , it 's in the nature of things that their operations remain secret , " christian dienst said .
" this means that only a very small circle of people is in the know about any details of these operations . "
everything said before ?
wikileaks knows that much of the information provided is not totally new .
but it claims it has got hold of the most comprehensive description of an armed conflict ever .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spiegel has looked into us special forces ' operations before wikileaks is a web platform which claims to be the first intelligence agency of the people .
since its founding in december 2006 it has called on potential whistleblowers from all over the world to make anonymous contributions and provide mostly classified information .
so far , people have sent about 1.2 million such documents to the web platform .
among wikileaks ' best-known scoops was the posting of a video depicting a us helicopter strike in baghdad in 2007 .
the footage showed how about a dozen civilians were gunned down , among them two employees from the reuters news agency .
in 2009 , the website first acquired international recognition when it published secret documents from a multinational shipping company , implicating the firm in toxic waste dumping in the ivory coast .

tehran has condemned the measures but at the same time signalled it was willing to resume negotiations over its nuclear program . european union foreign ministers meeting in brussels monday have approved new sanctions on iran over its nuclear program .
in a surprise move , tehran shortly afterwards said it was prepared to return to negotiations without conditions , according to the country 's official news agency . at the heart of the sanctions is the concern that iran 's controversial uranium enrichment programme is not - as tehran claims - for civilian purpose , but rather intended to develop nuclear weapons .

tehran has condemned the measures but at the same time signalled it was willing to resume negotiations over its nuclear program . european union foreign ministers meeting in brussels monday have approved new sanctions on iran over its nuclear program .
in a surprise move , tehran shortly afterwards said it was prepared to return to negotiations without conditions , according to the country 's official news agency . at the heart of the sanctions is the concern that iran 's controversial uranium enrichment programme is not - as tehran claims - for civilian purpose , but rather intended to develop nuclear weapons . " today we sent quite a powerful message to iran that their nuclear programme is a cause for serious and growing concern to us , " the eu 's foreign policy chief , catherine ashton said . an obligation for transparency the new restrictions are likely to hit the backbone of iran 's economy - foreign trade , financial services and the oil and gas sector .
officials have described the measures as the toughest sanctions the european union has ever adopted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle said iran needs to comply with international calls for more transparency the measures are intended to block oil and gas investment and undermine tehran 's refining and natural gas capabilities .
they also ban the export to iran of dual-use goods that can be used both for civilian and military purposes . the sanctions will also further limit the activities of iranian trading banks and insurers , including restrictions on money transfers to iran . " of course iran has the right to use nuclear technology for civilian purposes , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle said . " but that also means that of course there is an obligation for transparency .
a nuclear armed iran is something that we can not accept . " iran prepared to resume talks iran has denounced the new sanctions as confrontational and said they would only further damage the already difficult relations with brussels . but tehran has at the same time signalled willingness to return to negotiations .
the country 's envoy to the iaea in vienna on monday suggested talks should be resumed . the eu 's catherine ashton welcomed the announcement but said she wanted to see the details first . " as far as i can see this is to be welcomed ... but we need to study the details , " she told reporters at a news briefing . the last high-level talks between iran and the six world powers – germany , britain , china , france , russia and the us – were held in geneva in october 2009 .

love parade tragedy news of the deaths at the love parade honestly made me sad .
i offer my condolences to chancellor merkel , her fellow germans and everyone else affected by the tragedy . - paul , us unfortunately the blame must lie with organizers , council and police and whoever signed off on an entrance via a huge tunnel .
surely the crowd could have been channelled far more easily via fencing through there than just letting them into the whole width of it - which meant people had nowhere to go .
if the entrance was actually at the other end of the tunnel , this would n't have happened once the venue filled up and the crowd could have been stopped before entering .
such a tragedy at an amazing event meant to celebrate music and peace . - simon , australia clearly the authorities are to blame for this tragedy .
it is they who have the expertise , the total authority and legal responsibility to decide if a festival venue is safe for the public to attend .
this is not within the expertise of commercial festival organizers .
the final decision is with city and police experts .
there is already ample evidence that the authorities were more interested in corralling the crowd into a small area , the usual state control freak mentality , than planning for crowd overflow and emergency exits and entrances .
it is a disgrace that parallels the inexcusable mistakes at duesseldorf airport 's fire where the rigid application of rules instead of common sense prevented the airport fire service from attending the fire and the subsequent loss of life .
no doubt the blame shall be pushed on to others as it was after duesseldorf , a hapless welder , there as i recall .
i speak with some authority as the uk is riddled with the same over-organized incompetence .
i hope heads roll over this disaster , resignations should be called for .
i was personally closer to this tragedy than was comfortable as my german son was at the festival but , upon seeing the potential for disaster given the mass overcrowding , decided to leave as thankfully did his friends .
in closing , i do not wish this to be vindictive of those involved , but hope with respect to all those people who lost their lives that we can learn from this tragedy to prevent its recurrence . - j. north , great britain i 'm a big fan of germany , but if an investigation is not launched into how a festival of 1 million in an open space that was held in berlin was transferred to a backwater that has experience of mostly classical music events and has a population of just 500,000 in a confined space that holds just 500,000 then germany will be deservedly a laughing stock .
germany needs to seriously question the city authorities that licensed this set up .
words fail me .
it 's not what we expect of germany at all .
to me it seems a disaster that was waiting to happen . - fergal barry via facebook it 's the organizers fault .
in 10 days the heavy metal event " wacken " will take place in wacken .
let 's hope they will organize it much better . - markus , via facebook from germany this is good that the investigation has started and i am sure that soon someone will be officially guilty .
but this is only the administration part .
we all need to ask ourselves : who will bring back the people who are dead now ?
i would like to send my appeal to all organizers for such events , please take this case in seriously and do not let it happen again . - mesar via facebook i think it 's the fault of the organizers and the people as well .
they should n't have used a tunnel for letting thousands of people through it , and people do not know when to stop pushing when they are moving forward in large groups .
people get trapped in a closed space , start panicking , and thus , the result .
wacken is much better organized because it 's at an open space , if something happens people can simply jump over the fences , and they 're off .
unlike a tunnel where they are trapped . - lena , the netherlands compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the test now is whether it can perform to expectations . in early july 2010 the united nations -lrb- un -rrb- created a new entity for gender equality and the empowerment of women – to be known as un women .
it also adopted important resolutions aimed at improving the un organizations ' development cooperation .
the first you 've heard of it ?
that is a shame because these achievements show that the organization is capable of instituting reform and that multilateral action among 192 countries remains possible .
so what 's it all about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un chief ban ki-moon has come in for heavy criticism of his leadership recently un organizations like the development program -lrb- undp -rrb- , the children 's program -lrb- unicef -rrb- or the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- – to name but the three largest – are important multilateral actors .
they have a key role to play when it comes to implementing universally valid norms such as , for instance , human rights , gender equality and environmental standards .
along with their global , operative tasks they also contribute research studies to the development discourse -lrb- for example , the annual undp human development report -rrb- and engage in advocacy work on behalf of the most disadvantaged .
the fact that developing countries are involved on equal terms in the governance of un organizations means they are regarded as especially legitimate .
and that is why they are in a better position to engage in sensitive policy fields .
nevertheless , the un system is highly fragmented .
the numerous organizations often do not work well together , their fields of activity overlap and they ought to bring their individual strengths more to the fore .
these were the conclusions drawn in a report submitted by a high-level panel of experts in 2006 that recommended that the un should " deliver as one . "
the experts also felt that the un 's structures should be simplified , among other things in the fields of women and gender equality .
they recommended that the four institutions dealing with these issues should be combined to form a new organization in order to make them more visible and better able to assert themselves by bringing together resources and mandates .
slow process while western industrialized nations backed ideas to simplify un structures and to concentrate their areas of activity , some key developing countries and emerging economies regarded these plans with suspicion from the very outset .
in their eyes these steps would weaken the un , which on paper at least has a comprehensive mandate for economic and financial issues .
they feared that development policy would suffer further cuts in favor of the security agenda endorsed by the west , and emphasized that it was the un 's institutional and thematic variety that set it apart .
in view of their dissent as to the content of the majority of the experts ' suggestions , they insisted that the negotiations - and thus any possible compromises - should cover all issues .
the establishment of the new women 's organization , which many developing countries also backed , thus became dependent on consensus in other areas .
decisions , decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major developing nations are demanding a greater say in international affairs the most important decision that has been taken is that to establish un women .
the entity aims to be up and running by january 2011 .
its work will on the one hand be normative , that is it will continue developing existing international obligations and ensure they are observed and implemented across the world .
on the other hand , it will run operational programs for which it will have a budget of 500 million us dollars at its disposal .
other decisions are less spectacular but nevertheless important , namely those on improving the governance of the un development system , on harmonizing administrative procedures across the entire system , guaranteeing a reliable funding base in the future and in regard to an ongoing reform initiative in which the un family delivers as one in eight pilot countries .
reaching agreement the resolution was preceded by four years of negotiations .
it quickly became clear that no radical restructuring exercise would be possible , as consensus could only be reached on implementing successive small-scale reforms .
although the line of conflict traditionally ran between developing countries -lrb- g-77 -rrb- and industrialized nations , clear differences became apparent .
smaller , poorer countries like rwanda and tanzania as well as middle-income countries like vietnam and uruguay , in which bilateral development aid is gradually tapering off , have a particular interest in more coherent and effective cooperation with un organizations .
the positions adopted by a few ideologically- , motivated countries like cuba or emerging economies like india and egypt were primarily based on power politics and their attempts to prevent changes or achieve concessions .
the industrialized nations ' positions were more homogeneous .
during the very last phase of negotiations , however , the united states irritated the other countries by going it alone and making concessions on the new un women supervisory board .
ultimately , however , no-one wanted to stand in the way of the creation of an organization that had long been overdue .
what next ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 is losing ground to the g20 in terms of significance the resolution set an important milestone on the road to the reform of un development cooperation .
however , un women must now prove that it can be more than the sum of its individual parts .
appointing a well-known and authoritative personality from the south to the leadership position will play a key role when it comes to gaining acceptance for the organization 's work in developing countries , as well as for the generosity donor countries will now have to show .
despite the need to tighten budgetary belts , germany should contribute financially .
not only in order to increase its chances of being elected onto the security council in october 2010 , but also , in view of the recently announced cuts in contributions , to demonstrate that the un is still an important partner for germany .
the un remains an indispensable consensus-reaching and decision-making forum when it comes to pressing global challenges .
in countries of the south , the world organization 's development activities are key to gaining acceptance for its activities in the areas of security , or norm and standard setting .
also in the age of the g-20 , strengthening the un continues to be in germany 's interest .

not only animals and plants flourish by protecting biodiversity , but business too . papua new guinea is one of the world 's least explored countries - both culturally and geographically - and many undiscovered species of plants and animals are thought to exist in its interior .
its tropical wilderness is home to a stunning range of biodiversity - from the queen alexandra 's birdwing , the largest butterfly in the world , to the flamboyant bird-of-paradise , which graces the flag of papua new guinea .
another rare and endangered species native to the country 's rainforest is the golden-mantled tree kangaroo , while a recent discovery was a frog with a pinocchio-like protuberance on its nose that points up when the male is calling and deflates when quiet .
local and global value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird of paradise is the country 's national emblem papua new guinea contains over 5 percent of the world 's biodiversity within less than 1 percent of its total land area .
for now , the rainforests of papua new guinea are still intact .
but although the overall population density of the country remains low , the population is growing slowly but steadily - progressing , according to un estimates , from 5,711,000 in 2003 to a projected population in the year 2015 of 7,169,000 .
these inhabitants depend on the local biological resources to sustain their livelihoods .
but the result , as recent satellite studies of the region show , is that current rates of deforestation will cause more than half of the papua new guinea 's rainforests to be lost or seriously degraded by 2021 .
taking a toll the increase in human population , coupled with the availability of more efficient farming tools , pose a growing threat to biodiversity .
the local agriculture and logging industry are taking their toll on the environment and threatening the natural habitats of valued birds , animals , fish , insects , plants and trees . un experts estimate that 130 species of plants , animals and insects are lost worldwide every single day .
" this is 100 to 1000 times faster than the evolutionary process of the extinction of species and appearance of new ones , " says andrea cederquist , a greenpeace biodiversity expert .
for now , it is unclear as to how exactly biodiversity in papua new guinea is being affected .
" climate change and the loss of species are closely intertwined , and no one can gauge the full effects , " stresses cederquist .
experts agree that these can not be predicted .
but given that the extinction of one species can have knock-on effects , causing further extinctions , not only papua new guinea 's birds of paradise are at stake , but entire ecosystems .
chains of extinction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were ants to die out , the result would be global disaster after all , most living things on earth support others .
the power of the " little creatures that run the world " was spelt out by harvard biologist edward o.wilson and german behavioral biologist bert hoelldobler in their pulitzer prize-winning 1990 study " the ants . " their book reveals how humans would die without the ants ' soil-tilling drudgery that maintains the existence of plant life .
army ants are known to support 100 known species , from beetles to birds .
were they to die out , entire ecosystems would collapse and the result would be global disaster .
" everyone is aware of all this , " says greenpeace expert cederquist . " but no one acts . "
pricing the earth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in papua new guinea , locals are leraning to farm sustainably what might finally spur action is the dawning awareness of the global economic impact of the loss of biodiversity .
under the aegis of the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -lrb- teeb -rrb- project is an international initiative to draw attention to this issue .
in its latest study published in july , it puts the extent of losses of natural capital taking place as a result of deforestation and degradation at between $ 2 - 4.5 trillion per year , every year .
the full report sets out the economic case for biodiversity and ecosystems , describing how even factors such as insect pollination ultimately have a crucial impact on business and society .
against this backdrop , environmentalists are well aware that however local they might seem , conservation efforts in papua new guinea have repercussions for the entire planet .

the test now is whether it can perform to expectations . in early july 2010 the united nations -lrb- un -rrb- created a new entity for gender equality and the empowerment of women – to be known as un women .
it also adopted important resolutions aimed at improving the un organizations ' development cooperation .
the first you 've heard of it ?
that is a shame because these achievements show that the organization is capable of instituting reform and that multilateral action among 192 countries remains possible .
so what 's it all about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un chief ban ki-moon has come in for heavy criticism of his leadership recently un organizations like the development program -lrb- undp -rrb- , the children 's program -lrb- unicef -rrb- or the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- – to name but the three largest – are important multilateral actors .
they have a key role to play when it comes to implementing universally valid norms such as , for instance , human rights , gender equality and environmental standards .
along with their global , operative tasks they also contribute research studies to the development discourse -lrb- for example , the annual undp human development report -rrb- and engage in advocacy work on behalf of the most disadvantaged .
the fact that developing countries are involved on equal terms in the governance of un organizations means they are regarded as especially legitimate .
and that is why they are in a better position to engage in sensitive policy fields .
nevertheless , the un system is highly fragmented .
the numerous organizations often do not work well together , their fields of activity overlap and they ought to bring their individual strengths more to the fore .
these were the conclusions drawn in a report submitted by a high-level panel of experts in 2006 that recommended that the un should " deliver as one . "
the experts also felt that the un 's structures should be simplified , among other things in the fields of women and gender equality .
they recommended that the four institutions dealing with these issues should be combined to form a new organization in order to make them more visible and better able to assert themselves by bringing together resources and mandates .
slow process while western industrialized nations backed ideas to simplify un structures and to concentrate their areas of activity , some key developing countries and emerging economies regarded these plans with suspicion from the very outset .
in their eyes these steps would weaken the un , which on paper at least has a comprehensive mandate for economic and financial issues .
they feared that development policy would suffer further cuts in favor of the security agenda endorsed by the west , and emphasized that it was the un 's institutional and thematic variety that set it apart .
in view of their dissent as to the content of the majority of the experts ' suggestions , they insisted that the negotiations - and thus any possible compromises - should cover all issues .
the establishment of the new women 's organization , which many developing countries also backed , thus became dependent on consensus in other areas .
decisions , decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major developing nations are demanding a greater say in international affairs the most important decision that has been taken is that to establish un women .
the entity aims to be up and running by january 2011 .
its work will on the one hand be normative , that is it will continue developing existing international obligations and ensure they are observed and implemented across the world .
on the other hand , it will run operational programs for which it will have a budget of 500 million us dollars at its disposal .
other decisions are less spectacular but nevertheless important , namely those on improving the governance of the un development system , on harmonizing administrative procedures across the entire system , guaranteeing a reliable funding base in the future and in regard to an ongoing reform initiative in which the un family delivers as one in eight pilot countries .
reaching agreement the resolution was preceded by four years of negotiations .
it quickly became clear that no radical restructuring exercise would be possible , as consensus could only be reached on implementing successive small-scale reforms .
although the line of conflict traditionally ran between developing countries -lrb- g-77 -rrb- and industrialized nations , clear differences became apparent .
smaller , poorer countries like rwanda and tanzania as well as middle-income countries like vietnam and uruguay , in which bilateral development aid is gradually tapering off , have a particular interest in more coherent and effective cooperation with un organizations .
the positions adopted by a few ideologically- , motivated countries like cuba or emerging economies like india and egypt were primarily based on power politics and their attempts to prevent changes or achieve concessions .
the industrialized nations ' positions were more homogeneous .
during the very last phase of negotiations , however , the united states irritated the other countries by going it alone and making concessions on the new un women supervisory board .
ultimately , however , no-one wanted to stand in the way of the creation of an organization that had long been overdue .
what next ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 is losing ground to the g20 in terms of significance the resolution set an important milestone on the road to the reform of un development cooperation .
however , un women must now prove that it can be more than the sum of its individual parts .
appointing a well-known and authoritative personality from the south to the leadership position will play a key role when it comes to gaining acceptance for the organization 's work in developing countries , as well as for the generosity donor countries will now have to show .
despite the need to tighten budgetary belts , germany should contribute financially .
not only in order to increase its chances of being elected onto the security council in october 2010 , but also , in view of the recently announced cuts in contributions , to demonstrate that the un is still an important partner for germany .
the un remains an indispensable consensus-reaching and decision-making forum when it comes to pressing global challenges .
in countries of the south , the world organization 's development activities are key to gaining acceptance for its activities in the areas of security , or norm and standard setting .
also in the age of the g-20 , strengthening the un continues to be in germany 's interest .

now the entrepreneur has become the obejct of public scrutiny . after a mass panic killed 19 people at the love parade techno music festival in duisburg on saturday , one of germany 's less conventional entrepreneurs has found himself in the public spotlight .
rainer schaller , who took over love parade in 2006 , owns a successful chain of fitness studios .
mcfit , as schaller 's chain is called , boasts prices as low as 16,90 euros per month .
it has 118 throughout germany , some 900,000 members , and a turnover of 134 million euros .
love parade was intended to serve as a marketing tool for the company , which plans to expand across europe .
41-year-old schaller 's success can in part be explained by his willingness to take risks .
according to the handelsblatt daily newspaper , schaller 's first fitness studio was an illegal operation which he kept amongst friends and operated in an attic above his parents ' supermarket outside of nuremberg .
he comes from a family of grocers who taught him the " mathematics and accounting " of running a business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 500 people were injured during the love parade mass panic self-made entrepreneur when schaller opened the first mcfit in wurzburg in 1997 , he did every job in the new business himself , from cleaning to training and administration tasks .
he advertised the new mcfit studio as being " now also in wurzburg , " giving the impression that it was part of a large , successful chain .
unlike most fitness chains in germany , mcfit 's strategy is to offer a barebones gym with limited classes and training staff and no extra amenities such as saunas .
customers have around-the-clock access to the machines , but showers cost 50 cents extra .
the concept proved popular , and schaller opened his second studio in 1998 .
in 2008 , the chain recruited ukrainian celebrity boxers vladimir und vitali klitschko to represent it , and in 2009 it opened its first studios in austria and spain .
in 2009 , he told the handelsblatt newspaper that mcfit 's interest in love parade was to " use a relatively small budget to gain a high recognition factor .
we spent a lot of time thinking about what kind of crazy thing we could do to make ourselves more well-known .
we chose love parade . "
condolences expressed schaller expressed his condolences at a press conference sunday , reading from a text and visibly upset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcfit was the main sponsor of the ill-fated love parade " the love parade was always a peaceful and joyous party that will now forever be overshadowed by yesterday 's tragic events .
out of respect for the victims , families and friends , we will discontinue the event .
the love parade is no more .
words are not enough to describe the extent of the shock i feel , " he said .
love parade was founded in 1989 by berlin dj matthias roeingh , also known as dr motte .
in some years it drew more than a million visitors , but planning and financing issues caused it to be cancelled in 2004 and 2005 .
the event was revived and relocated to the ruhr region in 2006 by lopavent , a schaller-owned company .
mcfit has sponsored it with 3 million euros per year ever since .

but on its 200th birthday , the future of the industry is now under threat . in 2001 , uk foreign secretary robin cook proclaimed chicken tikka masala , a lightly-spiced , creamy , tomato based stew a " true british national dish " .
the south asian curry has earned a lot of fans in britain .
annually , curry sales in britain are estimated at around 3.5 billion pounds .
but new government immigration rules introduced last week under the conservative-liberal coalition could spell the end of the local curry house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chicken tikka masala is very popular in britain the new immigration rule is a five-tier immigration system . it is similar to the australian system , where the visa applicants must have certain number of points to enter the country .
the points are ascertained by the applicants ' qualifications , their earning potential and their english speaking skills .
under this new system it would be difficult for unskilled foreign workers to get a visa . unemployment for thousands it would now be very hard to get foreign staff for these restaurants , as bajloor rashid , president of the bangladesh caterers association explains .
" at the moment we are not running at full capacity , " he says .
" for the last five years we have had an acute shortage of 30,000 skilled workers in our curry industry .
we have been lobbying the government for so long so that we can get more and more skilled staff from south asia .
and now the government is putting a cap on it .
so it will seriously damage our industry and there will be lot of job losses as well . " the curry industry relies on foreign cooks , mostly from bangladesh .
the bangladesh caterers association employs 100,000 people and has about 12,000 bangladeshi restaurants in britain .
rashid says cooking curry is a special art and one can not simply employ local staff in curry houses .
" there is a cultural barrier , " he says .
" when they work with bengali or hindi speaking people there is a language problem .
they can not take the curry smell as much as we can .
i mean we love curry and the smell of curry , but they think the smell of curry makes their clothes stink . "

and the period of high immigration was at the same time a period of unprecedented economic growth .
over that period the uk grew by about 3 percent .
the uk has since then been through recession .

and now the government is putting a cap on it .
so it will seriously damage our industry and there will be lot of job losses as well . " the curry industry relies on foreign cooks , mostly from bangladesh .
the bangladesh caterers association employs 100,000 people and has about 12,000 bangladeshi restaurants in britain .
rashid says cooking curry is a special art and one can not simply employ local staff in curry houses .
" there is a cultural barrier , " he says .
" when they work with bengali or hindi speaking people there is a language problem .
they can not take the curry smell as much as we can .
i mean we love curry and the smell of curry , but they think the smell of curry makes their clothes stink . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : typical spices used for curry protest against the move for years rashid and his organization have been arguing their case with the government .
" we are going to see the ministers soon to put our representation there .
they do n't know what the nation 's need is .
how can they put a limitation ?
we are going to lobby the government as much as we can and make sure that the government does not go for that rule . " prof. christian dustmann , head of the center for research and analysis of migration in london , explains the motive behind the cap : " the uk had experienced a period of very high immigration in the years between 2003 and 2008 .
and the period of high immigration was at the same time a period of unprecedented economic growth .
over that period the uk grew by about 3 percent .
the uk has since then been through recession .
however when the uk comes out of recession then the existence of a cap may prove detrimental to expanding the industries and the uk economy . " with the temporary immigration rule due to be introduced this week , immigration minister damian green is still consulting on a permanent cap due to be implemented next april . author : jaisu bhullar editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not only animals and plants flourish by protecting biodiversity , but business too . papua new guinea is one of the world 's least explored countries - both culturally and geographically - and many undiscovered species of plants and animals are thought to exist in its interior .
its tropical wilderness is home to a stunning range of biodiversity - from the queen alexandra 's birdwing , the largest butterfly in the world , to the flamboyant bird-of-paradise , which graces the flag of papua new guinea .
another rare and endangered species native to the country 's rainforest is the golden-mantled tree kangaroo , while a recent discovery was a frog with a pinocchio-like protuberance on its nose that points up when the male is calling and deflates when quiet .
local and global value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird of paradise is the country 's national emblem papua new guinea contains over 5 percent of the world 's biodiversity within less than 1 percent of its total land area .
for now , the rainforests of papua new guinea are still intact .
but although the overall population density of the country remains low , the population is growing slowly but steadily - progressing , according to un estimates , from 5,711,000 in 2003 to a projected population in the year 2015 of 7,169,000 .
these inhabitants depend on the local biological resources to sustain their livelihoods .
but the result , as recent satellite studies of the region show , is that current rates of deforestation will cause more than half of the papua new guinea 's rainforests to be lost or seriously degraded by 2021 .
taking a toll the increase in human population , coupled with the availability of more efficient farming tools , pose a growing threat to biodiversity .
the local agriculture and logging industry are taking their toll on the environment and threatening the natural habitats of valued birds , animals , fish , insects , plants and trees . un experts estimate that 130 species of plants , animals and insects are lost worldwide every single day .
" this is 100 to 1000 times faster than the evolutionary process of the extinction of species and appearance of new ones , " says andrea cederquist , a greenpeace biodiversity expert .
for now , it is unclear as to how exactly biodiversity in papua new guinea is being affected .
" climate change and the loss of species are closely intertwined , and no one can gauge the full effects , " stresses cederquist .
experts agree that these can not be predicted .
but given that the extinction of one species can have knock-on effects , causing further extinctions , not only papua new guinea 's birds of paradise are at stake , but entire ecosystems .
chains of extinction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were ants to die out , the result would be global disaster after all , most living things on earth support others .
the power of the " little creatures that run the world " was spelt out by harvard biologist edward o.wilson and german behavioral biologist bert hoelldobler in their pulitzer prize-winning 1990 study " the ants . " their book reveals how humans would die without the ants ' soil-tilling drudgery that maintains the existence of plant life .
army ants are known to support 100 known species , from beetles to birds .
were they to die out , entire ecosystems would collapse and the result would be global disaster .
" everyone is aware of all this , " says greenpeace expert cederquist . " but no one acts . "

the death toll now stands at 20 , and more than 500 people are still being treated for their injuries after panic broke out in a tunnel leading to the festival grounds on saturday afternoon .
duisburg mayor adolf sauerland , who defended what he called a " solid " security plan at a news conference on sunday and was pelted with rubbish by angry bystanders , has faced scathing criticism from several media outlets .
he resisted calls for his immediate resignation on monday and told public broadcaster wdr that he would address that issue when the time was right .
" i will be asking myself this question , there 's no doubt about that , " he said , adding that the main issue now was explaining saturday 's tragedy .
" and when we know what happened there , then we will answer this question .
that i promise . "
" if the city is guilty of anything then we will assume responsibility , " he said in a statement .
sauerland said a condolence book would remain available through the end of the month and that the city was working with church officials to plan a memorial service .
' consequences must be drawn urgently ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerland , right , has defended the city 's " solid " security plan on monday , german chancellor angela merkel said she expected a " scrupulously thorough " investigation into the tragedy , according to her spokesman ulrich wilhelm . " a full picture and a proper analysis of what happened and what mistakes were possibly made can however only be done once the investigation is completed , " he added . " consequences must be drawn urgently ...
i think it 's clear the security plans were not good , " said hannelore kraft , the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , in an interview on ard television . earlier monday , german prosecutors seized documents relating to the security planning of the event . rolf haferkamp , spokesman for the duisburg state prosecutors ' office , said he could not speak about the content of the numerous documents that were seized , but said the investigation of possible negligent manslaughter was ongoing . who 's to blame ? one theoretical explanation for the accident that quickly emerged in the press was that duisburg , a city in the former coal-mining ruhr region , was desperate to gain from the prestige of the love parade , and that city officials did not take security concerns seriously . the ruhr 2010 european capital of culture program has taken the lead in attracting such events and the program 's chief organizer , fritz pleitgen , said he felt " jointly responsible , but more in a moral sense . " " -lsb- the love parade -rsb- was offered to us as a project for the capital of culture program , " he told zdf public television .
" we accepted that , but we were not involved in financing or organizing the event . " the cologne-based daily newspaper koelner stadt-anzeiger also reported that the chief of the duisburg fire department told sauerland in writing that the location for the event - the city 's former freight rail station - was too small for the expected number of visitors . and the online edition of the news magazine der spiegel reported that an official document issued by the city of duisburg authorized only 250,000 people for the event - far short of the estimated 1.4 million who attended .
it also reportedly exempted the organizers from the minimal width of escape routes and from having fire brigade provisions .
bildunterschrift : organizers said the love parade would never take place again police unions point finger rainer wendt , head of the national police union , said police warnings about the dangers of holding the festival in duisburg were not heeded .
" i warned them a year ago that duisburg was not a suitable location for the love parade .
it 's too small and too cramped , " said wendt .
" but i was called a killjoy and a security fanatic . "
a report in the koelner stadt-anzeiger said that mayor sauerland gave the go-ahead for the event just hours before the start , despite concerns from police and fire officials .
however , frank richter , head of the state-level north rhine-westphalia police trade union , said there was currently no proof that city officials had ignored security concerns .
in an interview with deutschlandfunk radio , richter placed the blame on the event 's organizers .
" i find it unacceptable that those who are responsible for this event , like the organizer -lsb- rainer schaller -rsb- , said in the press conference that there would just be no more love parades , as if he had nothing to do with this whole thing . "

not only animals and plants flourish by protecting biodiversity , but business too . papua new guinea is one of the world 's least explored countries - both culturally and geographically - and many undiscovered species of plants and animals are thought to exist in its interior .
its tropical wilderness is home to a stunning range of biodiversity - from the queen alexandra 's birdwing , the largest butterfly in the world , to the flamboyant bird-of-paradise , which graces the flag of papua new guinea .
another rare and endangered species native to the country 's rainforest is the golden-mantled tree kangaroo , while a recent discovery was a frog with a pinocchio-like protuberance on its nose that points up when the male is calling and deflates when quiet .
local and global value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird of paradise is the country 's national emblem papua new guinea contains over 5 percent of the world 's biodiversity within less than 1 percent of its total land area .
for now , the rainforests of papua new guinea are still intact .
but although the overall population density of the country remains low , the population is growing slowly but steadily - progressing , according to un estimates , from 5,711,000 in 2003 to a projected population in the year 2015 of 7,169,000 .
these inhabitants depend on the local biological resources to sustain their livelihoods .
but the result , as recent satellite studies of the region show , is that current rates of deforestation will cause more than half of the papua new guinea 's rainforests to be lost or seriously degraded by 2021 .
taking a toll the increase in human population , coupled with the availability of more efficient farming tools , pose a growing threat to biodiversity .
the local agriculture and logging industry are taking their toll on the environment and threatening the natural habitats of valued birds , animals , fish , insects , plants and trees . un experts estimate that 130 species of plants , animals and insects are lost worldwide every single day .
" this is 100 to 1000 times faster than the evolutionary process of the extinction of species and appearance of new ones , " says andrea cederquist , a greenpeace biodiversity expert .
for now , it is unclear as to how exactly biodiversity in papua new guinea is being affected .
" climate change and the loss of species are closely intertwined , and no one can gauge the full effects , " stresses cederquist .
experts agree that these can not be predicted .
but given that the extinction of one species can have knock-on effects , causing further extinctions , not only papua new guinea 's birds of paradise are at stake , but entire ecosystems .
chains of extinction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were ants to die out , the result would be global disaster after all , most living things on earth support others .
the power of the " little creatures that run the world " was spelt out by harvard biologist edward o.wilson and german behavioral biologist bert hoelldobler in their pulitzer prize-winning 1990 study " the ants . " their book reveals how humans would die without the ants ' soil-tilling drudgery that maintains the existence of plant life .
army ants are known to support 100 known species , from beetles to birds .
were they to die out , entire ecosystems would collapse and the result would be global disaster .
" everyone is aware of all this , " says greenpeace expert cederquist . " but no one acts . "
pricing the earth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in papua new guinea , locals are leraning to farm sustainably what might finally spur action is the dawning awareness of the global economic impact of the loss of biodiversity .
under the aegis of the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -lrb- teeb -rrb- project is an international initiative to draw attention to this issue .
in its latest study published in july , it puts the extent of losses of natural capital taking place as a result of deforestation and degradation at between $ 2 - 4.5 trillion per year , every year .
the full report sets out the economic case for biodiversity and ecosystems , describing how even factors such as insect pollination ultimately have a crucial impact on business and society .
against this backdrop , environmentalists are well aware that however local they might seem , conservation efforts in papua new guinea have repercussions for the entire planet .

now the entrepreneur has become the obejct of public scrutiny . after a mass panic killed 19 people at the love parade techno music festival in duisburg on saturday , one of germany 's less conventional entrepreneurs has found himself in the public spotlight .
rainer schaller , who took over love parade in 2006 , owns a successful chain of fitness studios .
mcfit , as schaller 's chain is called , boasts prices as low as 16,90 euros per month .
it has 118 throughout germany , some 900,000 members , and a turnover of 134 million euros .
love parade was intended to serve as a marketing tool for the company , which plans to expand across europe .
41-year-old schaller 's success can in part be explained by his willingness to take risks .
according to the handelsblatt daily newspaper , schaller 's first fitness studio was an illegal operation which he kept amongst friends and operated in an attic above his parents ' supermarket outside of nuremberg .
he comes from a family of grocers who taught him the " mathematics and accounting " of running a business .

he advertised the new mcfit studio as being " now also in wurzburg , " giving the impression that it was part of a large , successful chain .
unlike most fitness chains in germany , mcfit 's strategy is to offer a barebones gym with limited classes and training staff and no extra amenities such as saunas .
customers have around-the-clock access to the machines , but showers cost 50 cents extra .
the concept proved popular , and schaller opened his second studio in 1998 .
in 2008 , the chain recruited ukrainian celebrity boxers vladimir und vitali klitschko to represent it , and in 2009 it opened its first studios in austria and spain .
in 2009 , he told the handelsblatt newspaper that mcfit 's interest in love parade was to " use a relatively small budget to gain a high recognition factor .
we spent a lot of time thinking about what kind of crazy thing we could do to make ourselves more well-known .
we chose love parade . "
condolences expressed schaller expressed his condolences at a press conference sunday , reading from a text and visibly upset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcfit was the main sponsor of the ill-fated love parade " the love parade was always a peaceful and joyous party that will now forever be overshadowed by yesterday 's tragic events .
out of respect for the victims , families and friends , we will discontinue the event .
the love parade is no more .
words are not enough to describe the extent of the shock i feel , " he said .
love parade was founded in 1989 by berlin dj matthias roeingh , also known as dr motte .
in some years it drew more than a million visitors , but planning and financing issues caused it to be cancelled in 2004 and 2005 .
the event was revived and relocated to the ruhr region in 2006 by lopavent , a schaller-owned company .
mcfit has sponsored it with 3 million euros per year ever since .

the test now is whether it can perform to expectations . in early july 2010 the united nations -lrb- un -rrb- created a new entity for gender equality and the empowerment of women – to be known as un women .
it also adopted important resolutions aimed at improving the un organizations ' development cooperation .
the first you 've heard of it ?
that is a shame because these achievements show that the organization is capable of instituting reform and that multilateral action among 192 countries remains possible .
so what 's it all about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un chief ban ki-moon has come in for heavy criticism of his leadership recently un organizations like the development program -lrb- undp -rrb- , the children 's program -lrb- unicef -rrb- or the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- – to name but the three largest – are important multilateral actors .
they have a key role to play when it comes to implementing universally valid norms such as , for instance , human rights , gender equality and environmental standards .
along with their global , operative tasks they also contribute research studies to the development discourse -lrb- for example , the annual undp human development report -rrb- and engage in advocacy work on behalf of the most disadvantaged .
the fact that developing countries are involved on equal terms in the governance of un organizations means they are regarded as especially legitimate .
and that is why they are in a better position to engage in sensitive policy fields .
nevertheless , the un system is highly fragmented .
the numerous organizations often do not work well together , their fields of activity overlap and they ought to bring their individual strengths more to the fore .
these were the conclusions drawn in a report submitted by a high-level panel of experts in 2006 that recommended that the un should " deliver as one . "
the experts also felt that the un 's structures should be simplified , among other things in the fields of women and gender equality .
they recommended that the four institutions dealing with these issues should be combined to form a new organization in order to make them more visible and better able to assert themselves by bringing together resources and mandates .
slow process while western industrialized nations backed ideas to simplify un structures and to concentrate their areas of activity , some key developing countries and emerging economies regarded these plans with suspicion from the very outset .
in their eyes these steps would weaken the un , which on paper at least has a comprehensive mandate for economic and financial issues .
they feared that development policy would suffer further cuts in favor of the security agenda endorsed by the west , and emphasized that it was the un 's institutional and thematic variety that set it apart .
in view of their dissent as to the content of the majority of the experts ' suggestions , they insisted that the negotiations - and thus any possible compromises - should cover all issues .
the establishment of the new women 's organization , which many developing countries also backed , thus became dependent on consensus in other areas .
decisions , decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major developing nations are demanding a greater say in international affairs the most important decision that has been taken is that to establish un women .
the entity aims to be up and running by january 2011 .
its work will on the one hand be normative , that is it will continue developing existing international obligations and ensure they are observed and implemented across the world .
on the other hand , it will run operational programs for which it will have a budget of 500 million us dollars at its disposal .
other decisions are less spectacular but nevertheless important , namely those on improving the governance of the un development system , on harmonizing administrative procedures across the entire system , guaranteeing a reliable funding base in the future and in regard to an ongoing reform initiative in which the un family delivers as one in eight pilot countries .
reaching agreement the resolution was preceded by four years of negotiations .
it quickly became clear that no radical restructuring exercise would be possible , as consensus could only be reached on implementing successive small-scale reforms .
although the line of conflict traditionally ran between developing countries -lrb- g-77 -rrb- and industrialized nations , clear differences became apparent .
smaller , poorer countries like rwanda and tanzania as well as middle-income countries like vietnam and uruguay , in which bilateral development aid is gradually tapering off , have a particular interest in more coherent and effective cooperation with un organizations .
the positions adopted by a few ideologically- , motivated countries like cuba or emerging economies like india and egypt were primarily based on power politics and their attempts to prevent changes or achieve concessions .
the industrialized nations ' positions were more homogeneous .
during the very last phase of negotiations , however , the united states irritated the other countries by going it alone and making concessions on the new un women supervisory board .
ultimately , however , no-one wanted to stand in the way of the creation of an organization that had long been overdue .
what next ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 is losing ground to the g20 in terms of significance the resolution set an important milestone on the road to the reform of un development cooperation .
however , un women must now prove that it can be more than the sum of its individual parts .
appointing a well-known and authoritative personality from the south to the leadership position will play a key role when it comes to gaining acceptance for the organization 's work in developing countries , as well as for the generosity donor countries will now have to show .
despite the need to tighten budgetary belts , germany should contribute financially .
not only in order to increase its chances of being elected onto the security council in october 2010 , but also , in view of the recently announced cuts in contributions , to demonstrate that the un is still an important partner for germany .
the un remains an indispensable consensus-reaching and decision-making forum when it comes to pressing global challenges .
in countries of the south , the world organization 's development activities are key to gaining acceptance for its activities in the areas of security , or norm and standard setting .
also in the age of the g-20 , strengthening the un continues to be in germany 's interest .
silke weinlich , researcher in department „ bi- and multilateral development cooperation “ , german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- is one of the leading think tanks for development policy world-wide .

but on its 200th birthday , the future of the industry is now under threat . in 2001 , uk foreign secretary robin cook proclaimed chicken tikka masala , a lightly-spiced , creamy , tomato based stew a " true british national dish " .
the south asian curry has earned a lot of fans in britain .
annually , curry sales in britain are estimated at around 3.5 billion pounds .
but new government immigration rules introduced last week under the conservative-liberal coalition could spell the end of the local curry house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chicken tikka masala is very popular in britain the new immigration rule is a five-tier immigration system . it is similar to the australian system , where the visa applicants must have certain number of points to enter the country .
the points are ascertained by the applicants ' qualifications , their earning potential and their english speaking skills .
under this new system it would be difficult for unskilled foreign workers to get a visa . unemployment for thousands it would now be very hard to get foreign staff for these restaurants , as bajloor rashid , president of the bangladesh caterers association explains .
" at the moment we are not running at full capacity , " he says .
" for the last five years we have had an acute shortage of 30,000 skilled workers in our curry industry .
we have been lobbying the government for so long so that we can get more and more skilled staff from south asia .
and now the government is putting a cap on it .
so it will seriously damage our industry and there will be lot of job losses as well . " the curry industry relies on foreign cooks , mostly from bangladesh .
the bangladesh caterers association employs 100,000 people and has about 12,000 bangladeshi restaurants in britain .
rashid says cooking curry is a special art and one can not simply employ local staff in curry houses .
" there is a cultural barrier , " he says .
" when they work with bengali or hindi speaking people there is a language problem .
they can not take the curry smell as much as we can .
i mean we love curry and the smell of curry , but they think the smell of curry makes their clothes stink . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : typical spices used for curry protest against the move for years rashid and his organization have been arguing their case with the government .
" we are going to see the ministers soon to put our representation there .
they do n't know what the nation 's need is .
how can they put a limitation ?
we are going to lobby the government as much as we can and make sure that the government does not go for that rule . " prof. christian dustmann , head of the center for research and analysis of migration in london , explains the motive behind the cap : " the uk had experienced a period of very high immigration in the years between 2003 and 2008 .
and the period of high immigration was at the same time a period of unprecedented economic growth .
over that period the uk grew by about 3 percent .
the uk has since then been through recession .
however when the uk comes out of recession then the existence of a cap may prove detrimental to expanding the industries and the uk economy . " with the temporary immigration rule due to be introduced this week , immigration minister damian green is still consulting on a permanent cap due to be implemented next april . author : jaisu bhullar editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but this year ’ s love parade in duisburg ended in disaster , with 19 people killed and hundreds of others injured .
two days on , many questions are left unanswered . german prosecutors are continuing to look into allegations about lax safety measures at saturday 's love parade in duisburg , where 19 people died and hundreds of others were injured in a crush near a tunnel leading to the festival grounds .
survivors are demanding explanations for why security plans , described by duisburg mayor adolf sauerland as “ solid ” , went wrong .
only 250,000 visitors authorized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors are asking why organizers said just hours before the event started that 1.4 million revelers were expected .
but in its online edition , the german magazine spiegel cites an internal document saying that the festival had authorization only for 250,000 visitors .
another newspaper , the koelner stadt-anzeiger , reports that the mayor had ignored written warnings in october 2009 saying the grounds were too narrow for the expected crowds .
the head of germany 's police union , rainer wendt , told the mass circulation newspaper bild that he warned authorities a year ago of duisburg 's unsuitability as a venue for the love parade , as the city was too small and narrow .
how many were there ?
but there are conflicting reports on how many people were actually in duisburg to visit the festival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former cargo train station : too small as a venue ?
police have so far only confirmed that 105,000 visitors arrived by train .
an official in charge of emergency response , wolfgang rabe , said the site , the former cargo train station , had a capacity of up to 300,000 people and that it was never full at any time during the event .
however , as the last three love parades , in berlin , essen and dortmund , have all had more than a million visitors , some argue that there was no reason to expect fewer this year .
who or whatever was to blame for the catastrophe , however , one thing seems certain : the love parade , which began in 1989 in berlin , has taken place for the last time .
organizer rainer schaller told a news conference in duisburg on sunday that the event would be discontinued out of respect for the victims , their families and friends .
but what will go on for a long time to come are questions about how such a tragedy could occur – and how to prevent something like it from ever happening again .

but this year ’ s love parade in duisburg ended in disaster , with 19 people killed and hundreds of others injured .
two days on , many questions are left unanswered . german prosecutors are continuing to look into allegations about lax safety measures at saturday 's love parade in duisburg , where 19 people died and hundreds of others were injured in a crush near a tunnel leading to the festival grounds .
survivors are demanding explanations for why security plans , described by duisburg mayor adolf sauerland as “ solid ” , went wrong .
only 250,000 visitors authorized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors are asking why organizers said just hours before the event started that 1.4 million revelers were expected .
but in its online edition , the german magazine spiegel cites an internal document saying that the festival had authorization only for 250,000 visitors .
another newspaper , the koelner stadt-anzeiger , reports that the mayor had ignored written warnings in october 2009 saying the grounds were too narrow for the expected crowds .
the head of germany 's police union , rainer wendt , told the mass circulation newspaper bild that he warned authorities a year ago of duisburg 's unsuitability as a venue for the love parade , as the city was too small and narrow .

an official in charge of emergency response , wolfgang rabe , said the site , the former cargo train station , had a capacity of up to 300,000 people and that it was never full at any time during the event .
however , as the last three love parades , in berlin , essen and dortmund , have all had more than a million visitors , some argue that there was no reason to expect fewer this year .
who or whatever was to blame for the catastrophe , however , one thing seems certain : the love parade , which began in 1989 in berlin , has taken place for the last time .
organizer rainer schaller told a news conference in duisburg on sunday that the event would be discontinued out of respect for the victims , their families and friends .

but on its 200th birthday , the future of the industry is now under threat . in 2001 , uk foreign secretary robin cook proclaimed chicken tikka masala , a lightly-spiced , creamy , tomato based stew a " true british national dish " .
the south asian curry has earned a lot of fans in britain .
annually , curry sales in britain are estimated at around 3.5 billion pounds .
but new government immigration rules introduced last week under the conservative-liberal coalition could spell the end of the local curry house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chicken tikka masala is very popular in britain the new immigration rule is a five-tier immigration system . it is similar to the australian system , where the visa applicants must have certain number of points to enter the country .
the points are ascertained by the applicants ' qualifications , their earning potential and their english speaking skills .
under this new system it would be difficult for unskilled foreign workers to get a visa . unemployment for thousands it would now be very hard to get foreign staff for these restaurants , as bajloor rashid , president of the bangladesh caterers association explains .
" at the moment we are not running at full capacity , " he says .
" for the last five years we have had an acute shortage of 30,000 skilled workers in our curry industry .
we have been lobbying the government for so long so that we can get more and more skilled staff from south asia .
and now the government is putting a cap on it .
so it will seriously damage our industry and there will be lot of job losses as well . " the curry industry relies on foreign cooks , mostly from bangladesh .
the bangladesh caterers association employs 100,000 people and has about 12,000 bangladeshi restaurants in britain .
rashid says cooking curry is a special art and one can not simply employ local staff in curry houses .
" there is a cultural barrier , " he says .
" when they work with bengali or hindi speaking people there is a language problem .
they can not take the curry smell as much as we can .
i mean we love curry and the smell of curry , but they think the smell of curry makes their clothes stink . "

how can they put a limitation ?
we are going to lobby the government as much as we can and make sure that the government does not go for that rule . " prof. christian dustmann , head of the center for research and analysis of migration in london , explains the motive behind the cap : " the uk had experienced a period of very high immigration in the years between 2003 and 2008 .
and the period of high immigration was at the same time a period of unprecedented economic growth .
over that period the uk grew by about 3 percent .
the uk has since then been through recession .

" when they work with bengali or hindi speaking people there is a language problem .
they can not take the curry smell as much as we can .
i mean we love curry and the smell of curry , but they think the smell of curry makes their clothes stink . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : typical spices used for curry protest against the move for years rashid and his organization have been arguing their case with the government .
" we are going to see the ministers soon to put our representation there .
they do n't know what the nation 's need is .
how can they put a limitation ?
we are going to lobby the government as much as we can and make sure that the government does not go for that rule . " prof. christian dustmann , head of the center for research and analysis of migration in london , explains the motive behind the cap : " the uk had experienced a period of very high immigration in the years between 2003 and 2008 .
and the period of high immigration was at the same time a period of unprecedented economic growth .
over that period the uk grew by about 3 percent .
the uk has since then been through recession .
however when the uk comes out of recession then the existence of a cap may prove detrimental to expanding the industries and the uk economy . " with the temporary immigration rule due to be introduced this week , immigration minister damian green is still consulting on a permanent cap due to be implemented next april . author : jaisu bhullar editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opinion is also divided within chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union . german chancellor angela merkel 's governing coalition has been put on notice that it will face a fight over any change to the law on nuclear energy without approval from the country 's upper house of parliament .
green party leader claudia roth threatened on sunday to press for a judicial review at the germany 's constitutional court if the government moved to extend the operational lifetimes of nuclear power plants without consent from the bundesrat .
speaking to public broadcaster ard , roth said that a number of germany 's state governments were unhappy about a proposed delay to the closure dates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leader roth says several states oppose a change the deputy premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , sylvia loehrmann , also said that the government could expect what she described as " bitter resistance " from that state 's coalition , which is made up of the spd and her green party .
" we will exhaust every legal possibility , right up to the constitutional court , " the green party 's loehrmann told the tagesspiegel newspaper on sunday .
according to a law passed in 2002 by the then-ruling spd and the green coalition , all of germany 's nuclear power plants are to go off line by 2022 .
chancellor merkel 's government has said that it intends to extend the deadline by a period that has yet to be determined .
until recently , it had been thought that any legal change would need to be approved by the bundesrat , germany 's upper house , which represents country 's 16 states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court may ultimately decide the matter however , after the may election in north rhine-westphalia , the center-right coalition lost its majority in the upper chamber .
soon afterward , merkel 's chief of staff , ronald pofalla , announced possible plans to bypass the bundesrat entirely - infuriating opposition parties .
whether or not the government needs the agreement of the bundesrat is not clear . dissent within coalition opinion within merkel 's cdu is also divided . the cdu premier of the state of saarland , peter mueller , has questioned the need for an extension .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister norbert roettgen is seeking a consensus " we need an energy supply that is safe , sustainable and affordable , " mueller said in sunday 's edition of the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" i believe that we would be able to achieve that without the extension of the lifetimes of nuclear power plants . "
environment minister norbert roettgen of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , argued for a new limited nuclear plant extension in the monday edition of bremen 's weser kurier , stressing that nuclear power was only needed until alternatives could be found .
" it is a very rational approach , which is linked with enormous economic opportunities for germany .
people in germany understand that , better apparently than so many critics . "
in the same newspaper 's online edition on sunday , baden wuertemberg 's cdu premier , stephan mappus , who wants to see the final shut down date extended by 15 years , criticized roettgen for not adopting a clearer line in favor of an extension .

green party leader claudia roth threatened on sunday to press for a judicial review at the germany 's constitutional court if the government moved to extend the operational lifetimes of nuclear power plants without consent from the bundesrat .
speaking to public broadcaster ard , roth said that a number of germany 's state governments were unhappy about a proposed delay to the closure dates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party leader roth says several states oppose a change the deputy premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , sylvia loehrmann , also said that the government could expect what she described as " bitter resistance " from that state 's coalition , which is made up of the spd and her green party .
" we will exhaust every legal possibility , right up to the constitutional court , " the green party 's loehrmann told the tagesspiegel newspaper on sunday .
according to a law passed in 2002 by the then-ruling spd and the green coalition , all of germany 's nuclear power plants are to go off line by 2022 .
chancellor merkel 's government has said that it intends to extend the deadline by a period that has yet to be determined .

soon afterward , merkel 's chief of staff , ronald pofalla , announced possible plans to bypass the bundesrat entirely - infuriating opposition parties .
whether or not the government needs the agreement of the bundesrat is not clear . dissent within coalition opinion within merkel 's cdu is also divided . the cdu premier of the state of saarland , peter mueller , has questioned the need for an extension .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister norbert roettgen is seeking a consensus " we need an energy supply that is safe , sustainable and affordable , " mueller said in sunday 's edition of the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" i believe that we would be able to achieve that without the extension of the lifetimes of nuclear power plants . "
environment minister norbert roettgen of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , argued for a new limited nuclear plant extension in the monday edition of bremen 's weser kurier , stressing that nuclear power was only needed until alternatives could be found .
" it is a very rational approach , which is linked with enormous economic opportunities for germany .
people in germany understand that , better apparently than so many critics . "
in the same newspaper 's online edition on sunday , baden wuertemberg 's cdu premier , stephan mappus , who wants to see the final shut down date extended by 15 years , criticized roettgen for not adopting a clearer line in favor of an extension .

not only animals and plants flourish by protecting biodiversity , but business too . papua new guinea is one of the world 's least explored countries - both culturally and geographically - and many undiscovered species of plants and animals are thought to exist in its interior .

not only animals and plants flourish by protecting biodiversity , but business too . papua new guinea is one of the world 's least explored countries - both culturally and geographically - and many undiscovered species of plants and animals are thought to exist in its interior .
its tropical wilderness is home to a stunning range of biodiversity - from the queen alexandra 's birdwing , the largest butterfly in the world , to the flamboyant bird-of-paradise , which graces the flag of papua new guinea .
another rare and endangered species native to the country 's rainforest is the golden-mantled tree kangaroo , while a recent discovery was a frog with a pinocchio-like protuberance on its nose that points up when the male is calling and deflates when quiet .
local and global value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird of paradise is the country 's national emblem papua new guinea contains over 5 percent of the world 's biodiversity within less than 1 percent of its total land area .
for now , the rainforests of papua new guinea are still intact .
but although the overall population density of the country remains low , the population is growing slowly but steadily - progressing , according to un estimates , from 5,711,000 in 2003 to a projected population in the year 2015 of 7,169,000 .
these inhabitants depend on the local biological resources to sustain their livelihoods .
but the result , as recent satellite studies of the region show , is that current rates of deforestation will cause more than half of the papua new guinea 's rainforests to be lost or seriously degraded by 2021 .
taking a toll the increase in human population , coupled with the availability of more efficient farming tools , pose a growing threat to biodiversity .
the local agriculture and logging industry are taking their toll on the environment and threatening the natural habitats of valued birds , animals , fish , insects , plants and trees . un experts estimate that 130 species of plants , animals and insects are lost worldwide every single day .
" this is 100 to 1000 times faster than the evolutionary process of the extinction of species and appearance of new ones , " says andrea cederquist , a greenpeace biodiversity expert .
for now , it is unclear as to how exactly biodiversity in papua new guinea is being affected .
" climate change and the loss of species are closely intertwined , and no one can gauge the full effects , " stresses cederquist .
experts agree that these can not be predicted .
but given that the extinction of one species can have knock-on effects , causing further extinctions , not only papua new guinea 's birds of paradise are at stake , but entire ecosystems .
chains of extinction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were ants to die out , the result would be global disaster after all , most living things on earth support others .
the power of the " little creatures that run the world " was spelt out by harvard biologist edward o.wilson and german behavioral biologist bert hoelldobler in their pulitzer prize-winning 1990 study " the ants . " their book reveals how humans would die without the ants ' soil-tilling drudgery that maintains the existence of plant life .
army ants are known to support 100 known species , from beetles to birds .
were they to die out , entire ecosystems would collapse and the result would be global disaster .
" everyone is aware of all this , " says greenpeace expert cederquist . " but no one acts . "
pricing the earth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in papua new guinea , locals are leraning to farm sustainably what might finally spur action is the dawning awareness of the global economic impact of the loss of biodiversity .
under the aegis of the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -lrb- teeb -rrb- project is an international initiative to draw attention to this issue .
in its latest study published in july , it puts the extent of losses of natural capital taking place as a result of deforestation and degradation at between $ 2 - 4.5 trillion per year , every year .
the full report sets out the economic case for biodiversity and ecosystems , describing how even factors such as insect pollination ultimately have a crucial impact on business and society .
against this backdrop , environmentalists are well aware that however local they might seem , conservation efforts in papua new guinea have repercussions for the entire planet .

the recyclable components are melted down and anything biodegradable gets sent off to be composted .
but the problem is that only a fraction of cast-off electronics in the european union actually see that fate .
european officials take up stronger measures a new report by the european parliament shows about 65 percent of the total amount of e-waste generated in the bloc gets turned in and sorted correctly , but after that things go downhill .
besides existing eu laws requiring collection and treatment , all eu member states have signed the basel convention , which outlaws the export of hazardous waste and requires e-waste to be treated as close to its origin as possible . but through loopholes , by claiming items are donations or functioning second-hand goods for re-sale - or by simply breaking the law - middlemen are making millions and making impoverished nations pay the price .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while currently holding the eu presidency , belgium is leading moves to tighten regulations on e-waste " we 've been clearly negligent because we have n't sent the right resources to fight illegal shipments , " said stephane arditi of the european environmental bureau , a brussels-based ngo .
" and that is something everybody is aware of , probably also ashamed of . "
she added that tightening existing laws will help , but it 's enforcement that 's really needed from the developed world .
mike anane , president of the league of environmental journalists in ghana , told researchers from the danish watchdog organization danwatch that his country is clearly being used as a convenient landfill for europe .
he noted the mountains of discarded computers , monitors and televisions that ghana has no way to recycle .
" some come under the guise of donations but when you examine the items , they do n't work , " anane said .
" it 's just a way to get rid of these computers from europe to africa . "
' of importance to all of us ' one of anane 's colleagues , maren swart is currently in accra , where she is investigating the levels of e-waste shipped to ghana either illegally or through the second-hand item loopholes .
" we have found computers from danish companies before in accra , " she said .
" they had a tag on them showing that they were from a school in denmark . "
the european parliament 's environment committee is now proposing more stringent standards that would require each member state to collect 85 percent of the waste it generates and to prove that the majority of the waste is treated within the country .
the full legislature will vote on the proposed changes in september .
belgium currently holds the eu presidency and has made sustainable materials management , including ethical waste treatment , a priority for the next six months .
joke schauvliege , the flemish environment minister , said the entire lifecycle of products needs to be considered . when possible , she said , the " cradle to cradle principle " should be applied , meaning that waste is used to create new products , rather than mountains of non-functioning monitors .
" this is a societal challenge on a large scale , " she said in dutch .
" these are things of importance to all of us .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while currently holding the eu presidency , belgium is leading moves to tighten regulations on e-waste " we 've been clearly negligent because we have n't sent the right resources to fight illegal shipments , " said stephane arditi of the european environmental bureau , a brussels-based ngo .
" and that is something everybody is aware of , probably also ashamed of . "
she added that tightening existing laws will help , but it 's enforcement that 's really needed from the developed world .
mike anane , president of the league of environmental journalists in ghana , told researchers from the danish watchdog organization danwatch that his country is clearly being used as a convenient landfill for europe .
he noted the mountains of discarded computers , monitors and televisions that ghana has no way to recycle .
" some come under the guise of donations but when you examine the items , they do n't work , " anane said .
" it 's just a way to get rid of these computers from europe to africa . "
' of importance to all of us ' one of anane 's colleagues , maren swart is currently in accra , where she is investigating the levels of e-waste shipped to ghana either illegally or through the second-hand item loopholes .
" we have found computers from danish companies before in accra , " she said .
" they had a tag on them showing that they were from a school in denmark . "
the european parliament 's environment committee is now proposing more stringent standards that would require each member state to collect 85 percent of the waste it generates and to prove that the majority of the waste is treated within the country .
the full legislature will vote on the proposed changes in september .
belgium currently holds the eu presidency and has made sustainable materials management , including ethical waste treatment , a priority for the next six months .
joke schauvliege , the flemish environment minister , said the entire lifecycle of products needs to be considered . when possible , she said , the " cradle to cradle principle " should be applied , meaning that waste is used to create new products , rather than mountains of non-functioning monitors .
" this is a societal challenge on a large scale , " she said in dutch .
" these are things of importance to all of us .
it 's not just governments that need to deal with this , it 's also the business world , citizens and also think tanks , experts .

not only animals and plants flourish by protecting biodiversity , but business too . papua new guinea is one of the world 's least explored countries - both culturally and geographically - and many undiscovered species of plants and animals are thought to exist in its interior .
its tropical wilderness is home to a stunning range of biodiversity - from the queen alexandra 's birdwing , the largest butterfly in the world , to the flamboyant bird-of-paradise , which graces the flag of papua new guinea .
another rare and endangered species native to the country 's rainforest is the golden-mantled tree kangaroo , while a recent discovery was a frog with a pinocchio-like protuberance on its nose that points up when the male is calling and deflates when quiet .
local and global value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird of paradise is the country 's national emblem papua new guinea contains over 5 percent of the world 's biodiversity within less than 1 percent of its total land area .
for now , the rainforests of papua new guinea are still intact .
but although the overall population density of the country remains low , the population is growing slowly but steadily - progressing , according to un estimates , from 5,711,000 in 2003 to a projected population in the year 2015 of 7,169,000 .
these inhabitants depend on the local biological resources to sustain their livelihoods .
but the result , as recent satellite studies of the region show , is that current rates of deforestation will cause more than half of the papua new guinea 's rainforests to be lost or seriously degraded by 2021 .
taking a toll the increase in human population , coupled with the availability of more efficient farming tools , pose a growing threat to biodiversity .
the local agriculture and logging industry are taking their toll on the environment and threatening the natural habitats of valued birds , animals , fish , insects , plants and trees . un experts estimate that 130 species of plants , animals and insects are lost worldwide every single day .
" this is 100 to 1000 times faster than the evolutionary process of the extinction of species and appearance of new ones , " says andrea cederquist , a greenpeace biodiversity expert .
for now , it is unclear as to how exactly biodiversity in papua new guinea is being affected .
" climate change and the loss of species are closely intertwined , and no one can gauge the full effects , " stresses cederquist .
experts agree that these can not be predicted .
but given that the extinction of one species can have knock-on effects , causing further extinctions , not only papua new guinea 's birds of paradise are at stake , but entire ecosystems .
chains of extinction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were ants to die out , the result would be global disaster after all , most living things on earth support others .
the power of the " little creatures that run the world " was spelt out by harvard biologist edward o.wilson and german behavioral biologist bert hoelldobler in their pulitzer prize-winning 1990 study " the ants . " their book reveals how humans would die without the ants ' soil-tilling drudgery that maintains the existence of plant life .
army ants are known to support 100 known species , from beetles to birds .
were they to die out , entire ecosystems would collapse and the result would be global disaster .
" everyone is aware of all this , " says greenpeace expert cederquist . " but no one acts . "
pricing the earth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in papua new guinea , locals are leraning to farm sustainably what might finally spur action is the dawning awareness of the global economic impact of the loss of biodiversity .
under the aegis of the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -lrb- teeb -rrb- project is an international initiative to draw attention to this issue .
in its latest study published in july , it puts the extent of losses of natural capital taking place as a result of deforestation and degradation at between $ 2 - 4.5 trillion per year , every year .
the full report sets out the economic case for biodiversity and ecosystems , describing how even factors such as insect pollination ultimately have a crucial impact on business and society .
against this backdrop , environmentalists are well aware that however local they might seem , conservation efforts in papua new guinea have repercussions for the entire planet .

the death toll now stands at 20 , and more than 500 people are still being treated for their injuries after panic broke out in a tunnel leading to the festival grounds on saturday afternoon .
duisburg mayor adolf sauerland , who defended what he called a " solid " security plan at a news conference on sunday and was pelted with rubbish by angry bystanders , has faced scathing criticism from several media outlets .
he resisted calls for his immediate resignation on monday and told public broadcaster wdr that he would address that issue when the time was right .
" i will be asking myself this question , there 's no doubt about that , " he said , adding that the main issue now was explaining saturday 's tragedy .
" and when we know what happened there , then we will answer this question .
that i promise . "
" if the city is guilty of anything then we will assume responsibility , " he said in a statement .
sauerland said a condolence book would remain available through the end of the month and that the city was working with church officials to plan a memorial service .
' consequences must be drawn urgently ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerland , right , has defended the city 's " solid " security plan on monday , german chancellor angela merkel said she expected a " scrupulously thorough " investigation into the tragedy , according to her spokesman ulrich wilhelm . " a full picture and a proper analysis of what happened and what mistakes were possibly made can however only be done once the investigation is completed , " he added . " consequences must be drawn urgently ...
i think it 's clear the security plans were not good , " said hannelore kraft , the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , in an interview on ard television . earlier monday , german prosecutors seized documents relating to the security planning of the event . rolf haferkamp , spokesman for the duisburg state prosecutors ' office , said he could not speak about the content of the numerous documents that were seized , but said the investigation of possible negligent manslaughter was ongoing . who 's to blame ? one theoretical explanation for the accident that quickly emerged in the press was that duisburg , a city in the former coal-mining ruhr region , was desperate to gain from the prestige of the love parade , and that city officials did not take security concerns seriously . the ruhr 2010 european capital of culture program has taken the lead in attracting such events and the program 's chief organizer , fritz pleitgen , said he felt " jointly responsible , but more in a moral sense . " " -lsb- the love parade -rsb- was offered to us as a project for the capital of culture program , " he told zdf public television .
" we accepted that , but we were not involved in financing or organizing the event . " the cologne-based daily newspaper koelner stadt-anzeiger also reported that the chief of the duisburg fire department told sauerland in writing that the location for the event - the city 's former freight rail station - was too small for the expected number of visitors . and the online edition of the news magazine der spiegel reported that an official document issued by the city of duisburg authorized only 250,000 people for the event - far short of the estimated 1.4 million who attended .
it also reportedly exempted the organizers from the minimal width of escape routes and from having fire brigade provisions .
bildunterschrift : organizers said the love parade would never take place again police unions point finger rainer wendt , head of the national police union , said police warnings about the dangers of holding the festival in duisburg were not heeded .
" i warned them a year ago that duisburg was not a suitable location for the love parade .
it 's too small and too cramped , " said wendt .
" but i was called a killjoy and a security fanatic . "
a report in the koelner stadt-anzeiger said that mayor sauerland gave the go-ahead for the event just hours before the start , despite concerns from police and fire officials .
however , frank richter , head of the state-level north rhine-westphalia police trade union , said there was currently no proof that city officials had ignored security concerns .
in an interview with deutschlandfunk radio , richter placed the blame on the event 's organizers .
" i find it unacceptable that those who are responsible for this event , like the organizer -lsb- rainer schaller -rsb- , said in the press conference that there would just be no more love parades , as if he had nothing to do with this whole thing . "

both religions celebrated their reconciliation at the lutheran world federation assembly . the bloody oppression of the mennonite free church in the 16th century is one of the darkest chapters in european history .
this past week , lutherans issued an official apology for the cruel persecution of the anabaptists - and both parties celebrated their reconciliation in a very moving ceremony . " we still remember being a prosecuted minority , " said larry miller , secretary general of the mennonite world conference . the mennonite free church is the main branch of the descendants of the christian baptist movement .
mennonites are known as anabaptists because they only baptise adults and not underage children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the apology is an important concession for larry miller for church reformer martin luther , mennonites were schismatic heretics who denied children access to the christian community .
luther expressed his rejection of the anabaptists in a letter of denomination which was published in the southern german city of augsburg , and is known as the augsburg confession of 1530 .
even today , lutheran pastors are ordained using parts of this text . bloody religious conflict the baptists , who advocated church reforms even more radical than those proposed by martin luther or ulrich zwingli , were persecuted by both the catholics and the protestants and had to flee for their lives .
nevertheless , thousands were killed today , the free church has more than one million members all over the world , mostly in the united states and canada .
about 60,000 members live in europe .
the mennonites disapprove of ecclesiastic hierarchies and their local churches are rather autonomous . early on , they decided to raise their voice against every act of war and violence and live according to a " total renunciation of force . "
they are regarded as one of the historical peace churches . no longer victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a relatively large number of mennonites lives in the us in the reconciliation ceremony during the 11th lutheran world federation assembly in stuttgart this past week , representatives of the lutheran church explicitly asked " god and our mennonite sisters and brothers for forgiveness for the harm that our ancestors have brought upon the anabaptists . " the plea for forgiveness is the result of a year-long process and is based on work done by the lutheran-mennonite study commission from 2005 to 2008 . for general secretary miller , this apology is a significant concession and an act of liberation .
the anabaptists had regarded themselves as victims for centuries . " now we have to reconsider our identity , " miller said .
indeed , the stories of martyrdom are still present in the mennonite communities and their ancestors ' suffering is passed on from generation to generation . healing can begin " it is a deep wound within the christian world when two churches of the reformation movement are separated despite actually being so close because of their common origin and their history , " mennonite pastor reiner burghard said , expressing his hope that this wound could now begin to heal . author : ulrike mast-kirschning -lrb- gri -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both religions celebrated their reconciliation at the lutheran world federation assembly . the bloody oppression of the mennonite free church in the 16th century is one of the darkest chapters in european history .
this past week , lutherans issued an official apology for the cruel persecution of the anabaptists - and both parties celebrated their reconciliation in a very moving ceremony . " we still remember being a prosecuted minority , " said larry miller , secretary general of the mennonite world conference . the mennonite free church is the main branch of the descendants of the christian baptist movement .
mennonites are known as anabaptists because they only baptise adults and not underage children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the apology is an important concession for larry miller for church reformer martin luther , mennonites were schismatic heretics who denied children access to the christian community .
luther expressed his rejection of the anabaptists in a letter of denomination which was published in the southern german city of augsburg , and is known as the augsburg confession of 1530 .
even today , lutheran pastors are ordained using parts of this text . bloody religious conflict the baptists , who advocated church reforms even more radical than those proposed by martin luther or ulrich zwingli , were persecuted by both the catholics and the protestants and had to flee for their lives .
nevertheless , thousands were killed today , the free church has more than one million members all over the world , mostly in the united states and canada .
about 60,000 members live in europe .
the mennonites disapprove of ecclesiastic hierarchies and their local churches are rather autonomous . early on , they decided to raise their voice against every act of war and violence and live according to a " total renunciation of force . "

" the plea for forgiveness is the result of a year-long process and is based on work done by the lutheran-mennonite study commission from 2005 to 2008 . for general secretary miller , this apology is a significant concession and an act of liberation .

love parade tragedy news of the deaths at the love parade honestly made me sad .
i offer my condolences to chancellor merkel , her fellow germans and everyone else affected by the tragedy . - paul , us unfortunately the blame must lie with organizers , council and police and whoever signed off on an entrance via a huge tunnel .
surely the crowd could have been channelled far more easily via fencing through there than just letting them into the whole width of it - which meant people had nowhere to go .
if the entrance was actually at the other end of the tunnel , this would n't have happened once the venue filled up and the crowd could have been stopped before entering .
such a tragedy at an amazing event meant to celebrate music and peace . - simon , australia clearly the authorities are to blame for this tragedy .
it is they who have the expertise , the total authority and legal responsibility to decide if a festival venue is safe for the public to attend .
this is not within the expertise of commercial festival organizers .
the final decision is with city and police experts .
there is already ample evidence that the authorities were more interested in corralling the crowd into a small area , the usual state control freak mentality , than planning for crowd overflow and emergency exits and entrances .
it is a disgrace that parallels the inexcusable mistakes at duesseldorf airport 's fire where the rigid application of rules instead of common sense prevented the airport fire service from attending the fire and the subsequent loss of life .
no doubt the blame shall be pushed on to others as it was after duesseldorf , a hapless welder , there as i recall .
i speak with some authority as the uk is riddled with the same over-organized incompetence .
i hope heads roll over this disaster , resignations should be called for .
i was personally closer to this tragedy than was comfortable as my german son was at the festival but , upon seeing the potential for disaster given the mass overcrowding , decided to leave as thankfully did his friends .
in closing , i do not wish this to be vindictive of those involved , but hope with respect to all those people who lost their lives that we can learn from this tragedy to prevent its recurrence . - j. north , great britain i 'm a big fan of germany , but if an investigation is not launched into how a festival of 1 million in an open space that was held in berlin was transferred to a backwater that has experience of mostly classical music events and has a population of just 500,000 in a confined space that holds just 500,000 then germany will be deservedly a laughing stock .
germany needs to seriously question the city authorities that licensed this set up .
words fail me .
it 's not what we expect of germany at all .
to me it seems a disaster that was waiting to happen . - fergal barry via facebook it 's the organizers fault .
in 10 days the heavy metal event " wacken " will take place in wacken .
let 's hope they will organize it much better . - markus , via facebook from germany this is good that the investigation has started and i am sure that soon someone will be officially guilty .
but this is only the administration part .
we all need to ask ourselves : who will bring back the people who are dead now ?
i would like to send my appeal to all organizers for such events , please take this case in seriously and do not let it happen again . - mesar via facebook i think it 's the fault of the organizers and the people as well .
they should n't have used a tunnel for letting thousands of people through it , and people do not know when to stop pushing when they are moving forward in large groups .
people get trapped in a closed space , start panicking , and thus , the result .
wacken is much better organized because it 's at an open space , if something happens people can simply jump over the fences , and they 're off .

if the entrance was actually at the other end of the tunnel , this would n't have happened once the venue filled up and the crowd could have been stopped before entering .
such a tragedy at an amazing event meant to celebrate music and peace . - simon , australia clearly the authorities are to blame for this tragedy .
it is they who have the expertise , the total authority and legal responsibility to decide if a festival venue is safe for the public to attend .
this is not within the expertise of commercial festival organizers .
the final decision is with city and police experts .
there is already ample evidence that the authorities were more interested in corralling the crowd into a small area , the usual state control freak mentality , than planning for crowd overflow and emergency exits and entrances .
it is a disgrace that parallels the inexcusable mistakes at duesseldorf airport 's fire where the rigid application of rules instead of common sense prevented the airport fire service from attending the fire and the subsequent loss of life .
no doubt the blame shall be pushed on to others as it was after duesseldorf , a hapless welder , there as i recall .
i speak with some authority as the uk is riddled with the same over-organized incompetence .
i hope heads roll over this disaster , resignations should be called for .
i was personally closer to this tragedy than was comfortable as my german son was at the festival but , upon seeing the potential for disaster given the mass overcrowding , decided to leave as thankfully did his friends .
in closing , i do not wish this to be vindictive of those involved , but hope with respect to all those people who lost their lives that we can learn from this tragedy to prevent its recurrence . - j. north , great britain i 'm a big fan of germany , but if an investigation is not launched into how a festival of 1 million in an open space that was held in berlin was transferred to a backwater that has experience of mostly classical music events and has a population of just 500,000 in a confined space that holds just 500,000 then germany will be deservedly a laughing stock .
germany needs to seriously question the city authorities that licensed this set up .
words fail me .
it 's not what we expect of germany at all .
to me it seems a disaster that was waiting to happen . - fergal barry via facebook it 's the organizers fault .
in 10 days the heavy metal event " wacken " will take place in wacken .
let 's hope they will organize it much better . - markus , via facebook from germany this is good that the investigation has started and i am sure that soon someone will be officially guilty .
but this is only the administration part .
we all need to ask ourselves : who will bring back the people who are dead now ?
i would like to send my appeal to all organizers for such events , please take this case in seriously and do not let it happen again . - mesar via facebook i think it 's the fault of the organizers and the people as well .
they should n't have used a tunnel for letting thousands of people through it , and people do not know when to stop pushing when they are moving forward in large groups .
people get trapped in a closed space , start panicking , and thus , the result .
wacken is much better organized because it 's at an open space , if something happens people can simply jump over the fences , and they 're off .
unlike a tunnel where they are trapped . - lena , the netherlands compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but there are still security concerns and plans to investigate . the german defense ministry on monday criticized the leak of around 92,000 classified us military documents on the afghanistan war , but said the news value was rather limited .
the german news magazine spiegel as well as the new york times and the guardian newspapers at the weekend printed excerpts of the documents , which were released by the wikileaks website .
" obtaining and releasing documents , some of them secret , on such a scale is a highly questionable practice since it could affect the national security of nato allies and the whole nato mission , " defense ministry spokesman christian dienst said . " we 're in the process of analyzing the material so as to find out whether the security of our german troops on the ground is affected in any way . "
german foreign minister guido westerwelle also called for further scrutiny of the documents .
at an eu foreign ministers ’ meeting in brussels , westerwelle said the documents , which contain claims of concealed civilian casualties , had given him " comfort in my position , which consisted of never talking up the situation in afghanistan , which is exceptionally serious . "
attacks on the rise dienst confirmed that reports about a drastic increase of taliban attacks on allied troops were true .
he said that in the course of this year alone there had been close to 60 armed attacks on the german isaf contingent alone – almost triple the the figures available for 2007 and the years before .

the joint leader of germany 's opposition green party , claudia roth , told the media on monday she did n't sense an often-cited new strategy of the allied forces in afghanistan at all .
killing a priority ?
" the wikileaks documents bear out just how dramatic the situation in afghanistan is , " roth said .
" but they also show the range of means the allies resort to in their fight for more stability . "
roth referred to classified documents highlighting the us special forces ' capture-and-kill operations , including manhunts where the killing of innocent people is seen as mere collateral damage .
according to the documents , 300 soldiers from the elite us 373 task force are located in the german camp at masar-i-sharif in the north of afghanistan .
their major task is the killing of high-ranking taliban leaders .
the sources available to wikileaks do not specify whether any german officers are involved in the planning or implementing of such targeted killings .
and the defense ministry in berlin was unwilling to shed any light on this issue .
" as far as the us task force is concerned , it 's in the nature of things that their operations remain secret , " christian dienst said .
" this means that only a very small circle of people is in the know about any details of these operations . "
everything said before ?
wikileaks knows that much of the information provided is not totally new .
but it claims it has got hold of the most comprehensive description of an armed conflict ever .

so far , people have sent about 1.2 million such documents to the web platform .
among wikileaks ' best-known scoops was the posting of a video depicting a us helicopter strike in baghdad in 2007 .
the footage showed how about a dozen civilians were gunned down , among them two employees from the reuters news agency .

tehran has condemned the measures but at the same time signalled it was willing to resume negotiations over its nuclear program . european union foreign ministers meeting in brussels monday have approved new sanctions on iran over its nuclear program .
in a surprise move , tehran shortly afterwards said it was prepared to return to negotiations without conditions , according to the country 's official news agency . at the heart of the sanctions is the concern that iran 's controversial uranium enrichment programme is not - as tehran claims - for civilian purpose , but rather intended to develop nuclear weapons . " today we sent quite a powerful message to iran that their nuclear programme is a cause for serious and growing concern to us , " the eu 's foreign policy chief , catherine ashton said . an obligation for transparency the new restrictions are likely to hit the backbone of iran 's economy - foreign trade , financial services and the oil and gas sector .
officials have described the measures as the toughest sanctions the european union has ever adopted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle said iran needs to comply with international calls for more transparency the measures are intended to block oil and gas investment and undermine tehran 's refining and natural gas capabilities .
they also ban the export to iran of dual-use goods that can be used both for civilian and military purposes . the sanctions will also further limit the activities of iranian trading banks and insurers , including restrictions on money transfers to iran . " of course iran has the right to use nuclear technology for civilian purposes , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle said . " but that also means that of course there is an obligation for transparency .
a nuclear armed iran is something that we can not accept . " iran prepared to resume talks iran has denounced the new sanctions as confrontational and said they would only further damage the already difficult relations with brussels . but tehran has at the same time signalled willingness to return to negotiations .
the country 's envoy to the iaea in vienna on monday suggested talks should be resumed . the eu 's catherine ashton welcomed the announcement but said she wanted to see the details first . " as far as i can see this is to be welcomed ... but we need to study the details , " she told reporters at a news briefing . the last high-level talks between iran and the six world powers – germany , britain , china , france , russia and the us – were held in geneva in october 2009 .

tehran has condemned the measures but at the same time signalled it was willing to resume negotiations over its nuclear program . european union foreign ministers meeting in brussels monday have approved new sanctions on iran over its nuclear program .
in a surprise move , tehran shortly afterwards said it was prepared to return to negotiations without conditions , according to the country 's official news agency . at the heart of the sanctions is the concern that iran 's controversial uranium enrichment programme is not - as tehran claims - for civilian purpose , but rather intended to develop nuclear weapons . " today we sent quite a powerful message to iran that their nuclear programme is a cause for serious and growing concern to us , " the eu 's foreign policy chief , catherine ashton said . an obligation for transparency the new restrictions are likely to hit the backbone of iran 's economy - foreign trade , financial services and the oil and gas sector .

critics say the tour is not clean , and are pointing the finger at world cycling 's testing procedure . a second successive tour de france has ended without news of a single rider testing positive for a banned substance .
the organizers are happy , with tour chief christian prudhomme calling it the " greatest tour he has experienced . "
but fans and critics remain to be convinced that the tour is suddenly totally clean .
" the tests that are currently being done are a joke , they are very poor , " german anti-doping expert werner franke told deutsche welle .
" no doubt about it , it -lrb- doping -rrb- all continues , but is no longer discovered .
it 's the money that counts ; it 's the image that counts – and nobody will say anything against that , " said the biologist from the german cancer research center .
the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- was again responsible for doping tests during this year ’ s tour , with officials from the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- acting as independent observers .
french anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- chief pierre bordry has criticized the way tests are run .
" they are organized in such a way that the riders know about them beforehand , " he said .
the afld shadowed uci ’ s testing processes in 2009 , and accused world cycling 's governing body of showing favoritism towards the leading riders , like winner alberto contador .
bordry 's organization made a request to carry out its own drug tests on this year 's tour , which was turned down by wada .
the international agency said that french law did not totally conform with the global anti-doping code , meaning any positive results gained would lead to a legislative stalemate .
' unprecedented ' testing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl was the last top-level rider to be banned for doping the afld led the testing on the 2008 tour , when seven riders were caught using cera , a new variant of the banned red-blood-cell booster erythropoietin .
no rider has tested positive for a banned substance since the uci took over testing last year .
speeds and levels of performance in sprints , time trials and mountain stages have not dropped over this time period though .
uci president pat mcquaid promised an unprecedented level of testing during the 2010 tour , with at least 600 doping tests being carried out .
" we also have a list of 55 riders , like the favorites , who will have extra tests , " mcquaid said before the tour .
the uci has sought to tighten up the testing procedure , employing chaperons to watch over riders from the finish line until after they have provided urine or blood samples .
cycling ’ s governing body also began a biological passport scheme in 2008 , where certain blood markers were monitored in every rider .
long-term variations would signal doping .
a spokesman for the uci refused to comment on criticism of its testing procedures .
wada also declined to comment until after the release of a report by its independent observers in the coming weeks .
seven-time tour de france winner lance armstrong bowed out of the sport this week , with doping allegations still following him .
disgraced 2006 tour winner floyd landis has said that he saw his former teammate take drugs on numerous occasions .
landis ' claims have led to a u.s. federal investigation into the use of government money for doping by armstrong and his former u.s. postal team .
allegations lingering austrian rider bernhard kohl was one of those suspended for using cera in 2008 .
he was crowned king of the mountains and finished third overall , before testing positive and later confessing to doping .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong 's record as the best ever tour de france cyclist has been tainted by allegations " you have to dope to make it a level playing-field , " kohl told deutsche welle .
" the tour de france is 3,500 kilometers , it is very hard . "
the 28-year-old said that calling the last two tours " completely clean " was " an illusion " .
initially given a two-year suspension , his ban was later extended until 2014 .
kohl announced his retirement in 2009 .
to help combat the use of drugs in the sport in the future , bernhard kohl also points to the role of cycling 's governing bodies .
" it is the same people , at the top of cycling , who must do their part .
but i believe it will be difficult to put an end to it . "

french anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- chief pierre bordry has criticized the way tests are run .

the afld shadowed uci ’ s testing processes in 2009 , and accused world cycling 's governing body of showing favoritism towards the leading riders , like winner alberto contador .
bordry 's organization made a request to carry out its own drug tests on this year 's tour , which was turned down by wada .

the uci has sought to tighten up the testing procedure , employing chaperons to watch over riders from the finish line until after they have provided urine or blood samples .
cycling ’ s governing body also began a biological passport scheme in 2008 , where certain blood markers were monitored in every rider .

critics say the tour is not clean , and are pointing the finger at world cycling 's testing procedure . a second successive tour de france has ended without news of a single rider testing positive for a banned substance .
the organizers are happy , with tour chief christian prudhomme calling it the " greatest tour he has experienced . "
but fans and critics remain to be convinced that the tour is suddenly totally clean .
" the tests that are currently being done are a joke , they are very poor , " german anti-doping expert werner franke told deutsche welle .
" no doubt about it , it -lrb- doping -rrb- all continues , but is no longer discovered .
it 's the money that counts ; it 's the image that counts – and nobody will say anything against that , " said the biologist from the german cancer research center .
the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- was again responsible for doping tests during this year ’ s tour , with officials from the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- acting as independent observers .
french anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- chief pierre bordry has criticized the way tests are run .
" they are organized in such a way that the riders know about them beforehand , " he said .
the afld shadowed uci ’ s testing processes in 2009 , and accused world cycling 's governing body of showing favoritism towards the leading riders , like winner alberto contador .
bordry 's organization made a request to carry out its own drug tests on this year 's tour , which was turned down by wada .
the international agency said that french law did not totally conform with the global anti-doping code , meaning any positive results gained would lead to a legislative stalemate .
' unprecedented ' testing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl was the last top-level rider to be banned for doping the afld led the testing on the 2008 tour , when seven riders were caught using cera , a new variant of the banned red-blood-cell booster erythropoietin .
no rider has tested positive for a banned substance since the uci took over testing last year .
speeds and levels of performance in sprints , time trials and mountain stages have not dropped over this time period though .
uci president pat mcquaid promised an unprecedented level of testing during the 2010 tour , with at least 600 doping tests being carried out .
" we also have a list of 55 riders , like the favorites , who will have extra tests , " mcquaid said before the tour .
the uci has sought to tighten up the testing procedure , employing chaperons to watch over riders from the finish line until after they have provided urine or blood samples .
cycling ’ s governing body also began a biological passport scheme in 2008 , where certain blood markers were monitored in every rider .
long-term variations would signal doping .
a spokesman for the uci refused to comment on criticism of its testing procedures .
wada also declined to comment until after the release of a report by its independent observers in the coming weeks .
seven-time tour de france winner lance armstrong bowed out of the sport this week , with doping allegations still following him .
disgraced 2006 tour winner floyd landis has said that he saw his former teammate take drugs on numerous occasions .
landis ' claims have led to a u.s. federal investigation into the use of government money for doping by armstrong and his former u.s. postal team .
allegations lingering austrian rider bernhard kohl was one of those suspended for using cera in 2008 .
he was crowned king of the mountains and finished third overall , before testing positive and later confessing to doping .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong 's record as the best ever tour de france cyclist has been tainted by allegations " you have to dope to make it a level playing-field , " kohl told deutsche welle .
" the tour de france is 3,500 kilometers , it is very hard . "
the 28-year-old said that calling the last two tours " completely clean " was " an illusion " .
initially given a two-year suspension , his ban was later extended until 2014 .
kohl announced his retirement in 2009 .
to help combat the use of drugs in the sport in the future , bernhard kohl also points to the role of cycling 's governing bodies .
" it is the same people , at the top of cycling , who must do their part .
but i believe it will be difficult to put an end to it . "

now the entrepreneur has become the obejct of public scrutiny . after a mass panic killed 19 people at the love parade techno music festival in duisburg on saturday , one of germany 's less conventional entrepreneurs has found himself in the public spotlight .
rainer schaller , who took over love parade in 2006 , owns a successful chain of fitness studios .
mcfit , as schaller 's chain is called , boasts prices as low as 16,90 euros per month .
it has 118 throughout germany , some 900,000 members , and a turnover of 134 million euros .
love parade was intended to serve as a marketing tool for the company , which plans to expand across europe .
41-year-old schaller 's success can in part be explained by his willingness to take risks .
according to the handelsblatt daily newspaper , schaller 's first fitness studio was an illegal operation which he kept amongst friends and operated in an attic above his parents ' supermarket outside of nuremberg .

he advertised the new mcfit studio as being " now also in wurzburg , " giving the impression that it was part of a large , successful chain .
unlike most fitness chains in germany , mcfit 's strategy is to offer a barebones gym with limited classes and training staff and no extra amenities such as saunas .
customers have around-the-clock access to the machines , but showers cost 50 cents extra .
the concept proved popular , and schaller opened his second studio in 1998 .
in 2008 , the chain recruited ukrainian celebrity boxers vladimir und vitali klitschko to represent it , and in 2009 it opened its first studios in austria and spain .
in 2009 , he told the handelsblatt newspaper that mcfit 's interest in love parade was to " use a relatively small budget to gain a high recognition factor .
we spent a lot of time thinking about what kind of crazy thing we could do to make ourselves more well-known .
we chose love parade . "

the love parade is no more .
words are not enough to describe the extent of the shock i feel , " he said .
love parade was founded in 1989 by berlin dj matthias roeingh , also known as dr motte .
in some years it drew more than a million visitors , but planning and financing issues caused it to be cancelled in 2004 and 2005 .
the event was revived and relocated to the ruhr region in 2006 by lopavent , a schaller-owned company .
mcfit has sponsored it with 3 million euros per year ever since .

now the entrepreneur has become the obejct of public scrutiny . after a mass panic killed 19 people at the love parade techno music festival in duisburg on saturday , one of germany 's less conventional entrepreneurs has found himself in the public spotlight .
rainer schaller , who took over love parade in 2006 , owns a successful chain of fitness studios .
mcfit , as schaller 's chain is called , boasts prices as low as 16,90 euros per month .
it has 118 throughout germany , some 900,000 members , and a turnover of 134 million euros .
love parade was intended to serve as a marketing tool for the company , which plans to expand across europe .
41-year-old schaller 's success can in part be explained by his willingness to take risks .
according to the handelsblatt daily newspaper , schaller 's first fitness studio was an illegal operation which he kept amongst friends and operated in an attic above his parents ' supermarket outside of nuremberg .
he comes from a family of grocers who taught him the " mathematics and accounting " of running a business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 500 people were injured during the love parade mass panic self-made entrepreneur when schaller opened the first mcfit in wurzburg in 1997 , he did every job in the new business himself , from cleaning to training and administration tasks .
he advertised the new mcfit studio as being " now also in wurzburg , " giving the impression that it was part of a large , successful chain .
unlike most fitness chains in germany , mcfit 's strategy is to offer a barebones gym with limited classes and training staff and no extra amenities such as saunas .
customers have around-the-clock access to the machines , but showers cost 50 cents extra .
the concept proved popular , and schaller opened his second studio in 1998 .
in 2008 , the chain recruited ukrainian celebrity boxers vladimir und vitali klitschko to represent it , and in 2009 it opened its first studios in austria and spain .
in 2009 , he told the handelsblatt newspaper that mcfit 's interest in love parade was to " use a relatively small budget to gain a high recognition factor .
we spent a lot of time thinking about what kind of crazy thing we could do to make ourselves more well-known .
we chose love parade . "
condolences expressed schaller expressed his condolences at a press conference sunday , reading from a text and visibly upset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcfit was the main sponsor of the ill-fated love parade " the love parade was always a peaceful and joyous party that will now forever be overshadowed by yesterday 's tragic events .
out of respect for the victims , families and friends , we will discontinue the event .
the love parade is no more .
words are not enough to describe the extent of the shock i feel , " he said .
love parade was founded in 1989 by berlin dj matthias roeingh , also known as dr motte .
in some years it drew more than a million visitors , but planning and financing issues caused it to be cancelled in 2004 and 2005 .
the event was revived and relocated to the ruhr region in 2006 by lopavent , a schaller-owned company .
mcfit has sponsored it with 3 million euros per year ever since .

tehran has condemned the measures but at the same time signalled it was willing to resume negotiations over its nuclear program . european union foreign ministers meeting in brussels monday have approved new sanctions on iran over its nuclear program .
in a surprise move , tehran shortly afterwards said it was prepared to return to negotiations without conditions , according to the country 's official news agency . at the heart of the sanctions is the concern that iran 's controversial uranium enrichment programme is not - as tehran claims - for civilian purpose , but rather intended to develop nuclear weapons . " today we sent quite a powerful message to iran that their nuclear programme is a cause for serious and growing concern to us , " the eu 's foreign policy chief , catherine ashton said . an obligation for transparency the new restrictions are likely to hit the backbone of iran 's economy - foreign trade , financial services and the oil and gas sector .
officials have described the measures as the toughest sanctions the european union has ever adopted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle said iran needs to comply with international calls for more transparency the measures are intended to block oil and gas investment and undermine tehran 's refining and natural gas capabilities .
they also ban the export to iran of dual-use goods that can be used both for civilian and military purposes . the sanctions will also further limit the activities of iranian trading banks and insurers , including restrictions on money transfers to iran . " of course iran has the right to use nuclear technology for civilian purposes , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle said . " but that also means that of course there is an obligation for transparency .
a nuclear armed iran is something that we can not accept . " iran prepared to resume talks iran has denounced the new sanctions as confrontational and said they would only further damage the already difficult relations with brussels . but tehran has at the same time signalled willingness to return to negotiations .
the country 's envoy to the iaea in vienna on monday suggested talks should be resumed . the eu 's catherine ashton welcomed the announcement but said she wanted to see the details first . " as far as i can see this is to be welcomed ... but we need to study the details , " she told reporters at a news briefing . the last high-level talks between iran and the six world powers – germany , britain , china , france , russia and the us – were held in geneva in october 2009 .

tehran has condemned the measures but at the same time signalled it was willing to resume negotiations over its nuclear program . european union foreign ministers meeting in brussels monday have approved new sanctions on iran over its nuclear program .
in a surprise move , tehran shortly afterwards said it was prepared to return to negotiations without conditions , according to the country 's official news agency . at the heart of the sanctions is the concern that iran 's controversial uranium enrichment programme is not - as tehran claims - for civilian purpose , but rather intended to develop nuclear weapons . " today we sent quite a powerful message to iran that their nuclear programme is a cause for serious and growing concern to us , " the eu 's foreign policy chief , catherine ashton said . an obligation for transparency the new restrictions are likely to hit the backbone of iran 's economy - foreign trade , financial services and the oil and gas sector .
officials have described the measures as the toughest sanctions the european union has ever adopted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle said iran needs to comply with international calls for more transparency the measures are intended to block oil and gas investment and undermine tehran 's refining and natural gas capabilities .
they also ban the export to iran of dual-use goods that can be used both for civilian and military purposes . the sanctions will also further limit the activities of iranian trading banks and insurers , including restrictions on money transfers to iran . " of course iran has the right to use nuclear technology for civilian purposes , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle said . " but that also means that of course there is an obligation for transparency .
a nuclear armed iran is something that we can not accept . " iran prepared to resume talks iran has denounced the new sanctions as confrontational and said they would only further damage the already difficult relations with brussels . but tehran has at the same time signalled willingness to return to negotiations .
the country 's envoy to the iaea in vienna on monday suggested talks should be resumed . the eu 's catherine ashton welcomed the announcement but said she wanted to see the details first . " as far as i can see this is to be welcomed ... but we need to study the details , " she told reporters at a news briefing . the last high-level talks between iran and the six world powers – germany , britain , china , france , russia and the us – were held in geneva in october 2009 .

two days on , many questions are left unanswered . german prosecutors are continuing to look into allegations about lax safety measures at saturday 's love parade in duisburg , where 19 people died and hundreds of others were injured in a crush near a tunnel leading to the festival grounds .
survivors are demanding explanations for why security plans , described by duisburg mayor adolf sauerland as “ solid ” , went wrong .

but in its online edition , the german magazine spiegel cites an internal document saying that the festival had authorization only for 250,000 visitors .
another newspaper , the koelner stadt-anzeiger , reports that the mayor had ignored written warnings in october 2009 saying the grounds were too narrow for the expected crowds .
the head of germany 's police union , rainer wendt , told the mass circulation newspaper bild that he warned authorities a year ago of duisburg 's unsuitability as a venue for the love parade , as the city was too small and narrow .

however , as the last three love parades , in berlin , essen and dortmund , have all had more than a million visitors , some argue that there was no reason to expect fewer this year .
who or whatever was to blame for the catastrophe , however , one thing seems certain : the love parade , which began in 1989 in berlin , has taken place for the last time .
organizer rainer schaller told a news conference in duisburg on sunday that the event would be discontinued out of respect for the victims , their families and friends .

two days on , many questions are left unanswered . german prosecutors are continuing to look into allegations about lax safety measures at saturday 's love parade in duisburg , where 19 people died and hundreds of others were injured in a crush near a tunnel leading to the festival grounds .
survivors are demanding explanations for why security plans , described by duisburg mayor adolf sauerland as “ solid ” , went wrong .
only 250,000 visitors authorized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors are asking why organizers said just hours before the event started that 1.4 million revelers were expected .
but in its online edition , the german magazine spiegel cites an internal document saying that the festival had authorization only for 250,000 visitors .
another newspaper , the koelner stadt-anzeiger , reports that the mayor had ignored written warnings in october 2009 saying the grounds were too narrow for the expected crowds .
the head of germany 's police union , rainer wendt , told the mass circulation newspaper bild that he warned authorities a year ago of duisburg 's unsuitability as a venue for the love parade , as the city was too small and narrow .

police have so far only confirmed that 105,000 visitors arrived by train .
an official in charge of emergency response , wolfgang rabe , said the site , the former cargo train station , had a capacity of up to 300,000 people and that it was never full at any time during the event .
however , as the last three love parades , in berlin , essen and dortmund , have all had more than a million visitors , some argue that there was no reason to expect fewer this year .
who or whatever was to blame for the catastrophe , however , one thing seems certain : the love parade , which began in 1989 in berlin , has taken place for the last time .

' consequences must be drawn urgently ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerland , right , has defended the city 's " solid " security plan on monday , german chancellor angela merkel said she expected a " scrupulously thorough " investigation into the tragedy , according to her spokesman ulrich wilhelm . " a full picture and a proper analysis of what happened and what mistakes were possibly made can however only be done once the investigation is completed , " he added . " consequences must be drawn urgently ...
i think it 's clear the security plans were not good , " said hannelore kraft , the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , in an interview on ard television . earlier monday , german prosecutors seized documents relating to the security planning of the event . rolf haferkamp , spokesman for the duisburg state prosecutors ' office , said he could not speak about the content of the numerous documents that were seized , but said the investigation of possible negligent manslaughter was ongoing . who 's to blame ? one theoretical explanation for the accident that quickly emerged in the press was that duisburg , a city in the former coal-mining ruhr region , was desperate to gain from the prestige of the love parade , and that city officials did not take security concerns seriously . the ruhr 2010 european capital of culture program has taken the lead in attracting such events and the program 's chief organizer , fritz pleitgen , said he felt " jointly responsible , but more in a moral sense . " " -lsb- the love parade -rsb- was offered to us as a project for the capital of culture program , " he told zdf public television .
" we accepted that , but we were not involved in financing or organizing the event . " the cologne-based daily newspaper koelner stadt-anzeiger also reported that the chief of the duisburg fire department told sauerland in writing that the location for the event - the city 's former freight rail station - was too small for the expected number of visitors . and the online edition of the news magazine der spiegel reported that an official document issued by the city of duisburg authorized only 250,000 people for the event - far short of the estimated 1.4 million who attended .
it also reportedly exempted the organizers from the minimal width of escape routes and from having fire brigade provisions .
bildunterschrift : organizers said the love parade would never take place again police unions point finger rainer wendt , head of the national police union , said police warnings about the dangers of holding the festival in duisburg were not heeded .
" i warned them a year ago that duisburg was not a suitable location for the love parade .
it 's too small and too cramped , " said wendt .
" but i was called a killjoy and a security fanatic . "
a report in the koelner stadt-anzeiger said that mayor sauerland gave the go-ahead for the event just hours before the start , despite concerns from police and fire officials .
however , frank richter , head of the state-level north rhine-westphalia police trade union , said there was currently no proof that city officials had ignored security concerns .
in an interview with deutschlandfunk radio , richter placed the blame on the event 's organizers .
" i find it unacceptable that those who are responsible for this event , like the organizer -lsb- rainer schaller -rsb- , said in the press conference that there would just be no more love parades , as if he had nothing to do with this whole thing . "

now the entrepreneur has become the obejct of public scrutiny . after a mass panic killed 19 people at the love parade techno music festival in duisburg on saturday , one of germany 's less conventional entrepreneurs has found himself in the public spotlight .
rainer schaller , who took over love parade in 2006 , owns a successful chain of fitness studios .
mcfit , as schaller 's chain is called , boasts prices as low as 16,90 euros per month .
it has 118 throughout germany , some 900,000 members , and a turnover of 134 million euros .
love parade was intended to serve as a marketing tool for the company , which plans to expand across europe .
41-year-old schaller 's success can in part be explained by his willingness to take risks .
according to the handelsblatt daily newspaper , schaller 's first fitness studio was an illegal operation which he kept amongst friends and operated in an attic above his parents ' supermarket outside of nuremberg .
he comes from a family of grocers who taught him the " mathematics and accounting " of running a business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 500 people were injured during the love parade mass panic self-made entrepreneur when schaller opened the first mcfit in wurzburg in 1997 , he did every job in the new business himself , from cleaning to training and administration tasks .
he advertised the new mcfit studio as being " now also in wurzburg , " giving the impression that it was part of a large , successful chain .
unlike most fitness chains in germany , mcfit 's strategy is to offer a barebones gym with limited classes and training staff and no extra amenities such as saunas .
customers have around-the-clock access to the machines , but showers cost 50 cents extra .
the concept proved popular , and schaller opened his second studio in 1998 .
in 2008 , the chain recruited ukrainian celebrity boxers vladimir und vitali klitschko to represent it , and in 2009 it opened its first studios in austria and spain .
in 2009 , he told the handelsblatt newspaper that mcfit 's interest in love parade was to " use a relatively small budget to gain a high recognition factor .
we spent a lot of time thinking about what kind of crazy thing we could do to make ourselves more well-known .
we chose love parade . "
condolences expressed schaller expressed his condolences at a press conference sunday , reading from a text and visibly upset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcfit was the main sponsor of the ill-fated love parade " the love parade was always a peaceful and joyous party that will now forever be overshadowed by yesterday 's tragic events .
out of respect for the victims , families and friends , we will discontinue the event .
the love parade is no more .
words are not enough to describe the extent of the shock i feel , " he said .
love parade was founded in 1989 by berlin dj matthias roeingh , also known as dr motte .
in some years it drew more than a million visitors , but planning and financing issues caused it to be cancelled in 2004 and 2005 .
the event was revived and relocated to the ruhr region in 2006 by lopavent , a schaller-owned company .
mcfit has sponsored it with 3 million euros per year ever since .

love parade tragedy news of the deaths at the love parade honestly made me sad .
i offer my condolences to chancellor merkel , her fellow germans and everyone else affected by the tragedy . - paul , us unfortunately the blame must lie with organizers , council and police and whoever signed off on an entrance via a huge tunnel .
surely the crowd could have been channelled far more easily via fencing through there than just letting them into the whole width of it - which meant people had nowhere to go .
if the entrance was actually at the other end of the tunnel , this would n't have happened once the venue filled up and the crowd could have been stopped before entering .
such a tragedy at an amazing event meant to celebrate music and peace . - simon , australia clearly the authorities are to blame for this tragedy .
it is they who have the expertise , the total authority and legal responsibility to decide if a festival venue is safe for the public to attend .
this is not within the expertise of commercial festival organizers .
the final decision is with city and police experts .
there is already ample evidence that the authorities were more interested in corralling the crowd into a small area , the usual state control freak mentality , than planning for crowd overflow and emergency exits and entrances .
it is a disgrace that parallels the inexcusable mistakes at duesseldorf airport 's fire where the rigid application of rules instead of common sense prevented the airport fire service from attending the fire and the subsequent loss of life .
no doubt the blame shall be pushed on to others as it was after duesseldorf , a hapless welder , there as i recall .
i speak with some authority as the uk is riddled with the same over-organized incompetence .
i hope heads roll over this disaster , resignations should be called for .
i was personally closer to this tragedy than was comfortable as my german son was at the festival but , upon seeing the potential for disaster given the mass overcrowding , decided to leave as thankfully did his friends .
in closing , i do not wish this to be vindictive of those involved , but hope with respect to all those people who lost their lives that we can learn from this tragedy to prevent its recurrence . - j. north , great britain i 'm a big fan of germany , but if an investigation is not launched into how a festival of 1 million in an open space that was held in berlin was transferred to a backwater that has experience of mostly classical music events and has a population of just 500,000 in a confined space that holds just 500,000 then germany will be deservedly a laughing stock .
germany needs to seriously question the city authorities that licensed this set up .
words fail me .
it 's not what we expect of germany at all .
to me it seems a disaster that was waiting to happen . - fergal barry via facebook it 's the organizers fault .
in 10 days the heavy metal event " wacken " will take place in wacken .
let 's hope they will organize it much better . - markus , via facebook from germany this is good that the investigation has started and i am sure that soon someone will be officially guilty .
but this is only the administration part .
we all need to ask ourselves : who will bring back the people who are dead now ?
i would like to send my appeal to all organizers for such events , please take this case in seriously and do not let it happen again . - mesar via facebook i think it 's the fault of the organizers and the people as well .
they should n't have used a tunnel for letting thousands of people through it , and people do not know when to stop pushing when they are moving forward in large groups .
people get trapped in a closed space , start panicking , and thus , the result .
wacken is much better organized because it 's at an open space , if something happens people can simply jump over the fences , and they 're off .

but there are still security concerns and plans to investigate . the german defense ministry on monday criticized the leak of around 92,000 classified us military documents on the afghanistan war , but said the news value was rather limited .
the german news magazine spiegel as well as the new york times and the guardian newspapers at the weekend printed excerpts of the documents , which were released by the wikileaks website .
" obtaining and releasing documents , some of them secret , on such a scale is a highly questionable practice since it could affect the national security of nato allies and the whole nato mission , " defense ministry spokesman christian dienst said . " we 're in the process of analyzing the material so as to find out whether the security of our german troops on the ground is affected in any way . "
german foreign minister guido westerwelle also called for further scrutiny of the documents .
at an eu foreign ministers ’ meeting in brussels , westerwelle said the documents , which contain claims of concealed civilian casualties , had given him " comfort in my position , which consisted of never talking up the situation in afghanistan , which is exceptionally serious . "
attacks on the rise dienst confirmed that reports about a drastic increase of taliban attacks on allied troops were true .
he said that in the course of this year alone there had been close to 60 armed attacks on the german isaf contingent alone – almost triple the the figures available for 2007 and the years before .

the joint leader of germany 's opposition green party , claudia roth , told the media on monday she did n't sense an often-cited new strategy of the allied forces in afghanistan at all .
killing a priority ?
" the wikileaks documents bear out just how dramatic the situation in afghanistan is , " roth said .
" but they also show the range of means the allies resort to in their fight for more stability . "
roth referred to classified documents highlighting the us special forces ' capture-and-kill operations , including manhunts where the killing of innocent people is seen as mere collateral damage .
according to the documents , 300 soldiers from the elite us 373 task force are located in the german camp at masar-i-sharif in the north of afghanistan .
their major task is the killing of high-ranking taliban leaders .
the sources available to wikileaks do not specify whether any german officers are involved in the planning or implementing of such targeted killings .
and the defense ministry in berlin was unwilling to shed any light on this issue .
" as far as the us task force is concerned , it 's in the nature of things that their operations remain secret , " christian dienst said .
" this means that only a very small circle of people is in the know about any details of these operations . "

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
love parade tragedy news of the deaths at the love parade honestly made me sad .
i offer my condolences to chancellor merkel , her fellow germans and everyone else affected by the tragedy . - paul , us unfortunately the blame must lie with organizers , council and police and whoever signed off on an entrance via a huge tunnel .
surely the crowd could have been channelled far more easily via fencing through there than just letting them into the whole width of it - which meant people had nowhere to go .
if the entrance was actually at the other end of the tunnel , this would n't have happened once the venue filled up and the crowd could have been stopped before entering .
such a tragedy at an amazing event meant to celebrate music and peace . - simon , australia clearly the authorities are to blame for this tragedy .
it is they who have the expertise , the total authority and legal responsibility to decide if a festival venue is safe for the public to attend .
this is not within the expertise of commercial festival organizers .
the final decision is with city and police experts .
there is already ample evidence that the authorities were more interested in corralling the crowd into a small area , the usual state control freak mentality , than planning for crowd overflow and emergency exits and entrances .
it is a disgrace that parallels the inexcusable mistakes at duesseldorf airport 's fire where the rigid application of rules instead of common sense prevented the airport fire service from attending the fire and the subsequent loss of life .
no doubt the blame shall be pushed on to others as it was after duesseldorf , a hapless welder , there as i recall .
i speak with some authority as the uk is riddled with the same over-organized incompetence .
i hope heads roll over this disaster , resignations should be called for .
i was personally closer to this tragedy than was comfortable as my german son was at the festival but , upon seeing the potential for disaster given the mass overcrowding , decided to leave as thankfully did his friends .
in closing , i do not wish this to be vindictive of those involved , but hope with respect to all those people who lost their lives that we can learn from this tragedy to prevent its recurrence . - j. north , great britain i 'm a big fan of germany , but if an investigation is not launched into how a festival of 1 million in an open space that was held in berlin was transferred to a backwater that has experience of mostly classical music events and has a population of just 500,000 in a confined space that holds just 500,000 then germany will be deservedly a laughing stock .
germany needs to seriously question the city authorities that licensed this set up .
words fail me .
it 's not what we expect of germany at all .
to me it seems a disaster that was waiting to happen . - fergal barry via facebook it 's the organizers fault .
in 10 days the heavy metal event " wacken " will take place in wacken .
let 's hope they will organize it much better . - markus , via facebook from germany this is good that the investigation has started and i am sure that soon someone will be officially guilty .
but this is only the administration part .
we all need to ask ourselves : who will bring back the people who are dead now ?
i would like to send my appeal to all organizers for such events , please take this case in seriously and do not let it happen again . - mesar via facebook i think it 's the fault of the organizers and the people as well .
they should n't have used a tunnel for letting thousands of people through it , and people do not know when to stop pushing when they are moving forward in large groups .
people get trapped in a closed space , start panicking , and thus , the result .
wacken is much better organized because it 's at an open space , if something happens people can simply jump over the fences , and they 're off .
unlike a tunnel where they are trapped . - lena , the netherlands compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but there are still security concerns and plans to investigate . the german defense ministry on monday criticized the leak of around 92,000 classified us military documents on the afghanistan war , but said the news value was rather limited .
the german news magazine spiegel as well as the new york times and the guardian newspapers at the weekend printed excerpts of the documents , which were released by the wikileaks website .

" we 're in the process of analyzing the material so as to find out whether the security of our german troops on the ground is affected in any way . "
german foreign minister guido westerwelle also called for further scrutiny of the documents .

" the wikileaks documents bear out just how dramatic the situation in afghanistan is , " roth said .
" but they also show the range of means the allies resort to in their fight for more stability . "
roth referred to classified documents highlighting the us special forces ' capture-and-kill operations , including manhunts where the killing of innocent people is seen as mere collateral damage .
according to the documents , 300 soldiers from the elite us 373 task force are located in the german camp at masar-i-sharif in the north of afghanistan .

now the entrepreneur has become the obejct of public scrutiny . after a mass panic killed 19 people at the love parade techno music festival in duisburg on saturday , one of germany 's less conventional entrepreneurs has found himself in the public spotlight .
rainer schaller , who took over love parade in 2006 , owns a successful chain of fitness studios .
mcfit , as schaller 's chain is called , boasts prices as low as 16,90 euros per month .
it has 118 throughout germany , some 900,000 members , and a turnover of 134 million euros .
love parade was intended to serve as a marketing tool for the company , which plans to expand across europe .
41-year-old schaller 's success can in part be explained by his willingness to take risks .
according to the handelsblatt daily newspaper , schaller 's first fitness studio was an illegal operation which he kept amongst friends and operated in an attic above his parents ' supermarket outside of nuremberg .
he comes from a family of grocers who taught him the " mathematics and accounting " of running a business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 500 people were injured during the love parade mass panic self-made entrepreneur when schaller opened the first mcfit in wurzburg in 1997 , he did every job in the new business himself , from cleaning to training and administration tasks .
he advertised the new mcfit studio as being " now also in wurzburg , " giving the impression that it was part of a large , successful chain .
unlike most fitness chains in germany , mcfit 's strategy is to offer a barebones gym with limited classes and training staff and no extra amenities such as saunas .
customers have around-the-clock access to the machines , but showers cost 50 cents extra .
the concept proved popular , and schaller opened his second studio in 1998 .
in 2008 , the chain recruited ukrainian celebrity boxers vladimir und vitali klitschko to represent it , and in 2009 it opened its first studios in austria and spain .
in 2009 , he told the handelsblatt newspaper that mcfit 's interest in love parade was to " use a relatively small budget to gain a high recognition factor .
we spent a lot of time thinking about what kind of crazy thing we could do to make ourselves more well-known .
we chose love parade . "
condolences expressed schaller expressed his condolences at a press conference sunday , reading from a text and visibly upset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcfit was the main sponsor of the ill-fated love parade " the love parade was always a peaceful and joyous party that will now forever be overshadowed by yesterday 's tragic events .
out of respect for the victims , families and friends , we will discontinue the event .
the love parade is no more .
words are not enough to describe the extent of the shock i feel , " he said .
love parade was founded in 1989 by berlin dj matthias roeingh , also known as dr motte .
in some years it drew more than a million visitors , but planning and financing issues caused it to be cancelled in 2004 and 2005 .
the event was revived and relocated to the ruhr region in 2006 by lopavent , a schaller-owned company .
mcfit has sponsored it with 3 million euros per year ever since .

not only animals and plants flourish by protecting biodiversity , but business too . papua new guinea is one of the world 's least explored countries - both culturally and geographically - and many undiscovered species of plants and animals are thought to exist in its interior .
its tropical wilderness is home to a stunning range of biodiversity - from the queen alexandra 's birdwing , the largest butterfly in the world , to the flamboyant bird-of-paradise , which graces the flag of papua new guinea .
another rare and endangered species native to the country 's rainforest is the golden-mantled tree kangaroo , while a recent discovery was a frog with a pinocchio-like protuberance on its nose that points up when the male is calling and deflates when quiet .
local and global value bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bird of paradise is the country 's national emblem papua new guinea contains over 5 percent of the world 's biodiversity within less than 1 percent of its total land area .
for now , the rainforests of papua new guinea are still intact .
but although the overall population density of the country remains low , the population is growing slowly but steadily - progressing , according to un estimates , from 5,711,000 in 2003 to a projected population in the year 2015 of 7,169,000 .
these inhabitants depend on the local biological resources to sustain their livelihoods .
but the result , as recent satellite studies of the region show , is that current rates of deforestation will cause more than half of the papua new guinea 's rainforests to be lost or seriously degraded by 2021 .
taking a toll the increase in human population , coupled with the availability of more efficient farming tools , pose a growing threat to biodiversity .
the local agriculture and logging industry are taking their toll on the environment and threatening the natural habitats of valued birds , animals , fish , insects , plants and trees . un experts estimate that 130 species of plants , animals and insects are lost worldwide every single day .
" this is 100 to 1000 times faster than the evolutionary process of the extinction of species and appearance of new ones , " says andrea cederquist , a greenpeace biodiversity expert .
for now , it is unclear as to how exactly biodiversity in papua new guinea is being affected .
" climate change and the loss of species are closely intertwined , and no one can gauge the full effects , " stresses cederquist .
experts agree that these can not be predicted .
but given that the extinction of one species can have knock-on effects , causing further extinctions , not only papua new guinea 's birds of paradise are at stake , but entire ecosystems .
chains of extinction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : were ants to die out , the result would be global disaster after all , most living things on earth support others .
the power of the " little creatures that run the world " was spelt out by harvard biologist edward o.wilson and german behavioral biologist bert hoelldobler in their pulitzer prize-winning 1990 study " the ants . " their book reveals how humans would die without the ants ' soil-tilling drudgery that maintains the existence of plant life .
army ants are known to support 100 known species , from beetles to birds .
were they to die out , entire ecosystems would collapse and the result would be global disaster .
" everyone is aware of all this , " says greenpeace expert cederquist . " but no one acts . "
pricing the earth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in papua new guinea , locals are leraning to farm sustainably what might finally spur action is the dawning awareness of the global economic impact of the loss of biodiversity .
under the aegis of the united nations environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- , the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity -lrb- teeb -rrb- project is an international initiative to draw attention to this issue .
in its latest study published in july , it puts the extent of losses of natural capital taking place as a result of deforestation and degradation at between $ 2 - 4.5 trillion per year , every year .
the full report sets out the economic case for biodiversity and ecosystems , describing how even factors such as insect pollination ultimately have a crucial impact on business and society .
against this backdrop , environmentalists are well aware that however local they might seem , conservation efforts in papua new guinea have repercussions for the entire planet .

now the entrepreneur has become the obejct of public scrutiny . after a mass panic killed 19 people at the love parade techno music festival in duisburg on saturday , one of germany 's less conventional entrepreneurs has found himself in the public spotlight .
rainer schaller , who took over love parade in 2006 , owns a successful chain of fitness studios .
mcfit , as schaller 's chain is called , boasts prices as low as 16,90 euros per month .
it has 118 throughout germany , some 900,000 members , and a turnover of 134 million euros .
love parade was intended to serve as a marketing tool for the company , which plans to expand across europe .
41-year-old schaller 's success can in part be explained by his willingness to take risks .
according to the handelsblatt daily newspaper , schaller 's first fitness studio was an illegal operation which he kept amongst friends and operated in an attic above his parents ' supermarket outside of nuremberg .
he comes from a family of grocers who taught him the " mathematics and accounting " of running a business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 500 people were injured during the love parade mass panic self-made entrepreneur when schaller opened the first mcfit in wurzburg in 1997 , he did every job in the new business himself , from cleaning to training and administration tasks .
he advertised the new mcfit studio as being " now also in wurzburg , " giving the impression that it was part of a large , successful chain .
unlike most fitness chains in germany , mcfit 's strategy is to offer a barebones gym with limited classes and training staff and no extra amenities such as saunas .
customers have around-the-clock access to the machines , but showers cost 50 cents extra .
the concept proved popular , and schaller opened his second studio in 1998 .
in 2008 , the chain recruited ukrainian celebrity boxers vladimir und vitali klitschko to represent it , and in 2009 it opened its first studios in austria and spain .
in 2009 , he told the handelsblatt newspaper that mcfit 's interest in love parade was to " use a relatively small budget to gain a high recognition factor .
we spent a lot of time thinking about what kind of crazy thing we could do to make ourselves more well-known .
we chose love parade . "
condolences expressed schaller expressed his condolences at a press conference sunday , reading from a text and visibly upset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcfit was the main sponsor of the ill-fated love parade " the love parade was always a peaceful and joyous party that will now forever be overshadowed by yesterday 's tragic events .
out of respect for the victims , families and friends , we will discontinue the event .
the love parade is no more .
words are not enough to describe the extent of the shock i feel , " he said .
love parade was founded in 1989 by berlin dj matthias roeingh , also known as dr motte .
in some years it drew more than a million visitors , but planning and financing issues caused it to be cancelled in 2004 and 2005 .
the event was revived and relocated to the ruhr region in 2006 by lopavent , a schaller-owned company .
mcfit has sponsored it with 3 million euros per year ever since .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
love parade tragedy news of the deaths at the love parade honestly made me sad .
i offer my condolences to chancellor merkel , her fellow germans and everyone else affected by the tragedy . - paul , us unfortunately the blame must lie with organizers , council and police and whoever signed off on an entrance via a huge tunnel .
surely the crowd could have been channelled far more easily via fencing through there than just letting them into the whole width of it - which meant people had nowhere to go .
if the entrance was actually at the other end of the tunnel , this would n't have happened once the venue filled up and the crowd could have been stopped before entering .
such a tragedy at an amazing event meant to celebrate music and peace . - simon , australia clearly the authorities are to blame for this tragedy .
it is they who have the expertise , the total authority and legal responsibility to decide if a festival venue is safe for the public to attend .
this is not within the expertise of commercial festival organizers .
the final decision is with city and police experts .
there is already ample evidence that the authorities were more interested in corralling the crowd into a small area , the usual state control freak mentality , than planning for crowd overflow and emergency exits and entrances .
it is a disgrace that parallels the inexcusable mistakes at duesseldorf airport 's fire where the rigid application of rules instead of common sense prevented the airport fire service from attending the fire and the subsequent loss of life .
no doubt the blame shall be pushed on to others as it was after duesseldorf , a hapless welder , there as i recall .
i speak with some authority as the uk is riddled with the same over-organized incompetence .
i hope heads roll over this disaster , resignations should be called for .
i was personally closer to this tragedy than was comfortable as my german son was at the festival but , upon seeing the potential for disaster given the mass overcrowding , decided to leave as thankfully did his friends .
in closing , i do not wish this to be vindictive of those involved , but hope with respect to all those people who lost their lives that we can learn from this tragedy to prevent its recurrence . - j. north , great britain i 'm a big fan of germany , but if an investigation is not launched into how a festival of 1 million in an open space that was held in berlin was transferred to a backwater that has experience of mostly classical music events and has a population of just 500,000 in a confined space that holds just 500,000 then germany will be deservedly a laughing stock .
germany needs to seriously question the city authorities that licensed this set up .
words fail me .
it 's not what we expect of germany at all .
to me it seems a disaster that was waiting to happen . - fergal barry via facebook it 's the organizers fault .
in 10 days the heavy metal event " wacken " will take place in wacken .
let 's hope they will organize it much better . - markus , via facebook from germany this is good that the investigation has started and i am sure that soon someone will be officially guilty .
but this is only the administration part .
we all need to ask ourselves : who will bring back the people who are dead now ?
i would like to send my appeal to all organizers for such events , please take this case in seriously and do not let it happen again . - mesar via facebook i think it 's the fault of the organizers and the people as well .
they should n't have used a tunnel for letting thousands of people through it , and people do not know when to stop pushing when they are moving forward in large groups .
people get trapped in a closed space , start panicking , and thus , the result .
wacken is much better organized because it 's at an open space , if something happens people can simply jump over the fences , and they 're off .
unlike a tunnel where they are trapped . - lena , the netherlands compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but this year ’ s love parade in duisburg ended in disaster , with 19 people killed and hundreds of others injured .
two days on , many questions are left unanswered .

love parade tragedy news of the deaths at the love parade honestly made me sad .
i offer my condolences to chancellor merkel , her fellow germans and everyone else affected by the tragedy . - paul , us unfortunately the blame must lie with organizers , council and police and whoever signed off on an entrance via a huge tunnel .
surely the crowd could have been channelled far more easily via fencing through there than just letting them into the whole width of it - which meant people had nowhere to go .
if the entrance was actually at the other end of the tunnel , this would n't have happened once the venue filled up and the crowd could have been stopped before entering .
such a tragedy at an amazing event meant to celebrate music and peace . - simon , australia clearly the authorities are to blame for this tragedy .
it is they who have the expertise , the total authority and legal responsibility to decide if a festival venue is safe for the public to attend .
this is not within the expertise of commercial festival organizers .
the final decision is with city and police experts .
there is already ample evidence that the authorities were more interested in corralling the crowd into a small area , the usual state control freak mentality , than planning for crowd overflow and emergency exits and entrances .
it is a disgrace that parallels the inexcusable mistakes at duesseldorf airport 's fire where the rigid application of rules instead of common sense prevented the airport fire service from attending the fire and the subsequent loss of life .
no doubt the blame shall be pushed on to others as it was after duesseldorf , a hapless welder , there as i recall .
i speak with some authority as the uk is riddled with the same over-organized incompetence .
i hope heads roll over this disaster , resignations should be called for .
i was personally closer to this tragedy than was comfortable as my german son was at the festival but , upon seeing the potential for disaster given the mass overcrowding , decided to leave as thankfully did his friends .
in closing , i do not wish this to be vindictive of those involved , but hope with respect to all those people who lost their lives that we can learn from this tragedy to prevent its recurrence . - j. north , great britain i 'm a big fan of germany , but if an investigation is not launched into how a festival of 1 million in an open space that was held in berlin was transferred to a backwater that has experience of mostly classical music events and has a population of just 500,000 in a confined space that holds just 500,000 then germany will be deservedly a laughing stock .
germany needs to seriously question the city authorities that licensed this set up .
words fail me .
it 's not what we expect of germany at all .
to me it seems a disaster that was waiting to happen . - fergal barry via facebook it 's the organizers fault .
in 10 days the heavy metal event " wacken " will take place in wacken .
let 's hope they will organize it much better . - markus , via facebook from germany this is good that the investigation has started and i am sure that soon someone will be officially guilty .
but this is only the administration part .
we all need to ask ourselves : who will bring back the people who are dead now ?
i would like to send my appeal to all organizers for such events , please take this case in seriously and do not let it happen again . - mesar via facebook i think it 's the fault of the organizers and the people as well .
they should n't have used a tunnel for letting thousands of people through it , and people do not know when to stop pushing when they are moving forward in large groups .
people get trapped in a closed space , start panicking , and thus , the result .
wacken is much better organized because it 's at an open space , if something happens people can simply jump over the fences , and they 're off .

both religions celebrated their reconciliation at the lutheran world federation assembly . the bloody oppression of the mennonite free church in the 16th century is one of the darkest chapters in european history .
this past week , lutherans issued an official apology for the cruel persecution of the anabaptists - and both parties celebrated their reconciliation in a very moving ceremony . " we still remember being a prosecuted minority , " said larry miller , secretary general of the mennonite world conference . the mennonite free church is the main branch of the descendants of the christian baptist movement .
mennonites are known as anabaptists because they only baptise adults and not underage children . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the apology is an important concession for larry miller for church reformer martin luther , mennonites were schismatic heretics who denied children access to the christian community .
luther expressed his rejection of the anabaptists in a letter of denomination which was published in the southern german city of augsburg , and is known as the augsburg confession of 1530 .
even today , lutheran pastors are ordained using parts of this text . bloody religious conflict the baptists , who advocated church reforms even more radical than those proposed by martin luther or ulrich zwingli , were persecuted by both the catholics and the protestants and had to flee for their lives .
nevertheless , thousands were killed today , the free church has more than one million members all over the world , mostly in the united states and canada .
about 60,000 members live in europe .
the mennonites disapprove of ecclesiastic hierarchies and their local churches are rather autonomous . early on , they decided to raise their voice against every act of war and violence and live according to a " total renunciation of force . "
they are regarded as one of the historical peace churches . no longer victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a relatively large number of mennonites lives in the us in the reconciliation ceremony during the 11th lutheran world federation assembly in stuttgart this past week , representatives of the lutheran church explicitly asked " god and our mennonite sisters and brothers for forgiveness for the harm that our ancestors have brought upon the anabaptists . " the plea for forgiveness is the result of a year-long process and is based on work done by the lutheran-mennonite study commission from 2005 to 2008 . for general secretary miller , this apology is a significant concession and an act of liberation .
the anabaptists had regarded themselves as victims for centuries . " now we have to reconsider our identity , " miller said .
indeed , the stories of martyrdom are still present in the mennonite communities and their ancestors ' suffering is passed on from generation to generation . healing can begin " it is a deep wound within the christian world when two churches of the reformation movement are separated despite actually being so close because of their common origin and their history , " mennonite pastor reiner burghard said , expressing his hope that this wound could now begin to heal . author : ulrike mast-kirschning -lrb- gri -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : wikileaks disclosures wikileaks exposes shell 's infiltration of nigeria 's government opinion : wikileaks is a test of us commitment to free press wikileaks cables show consistent us foreign policy , say experts wikileaks release could lead to shift from transparency to secrecy afghanistan -pipe- 26.07.2010 berlin plays down wikileaks ' afghanistan files but plans investigation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks sees itself a citizens ' intelligence agency the release of us military documents on the afghan war and the publishing of classified material has not caused uproar in the german government .
but there are still security concerns and plans to investigate . the german defense ministry on monday criticized the leak of around 92,000 classified us military documents on the afghanistan war , but said the news value was rather limited .
the german news magazine spiegel as well as the new york times and the guardian newspapers at the weekend printed excerpts of the documents , which were released by the wikileaks website .
" obtaining and releasing documents , some of them secret , on such a scale is a highly questionable practice since it could affect the national security of nato allies and the whole nato mission , " defense ministry spokesman christian dienst said . " we 're in the process of analyzing the material so as to find out whether the security of our german troops on the ground is affected in any way . "
german foreign minister guido westerwelle also called for further scrutiny of the documents .
at an eu foreign ministers ’ meeting in brussels , westerwelle said the documents , which contain claims of concealed civilian casualties , had given him " comfort in my position , which consisted of never talking up the situation in afghanistan , which is exceptionally serious . "
attacks on the rise dienst confirmed that reports about a drastic increase of taliban attacks on allied troops were true .
he said that in the course of this year alone there had been close to 60 armed attacks on the german isaf contingent alone – almost triple the the figures available for 2007 and the years before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers are based largely in northern afghanistan wikileaks claimed that us and nato forces had increasingly been confined to reacting to the taleban 's operations and strategy rather than actively pursuing a policy of their own .
the joint leader of germany 's opposition green party , claudia roth , told the media on monday she did n't sense an often-cited new strategy of the allied forces in afghanistan at all .
killing a priority ?
" the wikileaks documents bear out just how dramatic the situation in afghanistan is , " roth said .
" but they also show the range of means the allies resort to in their fight for more stability . "
roth referred to classified documents highlighting the us special forces ' capture-and-kill operations , including manhunts where the killing of innocent people is seen as mere collateral damage .
according to the documents , 300 soldiers from the elite us 373 task force are located in the german camp at masar-i-sharif in the north of afghanistan .
their major task is the killing of high-ranking taliban leaders .
the sources available to wikileaks do not specify whether any german officers are involved in the planning or implementing of such targeted killings .
and the defense ministry in berlin was unwilling to shed any light on this issue .
" as far as the us task force is concerned , it 's in the nature of things that their operations remain secret , " christian dienst said .
" this means that only a very small circle of people is in the know about any details of these operations . "
everything said before ?
wikileaks knows that much of the information provided is not totally new .
but it claims it has got hold of the most comprehensive description of an armed conflict ever .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spiegel has looked into us special forces ' operations before wikileaks is a web platform which claims to be the first intelligence agency of the people .
since its founding in december 2006 it has called on potential whistleblowers from all over the world to make anonymous contributions and provide mostly classified information .
so far , people have sent about 1.2 million such documents to the web platform .
among wikileaks ' best-known scoops was the posting of a video depicting a us helicopter strike in baghdad in 2007 .
the footage showed how about a dozen civilians were gunned down , among them two employees from the reuters news agency .
in 2009 , the website first acquired international recognition when it published secret documents from a multinational shipping company , implicating the firm in toxic waste dumping in the ivory coast .

the test now is whether it can perform to expectations . in early july 2010 the united nations -lrb- un -rrb- created a new entity for gender equality and the empowerment of women – to be known as un women .
it also adopted important resolutions aimed at improving the un organizations ' development cooperation .
the first you 've heard of it ?
that is a shame because these achievements show that the organization is capable of instituting reform and that multilateral action among 192 countries remains possible .
so what 's it all about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un chief ban ki-moon has come in for heavy criticism of his leadership recently un organizations like the development program -lrb- undp -rrb- , the children 's program -lrb- unicef -rrb- or the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- – to name but the three largest – are important multilateral actors .
they have a key role to play when it comes to implementing universally valid norms such as , for instance , human rights , gender equality and environmental standards .
along with their global , operative tasks they also contribute research studies to the development discourse -lrb- for example , the annual undp human development report -rrb- and engage in advocacy work on behalf of the most disadvantaged .
the fact that developing countries are involved on equal terms in the governance of un organizations means they are regarded as especially legitimate .
and that is why they are in a better position to engage in sensitive policy fields .
nevertheless , the un system is highly fragmented .
the numerous organizations often do not work well together , their fields of activity overlap and they ought to bring their individual strengths more to the fore .
these were the conclusions drawn in a report submitted by a high-level panel of experts in 2006 that recommended that the un should " deliver as one . "
the experts also felt that the un 's structures should be simplified , among other things in the fields of women and gender equality .
they recommended that the four institutions dealing with these issues should be combined to form a new organization in order to make them more visible and better able to assert themselves by bringing together resources and mandates .
slow process while western industrialized nations backed ideas to simplify un structures and to concentrate their areas of activity , some key developing countries and emerging economies regarded these plans with suspicion from the very outset .
in their eyes these steps would weaken the un , which on paper at least has a comprehensive mandate for economic and financial issues .
they feared that development policy would suffer further cuts in favor of the security agenda endorsed by the west , and emphasized that it was the un 's institutional and thematic variety that set it apart .
in view of their dissent as to the content of the majority of the experts ' suggestions , they insisted that the negotiations - and thus any possible compromises - should cover all issues .
the establishment of the new women 's organization , which many developing countries also backed , thus became dependent on consensus in other areas .
decisions , decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major developing nations are demanding a greater say in international affairs the most important decision that has been taken is that to establish un women .
the entity aims to be up and running by january 2011 .
its work will on the one hand be normative , that is it will continue developing existing international obligations and ensure they are observed and implemented across the world .
on the other hand , it will run operational programs for which it will have a budget of 500 million us dollars at its disposal .
other decisions are less spectacular but nevertheless important , namely those on improving the governance of the un development system , on harmonizing administrative procedures across the entire system , guaranteeing a reliable funding base in the future and in regard to an ongoing reform initiative in which the un family delivers as one in eight pilot countries .
reaching agreement the resolution was preceded by four years of negotiations .
it quickly became clear that no radical restructuring exercise would be possible , as consensus could only be reached on implementing successive small-scale reforms .
although the line of conflict traditionally ran between developing countries -lrb- g-77 -rrb- and industrialized nations , clear differences became apparent .
smaller , poorer countries like rwanda and tanzania as well as middle-income countries like vietnam and uruguay , in which bilateral development aid is gradually tapering off , have a particular interest in more coherent and effective cooperation with un organizations .
the positions adopted by a few ideologically- , motivated countries like cuba or emerging economies like india and egypt were primarily based on power politics and their attempts to prevent changes or achieve concessions .
the industrialized nations ' positions were more homogeneous .
during the very last phase of negotiations , however , the united states irritated the other countries by going it alone and making concessions on the new un women supervisory board .
ultimately , however , no-one wanted to stand in the way of the creation of an organization that had long been overdue .
what next ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 is losing ground to the g20 in terms of significance the resolution set an important milestone on the road to the reform of un development cooperation .
however , un women must now prove that it can be more than the sum of its individual parts .
appointing a well-known and authoritative personality from the south to the leadership position will play a key role when it comes to gaining acceptance for the organization 's work in developing countries , as well as for the generosity donor countries will now have to show .
despite the need to tighten budgetary belts , germany should contribute financially .
not only in order to increase its chances of being elected onto the security council in october 2010 , but also , in view of the recently announced cuts in contributions , to demonstrate that the un is still an important partner for germany .
the un remains an indispensable consensus-reaching and decision-making forum when it comes to pressing global challenges .
in countries of the south , the world organization 's development activities are key to gaining acceptance for its activities in the areas of security , or norm and standard setting .
also in the age of the g-20 , strengthening the un continues to be in germany 's interest .

the test now is whether it can perform to expectations . in early july 2010 the united nations -lrb- un -rrb- created a new entity for gender equality and the empowerment of women – to be known as un women .
it also adopted important resolutions aimed at improving the un organizations ' development cooperation .
the first you 've heard of it ?
that is a shame because these achievements show that the organization is capable of instituting reform and that multilateral action among 192 countries remains possible .
so what 's it all about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un chief ban ki-moon has come in for heavy criticism of his leadership recently un organizations like the development program -lrb- undp -rrb- , the children 's program -lrb- unicef -rrb- or the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- – to name but the three largest – are important multilateral actors .
they have a key role to play when it comes to implementing universally valid norms such as , for instance , human rights , gender equality and environmental standards .
along with their global , operative tasks they also contribute research studies to the development discourse -lrb- for example , the annual undp human development report -rrb- and engage in advocacy work on behalf of the most disadvantaged .
the fact that developing countries are involved on equal terms in the governance of un organizations means they are regarded as especially legitimate .
and that is why they are in a better position to engage in sensitive policy fields .
nevertheless , the un system is highly fragmented .
the numerous organizations often do not work well together , their fields of activity overlap and they ought to bring their individual strengths more to the fore .
these were the conclusions drawn in a report submitted by a high-level panel of experts in 2006 that recommended that the un should " deliver as one . "
the experts also felt that the un 's structures should be simplified , among other things in the fields of women and gender equality .
they recommended that the four institutions dealing with these issues should be combined to form a new organization in order to make them more visible and better able to assert themselves by bringing together resources and mandates .
slow process while western industrialized nations backed ideas to simplify un structures and to concentrate their areas of activity , some key developing countries and emerging economies regarded these plans with suspicion from the very outset .
in their eyes these steps would weaken the un , which on paper at least has a comprehensive mandate for economic and financial issues .
they feared that development policy would suffer further cuts in favor of the security agenda endorsed by the west , and emphasized that it was the un 's institutional and thematic variety that set it apart .
in view of their dissent as to the content of the majority of the experts ' suggestions , they insisted that the negotiations - and thus any possible compromises - should cover all issues .
the establishment of the new women 's organization , which many developing countries also backed , thus became dependent on consensus in other areas .
decisions , decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major developing nations are demanding a greater say in international affairs the most important decision that has been taken is that to establish un women .
the entity aims to be up and running by january 2011 .
its work will on the one hand be normative , that is it will continue developing existing international obligations and ensure they are observed and implemented across the world .
on the other hand , it will run operational programs for which it will have a budget of 500 million us dollars at its disposal .
other decisions are less spectacular but nevertheless important , namely those on improving the governance of the un development system , on harmonizing administrative procedures across the entire system , guaranteeing a reliable funding base in the future and in regard to an ongoing reform initiative in which the un family delivers as one in eight pilot countries .
reaching agreement the resolution was preceded by four years of negotiations .
it quickly became clear that no radical restructuring exercise would be possible , as consensus could only be reached on implementing successive small-scale reforms .
although the line of conflict traditionally ran between developing countries -lrb- g-77 -rrb- and industrialized nations , clear differences became apparent .
smaller , poorer countries like rwanda and tanzania as well as middle-income countries like vietnam and uruguay , in which bilateral development aid is gradually tapering off , have a particular interest in more coherent and effective cooperation with un organizations .
the positions adopted by a few ideologically- , motivated countries like cuba or emerging economies like india and egypt were primarily based on power politics and their attempts to prevent changes or achieve concessions .
the industrialized nations ' positions were more homogeneous .
during the very last phase of negotiations , however , the united states irritated the other countries by going it alone and making concessions on the new un women supervisory board .
ultimately , however , no-one wanted to stand in the way of the creation of an organization that had long been overdue .
what next ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 is losing ground to the g20 in terms of significance the resolution set an important milestone on the road to the reform of un development cooperation .
however , un women must now prove that it can be more than the sum of its individual parts .
appointing a well-known and authoritative personality from the south to the leadership position will play a key role when it comes to gaining acceptance for the organization 's work in developing countries , as well as for the generosity donor countries will now have to show .
despite the need to tighten budgetary belts , germany should contribute financially .
not only in order to increase its chances of being elected onto the security council in october 2010 , but also , in view of the recently announced cuts in contributions , to demonstrate that the un is still an important partner for germany .
the un remains an indispensable consensus-reaching and decision-making forum when it comes to pressing global challenges .
in countries of the south , the world organization 's development activities are key to gaining acceptance for its activities in the areas of security , or norm and standard setting .
also in the age of the g-20 , strengthening the un continues to be in germany 's interest .

the organizers are happy , with tour chief christian prudhomme calling it the " greatest tour he has experienced . "

the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- was again responsible for doping tests during this year ’ s tour , with officials from the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- acting as independent observers .
french anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- chief pierre bordry has criticized the way tests are run .
" they are organized in such a way that the riders know about them beforehand , " he said .
the afld shadowed uci ’ s testing processes in 2009 , and accused world cycling 's governing body of showing favoritism towards the leading riders , like winner alberto contador .
bordry 's organization made a request to carry out its own drug tests on this year 's tour , which was turned down by wada .
the international agency said that french law did not totally conform with the global anti-doping code , meaning any positive results gained would lead to a legislative stalemate .

no rider has tested positive for a banned substance since the uci took over testing last year .
speeds and levels of performance in sprints , time trials and mountain stages have not dropped over this time period though .
uci president pat mcquaid promised an unprecedented level of testing during the 2010 tour , with at least 600 doping tests being carried out .
" we also have a list of 55 riders , like the favorites , who will have extra tests , " mcquaid said before the tour .
the uci has sought to tighten up the testing procedure , employing chaperons to watch over riders from the finish line until after they have provided urine or blood samples .
cycling ’ s governing body also began a biological passport scheme in 2008 , where certain blood markers were monitored in every rider .
long-term variations would signal doping .
a spokesman for the uci refused to comment on criticism of its testing procedures .
wada also declined to comment until after the release of a report by its independent observers in the coming weeks .
seven-time tour de france winner lance armstrong bowed out of the sport this week , with doping allegations still following him .
disgraced 2006 tour winner floyd landis has said that he saw his former teammate take drugs on numerous occasions .

critics say the tour is not clean , and are pointing the finger at world cycling 's testing procedure . a second successive tour de france has ended without news of a single rider testing positive for a banned substance .
the organizers are happy , with tour chief christian prudhomme calling it the " greatest tour he has experienced . "
but fans and critics remain to be convinced that the tour is suddenly totally clean .
" the tests that are currently being done are a joke , they are very poor , " german anti-doping expert werner franke told deutsche welle .
" no doubt about it , it -lrb- doping -rrb- all continues , but is no longer discovered .
it 's the money that counts ; it 's the image that counts – and nobody will say anything against that , " said the biologist from the german cancer research center .
the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- was again responsible for doping tests during this year ’ s tour , with officials from the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- acting as independent observers .
french anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- chief pierre bordry has criticized the way tests are run .
" they are organized in such a way that the riders know about them beforehand , " he said .
the afld shadowed uci ’ s testing processes in 2009 , and accused world cycling 's governing body of showing favoritism towards the leading riders , like winner alberto contador .
bordry 's organization made a request to carry out its own drug tests on this year 's tour , which was turned down by wada .
the international agency said that french law did not totally conform with the global anti-doping code , meaning any positive results gained would lead to a legislative stalemate .
' unprecedented ' testing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl was the last top-level rider to be banned for doping the afld led the testing on the 2008 tour , when seven riders were caught using cera , a new variant of the banned red-blood-cell booster erythropoietin .
no rider has tested positive for a banned substance since the uci took over testing last year .
speeds and levels of performance in sprints , time trials and mountain stages have not dropped over this time period though .
uci president pat mcquaid promised an unprecedented level of testing during the 2010 tour , with at least 600 doping tests being carried out .
" we also have a list of 55 riders , like the favorites , who will have extra tests , " mcquaid said before the tour .
the uci has sought to tighten up the testing procedure , employing chaperons to watch over riders from the finish line until after they have provided urine or blood samples .
cycling ’ s governing body also began a biological passport scheme in 2008 , where certain blood markers were monitored in every rider .
long-term variations would signal doping .
a spokesman for the uci refused to comment on criticism of its testing procedures .
wada also declined to comment until after the release of a report by its independent observers in the coming weeks .
seven-time tour de france winner lance armstrong bowed out of the sport this week , with doping allegations still following him .
disgraced 2006 tour winner floyd landis has said that he saw his former teammate take drugs on numerous occasions .
landis ' claims have led to a u.s. federal investigation into the use of government money for doping by armstrong and his former u.s. postal team .
allegations lingering austrian rider bernhard kohl was one of those suspended for using cera in 2008 .
he was crowned king of the mountains and finished third overall , before testing positive and later confessing to doping .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong 's record as the best ever tour de france cyclist has been tainted by allegations " you have to dope to make it a level playing-field , " kohl told deutsche welle .
" the tour de france is 3,500 kilometers , it is very hard . "
the 28-year-old said that calling the last two tours " completely clean " was " an illusion " .
initially given a two-year suspension , his ban was later extended until 2014 .
kohl announced his retirement in 2009 .
to help combat the use of drugs in the sport in the future , bernhard kohl also points to the role of cycling 's governing bodies .
" it is the same people , at the top of cycling , who must do their part .
but i believe it will be difficult to put an end to it . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de doping -pipe- 26.07.2010 critics deride ' clean ' tour de france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping reared its head in 1998 , when riders held a sit-in to protest against police raids the 2010 tour de france finished on sunday , without a single rider testing positive for doping .
critics say the tour is not clean , and are pointing the finger at world cycling 's testing procedure . a second successive tour de france has ended without news of a single rider testing positive for a banned substance .
the organizers are happy , with tour chief christian prudhomme calling it the " greatest tour he has experienced . "
but fans and critics remain to be convinced that the tour is suddenly totally clean .
" the tests that are currently being done are a joke , they are very poor , " german anti-doping expert werner franke told deutsche welle .
" no doubt about it , it -lrb- doping -rrb- all continues , but is no longer discovered .
it 's the money that counts ; it 's the image that counts – and nobody will say anything against that , " said the biologist from the german cancer research center .
the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- was again responsible for doping tests during this year ’ s tour , with officials from the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- acting as independent observers .
french anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- chief pierre bordry has criticized the way tests are run .
" they are organized in such a way that the riders know about them beforehand , " he said .
the afld shadowed uci ’ s testing processes in 2009 , and accused world cycling 's governing body of showing favoritism towards the leading riders , like winner alberto contador .
bordry 's organization made a request to carry out its own drug tests on this year 's tour , which was turned down by wada .
the international agency said that french law did not totally conform with the global anti-doping code , meaning any positive results gained would lead to a legislative stalemate .
' unprecedented ' testing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl was the last top-level rider to be banned for doping the afld led the testing on the 2008 tour , when seven riders were caught using cera , a new variant of the banned red-blood-cell booster erythropoietin .
no rider has tested positive for a banned substance since the uci took over testing last year .
speeds and levels of performance in sprints , time trials and mountain stages have not dropped over this time period though .
uci president pat mcquaid promised an unprecedented level of testing during the 2010 tour , with at least 600 doping tests being carried out .
" we also have a list of 55 riders , like the favorites , who will have extra tests , " mcquaid said before the tour .
the uci has sought to tighten up the testing procedure , employing chaperons to watch over riders from the finish line until after they have provided urine or blood samples .
cycling ’ s governing body also began a biological passport scheme in 2008 , where certain blood markers were monitored in every rider .
long-term variations would signal doping .
a spokesman for the uci refused to comment on criticism of its testing procedures .
wada also declined to comment until after the release of a report by its independent observers in the coming weeks .
seven-time tour de france winner lance armstrong bowed out of the sport this week , with doping allegations still following him .
disgraced 2006 tour winner floyd landis has said that he saw his former teammate take drugs on numerous occasions .
landis ' claims have led to a u.s. federal investigation into the use of government money for doping by armstrong and his former u.s. postal team .
allegations lingering austrian rider bernhard kohl was one of those suspended for using cera in 2008 .
he was crowned king of the mountains and finished third overall , before testing positive and later confessing to doping .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armstrong 's record as the best ever tour de france cyclist has been tainted by allegations " you have to dope to make it a level playing-field , " kohl told deutsche welle .
" the tour de france is 3,500 kilometers , it is very hard . "
the 28-year-old said that calling the last two tours " completely clean " was " an illusion " .
initially given a two-year suspension , his ban was later extended until 2014 .
kohl announced his retirement in 2009 .
to help combat the use of drugs in the sport in the future , bernhard kohl also points to the role of cycling 's governing bodies .
" it is the same people , at the top of cycling , who must do their part .
but i believe it will be difficult to put an end to it . "

opinion is also divided within chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union . german chancellor angela merkel 's governing coalition has been put on notice that it will face a fight over any change to the law on nuclear energy without approval from the country 's upper house of parliament .
green party leader claudia roth threatened on sunday to press for a judicial review at the germany 's constitutional court if the government moved to extend the operational lifetimes of nuclear power plants without consent from the bundesrat .
speaking to public broadcaster ard , roth said that a number of germany 's state governments were unhappy about a proposed delay to the closure dates .

according to a law passed in 2002 by the then-ruling spd and the green coalition , all of germany 's nuclear power plants are to go off line by 2022 .

" we will exhaust every legal possibility , right up to the constitutional court , " the green party 's loehrmann told the tagesspiegel newspaper on sunday .
according to a law passed in 2002 by the then-ruling spd and the green coalition , all of germany 's nuclear power plants are to go off line by 2022 .
chancellor merkel 's government has said that it intends to extend the deadline by a period that has yet to be determined .
until recently , it had been thought that any legal change would need to be approved by the bundesrat , germany 's upper house , which represents country 's 16 states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitutional court may ultimately decide the matter however , after the may election in north rhine-westphalia , the center-right coalition lost its majority in the upper chamber .
soon afterward , merkel 's chief of staff , ronald pofalla , announced possible plans to bypass the bundesrat entirely - infuriating opposition parties .
whether or not the government needs the agreement of the bundesrat is not clear . dissent within coalition opinion within merkel 's cdu is also divided . the cdu premier of the state of saarland , peter mueller , has questioned the need for an extension .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister norbert roettgen is seeking a consensus " we need an energy supply that is safe , sustainable and affordable , " mueller said in sunday 's edition of the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" i believe that we would be able to achieve that without the extension of the lifetimes of nuclear power plants . "
environment minister norbert roettgen of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , argued for a new limited nuclear plant extension in the monday edition of bremen 's weser kurier , stressing that nuclear power was only needed until alternatives could be found .
" it is a very rational approach , which is linked with enormous economic opportunities for germany .
people in germany understand that , better apparently than so many critics . "
in the same newspaper 's online edition on sunday , baden wuertemberg 's cdu premier , stephan mappus , who wants to see the final shut down date extended by 15 years , criticized roettgen for not adopting a clearer line in favor of an extension .

the death toll now stands at 20 , and more than 500 people are still being treated for their injuries after panic broke out in a tunnel leading to the festival grounds on saturday afternoon .
duisburg mayor adolf sauerland , who defended what he called a " solid " security plan at a news conference on sunday and was pelted with rubbish by angry bystanders , has faced scathing criticism from several media outlets .
he resisted calls for his immediate resignation on monday and told public broadcaster wdr that he would address that issue when the time was right .
" i will be asking myself this question , there 's no doubt about that , " he said , adding that the main issue now was explaining saturday 's tragedy .
" and when we know what happened there , then we will answer this question .
that i promise . "
" if the city is guilty of anything then we will assume responsibility , " he said in a statement .
sauerland said a condolence book would remain available through the end of the month and that the city was working with church officials to plan a memorial service .
' consequences must be drawn urgently ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerland , right , has defended the city 's " solid " security plan on monday , german chancellor angela merkel said she expected a " scrupulously thorough " investigation into the tragedy , according to her spokesman ulrich wilhelm . " a full picture and a proper analysis of what happened and what mistakes were possibly made can however only be done once the investigation is completed , " he added . " consequences must be drawn urgently ...
i think it 's clear the security plans were not good , " said hannelore kraft , the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , in an interview on ard television . earlier monday , german prosecutors seized documents relating to the security planning of the event . rolf haferkamp , spokesman for the duisburg state prosecutors ' office , said he could not speak about the content of the numerous documents that were seized , but said the investigation of possible negligent manslaughter was ongoing . who 's to blame ? one theoretical explanation for the accident that quickly emerged in the press was that duisburg , a city in the former coal-mining ruhr region , was desperate to gain from the prestige of the love parade , and that city officials did not take security concerns seriously . the ruhr 2010 european capital of culture program has taken the lead in attracting such events and the program 's chief organizer , fritz pleitgen , said he felt " jointly responsible , but more in a moral sense . " " -lsb- the love parade -rsb- was offered to us as a project for the capital of culture program , " he told zdf public television .
" we accepted that , but we were not involved in financing or organizing the event . " the cologne-based daily newspaper koelner stadt-anzeiger also reported that the chief of the duisburg fire department told sauerland in writing that the location for the event - the city 's former freight rail station - was too small for the expected number of visitors . and the online edition of the news magazine der spiegel reported that an official document issued by the city of duisburg authorized only 250,000 people for the event - far short of the estimated 1.4 million who attended .
it also reportedly exempted the organizers from the minimal width of escape routes and from having fire brigade provisions .
bildunterschrift : organizers said the love parade would never take place again police unions point finger rainer wendt , head of the national police union , said police warnings about the dangers of holding the festival in duisburg were not heeded .
" i warned them a year ago that duisburg was not a suitable location for the love parade .
it 's too small and too cramped , " said wendt .
" but i was called a killjoy and a security fanatic . "
a report in the koelner stadt-anzeiger said that mayor sauerland gave the go-ahead for the event just hours before the start , despite concerns from police and fire officials .
however , frank richter , head of the state-level north rhine-westphalia police trade union , said there was currently no proof that city officials had ignored security concerns .
in an interview with deutschlandfunk radio , richter placed the blame on the event 's organizers .
" i find it unacceptable that those who are responsible for this event , like the organizer -lsb- rainer schaller -rsb- , said in the press conference that there would just be no more love parades , as if he had nothing to do with this whole thing . "

the death toll now stands at 20 , and more than 500 people are still being treated for their injuries after panic broke out in a tunnel leading to the festival grounds on saturday afternoon .
duisburg mayor adolf sauerland , who defended what he called a " solid " security plan at a news conference on sunday and was pelted with rubbish by angry bystanders , has faced scathing criticism from several media outlets .
he resisted calls for his immediate resignation on monday and told public broadcaster wdr that he would address that issue when the time was right .
" i will be asking myself this question , there 's no doubt about that , " he said , adding that the main issue now was explaining saturday 's tragedy .
" and when we know what happened there , then we will answer this question .
that i promise . "
" if the city is guilty of anything then we will assume responsibility , " he said in a statement .
sauerland said a condolence book would remain available through the end of the month and that the city was working with church officials to plan a memorial service .
' consequences must be drawn urgently ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerland , right , has defended the city 's " solid " security plan on monday , german chancellor angela merkel said she expected a " scrupulously thorough " investigation into the tragedy , according to her spokesman ulrich wilhelm . " a full picture and a proper analysis of what happened and what mistakes were possibly made can however only be done once the investigation is completed , " he added . " consequences must be drawn urgently ...
i think it 's clear the security plans were not good , " said hannelore kraft , the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , in an interview on ard television . earlier monday , german prosecutors seized documents relating to the security planning of the event . rolf haferkamp , spokesman for the duisburg state prosecutors ' office , said he could not speak about the content of the numerous documents that were seized , but said the investigation of possible negligent manslaughter was ongoing . who 's to blame ? one theoretical explanation for the accident that quickly emerged in the press was that duisburg , a city in the former coal-mining ruhr region , was desperate to gain from the prestige of the love parade , and that city officials did not take security concerns seriously . the ruhr 2010 european capital of culture program has taken the lead in attracting such events and the program 's chief organizer , fritz pleitgen , said he felt " jointly responsible , but more in a moral sense . " " -lsb- the love parade -rsb- was offered to us as a project for the capital of culture program , " he told zdf public television .
" we accepted that , but we were not involved in financing or organizing the event . " the cologne-based daily newspaper koelner stadt-anzeiger also reported that the chief of the duisburg fire department told sauerland in writing that the location for the event - the city 's former freight rail station - was too small for the expected number of visitors . and the online edition of the news magazine der spiegel reported that an official document issued by the city of duisburg authorized only 250,000 people for the event - far short of the estimated 1.4 million who attended .
it also reportedly exempted the organizers from the minimal width of escape routes and from having fire brigade provisions .
bildunterschrift : organizers said the love parade would never take place again police unions point finger rainer wendt , head of the national police union , said police warnings about the dangers of holding the festival in duisburg were not heeded .
" i warned them a year ago that duisburg was not a suitable location for the love parade .
it 's too small and too cramped , " said wendt .
" but i was called a killjoy and a security fanatic . "
a report in the koelner stadt-anzeiger said that mayor sauerland gave the go-ahead for the event just hours before the start , despite concerns from police and fire officials .
however , frank richter , head of the state-level north rhine-westphalia police trade union , said there was currently no proof that city officials had ignored security concerns .
in an interview with deutschlandfunk radio , richter placed the blame on the event 's organizers .
" i find it unacceptable that those who are responsible for this event , like the organizer -lsb- rainer schaller -rsb- , said in the press conference that there would just be no more love parades , as if he had nothing to do with this whole thing . "

he was the head of the khmer rouge 's most important torture and execution centre known as s-21 . the un-backed tribunal on monday ruled that comrade duch , the former head of the khmer rouge 's torture and execution centre known as s-21 , is guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity . duch was sentenced to 35 years in jail , but will probably serve just 19 .
that is because he has already spent 11 years in jail awaiting trial .
he will get a discount of a further five years because he was held illegally without trial since his arrest in 1999 .
duch has 90 days in which to file an appeal . in the judgment the court said the offences duch perpetrated against at least 12,273 victims were " shocking and heinous " , adding that they warranted a lengthy jail term .
but presiding judge nil nonn , who read the verdict , said duch 's cooperation , acceptance of responsibility , and limited expressions of remorse were mitigating factors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist nuns and monks line up in front of the tribunal dismay over ruling the families of many of his victims condemned the sentence .
some were so distraught they left the court compound immediately after the verdict was delivered . theary seng , a cambodian-american lawyer who lost family members to the khmer rouge regime , said 19 years was simply insufficient for the scale and quantity of crimes duch had committed .
" that is not acceptable .
what is unacceptable is to envision him as a free man even for one minute in the public sphere , " she said . her anger was reflected by many , including two of s-21 's survivors – bou meng and chum mey , both of whom last year gave moving testimony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : s-21 survivor chum mey , right , outside the court hall theary seng said the 67-year-old defendant – a man with literally thousands of lives on his conscience – should have gone to jail for the rest of his life .
" fourteen thousand lives were lost there , and he should be receiving many life sentences . " horrors of s-21 duch 's nine-month trial , which ended in november , heard how s-21 prison was a place where every one of as many as 20,000 people sent there was deemed guilty of treason . no more than a dozen inmates survived , and that was solely because they were prisoners with skills duch deemed useful , such as painting portraits of the regime 's leader pol pot , or the ability to fix machines . s-21 's function was to torture suspected enemies of the revolution , extract confessions , and then kill them .
those implicated in the confessions would in turn be rounded up , and the cycle resumed .
duch 's signature was on thousands of execution orders , which contained the phrase ' smash them ' .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a khmer rouge victim weeps after the sentencing of duch importance of judgment heather ryan from the soros-funded open society justice initiative spent much of last year observing the trial , and was in court monday .
she acknowledged that aspects of the judgment were upsetting to surviving victims and the families of those who were murdered . but she said monday was important as it showed the cambodian people that those guilty of serious crimes did not have impunity .
" so all in all i feel satisfied and sort of inspired by what happened .
there are details that i think people will be unhappy with – particularly the reparations award for the victims . " that was a reference to the decision that ruled out almost every suggestion made by lawyers for the civil parties .
the lawyers said judges even rejected building a memorial inside the grounds of s-21 that would carry the name of every known victim of duch 's prison . although many people were angry and disappointed with what they see as a lenient verdict , it remains the case that duch now stands in a reviled group internationally .
importantly for cambodia , duch 's is the first conviction on international war crimes charges of any member of the khmer rouge regime that ruled the country between 1975 and 1979 leaving an estimated two million dead . as the cambodian prosecutor said afterwards , duch 's sentence provides legal recognition of the pain endured by the families of the victims and sends a message of hope to all cambodians for a better future . author : robert carmichael -lrb- phnom penh -rrb- editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the entrepreneur has become the obejct of public scrutiny . after a mass panic killed 19 people at the love parade techno music festival in duisburg on saturday , one of germany 's less conventional entrepreneurs has found himself in the public spotlight .
rainer schaller , who took over love parade in 2006 , owns a successful chain of fitness studios .
mcfit , as schaller 's chain is called , boasts prices as low as 16,90 euros per month .
it has 118 throughout germany , some 900,000 members , and a turnover of 134 million euros .
love parade was intended to serve as a marketing tool for the company , which plans to expand across europe .
41-year-old schaller 's success can in part be explained by his willingness to take risks .
according to the handelsblatt daily newspaper , schaller 's first fitness studio was an illegal operation which he kept amongst friends and operated in an attic above his parents ' supermarket outside of nuremberg .

he advertised the new mcfit studio as being " now also in wurzburg , " giving the impression that it was part of a large , successful chain .
unlike most fitness chains in germany , mcfit 's strategy is to offer a barebones gym with limited classes and training staff and no extra amenities such as saunas .
customers have around-the-clock access to the machines , but showers cost 50 cents extra .
the concept proved popular , and schaller opened his second studio in 1998 .
in 2008 , the chain recruited ukrainian celebrity boxers vladimir und vitali klitschko to represent it , and in 2009 it opened its first studios in austria and spain .
in 2009 , he told the handelsblatt newspaper that mcfit 's interest in love parade was to " use a relatively small budget to gain a high recognition factor .

the test now is whether it can perform to expectations . in early july 2010 the united nations -lrb- un -rrb- created a new entity for gender equality and the empowerment of women – to be known as un women .
it also adopted important resolutions aimed at improving the un organizations ' development cooperation .
the first you 've heard of it ?
that is a shame because these achievements show that the organization is capable of instituting reform and that multilateral action among 192 countries remains possible .
so what 's it all about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un chief ban ki-moon has come in for heavy criticism of his leadership recently un organizations like the development program -lrb- undp -rrb- , the children 's program -lrb- unicef -rrb- or the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- – to name but the three largest – are important multilateral actors .
they have a key role to play when it comes to implementing universally valid norms such as , for instance , human rights , gender equality and environmental standards .
along with their global , operative tasks they also contribute research studies to the development discourse -lrb- for example , the annual undp human development report -rrb- and engage in advocacy work on behalf of the most disadvantaged .
the fact that developing countries are involved on equal terms in the governance of un organizations means they are regarded as especially legitimate .
and that is why they are in a better position to engage in sensitive policy fields .
nevertheless , the un system is highly fragmented .
the numerous organizations often do not work well together , their fields of activity overlap and they ought to bring their individual strengths more to the fore .
these were the conclusions drawn in a report submitted by a high-level panel of experts in 2006 that recommended that the un should " deliver as one . "
the experts also felt that the un 's structures should be simplified , among other things in the fields of women and gender equality .
they recommended that the four institutions dealing with these issues should be combined to form a new organization in order to make them more visible and better able to assert themselves by bringing together resources and mandates .
slow process while western industrialized nations backed ideas to simplify un structures and to concentrate their areas of activity , some key developing countries and emerging economies regarded these plans with suspicion from the very outset .
in their eyes these steps would weaken the un , which on paper at least has a comprehensive mandate for economic and financial issues .
they feared that development policy would suffer further cuts in favor of the security agenda endorsed by the west , and emphasized that it was the un 's institutional and thematic variety that set it apart .
in view of their dissent as to the content of the majority of the experts ' suggestions , they insisted that the negotiations - and thus any possible compromises - should cover all issues .
the establishment of the new women 's organization , which many developing countries also backed , thus became dependent on consensus in other areas .
decisions , decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major developing nations are demanding a greater say in international affairs the most important decision that has been taken is that to establish un women .
the entity aims to be up and running by january 2011 .
its work will on the one hand be normative , that is it will continue developing existing international obligations and ensure they are observed and implemented across the world .
on the other hand , it will run operational programs for which it will have a budget of 500 million us dollars at its disposal .
other decisions are less spectacular but nevertheless important , namely those on improving the governance of the un development system , on harmonizing administrative procedures across the entire system , guaranteeing a reliable funding base in the future and in regard to an ongoing reform initiative in which the un family delivers as one in eight pilot countries .
reaching agreement the resolution was preceded by four years of negotiations .
it quickly became clear that no radical restructuring exercise would be possible , as consensus could only be reached on implementing successive small-scale reforms .
although the line of conflict traditionally ran between developing countries -lrb- g-77 -rrb- and industrialized nations , clear differences became apparent .
smaller , poorer countries like rwanda and tanzania as well as middle-income countries like vietnam and uruguay , in which bilateral development aid is gradually tapering off , have a particular interest in more coherent and effective cooperation with un organizations .
the positions adopted by a few ideologically- , motivated countries like cuba or emerging economies like india and egypt were primarily based on power politics and their attempts to prevent changes or achieve concessions .
the industrialized nations ' positions were more homogeneous .
during the very last phase of negotiations , however , the united states irritated the other countries by going it alone and making concessions on the new un women supervisory board .
ultimately , however , no-one wanted to stand in the way of the creation of an organization that had long been overdue .
what next ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 is losing ground to the g20 in terms of significance the resolution set an important milestone on the road to the reform of un development cooperation .
however , un women must now prove that it can be more than the sum of its individual parts .
appointing a well-known and authoritative personality from the south to the leadership position will play a key role when it comes to gaining acceptance for the organization 's work in developing countries , as well as for the generosity donor countries will now have to show .
despite the need to tighten budgetary belts , germany should contribute financially .
not only in order to increase its chances of being elected onto the security council in october 2010 , but also , in view of the recently announced cuts in contributions , to demonstrate that the un is still an important partner for germany .
the un remains an indispensable consensus-reaching and decision-making forum when it comes to pressing global challenges .

it also adopted important resolutions aimed at improving the un organizations ' development cooperation .
the first you 've heard of it ?
that is a shame because these achievements show that the organization is capable of instituting reform and that multilateral action among 192 countries remains possible .
so what 's it all about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un chief ban ki-moon has come in for heavy criticism of his leadership recently un organizations like the development program -lrb- undp -rrb- , the children 's program -lrb- unicef -rrb- or the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- – to name but the three largest – are important multilateral actors .

along with their global , operative tasks they also contribute research studies to the development discourse -lrb- for example , the annual undp human development report -rrb- and engage in advocacy work on behalf of the most disadvantaged .
the fact that developing countries are involved on equal terms in the governance of un organizations means they are regarded as especially legitimate .
and that is why they are in a better position to engage in sensitive policy fields .
nevertheless , the un system is highly fragmented .
the numerous organizations often do not work well together , their fields of activity overlap and they ought to bring their individual strengths more to the fore .
these were the conclusions drawn in a report submitted by a high-level panel of experts in 2006 that recommended that the un should " deliver as one . "
the experts also felt that the un 's structures should be simplified , among other things in the fields of women and gender equality .
they recommended that the four institutions dealing with these issues should be combined to form a new organization in order to make them more visible and better able to assert themselves by bringing together resources and mandates .
slow process while western industrialized nations backed ideas to simplify un structures and to concentrate their areas of activity , some key developing countries and emerging economies regarded these plans with suspicion from the very outset .
in their eyes these steps would weaken the un , which on paper at least has a comprehensive mandate for economic and financial issues .

in view of their dissent as to the content of the majority of the experts ' suggestions , they insisted that the negotiations - and thus any possible compromises - should cover all issues .
the establishment of the new women 's organization , which many developing countries also backed , thus became dependent on consensus in other areas .
decisions , decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major developing nations are demanding a greater say in international affairs the most important decision that has been taken is that to establish un women .
the entity aims to be up and running by january 2011 .
its work will on the one hand be normative , that is it will continue developing existing international obligations and ensure they are observed and implemented across the world .
on the other hand , it will run operational programs for which it will have a budget of 500 million us dollars at its disposal .
other decisions are less spectacular but nevertheless important , namely those on improving the governance of the un development system , on harmonizing administrative procedures across the entire system , guaranteeing a reliable funding base in the future and in regard to an ongoing reform initiative in which the un family delivers as one in eight pilot countries .
reaching agreement the resolution was preceded by four years of negotiations .
it quickly became clear that no radical restructuring exercise would be possible , as consensus could only be reached on implementing successive small-scale reforms .
although the line of conflict traditionally ran between developing countries -lrb- g-77 -rrb- and industrialized nations , clear differences became apparent .
smaller , poorer countries like rwanda and tanzania as well as middle-income countries like vietnam and uruguay , in which bilateral development aid is gradually tapering off , have a particular interest in more coherent and effective cooperation with un organizations .
the positions adopted by a few ideologically- , motivated countries like cuba or emerging economies like india and egypt were primarily based on power politics and their attempts to prevent changes or achieve concessions .
the industrialized nations ' positions were more homogeneous .
during the very last phase of negotiations , however , the united states irritated the other countries by going it alone and making concessions on the new un women supervisory board .
ultimately , however , no-one wanted to stand in the way of the creation of an organization that had long been overdue .
what next ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 is losing ground to the g20 in terms of significance the resolution set an important milestone on the road to the reform of un development cooperation .
however , un women must now prove that it can be more than the sum of its individual parts .
appointing a well-known and authoritative personality from the south to the leadership position will play a key role when it comes to gaining acceptance for the organization 's work in developing countries , as well as for the generosity donor countries will now have to show .
despite the need to tighten budgetary belts , germany should contribute financially .
not only in order to increase its chances of being elected onto the security council in october 2010 , but also , in view of the recently announced cuts in contributions , to demonstrate that the un is still an important partner for germany .
the un remains an indispensable consensus-reaching and decision-making forum when it comes to pressing global challenges .

he was the head of the khmer rouge 's most important torture and execution centre known as s-21 . the un-backed tribunal on monday ruled that comrade duch , the former head of the khmer rouge 's torture and execution centre known as s-21 , is guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity . duch was sentenced to 35 years in jail , but will probably serve just 19 .
that is because he has already spent 11 years in jail awaiting trial .
he will get a discount of a further five years because he was held illegally without trial since his arrest in 1999 .
duch has 90 days in which to file an appeal . in the judgment the court said the offences duch perpetrated against at least 12,273 victims were " shocking and heinous " , adding that they warranted a lengthy jail term .
but presiding judge nil nonn , who read the verdict , said duch 's cooperation , acceptance of responsibility , and limited expressions of remorse were mitigating factors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist nuns and monks line up in front of the tribunal dismay over ruling the families of many of his victims condemned the sentence .
some were so distraught they left the court compound immediately after the verdict was delivered . theary seng , a cambodian-american lawyer who lost family members to the khmer rouge regime , said 19 years was simply insufficient for the scale and quantity of crimes duch had committed .
" that is not acceptable .
what is unacceptable is to envision him as a free man even for one minute in the public sphere , " she said . her anger was reflected by many , including two of s-21 's survivors – bou meng and chum mey , both of whom last year gave moving testimony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : s-21 survivor chum mey , right , outside the court hall theary seng said the 67-year-old defendant – a man with literally thousands of lives on his conscience – should have gone to jail for the rest of his life .
" fourteen thousand lives were lost there , and he should be receiving many life sentences . " horrors of s-21 duch 's nine-month trial , which ended in november , heard how s-21 prison was a place where every one of as many as 20,000 people sent there was deemed guilty of treason . no more than a dozen inmates survived , and that was solely because they were prisoners with skills duch deemed useful , such as painting portraits of the regime 's leader pol pot , or the ability to fix machines . s-21 's function was to torture suspected enemies of the revolution , extract confessions , and then kill them .
those implicated in the confessions would in turn be rounded up , and the cycle resumed .
duch 's signature was on thousands of execution orders , which contained the phrase ' smash them ' .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a khmer rouge victim weeps after the sentencing of duch importance of judgment heather ryan from the soros-funded open society justice initiative spent much of last year observing the trial , and was in court monday .
she acknowledged that aspects of the judgment were upsetting to surviving victims and the families of those who were murdered . but she said monday was important as it showed the cambodian people that those guilty of serious crimes did not have impunity .
" so all in all i feel satisfied and sort of inspired by what happened .
there are details that i think people will be unhappy with – particularly the reparations award for the victims . " that was a reference to the decision that ruled out almost every suggestion made by lawyers for the civil parties .
the lawyers said judges even rejected building a memorial inside the grounds of s-21 that would carry the name of every known victim of duch 's prison . although many people were angry and disappointed with what they see as a lenient verdict , it remains the case that duch now stands in a reviled group internationally .
importantly for cambodia , duch 's is the first conviction on international war crimes charges of any member of the khmer rouge regime that ruled the country between 1975 and 1979 leaving an estimated two million dead . as the cambodian prosecutor said afterwards , duch 's sentence provides legal recognition of the pain endured by the families of the victims and sends a message of hope to all cambodians for a better future . author : robert carmichael -lrb- phnom penh -rrb- editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now the entrepreneur has become the obejct of public scrutiny . after a mass panic killed 19 people at the love parade techno music festival in duisburg on saturday , one of germany 's less conventional entrepreneurs has found himself in the public spotlight .
rainer schaller , who took over love parade in 2006 , owns a successful chain of fitness studios .
mcfit , as schaller 's chain is called , boasts prices as low as 16,90 euros per month .
it has 118 throughout germany , some 900,000 members , and a turnover of 134 million euros .
love parade was intended to serve as a marketing tool for the company , which plans to expand across europe .
41-year-old schaller 's success can in part be explained by his willingness to take risks .
according to the handelsblatt daily newspaper , schaller 's first fitness studio was an illegal operation which he kept amongst friends and operated in an attic above his parents ' supermarket outside of nuremberg .
he comes from a family of grocers who taught him the " mathematics and accounting " of running a business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 500 people were injured during the love parade mass panic self-made entrepreneur when schaller opened the first mcfit in wurzburg in 1997 , he did every job in the new business himself , from cleaning to training and administration tasks .
he advertised the new mcfit studio as being " now also in wurzburg , " giving the impression that it was part of a large , successful chain .
unlike most fitness chains in germany , mcfit 's strategy is to offer a barebones gym with limited classes and training staff and no extra amenities such as saunas .
customers have around-the-clock access to the machines , but showers cost 50 cents extra .
the concept proved popular , and schaller opened his second studio in 1998 .
in 2008 , the chain recruited ukrainian celebrity boxers vladimir und vitali klitschko to represent it , and in 2009 it opened its first studios in austria and spain .
in 2009 , he told the handelsblatt newspaper that mcfit 's interest in love parade was to " use a relatively small budget to gain a high recognition factor .
we spent a lot of time thinking about what kind of crazy thing we could do to make ourselves more well-known .
we chose love parade . "
condolences expressed schaller expressed his condolences at a press conference sunday , reading from a text and visibly upset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcfit was the main sponsor of the ill-fated love parade " the love parade was always a peaceful and joyous party that will now forever be overshadowed by yesterday 's tragic events .
out of respect for the victims , families and friends , we will discontinue the event .
the love parade is no more .
words are not enough to describe the extent of the shock i feel , " he said .
love parade was founded in 1989 by berlin dj matthias roeingh , also known as dr motte .
in some years it drew more than a million visitors , but planning and financing issues caused it to be cancelled in 2004 and 2005 .
the event was revived and relocated to the ruhr region in 2006 by lopavent , a schaller-owned company .
mcfit has sponsored it with 3 million euros per year ever since .

but on its 200th birthday , the future of the industry is now under threat . in 2001 , uk foreign secretary robin cook proclaimed chicken tikka masala , a lightly-spiced , creamy , tomato based stew a " true british national dish " .
the south asian curry has earned a lot of fans in britain .
annually , curry sales in britain are estimated at around 3.5 billion pounds .
but new government immigration rules introduced last week under the conservative-liberal coalition could spell the end of the local curry house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chicken tikka masala is very popular in britain the new immigration rule is a five-tier immigration system . it is similar to the australian system , where the visa applicants must have certain number of points to enter the country .
the points are ascertained by the applicants ' qualifications , their earning potential and their english speaking skills .
under this new system it would be difficult for unskilled foreign workers to get a visa . unemployment for thousands it would now be very hard to get foreign staff for these restaurants , as bajloor rashid , president of the bangladesh caterers association explains .
" at the moment we are not running at full capacity , " he says .
" for the last five years we have had an acute shortage of 30,000 skilled workers in our curry industry .
we have been lobbying the government for so long so that we can get more and more skilled staff from south asia .
and now the government is putting a cap on it .
so it will seriously damage our industry and there will be lot of job losses as well . " the curry industry relies on foreign cooks , mostly from bangladesh .
the bangladesh caterers association employs 100,000 people and has about 12,000 bangladeshi restaurants in britain .
rashid says cooking curry is a special art and one can not simply employ local staff in curry houses .
" there is a cultural barrier , " he says .
" when they work with bengali or hindi speaking people there is a language problem .
they can not take the curry smell as much as we can .
i mean we love curry and the smell of curry , but they think the smell of curry makes their clothes stink . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : typical spices used for curry protest against the move for years rashid and his organization have been arguing their case with the government .
" we are going to see the ministers soon to put our representation there .

how can they put a limitation ?
we are going to lobby the government as much as we can and make sure that the government does not go for that rule . " prof. christian dustmann , head of the center for research and analysis of migration in london , explains the motive behind the cap : " the uk had experienced a period of very high immigration in the years between 2003 and 2008 .
and the period of high immigration was at the same time a period of unprecedented economic growth .
over that period the uk grew by about 3 percent .
the uk has since then been through recession .
however when the uk comes out of recession then the existence of a cap may prove detrimental to expanding the industries and the uk economy .

but on its 200th birthday , the future of the industry is now under threat . in 2001 , uk foreign secretary robin cook proclaimed chicken tikka masala , a lightly-spiced , creamy , tomato based stew a " true british national dish " .
the south asian curry has earned a lot of fans in britain .
annually , curry sales in britain are estimated at around 3.5 billion pounds .
but new government immigration rules introduced last week under the conservative-liberal coalition could spell the end of the local curry house . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chicken tikka masala is very popular in britain the new immigration rule is a five-tier immigration system . it is similar to the australian system , where the visa applicants must have certain number of points to enter the country .
the points are ascertained by the applicants ' qualifications , their earning potential and their english speaking skills .
under this new system it would be difficult for unskilled foreign workers to get a visa . unemployment for thousands it would now be very hard to get foreign staff for these restaurants , as bajloor rashid , president of the bangladesh caterers association explains .
" at the moment we are not running at full capacity , " he says .
" for the last five years we have had an acute shortage of 30,000 skilled workers in our curry industry .
we have been lobbying the government for so long so that we can get more and more skilled staff from south asia .
and now the government is putting a cap on it .
so it will seriously damage our industry and there will be lot of job losses as well . " the curry industry relies on foreign cooks , mostly from bangladesh .
the bangladesh caterers association employs 100,000 people and has about 12,000 bangladeshi restaurants in britain .
rashid says cooking curry is a special art and one can not simply employ local staff in curry houses .
" there is a cultural barrier , " he says .
" when they work with bengali or hindi speaking people there is a language problem .
they can not take the curry smell as much as we can .
i mean we love curry and the smell of curry , but they think the smell of curry makes their clothes stink . "

he was the head of the khmer rouge 's most important torture and execution centre known as s-21 . the un-backed tribunal on monday ruled that comrade duch , the former head of the khmer rouge 's torture and execution centre known as s-21 , is guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity . duch was sentenced to 35 years in jail , but will probably serve just 19 .
that is because he has already spent 11 years in jail awaiting trial .
he will get a discount of a further five years because he was held illegally without trial since his arrest in 1999 .
duch has 90 days in which to file an appeal . in the judgment the court said the offences duch perpetrated against at least 12,273 victims were " shocking and heinous " , adding that they warranted a lengthy jail term .
but presiding judge nil nonn , who read the verdict , said duch 's cooperation , acceptance of responsibility , and limited expressions of remorse were mitigating factors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist nuns and monks line up in front of the tribunal dismay over ruling the families of many of his victims condemned the sentence .
some were so distraught they left the court compound immediately after the verdict was delivered . theary seng , a cambodian-american lawyer who lost family members to the khmer rouge regime , said 19 years was simply insufficient for the scale and quantity of crimes duch had committed .
" that is not acceptable .
what is unacceptable is to envision him as a free man even for one minute in the public sphere , " she said . her anger was reflected by many , including two of s-21 's survivors – bou meng and chum mey , both of whom last year gave moving testimony . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : s-21 survivor chum mey , right , outside the court hall theary seng said the 67-year-old defendant – a man with literally thousands of lives on his conscience – should have gone to jail for the rest of his life .
" fourteen thousand lives were lost there , and he should be receiving many life sentences . " horrors of s-21 duch 's nine-month trial , which ended in november , heard how s-21 prison was a place where every one of as many as 20,000 people sent there was deemed guilty of treason . no more than a dozen inmates survived , and that was solely because they were prisoners with skills duch deemed useful , such as painting portraits of the regime 's leader pol pot , or the ability to fix machines . s-21 's function was to torture suspected enemies of the revolution , extract confessions , and then kill them .

he was the head of the khmer rouge 's most important torture and execution centre known as s-21 . the un-backed tribunal on monday ruled that comrade duch , the former head of the khmer rouge 's torture and execution centre known as s-21 , is guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity . duch was sentenced to 35 years in jail , but will probably serve just 19 .
that is because he has already spent 11 years in jail awaiting trial .
he will get a discount of a further five years because he was held illegally without trial since his arrest in 1999 .
duch has 90 days in which to file an appeal . in the judgment the court said the offences duch perpetrated against at least 12,273 victims were " shocking and heinous " , adding that they warranted a lengthy jail term .
but presiding judge nil nonn , who read the verdict , said duch 's cooperation , acceptance of responsibility , and limited expressions of remorse were mitigating factors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist nuns and monks line up in front of the tribunal dismay over ruling the families of many of his victims condemned the sentence .

" that is not acceptable .

" fourteen thousand lives were lost there , and he should be receiving many life sentences . " horrors of s-21 duch 's nine-month trial , which ended in november , heard how s-21 prison was a place where every one of as many as 20,000 people sent there was deemed guilty of treason . no more than a dozen inmates survived , and that was solely because they were prisoners with skills duch deemed useful , such as painting portraits of the regime 's leader pol pot , or the ability to fix machines . s-21 's function was to torture suspected enemies of the revolution , extract confessions , and then kill them .

a team of experts at vall d 'hebron hospital in barcelona had carried out the transplant in late march . in a 24-hour-operation , the 31-year-old patient , identified only as oscar , received new facial muscles , skin , nose , lips , a jaw , teeth , a palate and cheekbones , according to the head of the medical team that carried out the procedure , joan pere barret .
barret said the man would now need between a year and 18 months of physical therapy and would regain up to 90 percent of his facial functions .
a new life " bit by bit he is improving but he nonetheless has a long and difficult road ahead to have intelligible speech like he had before , " barret added .
at the news conference , oscar spoke with considerable difficulty .
he was unable to breathe , swallow , talk normally or eat on his own after accidentally shooting himself in the face five years ago .
now , oscar is able to drink liquids and speak .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 26.07.2010 the war machine and freedom of thought großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speculation and rumors are rife in afghanistan the latest wikileaks revelations on afghanistan are not the first of their kind .
only a few months ago a leaked cia memo surfaced outlining strategies to boost german public support for the war in afghanistan . the red cell memorandum entitled " why counting on apathy might not be enough " cites the fragility of european support for the nato-led isaf mission and subsequently sets out clear proposals for the french and german governments to boost support among their respective populations .
in the case of germany the document suggests putting greater emphasis on the humanitarian aspects of the war and dramatizing the consequences of a nato defeat for specific german interests , such as exposure to terrorism , opium and refugees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ultimately it is up to the public to disseminate information for itself for france , it says the best way to proceed would be to highlight the message that isaf is of benefit to afghan citizens by paving the way for girls to get an education they could n't dream of under the taliban .
among other things .
to all intents and purposes , the paper reads like a public relations pitch , which as albert stahel of the strategic studies institute in zurich told deutsche welle , is essentially what it is .
" it 's a marketing concept , " he said .
" and the object of it is to manipulate the public , to sell them a product using a variety of different channels . "
eliminating the competition those channels , he says include important figures in the worlds of academia and media , middle men and journalists .
" you involve a journalist , you say we have some information for you , you hold a press conference , you invite 50 people and so on . "
positioning information is the name of the game , but christian tuschhoff , adjunct professor with the political science department of berlin 's free university , says that war pr is not only about selling an idea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : read all about it " the goal is a little bit more ambitious than that , " the political scientist told deutsche welle .
" it is not only to market a product but to eliminate the competition from the debate , to take control of the entire range of options being discussed by the public . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 26.07.2010 the war machine and freedom of thought großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speculation and rumors are rife in afghanistan the latest wikileaks revelations on afghanistan are not the first of their kind .
only a few months ago a leaked cia memo surfaced outlining strategies to boost german public support for the war in afghanistan . the red cell memorandum entitled " why counting on apathy might not be enough " cites the fragility of european support for the nato-led isaf mission and subsequently sets out clear proposals for the french and german governments to boost support among their respective populations .
in the case of germany the document suggests putting greater emphasis on the humanitarian aspects of the war and dramatizing the consequences of a nato defeat for specific german interests , such as exposure to terrorism , opium and refugees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ultimately it is up to the public to disseminate information for itself for france , it says the best way to proceed would be to highlight the message that isaf is of benefit to afghan citizens by paving the way for girls to get an education they could n't dream of under the taliban .
among other things .
to all intents and purposes , the paper reads like a public relations pitch , which as albert stahel of the strategic studies institute in zurich told deutsche welle , is essentially what it is .
" it 's a marketing concept , " he said .
" and the object of it is to manipulate the public , to sell them a product using a variety of different channels . "
eliminating the competition those channels , he says include important figures in the worlds of academia and media , middle men and journalists .
" you involve a journalist , you say we have some information for you , you hold a press conference , you invite 50 people and so on . "
positioning information is the name of the game , but christian tuschhoff , adjunct professor with the political science department of berlin 's free university , says that war pr is not only about selling an idea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : read all about it " the goal is a little bit more ambitious than that , " the political scientist told deutsche welle .
" it is not only to market a product but to eliminate the competition from the debate , to take control of the entire range of options being discussed by the public . "
that though , is ultimately very difficult to pull off , even for a government with a wealth of instruments for swaying public opinion at its disposal .
not least because the public actually helps to create the agenda by demonstrating a greater interest in one aspect of the war than another .
tragedy over strategy michael o 'hanlon is senior fellow in foreign policy at the brookings institution in new york and he says the german press , and thus the national public , has paid much more attention to the tragedies than the strategies of the afghanistan conflict .
" german media has its own tendencies , whether conscious or sub-conscious , they are telling a certain story and over-telling certain parts of the story at the expense of others . "
but tuschhoff says there is no objective truth to be told and disseminated to the public , but that people come to their own conclusions about what holds true .
" there may be parts of the arguments that are more present in one national debate than another , but the public has the right to establish what they want to discuss and what they want to ignore , it 's pretty much up to them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers at the coffin of a comrade killed in afghanistan and strategy , it seems is simply less important to the average german than certain other issues .
" germans are interested from a humanitarian perspective , " stahel said .
" the minds of the german people were transformed after the second world war and they have a strong pacifist feeling . "
transparency is key hence the cia recommendations to recruit afghan women to " serve as messengers in humanizing the isaf role in combating the taliban , " which tuschhoff says were out of place and will not be taken seriously by berlin .
" politicians are skilled at knowing what they should or should not transmit to their audience , " he said , adding that a foreign government or agency ca n't realistically take on that job because they do n't know what the german public is able to digest or reject or accept .
o 'hanlon agrees that the memo was off-key , not so much because it might have hit the wrong note with the european populations for whom it was intended , but because it is not transparent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and karl-theodor zu guttenberg : in tune with their public ?

tehran has condemned the measures but at the same time signalled it was willing to resume negotiations over its nuclear program . european union foreign ministers meeting in brussels monday have approved new sanctions on iran over its nuclear program .
in a surprise move , tehran shortly afterwards said it was prepared to return to negotiations without conditions , according to the country 's official news agency . at the heart of the sanctions is the concern that iran 's controversial uranium enrichment programme is not - as tehran claims - for civilian purpose , but rather intended to develop nuclear weapons . " today we sent quite a powerful message to iran that their nuclear programme is a cause for serious and growing concern to us , " the eu 's foreign policy chief , catherine ashton said . an obligation for transparency the new restrictions are likely to hit the backbone of iran 's economy - foreign trade , financial services and the oil and gas sector .
officials have described the measures as the toughest sanctions the european union has ever adopted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle said iran needs to comply with international calls for more transparency the measures are intended to block oil and gas investment and undermine tehran 's refining and natural gas capabilities .
they also ban the export to iran of dual-use goods that can be used both for civilian and military purposes . the sanctions will also further limit the activities of iranian trading banks and insurers , including restrictions on money transfers to iran . " of course iran has the right to use nuclear technology for civilian purposes , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle said . " but that also means that of course there is an obligation for transparency .
a nuclear armed iran is something that we can not accept . " iran prepared to resume talks iran has denounced the new sanctions as confrontational and said they would only further damage the already difficult relations with brussels . but tehran has at the same time signalled willingness to return to negotiations .
the country 's envoy to the iaea in vienna on monday suggested talks should be resumed . the eu 's catherine ashton welcomed the announcement but said she wanted to see the details first . " as far as i can see this is to be welcomed ... but we need to study the details , " she told reporters at a news briefing . the last high-level talks between iran and the six world powers – germany , britain , china , france , russia and the us – were held in geneva in october 2009 .

now the entrepreneur has become the obejct of public scrutiny . after a mass panic killed 19 people at the love parade techno music festival in duisburg on saturday , one of germany 's less conventional entrepreneurs has found himself in the public spotlight .
rainer schaller , who took over love parade in 2006 , owns a successful chain of fitness studios .
mcfit , as schaller 's chain is called , boasts prices as low as 16,90 euros per month .
it has 118 throughout germany , some 900,000 members , and a turnover of 134 million euros .
love parade was intended to serve as a marketing tool for the company , which plans to expand across europe .
41-year-old schaller 's success can in part be explained by his willingness to take risks .
according to the handelsblatt daily newspaper , schaller 's first fitness studio was an illegal operation which he kept amongst friends and operated in an attic above his parents ' supermarket outside of nuremberg .
he comes from a family of grocers who taught him the " mathematics and accounting " of running a business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 500 people were injured during the love parade mass panic self-made entrepreneur when schaller opened the first mcfit in wurzburg in 1997 , he did every job in the new business himself , from cleaning to training and administration tasks .
he advertised the new mcfit studio as being " now also in wurzburg , " giving the impression that it was part of a large , successful chain .
unlike most fitness chains in germany , mcfit 's strategy is to offer a barebones gym with limited classes and training staff and no extra amenities such as saunas .
customers have around-the-clock access to the machines , but showers cost 50 cents extra .
the concept proved popular , and schaller opened his second studio in 1998 .
in 2008 , the chain recruited ukrainian celebrity boxers vladimir und vitali klitschko to represent it , and in 2009 it opened its first studios in austria and spain .
in 2009 , he told the handelsblatt newspaper that mcfit 's interest in love parade was to " use a relatively small budget to gain a high recognition factor .
we spent a lot of time thinking about what kind of crazy thing we could do to make ourselves more well-known .
we chose love parade . "
condolences expressed schaller expressed his condolences at a press conference sunday , reading from a text and visibly upset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcfit was the main sponsor of the ill-fated love parade " the love parade was always a peaceful and joyous party that will now forever be overshadowed by yesterday 's tragic events .
out of respect for the victims , families and friends , we will discontinue the event .
the love parade is no more .
words are not enough to describe the extent of the shock i feel , " he said .
love parade was founded in 1989 by berlin dj matthias roeingh , also known as dr motte .
in some years it drew more than a million visitors , but planning and financing issues caused it to be cancelled in 2004 and 2005 .
the event was revived and relocated to the ruhr region in 2006 by lopavent , a schaller-owned company .
mcfit has sponsored it with 3 million euros per year ever since .

now the entrepreneur has become the obejct of public scrutiny . after a mass panic killed 19 people at the love parade techno music festival in duisburg on saturday , one of germany 's less conventional entrepreneurs has found himself in the public spotlight .
rainer schaller , who took over love parade in 2006 , owns a successful chain of fitness studios .
mcfit , as schaller 's chain is called , boasts prices as low as 16,90 euros per month .
it has 118 throughout germany , some 900,000 members , and a turnover of 134 million euros .
love parade was intended to serve as a marketing tool for the company , which plans to expand across europe .
41-year-old schaller 's success can in part be explained by his willingness to take risks .
according to the handelsblatt daily newspaper , schaller 's first fitness studio was an illegal operation which he kept amongst friends and operated in an attic above his parents ' supermarket outside of nuremberg .
he comes from a family of grocers who taught him the " mathematics and accounting " of running a business .

he advertised the new mcfit studio as being " now also in wurzburg , " giving the impression that it was part of a large , successful chain .
unlike most fitness chains in germany , mcfit 's strategy is to offer a barebones gym with limited classes and training staff and no extra amenities such as saunas .
customers have around-the-clock access to the machines , but showers cost 50 cents extra .
the concept proved popular , and schaller opened his second studio in 1998 .
in 2008 , the chain recruited ukrainian celebrity boxers vladimir und vitali klitschko to represent it , and in 2009 it opened its first studios in austria and spain .
in 2009 , he told the handelsblatt newspaper that mcfit 's interest in love parade was to " use a relatively small budget to gain a high recognition factor .
we spent a lot of time thinking about what kind of crazy thing we could do to make ourselves more well-known .
we chose love parade . "
condolences expressed schaller expressed his condolences at a press conference sunday , reading from a text and visibly upset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcfit was the main sponsor of the ill-fated love parade " the love parade was always a peaceful and joyous party that will now forever be overshadowed by yesterday 's tragic events .
out of respect for the victims , families and friends , we will discontinue the event .
the love parade is no more .
words are not enough to describe the extent of the shock i feel , " he said .
love parade was founded in 1989 by berlin dj matthias roeingh , also known as dr motte .
in some years it drew more than a million visitors , but planning and financing issues caused it to be cancelled in 2004 and 2005 .
the event was revived and relocated to the ruhr region in 2006 by lopavent , a schaller-owned company .
mcfit has sponsored it with 3 million euros per year ever since .

now the entrepreneur has become the obejct of public scrutiny . after a mass panic killed 19 people at the love parade techno music festival in duisburg on saturday , one of germany 's less conventional entrepreneurs has found himself in the public spotlight .
rainer schaller , who took over love parade in 2006 , owns a successful chain of fitness studios .
mcfit , as schaller 's chain is called , boasts prices as low as 16,90 euros per month .
it has 118 throughout germany , some 900,000 members , and a turnover of 134 million euros .
love parade was intended to serve as a marketing tool for the company , which plans to expand across europe .
41-year-old schaller 's success can in part be explained by his willingness to take risks .
according to the handelsblatt daily newspaper , schaller 's first fitness studio was an illegal operation which he kept amongst friends and operated in an attic above his parents ' supermarket outside of nuremberg .

he advertised the new mcfit studio as being " now also in wurzburg , " giving the impression that it was part of a large , successful chain .
unlike most fitness chains in germany , mcfit 's strategy is to offer a barebones gym with limited classes and training staff and no extra amenities such as saunas .
customers have around-the-clock access to the machines , but showers cost 50 cents extra .
the concept proved popular , and schaller opened his second studio in 1998 .
in 2008 , the chain recruited ukrainian celebrity boxers vladimir und vitali klitschko to represent it , and in 2009 it opened its first studios in austria and spain .
in 2009 , he told the handelsblatt newspaper that mcfit 's interest in love parade was to " use a relatively small budget to gain a high recognition factor .
we spent a lot of time thinking about what kind of crazy thing we could do to make ourselves more well-known .

but there are still security concerns and plans to investigate . the german defense ministry on monday criticized the leak of around 92,000 classified us military documents on the afghanistan war , but said the news value was rather limited .
the german news magazine spiegel as well as the new york times and the guardian newspapers at the weekend printed excerpts of the documents , which were released by the wikileaks website .
" obtaining and releasing documents , some of them secret , on such a scale is a highly questionable practice since it could affect the national security of nato allies and the whole nato mission , " defense ministry spokesman christian dienst said . " we 're in the process of analyzing the material so as to find out whether the security of our german troops on the ground is affected in any way . "
german foreign minister guido westerwelle also called for further scrutiny of the documents .
at an eu foreign ministers ’ meeting in brussels , westerwelle said the documents , which contain claims of concealed civilian casualties , had given him " comfort in my position , which consisted of never talking up the situation in afghanistan , which is exceptionally serious . "
attacks on the rise dienst confirmed that reports about a drastic increase of taliban attacks on allied troops were true .
he said that in the course of this year alone there had been close to 60 armed attacks on the german isaf contingent alone – almost triple the the figures available for 2007 and the years before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers are based largely in northern afghanistan wikileaks claimed that us and nato forces had increasingly been confined to reacting to the taleban 's operations and strategy rather than actively pursuing a policy of their own .
the joint leader of germany 's opposition green party , claudia roth , told the media on monday she did n't sense an often-cited new strategy of the allied forces in afghanistan at all .
killing a priority ?
" the wikileaks documents bear out just how dramatic the situation in afghanistan is , " roth said .
" but they also show the range of means the allies resort to in their fight for more stability . "
roth referred to classified documents highlighting the us special forces ' capture-and-kill operations , including manhunts where the killing of innocent people is seen as mere collateral damage .
according to the documents , 300 soldiers from the elite us 373 task force are located in the german camp at masar-i-sharif in the north of afghanistan .
their major task is the killing of high-ranking taliban leaders .
the sources available to wikileaks do not specify whether any german officers are involved in the planning or implementing of such targeted killings .
and the defense ministry in berlin was unwilling to shed any light on this issue .
" as far as the us task force is concerned , it 's in the nature of things that their operations remain secret , " christian dienst said .
" this means that only a very small circle of people is in the know about any details of these operations . "
everything said before ?
wikileaks knows that much of the information provided is not totally new .
but it claims it has got hold of the most comprehensive description of an armed conflict ever .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spiegel has looked into us special forces ' operations before wikileaks is a web platform which claims to be the first intelligence agency of the people .
since its founding in december 2006 it has called on potential whistleblowers from all over the world to make anonymous contributions and provide mostly classified information .
so far , people have sent about 1.2 million such documents to the web platform .
among wikileaks ' best-known scoops was the posting of a video depicting a us helicopter strike in baghdad in 2007 .
the footage showed how about a dozen civilians were gunned down , among them two employees from the reuters news agency .
in 2009 , the website first acquired international recognition when it published secret documents from a multinational shipping company , implicating the firm in toxic waste dumping in the ivory coast .

but this year ’ s love parade in duisburg ended in disaster , with 19 people killed and hundreds of others injured .
two days on , many questions are left unanswered . german prosecutors are continuing to look into allegations about lax safety measures at saturday 's love parade in duisburg , where 19 people died and hundreds of others were injured in a crush near a tunnel leading to the festival grounds .
survivors are demanding explanations for why security plans , described by duisburg mayor adolf sauerland as “ solid ” , went wrong .
only 250,000 visitors authorized bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors are asking why organizers said just hours before the event started that 1.4 million revelers were expected .
but in its online edition , the german magazine spiegel cites an internal document saying that the festival had authorization only for 250,000 visitors .
another newspaper , the koelner stadt-anzeiger , reports that the mayor had ignored written warnings in october 2009 saying the grounds were too narrow for the expected crowds .
the head of germany 's police union , rainer wendt , told the mass circulation newspaper bild that he warned authorities a year ago of duisburg 's unsuitability as a venue for the love parade , as the city was too small and narrow .
how many were there ?
but there are conflicting reports on how many people were actually in duisburg to visit the festival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former cargo train station : too small as a venue ?
police have so far only confirmed that 105,000 visitors arrived by train .
an official in charge of emergency response , wolfgang rabe , said the site , the former cargo train station , had a capacity of up to 300,000 people and that it was never full at any time during the event .
however , as the last three love parades , in berlin , essen and dortmund , have all had more than a million visitors , some argue that there was no reason to expect fewer this year .
who or whatever was to blame for the catastrophe , however , one thing seems certain : the love parade , which began in 1989 in berlin , has taken place for the last time .
organizer rainer schaller told a news conference in duisburg on sunday that the event would be discontinued out of respect for the victims , their families and friends .
but what will go on for a long time to come are questions about how such a tragedy could occur – and how to prevent something like it from ever happening again .

love parade tragedy news of the deaths at the love parade honestly made me sad .
i offer my condolences to chancellor merkel , her fellow germans and everyone else affected by the tragedy . - paul , us unfortunately the blame must lie with organizers , council and police and whoever signed off on an entrance via a huge tunnel .
surely the crowd could have been channelled far more easily via fencing through there than just letting them into the whole width of it - which meant people had nowhere to go .
if the entrance was actually at the other end of the tunnel , this would n't have happened once the venue filled up and the crowd could have been stopped before entering .
such a tragedy at an amazing event meant to celebrate music and peace . - simon , australia clearly the authorities are to blame for this tragedy .
it is they who have the expertise , the total authority and legal responsibility to decide if a festival venue is safe for the public to attend .
this is not within the expertise of commercial festival organizers .
the final decision is with city and police experts .
there is already ample evidence that the authorities were more interested in corralling the crowd into a small area , the usual state control freak mentality , than planning for crowd overflow and emergency exits and entrances .
it is a disgrace that parallels the inexcusable mistakes at duesseldorf airport 's fire where the rigid application of rules instead of common sense prevented the airport fire service from attending the fire and the subsequent loss of life .
no doubt the blame shall be pushed on to others as it was after duesseldorf , a hapless welder , there as i recall .
i speak with some authority as the uk is riddled with the same over-organized incompetence .
i hope heads roll over this disaster , resignations should be called for .
i was personally closer to this tragedy than was comfortable as my german son was at the festival but , upon seeing the potential for disaster given the mass overcrowding , decided to leave as thankfully did his friends .
in closing , i do not wish this to be vindictive of those involved , but hope with respect to all those people who lost their lives that we can learn from this tragedy to prevent its recurrence . - j. north , great britain i 'm a big fan of germany , but if an investigation is not launched into how a festival of 1 million in an open space that was held in berlin was transferred to a backwater that has experience of mostly classical music events and has a population of just 500,000 in a confined space that holds just 500,000 then germany will be deservedly a laughing stock .
germany needs to seriously question the city authorities that licensed this set up .
words fail me .
it 's not what we expect of germany at all .
to me it seems a disaster that was waiting to happen . - fergal barry via facebook it 's the organizers fault .
in 10 days the heavy metal event " wacken " will take place in wacken .
let 's hope they will organize it much better . - markus , via facebook from germany this is good that the investigation has started and i am sure that soon someone will be officially guilty .
but this is only the administration part .
we all need to ask ourselves : who will bring back the people who are dead now ?
i would like to send my appeal to all organizers for such events , please take this case in seriously and do not let it happen again . - mesar via facebook i think it 's the fault of the organizers and the people as well .
they should n't have used a tunnel for letting thousands of people through it , and people do not know when to stop pushing when they are moving forward in large groups .
people get trapped in a closed space , start panicking , and thus , the result .
wacken is much better organized because it 's at an open space , if something happens people can simply jump over the fences , and they 're off .

love parade tragedy news of the deaths at the love parade honestly made me sad .
i offer my condolences to chancellor merkel , her fellow germans and everyone else affected by the tragedy . - paul , us unfortunately the blame must lie with organizers , council and police and whoever signed off on an entrance via a huge tunnel .
surely the crowd could have been channelled far more easily via fencing through there than just letting them into the whole width of it - which meant people had nowhere to go .
if the entrance was actually at the other end of the tunnel , this would n't have happened once the venue filled up and the crowd could have been stopped before entering .
such a tragedy at an amazing event meant to celebrate music and peace . - simon , australia clearly the authorities are to blame for this tragedy .
it is they who have the expertise , the total authority and legal responsibility to decide if a festival venue is safe for the public to attend .
this is not within the expertise of commercial festival organizers .
the final decision is with city and police experts .
there is already ample evidence that the authorities were more interested in corralling the crowd into a small area , the usual state control freak mentality , than planning for crowd overflow and emergency exits and entrances .
it is a disgrace that parallels the inexcusable mistakes at duesseldorf airport 's fire where the rigid application of rules instead of common sense prevented the airport fire service from attending the fire and the subsequent loss of life .
no doubt the blame shall be pushed on to others as it was after duesseldorf , a hapless welder , there as i recall .
i speak with some authority as the uk is riddled with the same over-organized incompetence .
i hope heads roll over this disaster , resignations should be called for .
i was personally closer to this tragedy than was comfortable as my german son was at the festival but , upon seeing the potential for disaster given the mass overcrowding , decided to leave as thankfully did his friends .
in closing , i do not wish this to be vindictive of those involved , but hope with respect to all those people who lost their lives that we can learn from this tragedy to prevent its recurrence . - j. north , great britain i 'm a big fan of germany , but if an investigation is not launched into how a festival of 1 million in an open space that was held in berlin was transferred to a backwater that has experience of mostly classical music events and has a population of just 500,000 in a confined space that holds just 500,000 then germany will be deservedly a laughing stock .
germany needs to seriously question the city authorities that licensed this set up .
words fail me .
it 's not what we expect of germany at all .
to me it seems a disaster that was waiting to happen . - fergal barry via facebook it 's the organizers fault .
in 10 days the heavy metal event " wacken " will take place in wacken .
let 's hope they will organize it much better . - markus , via facebook from germany this is good that the investigation has started and i am sure that soon someone will be officially guilty .
but this is only the administration part .
we all need to ask ourselves : who will bring back the people who are dead now ?
i would like to send my appeal to all organizers for such events , please take this case in seriously and do not let it happen again . - mesar via facebook i think it 's the fault of the organizers and the people as well .
they should n't have used a tunnel for letting thousands of people through it , and people do not know when to stop pushing when they are moving forward in large groups .
people get trapped in a closed space , start panicking , and thus , the result .
wacken is much better organized because it 's at an open space , if something happens people can simply jump over the fences , and they 're off .

these were the conclusions drawn in a report submitted by a high-level panel of experts in 2006 that recommended that the un should " deliver as one . "
the experts also felt that the un 's structures should be simplified , among other things in the fields of women and gender equality .

so much so , the organisers of the 2010 event have been able to increase the number of runners for this year 's race , which will be held on yorkshire day , sunday 1 august .
an extra 3,000 people will be taking part bringing the total number of entrants to 8,000 .
events like this are becoming more and more popular , due to the legacy of inspirational people like jane tomlinson .
the events themselves are all about the individuals taking part and their personal stories .
jane tomlinson died in 2007 after a long battle with cancer .
during her illness she raised millions for charity .
jane 's appeal , the charity she established , organises the successful annual leeds run and in 2009 held the first one in york .
jane 's husband , mike tomlinson , says york was an obvious location for them to add a second run : " jane was very fond of york , our daughter rebecca is a student there and it 's a place we visited frequently .
logistically it was easier for us to set up an event somewhere in yorkshire . "
the inaugural york run took place on sunday 2 august 2009 , starting and finishing at york 's knavesmire , with the participants travelling through the city centre .
the charities involved in the york run in 2010 are jane 's appeal ; martin house children 's hospice ; macmillan cancer support ; sparks , the children 's medical research charity ; and coco , the international healthcare and education charity set up by steve cram .
many runners also raise money for a charity of their choice .
