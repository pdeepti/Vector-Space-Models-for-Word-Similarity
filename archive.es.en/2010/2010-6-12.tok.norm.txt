authorities think it is sometimes better for small children to remain with their mothers , in special prison wards . in frankfurt 's women 's prison , a brightly colored building in the middle of the grounds is somewhat different to the rest of the jail .
although still surrounded by a meter-high barbed-wire fence , this center is the mother-and-child wing of the prison .
in the german penal system , it is often thought better for children under three years old to stay with their mothers in prison , rather than being put into foster care .
however , facilities like the one in frankfurt are not available nationwide and are often in high demand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids live in the cells too educator klaus hermes is in charge of the mother-and-child ward of frankfurt prison .
they only take children under three years old , as it is thought that after this age , kids should not grow up behind bars .
" the goal is to avoid the separation of mother and child , " hermes said .
working closely with the local child protection agency , hermes examines each case individually while the mothers - or mothers-to-be - are still in pre-trial detention , that is before they has yet been convicted and a jail term pronounced .
if a mother has a drug habit or is doing a lifetime stretch in prison , children are automatically put into foster care .

martina - whose name we have changed to protect her identity - is serving a nine-year sentence for attempted murder .
her son , damien , was born in custody , and both mother and child were given a place in the ward , sharing a cell .
the jail nursery teachers ensure that damien gets to know the world beyond his barred windows , taking him shopping and on outings .
it 's hard for damien 's mother .
" all his first life experiences he has not done with me , " she said .
" i was n't with him for his first time in a swimming pool or his first trip to the zoo . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beatrix deinhard has worked in the jail for 19 years beatrix deinhard has been a nursery teacher in the frankfurt women 's prison for 19 years .
she knows how hard it is for incarcerated mothers to leave their children with another person .
and over time it gets worse .
" as children get older , the gap between their childhood experiences and what their mothers miss grows bigger , " deinhard said .
visits to the doctor in hospital are a prime example of when it is difficult for the children to leave their mothers .
" the children often cry , and then it is really hard for the mothers to let go of the children , " she said .
an element of normality in the special ward , the mothers can play , paint and sing with their children and have access to the educational assistants in the facility .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playtime in prison aims to be as normal as possible beatrix deinhard argues that when mothers maintain a good relationship with the staff , the children can develop normally and " it does them no harm . "
" when there is a problem , i think it comes from an external environment , from where the mother and child come from , " deinhard said .
she adds that the system works so long as the children do not get " too old . "
for martina , she is acutely aware that as her son grows up he becomes more inquisitive about his surroundings .
she has often tried to explain to him why they live in the prison .
" but then he asks , if you were naughty and sent to prison , does that mean i was naughty too ? " she said .
it is questions like these that weigh heavily on martina 's shoulders .
however , she is now pinning her hopes on being granted early release in three years and finally getting to spend time with her son beyond the prison walls .

authorities think it is sometimes better for small children to remain with their mothers , in special prison wards . in frankfurt 's women 's prison , a brightly colored building in the middle of the grounds is somewhat different to the rest of the jail .
although still surrounded by a meter-high barbed-wire fence , this center is the mother-and-child wing of the prison .

they only take children under three years old , as it is thought that after this age , kids should not grow up behind bars .
" the goal is to avoid the separation of mother and child , " hermes said .
working closely with the local child protection agency , hermes examines each case individually while the mothers - or mothers-to-be - are still in pre-trial detention , that is before they has yet been convicted and a jail term pronounced .

her son , damien , was born in custody , and both mother and child were given a place in the ward , sharing a cell .
the jail nursery teachers ensure that damien gets to know the world beyond his barred windows , taking him shopping and on outings .

visits to the doctor in hospital are a prime example of when it is difficult for the children to leave their mothers .
" the children often cry , and then it is really hard for the mothers to let go of the children , " she said .

it is questions like these that weigh heavily on martina 's shoulders .

" the goal is to avoid the separation of mother and child , " hermes said .
working closely with the local child protection agency , hermes examines each case individually while the mothers - or mothers-to-be - are still in pre-trial detention , that is before they has yet been convicted and a jail term pronounced .

her son , damien , was born in custody , and both mother and child were given a place in the ward , sharing a cell .
the jail nursery teachers ensure that damien gets to know the world beyond his barred windows , taking him shopping and on outings .

for martina , she is acutely aware that as her son grows up he becomes more inquisitive about his surroundings .
she has often tried to explain to him why they live in the prison .
" but then he asks , if you were naughty and sent to prison , does that mean i was naughty too ? " she said .
it is questions like these that weigh heavily on martina 's shoulders .

authorities think it is sometimes better for small children to remain with their mothers , in special prison wards . in frankfurt 's women 's prison , a brightly colored building in the middle of the grounds is somewhat different to the rest of the jail .
although still surrounded by a meter-high barbed-wire fence , this center is the mother-and-child wing of the prison .
in the german penal system , it is often thought better for children under three years old to stay with their mothers in prison , rather than being put into foster care .
however , facilities like the one in frankfurt are not available nationwide and are often in high demand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids live in the cells too educator klaus hermes is in charge of the mother-and-child ward of frankfurt prison .
they only take children under three years old , as it is thought that after this age , kids should not grow up behind bars .
" the goal is to avoid the separation of mother and child , " hermes said .
working closely with the local child protection agency , hermes examines each case individually while the mothers - or mothers-to-be - are still in pre-trial detention , that is before they has yet been convicted and a jail term pronounced .
if a mother has a drug habit or is doing a lifetime stretch in prison , children are automatically put into foster care .
martina and damien bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt prison has catered for mothers and children for years for one 27-year-old woman , the special ward means she gets to see her son grow and develop despite living behind bars .
martina - whose name we have changed to protect her identity - is serving a nine-year sentence for attempted murder .
her son , damien , was born in custody , and both mother and child were given a place in the ward , sharing a cell .
the jail nursery teachers ensure that damien gets to know the world beyond his barred windows , taking him shopping and on outings .
it 's hard for damien 's mother .
" all his first life experiences he has not done with me , " she said .
" i was n't with him for his first time in a swimming pool or his first trip to the zoo . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beatrix deinhard has worked in the jail for 19 years beatrix deinhard has been a nursery teacher in the frankfurt women 's prison for 19 years .
she knows how hard it is for incarcerated mothers to leave their children with another person .
and over time it gets worse .
" as children get older , the gap between their childhood experiences and what their mothers miss grows bigger , " deinhard said .
visits to the doctor in hospital are a prime example of when it is difficult for the children to leave their mothers .
" the children often cry , and then it is really hard for the mothers to let go of the children , " she said .
an element of normality in the special ward , the mothers can play , paint and sing with their children and have access to the educational assistants in the facility .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 12.06.2010 capello 's world cup debut shows signs of progress but also fallibility großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capello was stoic before the game - but that soon changed england coach fabio capello 's reputation for discipline , organization and preparation is well known in european soccer .
on saturday night , he applied his skills to the world cup for the first time with mixed results . for all the glittering prizes accrued over a career spent as the head coach of clubs such as real madrid , ac milan and juventus , this was capello 's first taste of the world cup as coach . as a no-nonsense midfielder , the italian played at the 1974 tournament , but the clash against the united states in the royal bafokeng stadium in rustenburg on saturday night was the highly decorated coach 's international baptism of fire . despite this , one would have been hard-pressed to find evidence of the combined pressure of this new experience plus the almost insurmountable expectation of a nation renowned for its lack of perspective at moments like these .
capello surveyed the scene before kick-off with his usual measured stare , his expression immovable on a granite face framed by severe spectacles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian 's stern manner is legendary once the action was underway , capello showed the other side of his nature .
he may be a tactical perfectionist and disciplinarian but he is a football man at heart .
passion and emotion are as much part of his approach to the game as cool-headed logic and preparation .
as such , it did n't take long for the craggy features to become animated once the match was underway . when steven gerrard opened the scoring on five minutes , capello was suddenly out of his seat , yelling and throwing his arms about – not in celebration but in anger at aaron lennon who had strayed out of his midfield corridor during the build-up to the goal .
as the england bench pumped the air , the italian was cursing the lack of discipline . however , when england managed to ride out a period of us pressure and mop up a dangerous situation , the pragmatic capello was quick to applaud his players , presumably because they had carried out his defensive requirements to the letter .
he was less pleased ten minutes later when onyewu put a clear header just wide with glen johnson and ledley king static . deployment of milner , green and king backfires bildunterschrift : fabio capello 's selection of green as england 's no.1 will be questioned after the keeper 's howler capello 's deployment of the more defensive-minded james milner ahead of the attacking joe cole in left midfield had seemed wise at first despite the aston villa winger missing training over the past few days with a fever .
the idea being that milner would assist ashley cole in stopping the threat of landon donovan . he was n't up to it .
skinned down the touchline time and again by us and hanover 96 fullback steve cherundolo , milner picked up an early yellow card and looked somehow sickly .
he made way for shaun wright-phillips after half an hour .
capello had taken a risk and it had backfired . wayne rooney was also playing in too deep a role , despite the inclusion of emile heskey , the man who was supposed to be the provider for the smaller england striker .
a stickler for players following instructions , rooney 's midfield meandering prompted no outburst from the italian , suggesting he had sanctioned such movement .
again , a strange decision . another might have been the inclusion of robert green in goal .
the keeper 's horrendous mistake for the equalizer prompted a death-stare from his coach which probably singed the eyebrows of the hapless green .
substitute keepers joe hart and david james may not have been alone in silently questioning capello 's choice for no.1. half-time grilling and reorganization reawakens england capello was far from happy with his side going into the break .
a number of times his face was overtaken by a look of horror as his intricate plans fell to pieces at the feet of his charges .
england were not passing well or creating any chances as the americans grew in confidence after their goal .
at some point capello put his hands over his eyes like a five-year old in front of scary tv show . since taking over the england job , the italian has been exposed as a half-time ranter and it is likely that the paint on the dressing room walls was peeling during the break .
while robert green may have been the obvious target , no one was safe after a poor half . capello did ring the changes but jamie carragher replaced ledley king because of the latter 's problematic knees , not his performance .
and yet this could be read as another admittance of miscalculation on the coach 's part .
it was certainly a risk to play king in the first place .
the tottenham defender has famously been unable to train before games for the past two years and can not play more than one match a week – something capello was well aware of when bringing him to south africa . bildunterschrift : wayne rooney played far too deep to start with and was isolated when he finally led the attack the coach rectified his somewhat bafflingly deep deployment of rooney once the game restarted with the england striker once more leading the line .
but with the rest of the team spending too much time building attacks from deep , rooney was often left to chase long , hopeful balls with no support . thinking on his feet , capello searches for breakthrough as the game wore on and england 's frustration became clearer , capello tried to reorganize and reiterate his instructions calmly ; keeping his head while all around him his players were losing theirs .
the effect was a positive one as england regained a modicum of composure as their coach prowled the technical area directing the white shirts in their search for a winner .
capello was back to showing his strengths , pushing the team further up the pitch and getting them to play a pressing game . however , as the clock ticked down and heskey made way for the towering peter crouch , the old england was suddenly back with high balls hit towards a target man .
such tactics smacked of desperation - something alien to capello 's way . in the end , even the great italian organizer could n't get a result out of his england side .
more than anyone he will want to do better in the next match - and he will demand a whole lot more from his players . author : nick amies editor : nicole goebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's unclear whether the suspect will be extradited to germany . the german federal prosecutor 's office confirmed on saturday that polish authorities arrested an alleged mossad spy from israel wanted in connection with a hamas agent slaying in dubai .
" he was arrested in warsaw and is suspected of being involved in illegally obtaining a -lrb- german -rrb- passport , " a spokesman for the office said , confirming a report in the german news magazine , der spiegel .
" it 's now up to the poles to decide if they are going to hand him over to germany , " he added .
according to the spiegel article published on monday , the suspect using the name uri brodsky was arrested in early june upon arrival at warsaw 's airport on suspicions of working for mossad in germany helping to issue a fake german passport to the operation .
mahmud al-mabhuh , a founder of the military wing of the islamist hamas movement , was found dead in his room in a hotel near the dubai airport on january 20 .
british , irish , french , australian , and german passports were used by 26 people believed to be linked to the murder , according to dubai police .
the issue caused a diplomatic row in which the five countries whose passports were used called in israeli envoys for talks .

this comes as the opposition is turning up the heat on merkel 's coalition government . in the german cities of berlin and stuttgart , around 25,000 demonstrators marched through the streets to voice disapproval of the federal government 's recently announced austerity package , which consists of cuts primarily in the social-welfare and family-services sectors .
the march was organized by trade unions and left-wing opposition groups under the motto : " this is not social justice . "
police estimated that up 10,000 marched in the southwestern city of stuttgart while organizers in berlin said between 15,000 and 20,000 people took to the streets there .
protesters carried banners saying " the crisis is called capitalism " and " employment , human rights , a secure future for everyone . "
in the face of widespread criticism of the austerity measures which are supposed to bring germany 's deficit within european union limits by 2013 , chancellor angela merkel rejected charges that the country 's poor were being unfairly burdened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is getting heat from all sides over her budget-cutting plans " people must realize that we have to save money and reduce debt , " merkel said in an interview to be published on sunday in the mass-circulation bild am sonntag weekly , adding that the " measures in the job sector aim to bring significantly more long-term unemployed back to work than in the past . "
she added that the package - which looks to slash federal spending by at least 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 96 billion -rrb- by 2014 - was evenly distributed throughout the country 's sectors .
" alongside the necessary cuts in the social-welfare budget , business is also making a contribution along with the civil-service and administrative departments , " she said .
but a new poll by infratest dimap showed that 79 percent of germans thought the savings package was not socially balanced and 93 percent thought measures were not enough to meet the government 's savings goal .
opposition demands snap elections germany 's opposition , led by the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , intensified its criticism of merkel 's center-right coalition , with spd parliamentary leader frank-walter steinmeier even calling for snap elections on saturday .
" this government is a failure and once they accept it , the tidiest solution would be a snap general election , " steinmeier told the daily bild newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's social democrats demand snap elections steinmeier said the government was in " deep crisis " and accused merkel of trying to hold on to power at all costs . " i 'm worried that this government will simply try to muddle through , " he said . the former foreign minister was referring to the politically uncertain situation germany finds itself in following the surprise resignation of president horst koehler , also a member of merkel 's christian democrats , last month .
political analysts in germany are calling it critical for merkel 's government to have her candidate , lower saxony state premier christian wulff , chosen as president , which in itself is a largely ceremonial post .
an electoral college is set to meet at the end of the month to decide between wulff and the opposition 's candidate , joachim gauck , a widely respected figure .

i 've made mistakes before .
i 'm strong enough to get through this .

i was pleased for him , " said the italian . " we had lots of chances in the game .
there were a lot of positives .
just the result was n't positive . " usa coach bob bradley , on the other hand , had reasons to be cheerful .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 12.06.2010 nato summit ends with recognition of progress - and need for more trainers - in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen said training will be an important part of future missions the nato defense alliance finished its latest summit in brussels knowing that it needs more military staff who can train afghan security forces .
but how is it going to provide them ? defense ministers wrapping up a two-day nato summit in brussels welcomed improvements in the security situation in afghanistan , but also acknowledged the need for member countries to provide more military trainers to work with afghan troops .
" we welcomed the significant improvement in the capability of the afghan national security forces , and are committed to providing the trainers needed to support that steady progress , " ministers said in a joint declaration on friday .
but the ministers did n't commit to offering specific numbers of troops .
the nato-led international security assistance force includes about 120,000 soldiers from 28 nato member states - including germany - and another 18 allies .
but the training mission lacks about 20 percent of the personnel it needs - a shortfall of 450 trainers .
in february , the german parliament voted to send up to 850 troops in addition to the 4,300 already there .
it also agreed to send extra police trainers and to increase the proportion of troops focusing on training from 280 to 1,400 .
an expanding role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany recently agreed to increase its number of police trainers nato 's secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , told reporters that training would likely play a growing role in the defense alliance 's future missions .
" it 's quite a new thing for nato allies to engage in such training missions ...
we have to adapt our alliance to this new task to train and educate local forces in a country like afghanistan , and i think we will deal with this aspect in the new strategic concept , " rasmussen said after the talks .
rasmussen said that allies were ready to help , but stymied by a lack of qualified officers who could do the training .
in the defense ministers final statement , they hailed " measured progress " in the nine-year war while noting that " significant challenges remain , and success is not yet assured . "
" operations across afghanistan are making measured progress in extending the reach of the afghan government , changing the political conditions , and marginalizing the insurgency , " the ministers said in a statement .

by unleashing lionel messi , maradona may turn a chaotic sideshow into a title challenge . it was hardly surprising that many of the 50,000 pairs of eyes at the ellis park stadium in johannesburg were fixed on diego maradona before the match between argentina and nigeria kicked-off on saturday afternoon .
here was a man who is seen by some as not only being larger than life but bigger than the game he so clearly adores , such is his legendary status as a world cup-winning player of unquestionable talent .
but as soon as the whistle went , the short , rotund man in the sober suit – grey to match the signs of age in his beard – seemed to purposefully diminish , as much as someone like diego maradona can .
the argentina coach remained visible for most of the game ; pacing his technical area at times , standing thoughtfully at others .
when gabriel heinze headed the only goal of the game to give argentina victory , maradona was mobbed by his coaching staff and substitutes alike but he refused to draw attention to himself with wild celebrations of his own .
this was not the maradona many were expecting .
in the run-up to the great man 's first shot at winning the world cup as a coach , it seemed that whatever the albiceleste achieved in south africa , the story would always be about diego .
many said he wanted it that way .
it was even suggested that maradona was so self-obsessed and egotistical that he would even tactically hobble the world 's best player in an effort to keep his legacy intact .
it was suggested that he would rather sacrifice lionel messi and argentina 's chances of glory than let his own standing in the annals of soccer history be eclipsed .
the freedom to perform bildunterschrift : in the formation maradona chose for the nigeria match , messi was allowed the freedom to run riot maradona 's tactics and formation on saturday put such conspiracies to bed .
messi was given the freedom of the park and played in his preferred role as part of an attacking trio alongside carlos tevez and gonzalo higuain .
as his strike partners ran the channels , messi floated , he probed , he went off on those mazy runs which tie defenders in knots .
this was not a player shackled by his coach 's ego .
there had been concerns that the little magician would be forced to chase and carry in a congested midfield , creating openings for others rather than carving them out for himself as he does so destructively for barcelona .
if this was maradona letting his ego get in the way , heaven help the opposition when he gets a bout of selfishness .
it was n't all perfect , however .
messi showed signs of a long season fighting on all fronts for the spanish champions and spurned a number of chances .
it was rumoured before the world cup began that he was running on empty and that , when given the world 's biggest stage to perform on , there would be no fuel left in the tank .
there were moments when it looked like the game would n't come to life for him .
ready to take center stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's icons finally look to be on the same page argentina 's no.10 looked a little off the pace at times and his final ball and shooting were not as clinical as observers have come to expect .
but as the game went on , messi 's influence grew and his artistry became hard to ignore .
by the end of the game , he was darting around , evading tackles and poking shots just inches wide in a way that suggested that he could even grow in strength and confidence as the tournament progresses , not grind to a halt .
messi was unleashed , unhindered and seemed to be having a whale of a time .
every time he got the ball something happened .
even though his performance deserved the goal which never came , it was a display that bodes well for argentina and the two little men at the heart of this surprisingly close-knit and confident squad .
even if the claims that maradona is so egotistical that he would sabotage his own country 's chance of glory were n't so outlandish that they should be rejected by the sane-minded , the fact that he has effectively given messi the canvas on which to create a masterpiece with his formation and tactics should put away those fears for good .
by giving messi the role he excels in and allowing him the freedom to do what he does best , maradona is not creating a threat to his own legacy but providing it with the best opportunity to be further enhanced .
maradona could be the coach who got the best out of lionel messi in the biggest soccer tournament on earth , adding a world cup winner 's medal as a coach to the one he collected as a player in the process .

it 's unclear whether the suspect will be extradited to germany . the german federal prosecutor 's office confirmed on saturday that polish authorities arrested an alleged mossad spy from israel wanted in connection with a hamas agent slaying in dubai .
" he was arrested in warsaw and is suspected of being involved in illegally obtaining a -lrb- german -rrb- passport , " a spokesman for the office said , confirming a report in the german news magazine , der spiegel .

mahmud al-mabhuh , a founder of the military wing of the islamist hamas movement , was found dead in his room in a hotel near the dubai airport on january 20 .

but as soon as the whistle went , the short , rotund man in the sober suit – grey to match the signs of age in his beard – seemed to purposefully diminish , as much as someone like diego maradona can .
the argentina coach remained visible for most of the game ; pacing his technical area at times , standing thoughtfully at others .
when gabriel heinze headed the only goal of the game to give argentina victory , maradona was mobbed by his coaching staff and substitutes alike but he refused to draw attention to himself with wild celebrations of his own .
this was not the maradona many were expecting .
in the run-up to the great man 's first shot at winning the world cup as a coach , it seemed that whatever the albiceleste achieved in south africa , the story would always be about diego .
many said he wanted it that way .
it was even suggested that maradona was so self-obsessed and egotistical that he would even tactically hobble the world 's best player in an effort to keep his legacy intact .
it was suggested that he would rather sacrifice lionel messi and argentina 's chances of glory than let his own standing in the annals of soccer history be eclipsed .
the freedom to perform bildunterschrift : in the formation maradona chose for the nigeria match , messi was allowed the freedom to run riot maradona 's tactics and formation on saturday put such conspiracies to bed .
messi was given the freedom of the park and played in his preferred role as part of an attacking trio alongside carlos tevez and gonzalo higuain .
as his strike partners ran the channels , messi floated , he probed , he went off on those mazy runs which tie defenders in knots .
this was not a player shackled by his coach 's ego .
there had been concerns that the little magician would be forced to chase and carry in a congested midfield , creating openings for others rather than carving them out for himself as he does so destructively for barcelona .
if this was maradona letting his ego get in the way , heaven help the opposition when he gets a bout of selfishness .
it was n't all perfect , however .
messi showed signs of a long season fighting on all fronts for the spanish champions and spurned a number of chances .
it was rumoured before the world cup began that he was running on empty and that , when given the world 's biggest stage to perform on , there would be no fuel left in the tank .
there were moments when it looked like the game would n't come to life for him .
ready to take center stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's icons finally look to be on the same page argentina 's no.10 looked a little off the pace at times and his final ball and shooting were not as clinical as observers have come to expect .
but as the game went on , messi 's influence grew and his artistry became hard to ignore .
by the end of the game , he was darting around , evading tackles and poking shots just inches wide in a way that suggested that he could even grow in strength and confidence as the tournament progresses , not grind to a halt .
messi was unleashed , unhindered and seemed to be having a whale of a time .
every time he got the ball something happened .
even though his performance deserved the goal which never came , it was a display that bodes well for argentina and the two little men at the heart of this surprisingly close-knit and confident squad .
even if the claims that maradona is so egotistical that he would sabotage his own country 's chance of glory were n't so outlandish that they should be rejected by the sane-minded , the fact that he has effectively given messi the canvas on which to create a masterpiece with his formation and tactics should put away those fears for good .
by giving messi the role he excels in and allowing him the freedom to do what he does best , maradona is not creating a threat to his own legacy but providing it with the best opportunity to be further enhanced .
maradona could be the coach who got the best out of lionel messi in the biggest soccer tournament on earth , adding a world cup winner 's medal as a coach to the one he collected as a player in the process .

but how is it going to provide them ? defense ministers wrapping up a two-day nato summit in brussels welcomed improvements in the security situation in afghanistan , but also acknowledged the need for member countries to provide more military trainers to work with afghan troops .
" we welcomed the significant improvement in the capability of the afghan national security forces , and are committed to providing the trainers needed to support that steady progress , " ministers said in a joint declaration on friday .
but the ministers did n't commit to offering specific numbers of troops .
the nato-led international security assistance force includes about 120,000 soldiers from 28 nato member states - including germany - and another 18 allies .
but the training mission lacks about 20 percent of the personnel it needs - a shortfall of 450 trainers .
in february , the german parliament voted to send up to 850 troops in addition to the 4,300 already there .
it also agreed to send extra police trainers and to increase the proportion of troops focusing on training from 280 to 1,400 .
an expanding role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany recently agreed to increase its number of police trainers nato 's secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , told reporters that training would likely play a growing role in the defense alliance 's future missions .
" it 's quite a new thing for nato allies to engage in such training missions ...
we have to adapt our alliance to this new task to train and educate local forces in a country like afghanistan , and i think we will deal with this aspect in the new strategic concept , " rasmussen said after the talks .
rasmussen said that allies were ready to help , but stymied by a lack of qualified officers who could do the training .
in the defense ministers final statement , they hailed " measured progress " in the nine-year war while noting that " significant challenges remain , and success is not yet assured . "
" operations across afghanistan are making measured progress in extending the reach of the afghan government , changing the political conditions , and marginalizing the insurgency , " the ministers said in a statement .

but if defense minister guttenberg has his way , the military draft could be scrapped altogether . germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , is currently debating a proposal to decrease the length of mandatory military service from nine to six months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg 's ministry has to come up with a strategy to save about 4 billion euros the proposal is among a raft of austerity measures put forward by chancellor angela merkel 's coalition cabinet , as the government seeks to tackle the country 's massive budget deficit . defense minister karl-theodor zu gutenberg wants to go a step further : he has proposed ending military conscription altogether , saying it is important to consider all options as the german government searches for more ways to save money . his ministry alone needs to cut about 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.8 billion -rrb- in costs . reluctance to end a ' tradition ' the opposition social democrats have opposed the move , saying it would destroy the country 's post-war tradition of the " citizens in uniform . " but even in the governing coalition , not everybody agrees with the defense minister , who is a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister-party to merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . the leader of the cdu 's parliamentary group has called for compulsory military service to be maintained . volker kauder told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper that it was " the instrument to link society and the bundeswehr . " " we 've experienced on a number of occasions in our history what can result if this bond is no longer there , " he said , adding that what mattered was that the bundeswehr was able to fulfill its mission . bildunterschrift : germany is seeking to save 10 billion euros -lrb- over $ 12 billion -rrb- every year from 2011 to 2016 plans for massive troop reduction ? meanwhile , the frankfurter rundschau newspaper reported that the defense ministry plans have for a long time been based on a total scrapping of compulsory military service and a massive troop reduction . according to the report , no new recruits are to be conscripted starting next year .
in addition , plans had been drawn up to get rid of 40,000 of the bundeswehr 's 251,000 professional and regular soldiers by 2014 . the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , junior partners in the governing coalition , have urged guttenberg to take a speedy decision on the abolition of conscription . " there should be clarity about the bundeswehr 's future before the next conscription deadline on october 1 , " the party 's defense policy spokesperson , elke hoff , told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper . she also stressed that cutting the number of regular and professional soldiers only made sense if conscription was suspended at the same time . the bundestag is expected to pass a bill on an amendment to the conscription law as early as next week .
the draft bill provides for compulsory military service of six months instead of the present nine months for all conscripts from july 1 . those opting for community instead of military service are expected to be allowed to extend their duty voluntarily by a further three months . the debate over whether to continue the post-war tradition of conscription comes as the bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan is becoming increasingly unpopular at home . more than 4,000 german troops are currently stationed in afghanistan . rb / afp / epd / dpa / kna editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" german politicians have expressed consternation at a racist outburst by the central bank 's board member and former berlin senator , thilo sarrazin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin drew flak for disparaging remarks about turkish and arab communities sarrazin was quoted by german media as telling a gathering of businessmen on thursday , june 10 , that germany was " becoming on average more stupid " because " turkish , near and middle eastern and african " immigrants were poorly educated . " there is an increase in population groups with different levels of intelligence , " the 65-year-old was quoted as saying .
" intelligence is passed on from parents to children .
it is about 80 percent hereditary . " chancellor angela merkel told the bild am sonntag newspaper that such sweeping statements were " stupid and pointless . " she conceded , however , that it was true that the academic qualifications of pupils from immigrant communities needed to be improved , adding that the key to that was " mastering the german language . " " if we promoted and demanded that , then those coming to live in germany would have great opportunities and they would enrich our lives , " merkel said . criticism across party lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 3 million people of turkish origin live in germany the leader of the opposition green pary , claudia roth , also criticized sarrazin . “ i wonder how much longer the bundesbank is prepared to tolerate such an agitator and right-wing populist on its board , ” she told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper . roth said that for the bundesbank – one of the country 's most important public institutions – having a leading member with such an attitude was untenable . she also said the opposition social democratic party – of which sarrazin is a member – must also ask themselves whether and how long they were ready to accept him in their own ranks . a prominent spd member , michael mueller , has meanwhile said that “ the renewed provocation by sarrazin was without question intolerable . ”
he said sarrazin had already been warned to restrain himself but that he had apparently not learnt his lesson . not the first time the banker caused a row last year after he made disparaging remarks in a magazine interview about berlin 's large turkish and arab communities . sarrazin had to apologize for saying that many of berlin 's arab and turkish immigrants have " no production , apart from fruit and vegetable trading . " meanwhile , the bundesbank has distanced itself from sarrazin 's remarks . " the opinions expressed were personal , " said susanne kreutzer , spokeswoman for the bundesbank .
" we can not comment . " the central bank 's president axel weber said last year that the bank 's reputation had been hurt by sarrazin 's remarks . rb / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's unclear whether the suspect will be extradited to germany . the german federal prosecutor 's office confirmed on saturday that polish authorities arrested an alleged mossad spy from israel wanted in connection with a hamas agent slaying in dubai .
" he was arrested in warsaw and is suspected of being involved in illegally obtaining a -lrb- german -rrb- passport , " a spokesman for the office said , confirming a report in the german news magazine , der spiegel .
" it 's now up to the poles to decide if they are going to hand him over to germany , " he added .
according to the spiegel article published on monday , the suspect using the name uri brodsky was arrested in early june upon arrival at warsaw 's airport on suspicions of working for mossad in germany helping to issue a fake german passport to the operation .
mahmud al-mabhuh , a founder of the military wing of the islamist hamas movement , was found dead in his room in a hotel near the dubai airport on january 20 .
british , irish , french , australian , and german passports were used by 26 people believed to be linked to the murder , according to dubai police .
the issue caused a diplomatic row in which the five countries whose passports were used called in israeli envoys for talks .

the kremlin , however , says it wo n't send troops for now . kyrgyzstan 's provisional government appealed on saturday to neigboring russia for help in containing the escalating ethnic violence in the south of the country , after at least 80 people were killed and around 1,000 injured since friday .
" we need military support in order to get the escalating situation in the south under control , " interim president roza otunbayeva said in the capital bishkek , according to the country 's akipress agency .
the government declared state of emergency for the city of jalal-abad and surrounding areas on saturday , after having already declared a state of emergency for osh , kyrgyzstan 's second-largest city , where the rampages have been taking place since thursday .
the request was for peacekeeping forces which could come from several countries , otunbayeva said , adding that the " dynamics of events " in the region permitted no other solution . violence between kyrgyz and uzbeks has escalated into running street battles , which prompted the government to impose a curfew .
cars were smashed and burned , and buildings set on fire .
kremlin hesitant to send forces otunbayeva said she had contacted both russian premier vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev to ask for support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the initial response out of moscow , however , was that the kremlin would not send the forces otunbayeva requested .
medvedev 's spokeswoman natalya timakova said saturday that russia would offer " humanitarian assistance " and that it would " help evacuate those wounded in osh . "
but she said that russia would n't immediately send its own troops to kyrgyzstan , because the requisite conditions were n't met for military involvement .
" this is an internal conflict and russia does not yet see the conditions for its participating in resolving it , " timakhova said .
a decision to dispatch peacekeepers could be taken only after consultations with the united nations , she added .
timakova said that moscow would hold consultations on monday with regional nations on the possibility of sending its peacekeepers to kyrgyzstan .
since last april 's uprising , which ousted president kurmanbek bakiyev , foreign leaders have warned of the possibility of civil war in the impoverished , but strategically important state , which hosts both us and russian military bases .
the us government on saturday called for " rapid restoration of peace and public order " and said it supported efforts by the un and europe to help quell the violence .
the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said on friday it was ready to help resolve the conflict .

the kremlin , however , says it wo n't send troops for now . kyrgyzstan 's provisional government appealed on saturday to neigboring russia for help in containing the escalating ethnic violence in the south of the country , after at least 80 people were killed and around 1,000 injured since friday .
" we need military support in order to get the escalating situation in the south under control , " interim president roza otunbayeva said in the capital bishkek , according to the country 's akipress agency .
the government declared state of emergency for the city of jalal-abad and surrounding areas on saturday , after having already declared a state of emergency for osh , kyrgyzstan 's second-largest city , where the rampages have been taking place since thursday .
the request was for peacekeeping forces which could come from several countries , otunbayeva said , adding that the " dynamics of events " in the region permitted no other solution . violence between kyrgyz and uzbeks has escalated into running street battles , which prompted the government to impose a curfew .
cars were smashed and burned , and buildings set on fire .

medvedev 's spokeswoman natalya timakova said saturday that russia would offer " humanitarian assistance " and that it would " help evacuate those wounded in osh . "
but she said that russia would n't immediately send its own troops to kyrgyzstan , because the requisite conditions were n't met for military involvement .
" this is an internal conflict and russia does not yet see the conditions for its participating in resolving it , " timakhova said .
a decision to dispatch peacekeepers could be taken only after consultations with the united nations , she added .
timakova said that moscow would hold consultations on monday with regional nations on the possibility of sending its peacekeepers to kyrgyzstan .
since last april 's uprising , which ousted president kurmanbek bakiyev , foreign leaders have warned of the possibility of civil war in the impoverished , but strategically important state , which hosts both us and russian military bases .
the us government on saturday called for " rapid restoration of peace and public order " and said it supported efforts by the un and europe to help quell the violence .
the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said on friday it was ready to help resolve the conflict .

but if defense minister guttenberg has his way , the military draft could be scrapped altogether . germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , is currently debating a proposal to decrease the length of mandatory military service from nine to six months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg 's ministry has to come up with a strategy to save about 4 billion euros the proposal is among a raft of austerity measures put forward by chancellor angela merkel 's coalition cabinet , as the government seeks to tackle the country 's massive budget deficit . defense minister karl-theodor zu gutenberg wants to go a step further : he has proposed ending military conscription altogether , saying it is important to consider all options as the german government searches for more ways to save money . his ministry alone needs to cut about 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.8 billion -rrb- in costs . reluctance to end a ' tradition ' the opposition social democrats have opposed the move , saying it would destroy the country 's post-war tradition of the " citizens in uniform . " but even in the governing coalition , not everybody agrees with the defense minister , who is a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister-party to merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . the leader of the cdu 's parliamentary group has called for compulsory military service to be maintained . volker kauder told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper that it was " the instrument to link society and the bundeswehr . " " we 've experienced on a number of occasions in our history what can result if this bond is no longer there , " he said , adding that what mattered was that the bundeswehr was able to fulfill its mission . bildunterschrift : germany is seeking to save 10 billion euros -lrb- over $ 12 billion -rrb- every year from 2011 to 2016 plans for massive troop reduction ? meanwhile , the frankfurter rundschau newspaper reported that the defense ministry plans have for a long time been based on a total scrapping of compulsory military service and a massive troop reduction . according to the report , no new recruits are to be conscripted starting next year .
in addition , plans had been drawn up to get rid of 40,000 of the bundeswehr 's 251,000 professional and regular soldiers by 2014 . the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , junior partners in the governing coalition , have urged guttenberg to take a speedy decision on the abolition of conscription . " there should be clarity about the bundeswehr 's future before the next conscription deadline on october 1 , " the party 's defense policy spokesperson , elke hoff , told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper . she also stressed that cutting the number of regular and professional soldiers only made sense if conscription was suspended at the same time . the bundestag is expected to pass a bill on an amendment to the conscription law as early as next week .
the draft bill provides for compulsory military service of six months instead of the present nine months for all conscripts from july 1 . those opting for community instead of military service are expected to be allowed to extend their duty voluntarily by a further three months . the debate over whether to continue the post-war tradition of conscription comes as the bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan is becoming increasingly unpopular at home . more than 4,000 german troops are currently stationed in afghanistan . rb / afp / epd / dpa / kna editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rather than offering artistic fictions , it presents alternative perspectives on reality . the berlin biennale , which opened on friday , june 11 , is taking place for the sixth time this year since its founding in 1996 .
it showcases top names like mark boulos -lrb- us -rrb- , phil collins -lrb- uk -rrb- , marcus geiger -lrb- switzerland -rrb- , nilbar gures -lrb- turkey -rrb- and michael schmidt -lrb- germany -rrb- . curator kathrin rhomberg of vienna delves into the relationship between art and reality , with this year 's show offering a heavy dose of reality .
rhomberg was responsible moving the biennale from its previous location in berlin 's trendy and expensive center to the rougher kreuzberg district . " kreuzberg is an interesting place because since the fifties , it has been largely shaped by working migrants and the consequences of the migration have become visible in many ways and have found an interesting coexistence with the so-called social majority , " said rhomberg .
" seen in this way , kreuzberg is an area that represents the european societies of the future . " bildunterschrift : petrit halilaj made a model of the house his family built after the kosovo war art versus reality for the berlin biennale , kreuzberg 's typical mixture of turkish immigrants , young left-wingers , students , academics and unemployed persons could itself practically serve as an exhibition in the festival under the motto " what 's waiting outside . "
rhomberg aims to show how current art reacts to the present world , with all its upheavals , terrorist attacks , migration , war and financial and environmental crises .
young kosovar artist petrit halilaj managed to capture this theme particularly well .
he created an authentic-looking copy of the frame of the house that his family built after the end of the kosovo war . " it is also a project for the future , because the family home was destroyed in the yugoslavian war , with all the traumas and migration stories that are connected to this , " said rhomberg .
" -lsb- halilaj -rsb- is now building a house in pristina that has no history and is future-oriented , and he has brought the insulation lumber to berlin to build a kind of negative of his family house . " family ties many of the works uncover the human relationship to the urban landscape .
algerian artist mohamed bourouissa , for example , shows a side of paris ' poor suburbs that does n't turn up in the news , while photographer minerva cuevas collects examples of political resistance in her native mexico . the theme of family ties also runs through the exhibition , including a film by artist anna witt , who convinced her mother to re-enact her birth .
the artist plays herself in the short video . bildunterschrift : anna witt and her mother re-enacted her birth it was berlin 's lack of an exhibition venue for contemporary art that led klaus biesenbach to found the biennale in 1996 .
biesenbach is credited with having a strong instinct for new trends , which allowed him to position the biennale firmly on the international art scene .
he is now the director of the p.s.1 contemporary art center in new york . it is still important to maintain this artistic outlet in berlin , said biesenbach . " it has attracted international interest ; 800 accreditations on the press conference day .
they are reporting on it everywhere .
i believe it has a lot of influential strength and is the start of many careers . " visitors can view the berlin biennale through august 8 , 2010 .

" german politicians have expressed consternation at a racist outburst by the central bank 's board member and former berlin senator , thilo sarrazin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin drew flak for disparaging remarks about turkish and arab communities sarrazin was quoted by german media as telling a gathering of businessmen on thursday , june 10 , that germany was " becoming on average more stupid " because " turkish , near and middle eastern and african " immigrants were poorly educated . " there is an increase in population groups with different levels of intelligence , " the 65-year-old was quoted as saying .
" intelligence is passed on from parents to children .
it is about 80 percent hereditary . " chancellor angela merkel told the bild am sonntag newspaper that such sweeping statements were " stupid and pointless . " she conceded , however , that it was true that the academic qualifications of pupils from immigrant communities needed to be improved , adding that the key to that was " mastering the german language . " " if we promoted and demanded that , then those coming to live in germany would have great opportunities and they would enrich our lives , " merkel said . criticism across party lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 3 million people of turkish origin live in germany the leader of the opposition green pary , claudia roth , also criticized sarrazin . “ i wonder how much longer the bundesbank is prepared to tolerate such an agitator and right-wing populist on its board , ” she told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper . roth said that for the bundesbank – one of the country 's most important public institutions – having a leading member with such an attitude was untenable . she also said the opposition social democratic party – of which sarrazin is a member – must also ask themselves whether and how long they were ready to accept him in their own ranks . a prominent spd member , michael mueller , has meanwhile said that “ the renewed provocation by sarrazin was without question intolerable . ”
he said sarrazin had already been warned to restrain himself but that he had apparently not learnt his lesson . not the first time the banker caused a row last year after he made disparaging remarks in a magazine interview about berlin 's large turkish and arab communities . sarrazin had to apologize for saying that many of berlin 's arab and turkish immigrants have " no production , apart from fruit and vegetable trading . " meanwhile , the bundesbank has distanced itself from sarrazin 's remarks . " the opinions expressed were personal , " said susanne kreutzer , spokeswoman for the bundesbank .
" we can not comment . " the central bank 's president axel weber said last year that the bank 's reputation had been hurt by sarrazin 's remarks . rb / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the kremlin , however , says it wo n't send troops for now . kyrgyzstan 's provisional government appealed on saturday to neigboring russia for help in containing the escalating ethnic violence in the south of the country , after at least 80 people were killed and around 1,000 injured since friday .
" we need military support in order to get the escalating situation in the south under control , " interim president roza otunbayeva said in the capital bishkek , according to the country 's akipress agency .
the government declared state of emergency for the city of jalal-abad and surrounding areas on saturday , after having already declared a state of emergency for osh , kyrgyzstan 's second-largest city , where the rampages have been taking place since thursday .
the request was for peacekeeping forces which could come from several countries , otunbayeva said , adding that the " dynamics of events " in the region permitted no other solution . violence between kyrgyz and uzbeks has escalated into running street battles , which prompted the government to impose a curfew .
cars were smashed and burned , and buildings set on fire .
kremlin hesitant to send forces otunbayeva said she had contacted both russian premier vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev to ask for support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the initial response out of moscow , however , was that the kremlin would not send the forces otunbayeva requested .
medvedev 's spokeswoman natalya timakova said saturday that russia would offer " humanitarian assistance " and that it would " help evacuate those wounded in osh . "
but she said that russia would n't immediately send its own troops to kyrgyzstan , because the requisite conditions were n't met for military involvement .
" this is an internal conflict and russia does not yet see the conditions for its participating in resolving it , " timakhova said .
a decision to dispatch peacekeepers could be taken only after consultations with the united nations , she added .
timakova said that moscow would hold consultations on monday with regional nations on the possibility of sending its peacekeepers to kyrgyzstan .
since last april 's uprising , which ousted president kurmanbek bakiyev , foreign leaders have warned of the possibility of civil war in the impoverished , but strategically important state , which hosts both us and russian military bases .
the us government on saturday called for " rapid restoration of peace and public order " and said it supported efforts by the un and europe to help quell the violence .
the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said on friday it was ready to help resolve the conflict .

but how is it going to provide them ? defense ministers wrapping up a two-day nato summit in brussels welcomed improvements in the security situation in afghanistan , but also acknowledged the need for member countries to provide more military trainers to work with afghan troops .
" we welcomed the significant improvement in the capability of the afghan national security forces , and are committed to providing the trainers needed to support that steady progress , " ministers said in a joint declaration on friday .
but the ministers did n't commit to offering specific numbers of troops .
the nato-led international security assistance force includes about 120,000 soldiers from 28 nato member states - including germany - and another 18 allies .
but the training mission lacks about 20 percent of the personnel it needs - a shortfall of 450 trainers .
in february , the german parliament voted to send up to 850 troops in addition to the 4,300 already there .
it also agreed to send extra police trainers and to increase the proportion of troops focusing on training from 280 to 1,400 .
an expanding role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany recently agreed to increase its number of police trainers nato 's secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , told reporters that training would likely play a growing role in the defense alliance 's future missions .
" it 's quite a new thing for nato allies to engage in such training missions ...
we have to adapt our alliance to this new task to train and educate local forces in a country like afghanistan , and i think we will deal with this aspect in the new strategic concept , " rasmussen said after the talks .
rasmussen said that allies were ready to help , but stymied by a lack of qualified officers who could do the training .
in the defense ministers final statement , they hailed " measured progress " in the nine-year war while noting that " significant challenges remain , and success is not yet assured . "
" operations across afghanistan are making measured progress in extending the reach of the afghan government , changing the political conditions , and marginalizing the insurgency , " the ministers said in a statement .

on saturday night , he applied his skills to the world cup for the first time with mixed results . for all the glittering prizes accrued over a career spent as the head coach of clubs such as real madrid , ac milan and juventus , this was capello 's first taste of the world cup as coach . as a no-nonsense midfielder , the italian played at the 1974 tournament , but the clash against the united states in the royal bafokeng stadium in rustenburg on saturday night was the highly decorated coach 's international baptism of fire . despite this , one would have been hard-pressed to find evidence of the combined pressure of this new experience plus the almost insurmountable expectation of a nation renowned for its lack of perspective at moments like these .

as such , it did n't take long for the craggy features to become animated once the match was underway . when steven gerrard opened the scoring on five minutes , capello was suddenly out of his seat , yelling and throwing his arms about – not in celebration but in anger at aaron lennon who had strayed out of his midfield corridor during the build-up to the goal .
as the england bench pumped the air , the italian was cursing the lack of discipline . however , when england managed to ride out a period of us pressure and mop up a dangerous situation , the pragmatic capello was quick to applaud his players , presumably because they had carried out his defensive requirements to the letter .
he was less pleased ten minutes later when onyewu put a clear header just wide with glen johnson and ledley king static . deployment of milner , green and king backfires bildunterschrift : fabio capello 's selection of green as england 's no.1 will be questioned after the keeper 's howler capello 's deployment of the more defensive-minded james milner ahead of the attacking joe cole in left midfield had seemed wise at first despite the aston villa winger missing training over the past few days with a fever .

skinned down the touchline time and again by us and hanover 96 fullback steve cherundolo , milner picked up an early yellow card and looked somehow sickly .
he made way for shaun wright-phillips after half an hour .
capello had taken a risk and it had backfired . wayne rooney was also playing in too deep a role , despite the inclusion of emile heskey , the man who was supposed to be the provider for the smaller england striker .
a stickler for players following instructions , rooney 's midfield meandering prompted no outburst from the italian , suggesting he had sanctioned such movement .

but with the rest of the team spending too much time building attacks from deep , rooney was often left to chase long , hopeful balls with no support . thinking on his feet , capello searches for breakthrough as the game wore on and england 's frustration became clearer , capello tried to reorganize and reiterate his instructions calmly ; keeping his head while all around him his players were losing theirs .
the effect was a positive one as england regained a modicum of composure as their coach prowled the technical area directing the white shirts in their search for a winner .
capello was back to showing his strengths , pushing the team further up the pitch and getting them to play a pressing game . however , as the clock ticked down and heskey made way for the towering peter crouch , the old england was suddenly back with high balls hit towards a target man .
such tactics smacked of desperation - something alien to capello 's way . in the end , even the great italian organizer could n't get a result out of his england side .
more than anyone he will want to do better in the next match - and he will demand a whole lot more from his players . author : nick amies editor : nicole goebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by unleashing lionel messi , maradona may turn a chaotic sideshow into a title challenge . it was hardly surprising that many of the 50,000 pairs of eyes at the ellis park stadium in johannesburg were fixed on diego maradona before the match between argentina and nigeria kicked-off on saturday afternoon .
here was a man who is seen by some as not only being larger than life but bigger than the game he so clearly adores , such is his legendary status as a world cup-winning player of unquestionable talent .
but as soon as the whistle went , the short , rotund man in the sober suit – grey to match the signs of age in his beard – seemed to purposefully diminish , as much as someone like diego maradona can .
the argentina coach remained visible for most of the game ; pacing his technical area at times , standing thoughtfully at others .
when gabriel heinze headed the only goal of the game to give argentina victory , maradona was mobbed by his coaching staff and substitutes alike but he refused to draw attention to himself with wild celebrations of his own .
this was not the maradona many were expecting .
in the run-up to the great man 's first shot at winning the world cup as a coach , it seemed that whatever the albiceleste achieved in south africa , the story would always be about diego .
many said he wanted it that way .
it was even suggested that maradona was so self-obsessed and egotistical that he would even tactically hobble the world 's best player in an effort to keep his legacy intact .
it was suggested that he would rather sacrifice lionel messi and argentina 's chances of glory than let his own standing in the annals of soccer history be eclipsed .
the freedom to perform bildunterschrift : in the formation maradona chose for the nigeria match , messi was allowed the freedom to run riot maradona 's tactics and formation on saturday put such conspiracies to bed .
messi was given the freedom of the park and played in his preferred role as part of an attacking trio alongside carlos tevez and gonzalo higuain .
as his strike partners ran the channels , messi floated , he probed , he went off on those mazy runs which tie defenders in knots .
this was not a player shackled by his coach 's ego .
there had been concerns that the little magician would be forced to chase and carry in a congested midfield , creating openings for others rather than carving them out for himself as he does so destructively for barcelona .
if this was maradona letting his ego get in the way , heaven help the opposition when he gets a bout of selfishness .
it was n't all perfect , however .
messi showed signs of a long season fighting on all fronts for the spanish champions and spurned a number of chances .
it was rumoured before the world cup began that he was running on empty and that , when given the world 's biggest stage to perform on , there would be no fuel left in the tank .
there were moments when it looked like the game would n't come to life for him .
ready to take center stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's icons finally look to be on the same page argentina 's no.10 looked a little off the pace at times and his final ball and shooting were not as clinical as observers have come to expect .
but as the game went on , messi 's influence grew and his artistry became hard to ignore .
by the end of the game , he was darting around , evading tackles and poking shots just inches wide in a way that suggested that he could even grow in strength and confidence as the tournament progresses , not grind to a halt .
messi was unleashed , unhindered and seemed to be having a whale of a time .
every time he got the ball something happened .
even though his performance deserved the goal which never came , it was a display that bodes well for argentina and the two little men at the heart of this surprisingly close-knit and confident squad .
even if the claims that maradona is so egotistical that he would sabotage his own country 's chance of glory were n't so outlandish that they should be rejected by the sane-minded , the fact that he has effectively given messi the canvas on which to create a masterpiece with his formation and tactics should put away those fears for good .
by giving messi the role he excels in and allowing him the freedom to do what he does best , maradona is not creating a threat to his own legacy but providing it with the best opportunity to be further enhanced .
maradona could be the coach who got the best out of lionel messi in the biggest soccer tournament on earth , adding a world cup winner 's medal as a coach to the one he collected as a player in the process .

" i just have to make sure this does n't happen again , " he said .
you know , you have a few hardships in life .
i 've made mistakes before .
i 'm strong enough to get through this .
the ball is no excuse . "
it was a shattering moment for england manager fabio capello who had gambled in giving green only his ninth start for england . but capello refused to lay the blame on green . " he made one mistake but then pulled off a great save in the second half .
i was pleased for him , " said the italian . " we had lots of chances in the game .
there were a lot of positives .
just the result was n't positive . " usa coach bob bradley , on the other hand , had reasons to be cheerful .
" it was a great team effort to come back and equalize .

this comes as the opposition is turning up the heat on merkel 's coalition government . in the german cities of berlin and stuttgart , around 25,000 demonstrators marched through the streets to voice disapproval of the federal government 's recently announced austerity package , which consists of cuts primarily in the social-welfare and family-services sectors .
the march was organized by trade unions and left-wing opposition groups under the motto : " this is not social justice . "
police estimated that up 10,000 marched in the southwestern city of stuttgart while organizers in berlin said between 15,000 and 20,000 people took to the streets there .
protesters carried banners saying " the crisis is called capitalism " and " employment , human rights , a secure future for everyone . "
in the face of widespread criticism of the austerity measures which are supposed to bring germany 's deficit within european union limits by 2013 , chancellor angela merkel rejected charges that the country 's poor were being unfairly burdened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is getting heat from all sides over her budget-cutting plans " people must realize that we have to save money and reduce debt , " merkel said in an interview to be published on sunday in the mass-circulation bild am sonntag weekly , adding that the " measures in the job sector aim to bring significantly more long-term unemployed back to work than in the past . "
she added that the package - which looks to slash federal spending by at least 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 96 billion -rrb- by 2014 - was evenly distributed throughout the country 's sectors .
" alongside the necessary cuts in the social-welfare budget , business is also making a contribution along with the civil-service and administrative departments , " she said .
but a new poll by infratest dimap showed that 79 percent of germans thought the savings package was not socially balanced and 93 percent thought measures were not enough to meet the government 's savings goal .
opposition demands snap elections germany 's opposition , led by the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , intensified its criticism of merkel 's center-right coalition , with spd parliamentary leader frank-walter steinmeier even calling for snap elections on saturday .
" this government is a failure and once they accept it , the tidiest solution would be a snap general election , " steinmeier told the daily bild newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's social democrats demand snap elections steinmeier said the government was in " deep crisis " and accused merkel of trying to hold on to power at all costs . " i 'm worried that this government will simply try to muddle through , " he said . the former foreign minister was referring to the politically uncertain situation germany finds itself in following the surprise resignation of president horst koehler , also a member of merkel 's christian democrats , last month .
political analysts in germany are calling it critical for merkel 's government to have her candidate , lower saxony state premier christian wulff , chosen as president , which in itself is a largely ceremonial post .
an electoral college is set to meet at the end of the month to decide between wulff and the opposition 's candidate , joachim gauck , a widely respected figure .

on saturday night , he applied his skills to the world cup for the first time with mixed results . for all the glittering prizes accrued over a career spent as the head coach of clubs such as real madrid , ac milan and juventus , this was capello 's first taste of the world cup as coach . as a no-nonsense midfielder , the italian played at the 1974 tournament , but the clash against the united states in the royal bafokeng stadium in rustenburg on saturday night was the highly decorated coach 's international baptism of fire . despite this , one would have been hard-pressed to find evidence of the combined pressure of this new experience plus the almost insurmountable expectation of a nation renowned for its lack of perspective at moments like these .
capello surveyed the scene before kick-off with his usual measured stare , his expression immovable on a granite face framed by severe spectacles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian 's stern manner is legendary once the action was underway , capello showed the other side of his nature .
he may be a tactical perfectionist and disciplinarian but he is a football man at heart .
passion and emotion are as much part of his approach to the game as cool-headed logic and preparation .
as such , it did n't take long for the craggy features to become animated once the match was underway . when steven gerrard opened the scoring on five minutes , capello was suddenly out of his seat , yelling and throwing his arms about – not in celebration but in anger at aaron lennon who had strayed out of his midfield corridor during the build-up to the goal .
as the england bench pumped the air , the italian was cursing the lack of discipline . however , when england managed to ride out a period of us pressure and mop up a dangerous situation , the pragmatic capello was quick to applaud his players , presumably because they had carried out his defensive requirements to the letter .
he was less pleased ten minutes later when onyewu put a clear header just wide with glen johnson and ledley king static . deployment of milner , green and king backfires bildunterschrift : fabio capello 's selection of green as england 's no.1 will be questioned after the keeper 's howler capello 's deployment of the more defensive-minded james milner ahead of the attacking joe cole in left midfield had seemed wise at first despite the aston villa winger missing training over the past few days with a fever .
the idea being that milner would assist ashley cole in stopping the threat of landon donovan . he was n't up to it .
skinned down the touchline time and again by us and hanover 96 fullback steve cherundolo , milner picked up an early yellow card and looked somehow sickly .
he made way for shaun wright-phillips after half an hour .
capello had taken a risk and it had backfired . wayne rooney was also playing in too deep a role , despite the inclusion of emile heskey , the man who was supposed to be the provider for the smaller england striker .
a stickler for players following instructions , rooney 's midfield meandering prompted no outburst from the italian , suggesting he had sanctioned such movement .
again , a strange decision . another might have been the inclusion of robert green in goal .
the keeper 's horrendous mistake for the equalizer prompted a death-stare from his coach which probably singed the eyebrows of the hapless green .
substitute keepers joe hart and david james may not have been alone in silently questioning capello 's choice for no.1. half-time grilling and reorganization reawakens england capello was far from happy with his side going into the break .
a number of times his face was overtaken by a look of horror as his intricate plans fell to pieces at the feet of his charges .
england were not passing well or creating any chances as the americans grew in confidence after their goal .
at some point capello put his hands over his eyes like a five-year old in front of scary tv show . since taking over the england job , the italian has been exposed as a half-time ranter and it is likely that the paint on the dressing room walls was peeling during the break .
while robert green may have been the obvious target , no one was safe after a poor half . capello did ring the changes but jamie carragher replaced ledley king because of the latter 's problematic knees , not his performance .
and yet this could be read as another admittance of miscalculation on the coach 's part .
it was certainly a risk to play king in the first place .
the tottenham defender has famously been unable to train before games for the past two years and can not play more than one match a week – something capello was well aware of when bringing him to south africa . bildunterschrift : wayne rooney played far too deep to start with and was isolated when he finally led the attack the coach rectified his somewhat bafflingly deep deployment of rooney once the game restarted with the england striker once more leading the line .
but with the rest of the team spending too much time building attacks from deep , rooney was often left to chase long , hopeful balls with no support . thinking on his feet , capello searches for breakthrough as the game wore on and england 's frustration became clearer , capello tried to reorganize and reiterate his instructions calmly ; keeping his head while all around him his players were losing theirs .
the effect was a positive one as england regained a modicum of composure as their coach prowled the technical area directing the white shirts in their search for a winner .
capello was back to showing his strengths , pushing the team further up the pitch and getting them to play a pressing game . however , as the clock ticked down and heskey made way for the towering peter crouch , the old england was suddenly back with high balls hit towards a target man .
such tactics smacked of desperation - something alien to capello 's way . in the end , even the great italian organizer could n't get a result out of his england side .
more than anyone he will want to do better in the next match - and he will demand a whole lot more from his players . author : nick amies editor : nicole goebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but how is it going to provide them ? defense ministers wrapping up a two-day nato summit in brussels welcomed improvements in the security situation in afghanistan , but also acknowledged the need for member countries to provide more military trainers to work with afghan troops .
" we welcomed the significant improvement in the capability of the afghan national security forces , and are committed to providing the trainers needed to support that steady progress , " ministers said in a joint declaration on friday .
but the ministers did n't commit to offering specific numbers of troops .
the nato-led international security assistance force includes about 120,000 soldiers from 28 nato member states - including germany - and another 18 allies .
but the training mission lacks about 20 percent of the personnel it needs - a shortfall of 450 trainers .
in february , the german parliament voted to send up to 850 troops in addition to the 4,300 already there .
it also agreed to send extra police trainers and to increase the proportion of troops focusing on training from 280 to 1,400 .

" it 's quite a new thing for nato allies to engage in such training missions ...
we have to adapt our alliance to this new task to train and educate local forces in a country like afghanistan , and i think we will deal with this aspect in the new strategic concept , " rasmussen said after the talks .
rasmussen said that allies were ready to help , but stymied by a lack of qualified officers who could do the training .
in the defense ministers final statement , they hailed " measured progress " in the nine-year war while noting that " significant challenges remain , and success is not yet assured . "
" operations across afghanistan are making measured progress in extending the reach of the afghan government , changing the political conditions , and marginalizing the insurgency , " the ministers said in a statement .

but if defense minister guttenberg has his way , the military draft could be scrapped altogether . germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , is currently debating a proposal to decrease the length of mandatory military service from nine to six months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg 's ministry has to come up with a strategy to save about 4 billion euros the proposal is among a raft of austerity measures put forward by chancellor angela merkel 's coalition cabinet , as the government seeks to tackle the country 's massive budget deficit . defense minister karl-theodor zu gutenberg wants to go a step further : he has proposed ending military conscription altogether , saying it is important to consider all options as the german government searches for more ways to save money . his ministry alone needs to cut about 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.8 billion -rrb- in costs . reluctance to end a ' tradition ' the opposition social democrats have opposed the move , saying it would destroy the country 's post-war tradition of the " citizens in uniform . " but even in the governing coalition , not everybody agrees with the defense minister , who is a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister-party to merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- . the leader of the cdu 's parliamentary group has called for compulsory military service to be maintained . volker kauder told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper that it was " the instrument to link society and the bundeswehr . " " we 've experienced on a number of occasions in our history what can result if this bond is no longer there , " he said , adding that what mattered was that the bundeswehr was able to fulfill its mission . bildunterschrift : germany is seeking to save 10 billion euros -lrb- over $ 12 billion -rrb- every year from 2011 to 2016 plans for massive troop reduction ? meanwhile , the frankfurter rundschau newspaper reported that the defense ministry plans have for a long time been based on a total scrapping of compulsory military service and a massive troop reduction . according to the report , no new recruits are to be conscripted starting next year .
in addition , plans had been drawn up to get rid of 40,000 of the bundeswehr 's 251,000 professional and regular soldiers by 2014 . the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , junior partners in the governing coalition , have urged guttenberg to take a speedy decision on the abolition of conscription . " there should be clarity about the bundeswehr 's future before the next conscription deadline on october 1 , " the party 's defense policy spokesperson , elke hoff , told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper . she also stressed that cutting the number of regular and professional soldiers only made sense if conscription was suspended at the same time . the bundestag is expected to pass a bill on an amendment to the conscription law as early as next week .
the draft bill provides for compulsory military service of six months instead of the present nine months for all conscripts from july 1 . those opting for community instead of military service are expected to be allowed to extend their duty voluntarily by a further three months . the debate over whether to continue the post-war tradition of conscription comes as the bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan is becoming increasingly unpopular at home . more than 4,000 german troops are currently stationed in afghanistan . rb / afp / epd / dpa / kna editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was certainly a risk to play king in the first place .
the tottenham defender has famously been unable to train before games for the past two years and can not play more than one match a week – something capello was well aware of when bringing him to south africa . bildunterschrift : wayne rooney played far too deep to start with and was isolated when he finally led the attack the coach rectified his somewhat bafflingly deep deployment of rooney once the game restarted with the england striker once more leading the line .
but with the rest of the team spending too much time building attacks from deep , rooney was often left to chase long , hopeful balls with no support . thinking on his feet , capello searches for breakthrough as the game wore on and england 's frustration became clearer , capello tried to reorganize and reiterate his instructions calmly ; keeping his head while all around him his players were losing theirs .
the effect was a positive one as england regained a modicum of composure as their coach prowled the technical area directing the white shirts in their search for a winner .
capello was back to showing his strengths , pushing the team further up the pitch and getting them to play a pressing game . however , as the clock ticked down and heskey made way for the towering peter crouch , the old england was suddenly back with high balls hit towards a target man .
such tactics smacked of desperation - something alien to capello 's way . in the end , even the great italian organizer could n't get a result out of his england side .
more than anyone he will want to do better in the next match - and he will demand a whole lot more from his players . author : nick amies editor : nicole goebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but how is it going to provide them ? defense ministers wrapping up a two-day nato summit in brussels welcomed improvements in the security situation in afghanistan , but also acknowledged the need for member countries to provide more military trainers to work with afghan troops .
" we welcomed the significant improvement in the capability of the afghan national security forces , and are committed to providing the trainers needed to support that steady progress , " ministers said in a joint declaration on friday .
but the ministers did n't commit to offering specific numbers of troops .
the nato-led international security assistance force includes about 120,000 soldiers from 28 nato member states - including germany - and another 18 allies .
but the training mission lacks about 20 percent of the personnel it needs - a shortfall of 450 trainers .

we have to adapt our alliance to this new task to train and educate local forces in a country like afghanistan , and i think we will deal with this aspect in the new strategic concept , " rasmussen said after the talks .
rasmussen said that allies were ready to help , but stymied by a lack of qualified officers who could do the training .
in the defense ministers final statement , they hailed " measured progress " in the nine-year war while noting that " significant challenges remain , and success is not yet assured . "
" operations across afghanistan are making measured progress in extending the reach of the afghan government , changing the political conditions , and marginalizing the insurgency , " the ministers said in a statement .

this comes as the opposition is turning up the heat on merkel 's coalition government . in the german cities of berlin and stuttgart , around 25,000 demonstrators marched through the streets to voice disapproval of the federal government 's recently announced austerity package , which consists of cuts primarily in the social-welfare and family-services sectors .
the march was organized by trade unions and left-wing opposition groups under the motto : " this is not social justice . "
police estimated that up 10,000 marched in the southwestern city of stuttgart while organizers in berlin said between 15,000 and 20,000 people took to the streets there .
protesters carried banners saying " the crisis is called capitalism " and " employment , human rights , a secure future for everyone . "
in the face of widespread criticism of the austerity measures which are supposed to bring germany 's deficit within european union limits by 2013 , chancellor angela merkel rejected charges that the country 's poor were being unfairly burdened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is getting heat from all sides over her budget-cutting plans " people must realize that we have to save money and reduce debt , " merkel said in an interview to be published on sunday in the mass-circulation bild am sonntag weekly , adding that the " measures in the job sector aim to bring significantly more long-term unemployed back to work than in the past . "
she added that the package - which looks to slash federal spending by at least 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 96 billion -rrb- by 2014 - was evenly distributed throughout the country 's sectors .
" alongside the necessary cuts in the social-welfare budget , business is also making a contribution along with the civil-service and administrative departments , " she said .
but a new poll by infratest dimap showed that 79 percent of germans thought the savings package was not socially balanced and 93 percent thought measures were not enough to meet the government 's savings goal .
opposition demands snap elections germany 's opposition , led by the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , intensified its criticism of merkel 's center-right coalition , with spd parliamentary leader frank-walter steinmeier even calling for snap elections on saturday .
" this government is a failure and once they accept it , the tidiest solution would be a snap general election , " steinmeier told the daily bild newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's social democrats demand snap elections steinmeier said the government was in " deep crisis " and accused merkel of trying to hold on to power at all costs . " i 'm worried that this government will simply try to muddle through , " he said . the former foreign minister was referring to the politically uncertain situation germany finds itself in following the surprise resignation of president horst koehler , also a member of merkel 's christian democrats , last month .
political analysts in germany are calling it critical for merkel 's government to have her candidate , lower saxony state premier christian wulff , chosen as president , which in itself is a largely ceremonial post .
an electoral college is set to meet at the end of the month to decide between wulff and the opposition 's candidate , joachim gauck , a widely respected figure .

the march was organized by trade unions and left-wing opposition groups under the motto : " this is not social justice . "
police estimated that up 10,000 marched in the southwestern city of stuttgart while organizers in berlin said between 15,000 and 20,000 people took to the streets there .
protesters carried banners saying " the crisis is called capitalism " and " employment , human rights , a secure future for everyone . "
in the face of widespread criticism of the austerity measures which are supposed to bring germany 's deficit within european union limits by 2013 , chancellor angela merkel rejected charges that the country 's poor were being unfairly burdened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is getting heat from all sides over her budget-cutting plans " people must realize that we have to save money and reduce debt , " merkel said in an interview to be published on sunday in the mass-circulation bild am sonntag weekly , adding that the " measures in the job sector aim to bring significantly more long-term unemployed back to work than in the past . "
she added that the package - which looks to slash federal spending by at least 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 96 billion -rrb- by 2014 - was evenly distributed throughout the country 's sectors .
" alongside the necessary cuts in the social-welfare budget , business is also making a contribution along with the civil-service and administrative departments , " she said .
but a new poll by infratest dimap showed that 79 percent of germans thought the savings package was not socially balanced and 93 percent thought measures were not enough to meet the government 's savings goal .
opposition demands snap elections germany 's opposition , led by the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , intensified its criticism of merkel 's center-right coalition , with spd parliamentary leader frank-walter steinmeier even calling for snap elections on saturday .
" this government is a failure and once they accept it , the tidiest solution would be a snap general election , " steinmeier told the daily bild newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's social democrats demand snap elections steinmeier said the government was in " deep crisis " and accused merkel of trying to hold on to power at all costs . " i 'm worried that this government will simply try to muddle through , " he said . the former foreign minister was referring to the politically uncertain situation germany finds itself in following the surprise resignation of president horst koehler , also a member of merkel 's christian democrats , last month .
political analysts in germany are calling it critical for merkel 's government to have her candidate , lower saxony state premier christian wulff , chosen as president , which in itself is a largely ceremonial post .
an electoral college is set to meet at the end of the month to decide between wulff and the opposition 's candidate , joachim gauck , a widely respected figure .

but how is it going to provide them ? defense ministers wrapping up a two-day nato summit in brussels welcomed improvements in the security situation in afghanistan , but also acknowledged the need for member countries to provide more military trainers to work with afghan troops .
" we welcomed the significant improvement in the capability of the afghan national security forces , and are committed to providing the trainers needed to support that steady progress , " ministers said in a joint declaration on friday .
but the ministers did n't commit to offering specific numbers of troops .
the nato-led international security assistance force includes about 120,000 soldiers from 28 nato member states - including germany - and another 18 allies .
but the training mission lacks about 20 percent of the personnel it needs - a shortfall of 450 trainers .
in february , the german parliament voted to send up to 850 troops in addition to the 4,300 already there .
it also agreed to send extra police trainers and to increase the proportion of troops focusing on training from 280 to 1,400 .
an expanding role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany recently agreed to increase its number of police trainers nato 's secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , told reporters that training would likely play a growing role in the defense alliance 's future missions .
" it 's quite a new thing for nato allies to engage in such training missions ...
we have to adapt our alliance to this new task to train and educate local forces in a country like afghanistan , and i think we will deal with this aspect in the new strategic concept , " rasmussen said after the talks .
rasmussen said that allies were ready to help , but stymied by a lack of qualified officers who could do the training .
in the defense ministers final statement , they hailed " measured progress " in the nine-year war while noting that " significant challenges remain , and success is not yet assured . "
" operations across afghanistan are making measured progress in extending the reach of the afghan government , changing the political conditions , and marginalizing the insurgency , " the ministers said in a statement .

on saturday night , he applied his skills to the world cup for the first time with mixed results . for all the glittering prizes accrued over a career spent as the head coach of clubs such as real madrid , ac milan and juventus , this was capello 's first taste of the world cup as coach . as a no-nonsense midfielder , the italian played at the 1974 tournament , but the clash against the united states in the royal bafokeng stadium in rustenburg on saturday night was the highly decorated coach 's international baptism of fire . despite this , one would have been hard-pressed to find evidence of the combined pressure of this new experience plus the almost insurmountable expectation of a nation renowned for its lack of perspective at moments like these .
capello surveyed the scene before kick-off with his usual measured stare , his expression immovable on a granite face framed by severe spectacles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian 's stern manner is legendary once the action was underway , capello showed the other side of his nature .
he may be a tactical perfectionist and disciplinarian but he is a football man at heart .
passion and emotion are as much part of his approach to the game as cool-headed logic and preparation .
as such , it did n't take long for the craggy features to become animated once the match was underway . when steven gerrard opened the scoring on five minutes , capello was suddenly out of his seat , yelling and throwing his arms about – not in celebration but in anger at aaron lennon who had strayed out of his midfield corridor during the build-up to the goal .
as the england bench pumped the air , the italian was cursing the lack of discipline . however , when england managed to ride out a period of us pressure and mop up a dangerous situation , the pragmatic capello was quick to applaud his players , presumably because they had carried out his defensive requirements to the letter .
he was less pleased ten minutes later when onyewu put a clear header just wide with glen johnson and ledley king static . deployment of milner , green and king backfires bildunterschrift : fabio capello 's selection of green as england 's no.1 will be questioned after the keeper 's howler capello 's deployment of the more defensive-minded james milner ahead of the attacking joe cole in left midfield had seemed wise at first despite the aston villa winger missing training over the past few days with a fever .
the idea being that milner would assist ashley cole in stopping the threat of landon donovan . he was n't up to it .
skinned down the touchline time and again by us and hanover 96 fullback steve cherundolo , milner picked up an early yellow card and looked somehow sickly .
he made way for shaun wright-phillips after half an hour .
capello had taken a risk and it had backfired . wayne rooney was also playing in too deep a role , despite the inclusion of emile heskey , the man who was supposed to be the provider for the smaller england striker .
a stickler for players following instructions , rooney 's midfield meandering prompted no outburst from the italian , suggesting he had sanctioned such movement .
again , a strange decision . another might have been the inclusion of robert green in goal .
the keeper 's horrendous mistake for the equalizer prompted a death-stare from his coach which probably singed the eyebrows of the hapless green .
substitute keepers joe hart and david james may not have been alone in silently questioning capello 's choice for no.1. half-time grilling and reorganization reawakens england capello was far from happy with his side going into the break .
a number of times his face was overtaken by a look of horror as his intricate plans fell to pieces at the feet of his charges .
england were not passing well or creating any chances as the americans grew in confidence after their goal .
at some point capello put his hands over his eyes like a five-year old in front of scary tv show . since taking over the england job , the italian has been exposed as a half-time ranter and it is likely that the paint on the dressing room walls was peeling during the break .
while robert green may have been the obvious target , no one was safe after a poor half . capello did ring the changes but jamie carragher replaced ledley king because of the latter 's problematic knees , not his performance .
and yet this could be read as another admittance of miscalculation on the coach 's part .
it was certainly a risk to play king in the first place .
the tottenham defender has famously been unable to train before games for the past two years and can not play more than one match a week – something capello was well aware of when bringing him to south africa . bildunterschrift : wayne rooney played far too deep to start with and was isolated when he finally led the attack the coach rectified his somewhat bafflingly deep deployment of rooney once the game restarted with the england striker once more leading the line .
but with the rest of the team spending too much time building attacks from deep , rooney was often left to chase long , hopeful balls with no support . thinking on his feet , capello searches for breakthrough as the game wore on and england 's frustration became clearer , capello tried to reorganize and reiterate his instructions calmly ; keeping his head while all around him his players were losing theirs .
the effect was a positive one as england regained a modicum of composure as their coach prowled the technical area directing the white shirts in their search for a winner .
capello was back to showing his strengths , pushing the team further up the pitch and getting them to play a pressing game . however , as the clock ticked down and heskey made way for the towering peter crouch , the old england was suddenly back with high balls hit towards a target man .
such tactics smacked of desperation - something alien to capello 's way . in the end , even the great italian organizer could n't get a result out of his england side .

skinned down the touchline time and again by us and hanover 96 fullback steve cherundolo , milner picked up an early yellow card and looked somehow sickly .
he made way for shaun wright-phillips after half an hour .
capello had taken a risk and it had backfired . wayne rooney was also playing in too deep a role , despite the inclusion of emile heskey , the man who was supposed to be the provider for the smaller england striker .
a stickler for players following instructions , rooney 's midfield meandering prompted no outburst from the italian , suggesting he had sanctioned such movement .
again , a strange decision . another might have been the inclusion of robert green in goal .

england were not passing well or creating any chances as the americans grew in confidence after their goal .
at some point capello put his hands over his eyes like a five-year old in front of scary tv show . since taking over the england job , the italian has been exposed as a half-time ranter and it is likely that the paint on the dressing room walls was peeling during the break .
while robert green may have been the obvious target , no one was safe after a poor half . capello did ring the changes but jamie carragher replaced ledley king because of the latter 's problematic knees , not his performance .
and yet this could be read as another admittance of miscalculation on the coach 's part .
it was certainly a risk to play king in the first place .
the tottenham defender has famously been unable to train before games for the past two years and can not play more than one match a week – something capello was well aware of when bringing him to south africa . bildunterschrift : wayne rooney played far too deep to start with and was isolated when he finally led the attack the coach rectified his somewhat bafflingly deep deployment of rooney once the game restarted with the england striker once more leading the line .
but with the rest of the team spending too much time building attacks from deep , rooney was often left to chase long , hopeful balls with no support . thinking on his feet , capello searches for breakthrough as the game wore on and england 's frustration became clearer , capello tried to reorganize and reiterate his instructions calmly ; keeping his head while all around him his players were losing theirs .
the effect was a positive one as england regained a modicum of composure as their coach prowled the technical area directing the white shirts in their search for a winner .
capello was back to showing his strengths , pushing the team further up the pitch and getting them to play a pressing game . however , as the clock ticked down and heskey made way for the towering peter crouch , the old england was suddenly back with high balls hit towards a target man .

on saturday night , he applied his skills to the world cup for the first time with mixed results . for all the glittering prizes accrued over a career spent as the head coach of clubs such as real madrid , ac milan and juventus , this was capello 's first taste of the world cup as coach . as a no-nonsense midfielder , the italian played at the 1974 tournament , but the clash against the united states in the royal bafokeng stadium in rustenburg on saturday night was the highly decorated coach 's international baptism of fire . despite this , one would have been hard-pressed to find evidence of the combined pressure of this new experience plus the almost insurmountable expectation of a nation renowned for its lack of perspective at moments like these .
capello surveyed the scene before kick-off with his usual measured stare , his expression immovable on a granite face framed by severe spectacles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian 's stern manner is legendary once the action was underway , capello showed the other side of his nature .
he may be a tactical perfectionist and disciplinarian but he is a football man at heart .
passion and emotion are as much part of his approach to the game as cool-headed logic and preparation .
as such , it did n't take long for the craggy features to become animated once the match was underway . when steven gerrard opened the scoring on five minutes , capello was suddenly out of his seat , yelling and throwing his arms about – not in celebration but in anger at aaron lennon who had strayed out of his midfield corridor during the build-up to the goal .
as the england bench pumped the air , the italian was cursing the lack of discipline . however , when england managed to ride out a period of us pressure and mop up a dangerous situation , the pragmatic capello was quick to applaud his players , presumably because they had carried out his defensive requirements to the letter .
he was less pleased ten minutes later when onyewu put a clear header just wide with glen johnson and ledley king static . deployment of milner , green and king backfires bildunterschrift : fabio capello 's selection of green as england 's no.1 will be questioned after the keeper 's howler capello 's deployment of the more defensive-minded james milner ahead of the attacking joe cole in left midfield had seemed wise at first despite the aston villa winger missing training over the past few days with a fever .

by unleashing lionel messi , maradona may turn a chaotic sideshow into a title challenge . it was hardly surprising that many of the 50,000 pairs of eyes at the ellis park stadium in johannesburg were fixed on diego maradona before the match between argentina and nigeria kicked-off on saturday afternoon .
here was a man who is seen by some as not only being larger than life but bigger than the game he so clearly adores , such is his legendary status as a world cup-winning player of unquestionable talent .
but as soon as the whistle went , the short , rotund man in the sober suit – grey to match the signs of age in his beard – seemed to purposefully diminish , as much as someone like diego maradona can .
the argentina coach remained visible for most of the game ; pacing his technical area at times , standing thoughtfully at others .
when gabriel heinze headed the only goal of the game to give argentina victory , maradona was mobbed by his coaching staff and substitutes alike but he refused to draw attention to himself with wild celebrations of his own .
this was not the maradona many were expecting .
in the run-up to the great man 's first shot at winning the world cup as a coach , it seemed that whatever the albiceleste achieved in south africa , the story would always be about diego .
many said he wanted it that way .
it was even suggested that maradona was so self-obsessed and egotistical that he would even tactically hobble the world 's best player in an effort to keep his legacy intact .
it was suggested that he would rather sacrifice lionel messi and argentina 's chances of glory than let his own standing in the annals of soccer history be eclipsed .
the freedom to perform bildunterschrift : in the formation maradona chose for the nigeria match , messi was allowed the freedom to run riot maradona 's tactics and formation on saturday put such conspiracies to bed .
messi was given the freedom of the park and played in his preferred role as part of an attacking trio alongside carlos tevez and gonzalo higuain .
as his strike partners ran the channels , messi floated , he probed , he went off on those mazy runs which tie defenders in knots .
this was not a player shackled by his coach 's ego .
there had been concerns that the little magician would be forced to chase and carry in a congested midfield , creating openings for others rather than carving them out for himself as he does so destructively for barcelona .
if this was maradona letting his ego get in the way , heaven help the opposition when he gets a bout of selfishness .
it was n't all perfect , however .
messi showed signs of a long season fighting on all fronts for the spanish champions and spurned a number of chances .
it was rumoured before the world cup began that he was running on empty and that , when given the world 's biggest stage to perform on , there would be no fuel left in the tank .
there were moments when it looked like the game would n't come to life for him .
ready to take center stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's icons finally look to be on the same page argentina 's no.10 looked a little off the pace at times and his final ball and shooting were not as clinical as observers have come to expect .
but as the game went on , messi 's influence grew and his artistry became hard to ignore .
by the end of the game , he was darting around , evading tackles and poking shots just inches wide in a way that suggested that he could even grow in strength and confidence as the tournament progresses , not grind to a halt .
messi was unleashed , unhindered and seemed to be having a whale of a time .
every time he got the ball something happened .
even though his performance deserved the goal which never came , it was a display that bodes well for argentina and the two little men at the heart of this surprisingly close-knit and confident squad .
even if the claims that maradona is so egotistical that he would sabotage his own country 's chance of glory were n't so outlandish that they should be rejected by the sane-minded , the fact that he has effectively given messi the canvas on which to create a masterpiece with his formation and tactics should put away those fears for good .
by giving messi the role he excels in and allowing him the freedom to do what he does best , maradona is not creating a threat to his own legacy but providing it with the best opportunity to be further enhanced .
maradona could be the coach who got the best out of lionel messi in the biggest soccer tournament on earth , adding a world cup winner 's medal as a coach to the one he collected as a player in the process .

here was a man who is seen by some as not only being larger than life but bigger than the game he so clearly adores , such is his legendary status as a world cup-winning player of unquestionable talent .
but as soon as the whistle went , the short , rotund man in the sober suit – grey to match the signs of age in his beard – seemed to purposefully diminish , as much as someone like diego maradona can .
the argentina coach remained visible for most of the game ; pacing his technical area at times , standing thoughtfully at others .
when gabriel heinze headed the only goal of the game to give argentina victory , maradona was mobbed by his coaching staff and substitutes alike but he refused to draw attention to himself with wild celebrations of his own .
this was not the maradona many were expecting .
in the run-up to the great man 's first shot at winning the world cup as a coach , it seemed that whatever the albiceleste achieved in south africa , the story would always be about diego .
many said he wanted it that way .
it was even suggested that maradona was so self-obsessed and egotistical that he would even tactically hobble the world 's best player in an effort to keep his legacy intact .
it was suggested that he would rather sacrifice lionel messi and argentina 's chances of glory than let his own standing in the annals of soccer history be eclipsed .
the freedom to perform bildunterschrift : in the formation maradona chose for the nigeria match , messi was allowed the freedom to run riot maradona 's tactics and formation on saturday put such conspiracies to bed .
messi was given the freedom of the park and played in his preferred role as part of an attacking trio alongside carlos tevez and gonzalo higuain .
as his strike partners ran the channels , messi floated , he probed , he went off on those mazy runs which tie defenders in knots .
this was not a player shackled by his coach 's ego .
there had been concerns that the little magician would be forced to chase and carry in a congested midfield , creating openings for others rather than carving them out for himself as he does so destructively for barcelona .
if this was maradona letting his ego get in the way , heaven help the opposition when he gets a bout of selfishness .
it was n't all perfect , however .
messi showed signs of a long season fighting on all fronts for the spanish champions and spurned a number of chances .
it was rumoured before the world cup began that he was running on empty and that , when given the world 's biggest stage to perform on , there would be no fuel left in the tank .
there were moments when it looked like the game would n't come to life for him .
ready to take center stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's icons finally look to be on the same page argentina 's no.10 looked a little off the pace at times and his final ball and shooting were not as clinical as observers have come to expect .
but as the game went on , messi 's influence grew and his artistry became hard to ignore .
by the end of the game , he was darting around , evading tackles and poking shots just inches wide in a way that suggested that he could even grow in strength and confidence as the tournament progresses , not grind to a halt .
messi was unleashed , unhindered and seemed to be having a whale of a time .
every time he got the ball something happened .
even though his performance deserved the goal which never came , it was a display that bodes well for argentina and the two little men at the heart of this surprisingly close-knit and confident squad .
even if the claims that maradona is so egotistical that he would sabotage his own country 's chance of glory were n't so outlandish that they should be rejected by the sane-minded , the fact that he has effectively given messi the canvas on which to create a masterpiece with his formation and tactics should put away those fears for good .
by giving messi the role he excels in and allowing him the freedom to do what he does best , maradona is not creating a threat to his own legacy but providing it with the best opportunity to be further enhanced .
maradona could be the coach who got the best out of lionel messi in the biggest soccer tournament on earth , adding a world cup winner 's medal as a coach to the one he collected as a player in the process .

the kremlin , however , says it wo n't send troops for now . kyrgyzstan 's provisional government appealed on saturday to neigboring russia for help in containing the escalating ethnic violence in the south of the country , after at least 80 people were killed and around 1,000 injured since friday .
" we need military support in order to get the escalating situation in the south under control , " interim president roza otunbayeva said in the capital bishkek , according to the country 's akipress agency .
the government declared state of emergency for the city of jalal-abad and surrounding areas on saturday , after having already declared a state of emergency for osh , kyrgyzstan 's second-largest city , where the rampages have been taking place since thursday .
the request was for peacekeeping forces which could come from several countries , otunbayeva said , adding that the " dynamics of events " in the region permitted no other solution . violence between kyrgyz and uzbeks has escalated into running street battles , which prompted the government to impose a curfew .
cars were smashed and burned , and buildings set on fire .
kremlin hesitant to send forces otunbayeva said she had contacted both russian premier vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev to ask for support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the initial response out of moscow , however , was that the kremlin would not send the forces otunbayeva requested .
medvedev 's spokeswoman natalya timakova said saturday that russia would offer " humanitarian assistance " and that it would " help evacuate those wounded in osh . "
but she said that russia would n't immediately send its own troops to kyrgyzstan , because the requisite conditions were n't met for military involvement .
" this is an internal conflict and russia does not yet see the conditions for its participating in resolving it , " timakhova said .
a decision to dispatch peacekeepers could be taken only after consultations with the united nations , she added .
timakova said that moscow would hold consultations on monday with regional nations on the possibility of sending its peacekeepers to kyrgyzstan .
since last april 's uprising , which ousted president kurmanbek bakiyev , foreign leaders have warned of the possibility of civil war in the impoverished , but strategically important state , which hosts both us and russian military bases .
the us government on saturday called for " rapid restoration of peace and public order " and said it supported efforts by the un and europe to help quell the violence .
the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said on friday it was ready to help resolve the conflict .

the kremlin , however , says it wo n't send troops for now . kyrgyzstan 's provisional government appealed on saturday to neigboring russia for help in containing the escalating ethnic violence in the south of the country , after at least 80 people were killed and around 1,000 injured since friday .
" we need military support in order to get the escalating situation in the south under control , " interim president roza otunbayeva said in the capital bishkek , according to the country 's akipress agency .
the government declared state of emergency for the city of jalal-abad and surrounding areas on saturday , after having already declared a state of emergency for osh , kyrgyzstan 's second-largest city , where the rampages have been taking place since thursday .
the request was for peacekeeping forces which could come from several countries , otunbayeva said , adding that the " dynamics of events " in the region permitted no other solution . violence between kyrgyz and uzbeks has escalated into running street battles , which prompted the government to impose a curfew .
cars were smashed and burned , and buildings set on fire .
kremlin hesitant to send forces otunbayeva said she had contacted both russian premier vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev to ask for support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the initial response out of moscow , however , was that the kremlin would not send the forces otunbayeva requested .
medvedev 's spokeswoman natalya timakova said saturday that russia would offer " humanitarian assistance " and that it would " help evacuate those wounded in osh . "
but she said that russia would n't immediately send its own troops to kyrgyzstan , because the requisite conditions were n't met for military involvement .
" this is an internal conflict and russia does not yet see the conditions for its participating in resolving it , " timakhova said .
a decision to dispatch peacekeepers could be taken only after consultations with the united nations , she added .
timakova said that moscow would hold consultations on monday with regional nations on the possibility of sending its peacekeepers to kyrgyzstan .
since last april 's uprising , which ousted president kurmanbek bakiyev , foreign leaders have warned of the possibility of civil war in the impoverished , but strategically important state , which hosts both us and russian military bases .
the us government on saturday called for " rapid restoration of peace and public order " and said it supported efforts by the un and europe to help quell the violence .
the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said on friday it was ready to help resolve the conflict .

but if defense minister guttenberg has his way , the military draft could be scrapped altogether . germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , is currently debating a proposal to decrease the length of mandatory military service from nine to six months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg 's ministry has to come up with a strategy to save about 4 billion euros the proposal is among a raft of austerity measures put forward by chancellor angela merkel 's coalition cabinet , as the government seeks to tackle the country 's massive budget deficit . defense minister karl-theodor zu gutenberg wants to go a step further : he has proposed ending military conscription altogether , saying it is important to consider all options as the german government searches for more ways to save money . his ministry alone needs to cut about 4 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.8 billion -rrb- in costs . reluctance to end a ' tradition ' the opposition social democrats have opposed the move , saying it would destroy the country 's post-war tradition of the " citizens in uniform .

" german politicians have expressed consternation at a racist outburst by the central bank 's board member and former berlin senator , thilo sarrazin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin drew flak for disparaging remarks about turkish and arab communities sarrazin was quoted by german media as telling a gathering of businessmen on thursday , june 10 , that germany was " becoming on average more stupid " because " turkish , near and middle eastern and african " immigrants were poorly educated . " there is an increase in population groups with different levels of intelligence , " the 65-year-old was quoted as saying .
" intelligence is passed on from parents to children .
it is about 80 percent hereditary . " chancellor angela merkel told the bild am sonntag newspaper that such sweeping statements were " stupid and pointless . " she conceded , however , that it was true that the academic qualifications of pupils from immigrant communities needed to be improved , adding that the key to that was " mastering the german language . " " if we promoted and demanded that , then those coming to live in germany would have great opportunities and they would enrich our lives , " merkel said . criticism across party lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 3 million people of turkish origin live in germany the leader of the opposition green pary , claudia roth , also criticized sarrazin . “ i wonder how much longer the bundesbank is prepared to tolerate such an agitator and right-wing populist on its board , ” she told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper . roth said that for the bundesbank – one of the country 's most important public institutions – having a leading member with such an attitude was untenable . she also said the opposition social democratic party – of which sarrazin is a member – must also ask themselves whether and how long they were ready to accept him in their own ranks . a prominent spd member , michael mueller , has meanwhile said that “ the renewed provocation by sarrazin was without question intolerable . ”
he said sarrazin had already been warned to restrain himself but that he had apparently not learnt his lesson . not the first time the banker caused a row last year after he made disparaging remarks in a magazine interview about berlin 's large turkish and arab communities . sarrazin had to apologize for saying that many of berlin 's arab and turkish immigrants have " no production , apart from fruit and vegetable trading . " meanwhile , the bundesbank has distanced itself from sarrazin 's remarks . " the opinions expressed were personal , " said susanne kreutzer , spokeswoman for the bundesbank .
" we can not comment . " the central bank 's president axel weber said last year that the bank 's reputation had been hurt by sarrazin 's remarks . rb / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the kremlin , however , says it wo n't send troops for now . kyrgyzstan 's provisional government appealed on saturday to neigboring russia for help in containing the escalating ethnic violence in the south of the country , after at least 80 people were killed and around 1,000 injured since friday .
" we need military support in order to get the escalating situation in the south under control , " interim president roza otunbayeva said in the capital bishkek , according to the country 's akipress agency .
the government declared state of emergency for the city of jalal-abad and surrounding areas on saturday , after having already declared a state of emergency for osh , kyrgyzstan 's second-largest city , where the rampages have been taking place since thursday .
the request was for peacekeeping forces which could come from several countries , otunbayeva said , adding that the " dynamics of events " in the region permitted no other solution . violence between kyrgyz and uzbeks has escalated into running street battles , which prompted the government to impose a curfew .
cars were smashed and burned , and buildings set on fire .
kremlin hesitant to send forces otunbayeva said she had contacted both russian premier vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev to ask for support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the initial response out of moscow , however , was that the kremlin would not send the forces otunbayeva requested .
medvedev 's spokeswoman natalya timakova said saturday that russia would offer " humanitarian assistance " and that it would " help evacuate those wounded in osh . "
but she said that russia would n't immediately send its own troops to kyrgyzstan , because the requisite conditions were n't met for military involvement .
" this is an internal conflict and russia does not yet see the conditions for its participating in resolving it , " timakhova said .
a decision to dispatch peacekeepers could be taken only after consultations with the united nations , she added .
timakova said that moscow would hold consultations on monday with regional nations on the possibility of sending its peacekeepers to kyrgyzstan .
since last april 's uprising , which ousted president kurmanbek bakiyev , foreign leaders have warned of the possibility of civil war in the impoverished , but strategically important state , which hosts both us and russian military bases .
the us government on saturday called for " rapid restoration of peace and public order " and said it supported efforts by the un and europe to help quell the violence .
the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said on friday it was ready to help resolve the conflict .

it 's unclear whether the suspect will be extradited to germany . the german federal prosecutor 's office confirmed on saturday that polish authorities arrested an alleged mossad spy from israel wanted in connection with a hamas agent slaying in dubai .
" he was arrested in warsaw and is suspected of being involved in illegally obtaining a -lrb- german -rrb- passport , " a spokesman for the office said , confirming a report in the german news magazine , der spiegel .
" it 's now up to the poles to decide if they are going to hand him over to germany , " he added .
according to the spiegel article published on monday , the suspect using the name uri brodsky was arrested in early june upon arrival at warsaw 's airport on suspicions of working for mossad in germany helping to issue a fake german passport to the operation .
mahmud al-mabhuh , a founder of the military wing of the islamist hamas movement , was found dead in his room in a hotel near the dubai airport on january 20 .
british , irish , french , australian , and german passports were used by 26 people believed to be linked to the murder , according to dubai police .
the issue caused a diplomatic row in which the five countries whose passports were used called in israeli envoys for talks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 12.06.2010 capello 's world cup debut shows signs of progress but also fallibility großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capello was stoic before the game - but that soon changed england coach fabio capello 's reputation for discipline , organization and preparation is well known in european soccer .
on saturday night , he applied his skills to the world cup for the first time with mixed results . for all the glittering prizes accrued over a career spent as the head coach of clubs such as real madrid , ac milan and juventus , this was capello 's first taste of the world cup as coach . as a no-nonsense midfielder , the italian played at the 1974 tournament , but the clash against the united states in the royal bafokeng stadium in rustenburg on saturday night was the highly decorated coach 's international baptism of fire . despite this , one would have been hard-pressed to find evidence of the combined pressure of this new experience plus the almost insurmountable expectation of a nation renowned for its lack of perspective at moments like these .
capello surveyed the scene before kick-off with his usual measured stare , his expression immovable on a granite face framed by severe spectacles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the italian 's stern manner is legendary once the action was underway , capello showed the other side of his nature .
he may be a tactical perfectionist and disciplinarian but he is a football man at heart .
passion and emotion are as much part of his approach to the game as cool-headed logic and preparation .

rather than offering artistic fictions , it presents alternative perspectives on reality . the berlin biennale , which opened on friday , june 11 , is taking place for the sixth time this year since its founding in 1996 .
it showcases top names like mark boulos -lrb- us -rrb- , phil collins -lrb- uk -rrb- , marcus geiger -lrb- switzerland -rrb- , nilbar gures -lrb- turkey -rrb- and michael schmidt -lrb- germany -rrb- . curator kathrin rhomberg of vienna delves into the relationship between art and reality , with this year 's show offering a heavy dose of reality .
rhomberg was responsible moving the biennale from its previous location in berlin 's trendy and expensive center to the rougher kreuzberg district . " kreuzberg is an interesting place because since the fifties , it has been largely shaped by working migrants and the consequences of the migration have become visible in many ways and have found an interesting coexistence with the so-called social majority , " said rhomberg .
" seen in this way , kreuzberg is an area that represents the european societies of the future . " bildunterschrift : petrit halilaj made a model of the house his family built after the kosovo war art versus reality for the berlin biennale , kreuzberg 's typical mixture of turkish immigrants , young left-wingers , students , academics and unemployed persons could itself practically serve as an exhibition in the festival under the motto " what 's waiting outside . "
rhomberg aims to show how current art reacts to the present world , with all its upheavals , terrorist attacks , migration , war and financial and environmental crises .
young kosovar artist petrit halilaj managed to capture this theme particularly well .
he created an authentic-looking copy of the frame of the house that his family built after the end of the kosovo war . " it is also a project for the future , because the family home was destroyed in the yugoslavian war , with all the traumas and migration stories that are connected to this , " said rhomberg .
" -lsb- halilaj -rsb- is now building a house in pristina that has no history and is future-oriented , and he has brought the insulation lumber to berlin to build a kind of negative of his family house . " family ties many of the works uncover the human relationship to the urban landscape .
algerian artist mohamed bourouissa , for example , shows a side of paris ' poor suburbs that does n't turn up in the news , while photographer minerva cuevas collects examples of political resistance in her native mexico . the theme of family ties also runs through the exhibition , including a film by artist anna witt , who convinced her mother to re-enact her birth .
the artist plays herself in the short video . bildunterschrift : anna witt and her mother re-enacted her birth it was berlin 's lack of an exhibition venue for contemporary art that led klaus biesenbach to found the biennale in 1996 .
biesenbach is credited with having a strong instinct for new trends , which allowed him to position the biennale firmly on the international art scene .
he is now the director of the p.s.1 contemporary art center in new york . it is still important to maintain this artistic outlet in berlin , said biesenbach . " it has attracted international interest ; 800 accreditations on the press conference day .
they are reporting on it everywhere .
i believe it has a lot of influential strength and is the start of many careers . " visitors can view the berlin biennale through august 8 , 2010 .

but how is it going to provide them ? defense ministers wrapping up a two-day nato summit in brussels welcomed improvements in the security situation in afghanistan , but also acknowledged the need for member countries to provide more military trainers to work with afghan troops .
" we welcomed the significant improvement in the capability of the afghan national security forces , and are committed to providing the trainers needed to support that steady progress , " ministers said in a joint declaration on friday .
but the ministers did n't commit to offering specific numbers of troops .
the nato-led international security assistance force includes about 120,000 soldiers from 28 nato member states - including germany - and another 18 allies .
but the training mission lacks about 20 percent of the personnel it needs - a shortfall of 450 trainers .
in february , the german parliament voted to send up to 850 troops in addition to the 4,300 already there .

we have to adapt our alliance to this new task to train and educate local forces in a country like afghanistan , and i think we will deal with this aspect in the new strategic concept , " rasmussen said after the talks .
rasmussen said that allies were ready to help , but stymied by a lack of qualified officers who could do the training .
in the defense ministers final statement , they hailed " measured progress " in the nine-year war while noting that " significant challenges remain , and success is not yet assured . "
" operations across afghanistan are making measured progress in extending the reach of the afghan government , changing the political conditions , and marginalizing the insurgency , " the ministers said in a statement .

" german politicians have expressed consternation at a racist outburst by the central bank 's board member and former berlin senator , thilo sarrazin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin drew flak for disparaging remarks about turkish and arab communities sarrazin was quoted by german media as telling a gathering of businessmen on thursday , june 10 , that germany was " becoming on average more stupid " because " turkish , near and middle eastern and african " immigrants were poorly educated . " there is an increase in population groups with different levels of intelligence , " the 65-year-old was quoted as saying .
" intelligence is passed on from parents to children .
it is about 80 percent hereditary . " chancellor angela merkel told the bild am sonntag newspaper that such sweeping statements were " stupid and pointless . " she conceded , however , that it was true that the academic qualifications of pupils from immigrant communities needed to be improved , adding that the key to that was " mastering the german language . " " if we promoted and demanded that , then those coming to live in germany would have great opportunities and they would enrich our lives , " merkel said . criticism across party lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 3 million people of turkish origin live in germany the leader of the opposition green pary , claudia roth , also criticized sarrazin . “ i wonder how much longer the bundesbank is prepared to tolerate such an agitator and right-wing populist on its board , ” she told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper . roth said that for the bundesbank – one of the country 's most important public institutions – having a leading member with such an attitude was untenable . she also said the opposition social democratic party – of which sarrazin is a member – must also ask themselves whether and how long they were ready to accept him in their own ranks . a prominent spd member , michael mueller , has meanwhile said that “ the renewed provocation by sarrazin was without question intolerable . ”
he said sarrazin had already been warned to restrain himself but that he had apparently not learnt his lesson . not the first time the banker caused a row last year after he made disparaging remarks in a magazine interview about berlin 's large turkish and arab communities . sarrazin had to apologize for saying that many of berlin 's arab and turkish immigrants have " no production , apart from fruit and vegetable trading .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 12.06.2010 austerity plan spurs thousands to protest in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of germans took to the streets to voice their anger on saturday up to 25,000 germans took to the streets of stuttgart and berlin on saturday to protest the government 's austerity package .
this comes as the opposition is turning up the heat on merkel 's coalition government . in the german cities of berlin and stuttgart , around 25,000 demonstrators marched through the streets to voice disapproval of the federal government 's recently announced austerity package , which consists of cuts primarily in the social-welfare and family-services sectors .
the march was organized by trade unions and left-wing opposition groups under the motto : " this is not social justice . "
police estimated that up 10,000 marched in the southwestern city of stuttgart while organizers in berlin said between 15,000 and 20,000 people took to the streets there .
protesters carried banners saying " the crisis is called capitalism " and " employment , human rights , a secure future for everyone . "
in the face of widespread criticism of the austerity measures which are supposed to bring germany 's deficit within european union limits by 2013 , chancellor angela merkel rejected charges that the country 's poor were being unfairly burdened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is getting heat from all sides over her budget-cutting plans " people must realize that we have to save money and reduce debt , " merkel said in an interview to be published on sunday in the mass-circulation bild am sonntag weekly , adding that the " measures in the job sector aim to bring significantly more long-term unemployed back to work than in the past . "
she added that the package - which looks to slash federal spending by at least 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 96 billion -rrb- by 2014 - was evenly distributed throughout the country 's sectors .
" alongside the necessary cuts in the social-welfare budget , business is also making a contribution along with the civil-service and administrative departments , " she said .
but a new poll by infratest dimap showed that 79 percent of germans thought the savings package was not socially balanced and 93 percent thought measures were not enough to meet the government 's savings goal .
opposition demands snap elections germany 's opposition , led by the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , intensified its criticism of merkel 's center-right coalition , with spd parliamentary leader frank-walter steinmeier even calling for snap elections on saturday .
" this government is a failure and once they accept it , the tidiest solution would be a snap general election , " steinmeier told the daily bild newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's social democrats demand snap elections steinmeier said the government was in " deep crisis " and accused merkel of trying to hold on to power at all costs . " i 'm worried that this government will simply try to muddle through , " he said . the former foreign minister was referring to the politically uncertain situation germany finds itself in following the surprise resignation of president horst koehler , also a member of merkel 's christian democrats , last month .
political analysts in germany are calling it critical for merkel 's government to have her candidate , lower saxony state premier christian wulff , chosen as president , which in itself is a largely ceremonial post .
an electoral college is set to meet at the end of the month to decide between wulff and the opposition 's candidate , joachim gauck , a widely respected figure .

this comes as the opposition is turning up the heat on merkel 's coalition government . in the german cities of berlin and stuttgart , around 25,000 demonstrators marched through the streets to voice disapproval of the federal government 's recently announced austerity package , which consists of cuts primarily in the social-welfare and family-services sectors .
the march was organized by trade unions and left-wing opposition groups under the motto : " this is not social justice . "
police estimated that up 10,000 marched in the southwestern city of stuttgart while organizers in berlin said between 15,000 and 20,000 people took to the streets there .
protesters carried banners saying " the crisis is called capitalism " and " employment , human rights , a secure future for everyone . "
in the face of widespread criticism of the austerity measures which are supposed to bring germany 's deficit within european union limits by 2013 , chancellor angela merkel rejected charges that the country 's poor were being unfairly burdened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is getting heat from all sides over her budget-cutting plans " people must realize that we have to save money and reduce debt , " merkel said in an interview to be published on sunday in the mass-circulation bild am sonntag weekly , adding that the " measures in the job sector aim to bring significantly more long-term unemployed back to work than in the past . "
she added that the package - which looks to slash federal spending by at least 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 96 billion -rrb- by 2014 - was evenly distributed throughout the country 's sectors .
" alongside the necessary cuts in the social-welfare budget , business is also making a contribution along with the civil-service and administrative departments , " she said .
but a new poll by infratest dimap showed that 79 percent of germans thought the savings package was not socially balanced and 93 percent thought measures were not enough to meet the government 's savings goal .
opposition demands snap elections germany 's opposition , led by the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , intensified its criticism of merkel 's center-right coalition , with spd parliamentary leader frank-walter steinmeier even calling for snap elections on saturday .
" this government is a failure and once they accept it , the tidiest solution would be a snap general election , " steinmeier told the daily bild newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's social democrats demand snap elections steinmeier said the government was in " deep crisis " and accused merkel of trying to hold on to power at all costs . " i 'm worried that this government will simply try to muddle through , " he said . the former foreign minister was referring to the politically uncertain situation germany finds itself in following the surprise resignation of president horst koehler , also a member of merkel 's christian democrats , last month .
political analysts in germany are calling it critical for merkel 's government to have her candidate , lower saxony state premier christian wulff , chosen as president , which in itself is a largely ceremonial post .
an electoral college is set to meet at the end of the month to decide between wulff and the opposition 's candidate , joachim gauck , a widely respected figure .

the kremlin , however , says it wo n't send troops for now . kyrgyzstan 's provisional government appealed on saturday to neigboring russia for help in containing the escalating ethnic violence in the south of the country , after at least 80 people were killed and around 1,000 injured since friday .
" we need military support in order to get the escalating situation in the south under control , " interim president roza otunbayeva said in the capital bishkek , according to the country 's akipress agency .
the government declared state of emergency for the city of jalal-abad and surrounding areas on saturday , after having already declared a state of emergency for osh , kyrgyzstan 's second-largest city , where the rampages have been taking place since thursday .
the request was for peacekeeping forces which could come from several countries , otunbayeva said , adding that the " dynamics of events " in the region permitted no other solution . violence between kyrgyz and uzbeks has escalated into running street battles , which prompted the government to impose a curfew .
cars were smashed and burned , and buildings set on fire .
kremlin hesitant to send forces otunbayeva said she had contacted both russian premier vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev to ask for support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the initial response out of moscow , however , was that the kremlin would not send the forces otunbayeva requested .
medvedev 's spokeswoman natalya timakova said saturday that russia would offer " humanitarian assistance " and that it would " help evacuate those wounded in osh . "
but she said that russia would n't immediately send its own troops to kyrgyzstan , because the requisite conditions were n't met for military involvement .
" this is an internal conflict and russia does not yet see the conditions for its participating in resolving it , " timakhova said .
a decision to dispatch peacekeepers could be taken only after consultations with the united nations , she added .
timakova said that moscow would hold consultations on monday with regional nations on the possibility of sending its peacekeepers to kyrgyzstan .
since last april 's uprising , which ousted president kurmanbek bakiyev , foreign leaders have warned of the possibility of civil war in the impoverished , but strategically important state , which hosts both us and russian military bases .
the us government on saturday called for " rapid restoration of peace and public order " and said it supported efforts by the un and europe to help quell the violence .
the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said on friday it was ready to help resolve the conflict .

the kremlin , however , says it wo n't send troops for now . kyrgyzstan 's provisional government appealed on saturday to neigboring russia for help in containing the escalating ethnic violence in the south of the country , after at least 80 people were killed and around 1,000 injured since friday .
" we need military support in order to get the escalating situation in the south under control , " interim president roza otunbayeva said in the capital bishkek , according to the country 's akipress agency .
the government declared state of emergency for the city of jalal-abad and surrounding areas on saturday , after having already declared a state of emergency for osh , kyrgyzstan 's second-largest city , where the rampages have been taking place since thursday .
the request was for peacekeeping forces which could come from several countries , otunbayeva said , adding that the " dynamics of events " in the region permitted no other solution . violence between kyrgyz and uzbeks has escalated into running street battles , which prompted the government to impose a curfew .
cars were smashed and burned , and buildings set on fire .
kremlin hesitant to send forces otunbayeva said she had contacted both russian premier vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev to ask for support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the initial response out of moscow , however , was that the kremlin would not send the forces otunbayeva requested .
medvedev 's spokeswoman natalya timakova said saturday that russia would offer " humanitarian assistance " and that it would " help evacuate those wounded in osh . "
but she said that russia would n't immediately send its own troops to kyrgyzstan , because the requisite conditions were n't met for military involvement .
" this is an internal conflict and russia does not yet see the conditions for its participating in resolving it , " timakhova said .
a decision to dispatch peacekeepers could be taken only after consultations with the united nations , she added .
timakova said that moscow would hold consultations on monday with regional nations on the possibility of sending its peacekeepers to kyrgyzstan .
since last april 's uprising , which ousted president kurmanbek bakiyev , foreign leaders have warned of the possibility of civil war in the impoverished , but strategically important state , which hosts both us and russian military bases .
the us government on saturday called for " rapid restoration of peace and public order " and said it supported efforts by the un and europe to help quell the violence .
the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said on friday it was ready to help resolve the conflict .

by unleashing lionel messi , maradona may turn a chaotic sideshow into a title challenge . it was hardly surprising that many of the 50,000 pairs of eyes at the ellis park stadium in johannesburg were fixed on diego maradona before the match between argentina and nigeria kicked-off on saturday afternoon .
here was a man who is seen by some as not only being larger than life but bigger than the game he so clearly adores , such is his legendary status as a world cup-winning player of unquestionable talent .
but as soon as the whistle went , the short , rotund man in the sober suit – grey to match the signs of age in his beard – seemed to purposefully diminish , as much as someone like diego maradona can .
the argentina coach remained visible for most of the game ; pacing his technical area at times , standing thoughtfully at others .
when gabriel heinze headed the only goal of the game to give argentina victory , maradona was mobbed by his coaching staff and substitutes alike but he refused to draw attention to himself with wild celebrations of his own .
this was not the maradona many were expecting .
in the run-up to the great man 's first shot at winning the world cup as a coach , it seemed that whatever the albiceleste achieved in south africa , the story would always be about diego .
many said he wanted it that way .
it was even suggested that maradona was so self-obsessed and egotistical that he would even tactically hobble the world 's best player in an effort to keep his legacy intact .
it was suggested that he would rather sacrifice lionel messi and argentina 's chances of glory than let his own standing in the annals of soccer history be eclipsed .
the freedom to perform bildunterschrift : in the formation maradona chose for the nigeria match , messi was allowed the freedom to run riot maradona 's tactics and formation on saturday put such conspiracies to bed .
messi was given the freedom of the park and played in his preferred role as part of an attacking trio alongside carlos tevez and gonzalo higuain .
as his strike partners ran the channels , messi floated , he probed , he went off on those mazy runs which tie defenders in knots .
this was not a player shackled by his coach 's ego .
there had been concerns that the little magician would be forced to chase and carry in a congested midfield , creating openings for others rather than carving them out for himself as he does so destructively for barcelona .
if this was maradona letting his ego get in the way , heaven help the opposition when he gets a bout of selfishness .
it was n't all perfect , however .
messi showed signs of a long season fighting on all fronts for the spanish champions and spurned a number of chances .
it was rumoured before the world cup began that he was running on empty and that , when given the world 's biggest stage to perform on , there would be no fuel left in the tank .
there were moments when it looked like the game would n't come to life for him .
ready to take center stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's icons finally look to be on the same page argentina 's no.10 looked a little off the pace at times and his final ball and shooting were not as clinical as observers have come to expect .
but as the game went on , messi 's influence grew and his artistry became hard to ignore .
by the end of the game , he was darting around , evading tackles and poking shots just inches wide in a way that suggested that he could even grow in strength and confidence as the tournament progresses , not grind to a halt .
messi was unleashed , unhindered and seemed to be having a whale of a time .
every time he got the ball something happened .
even though his performance deserved the goal which never came , it was a display that bodes well for argentina and the two little men at the heart of this surprisingly close-knit and confident squad .
even if the claims that maradona is so egotistical that he would sabotage his own country 's chance of glory were n't so outlandish that they should be rejected by the sane-minded , the fact that he has effectively given messi the canvas on which to create a masterpiece with his formation and tactics should put away those fears for good .
by giving messi the role he excels in and allowing him the freedom to do what he does best , maradona is not creating a threat to his own legacy but providing it with the best opportunity to be further enhanced .
maradona could be the coach who got the best out of lionel messi in the biggest soccer tournament on earth , adding a world cup winner 's medal as a coach to the one he collected as a player in the process .

by unleashing lionel messi , maradona may turn a chaotic sideshow into a title challenge . it was hardly surprising that many of the 50,000 pairs of eyes at the ellis park stadium in johannesburg were fixed on diego maradona before the match between argentina and nigeria kicked-off on saturday afternoon .
here was a man who is seen by some as not only being larger than life but bigger than the game he so clearly adores , such is his legendary status as a world cup-winning player of unquestionable talent .
but as soon as the whistle went , the short , rotund man in the sober suit – grey to match the signs of age in his beard – seemed to purposefully diminish , as much as someone like diego maradona can .
the argentina coach remained visible for most of the game ; pacing his technical area at times , standing thoughtfully at others .
when gabriel heinze headed the only goal of the game to give argentina victory , maradona was mobbed by his coaching staff and substitutes alike but he refused to draw attention to himself with wild celebrations of his own .
this was not the maradona many were expecting .
in the run-up to the great man 's first shot at winning the world cup as a coach , it seemed that whatever the albiceleste achieved in south africa , the story would always be about diego .
many said he wanted it that way .
it was even suggested that maradona was so self-obsessed and egotistical that he would even tactically hobble the world 's best player in an effort to keep his legacy intact .
it was suggested that he would rather sacrifice lionel messi and argentina 's chances of glory than let his own standing in the annals of soccer history be eclipsed .
the freedom to perform bildunterschrift : in the formation maradona chose for the nigeria match , messi was allowed the freedom to run riot maradona 's tactics and formation on saturday put such conspiracies to bed .
messi was given the freedom of the park and played in his preferred role as part of an attacking trio alongside carlos tevez and gonzalo higuain .
as his strike partners ran the channels , messi floated , he probed , he went off on those mazy runs which tie defenders in knots .
this was not a player shackled by his coach 's ego .
there had been concerns that the little magician would be forced to chase and carry in a congested midfield , creating openings for others rather than carving them out for himself as he does so destructively for barcelona .
if this was maradona letting his ego get in the way , heaven help the opposition when he gets a bout of selfishness .
it was n't all perfect , however .
messi showed signs of a long season fighting on all fronts for the spanish champions and spurned a number of chances .
it was rumoured before the world cup began that he was running on empty and that , when given the world 's biggest stage to perform on , there would be no fuel left in the tank .
there were moments when it looked like the game would n't come to life for him .
ready to take center stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's icons finally look to be on the same page argentina 's no.10 looked a little off the pace at times and his final ball and shooting were not as clinical as observers have come to expect .
but as the game went on , messi 's influence grew and his artistry became hard to ignore .
by the end of the game , he was darting around , evading tackles and poking shots just inches wide in a way that suggested that he could even grow in strength and confidence as the tournament progresses , not grind to a halt .
messi was unleashed , unhindered and seemed to be having a whale of a time .
every time he got the ball something happened .
even though his performance deserved the goal which never came , it was a display that bodes well for argentina and the two little men at the heart of this surprisingly close-knit and confident squad .
even if the claims that maradona is so egotistical that he would sabotage his own country 's chance of glory were n't so outlandish that they should be rejected by the sane-minded , the fact that he has effectively given messi the canvas on which to create a masterpiece with his formation and tactics should put away those fears for good .
by giving messi the role he excels in and allowing him the freedom to do what he does best , maradona is not creating a threat to his own legacy but providing it with the best opportunity to be further enhanced .
maradona could be the coach who got the best out of lionel messi in the biggest soccer tournament on earth , adding a world cup winner 's medal as a coach to the one he collected as a player in the process .

" german politicians have expressed consternation at a racist outburst by the central bank 's board member and former berlin senator , thilo sarrazin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin drew flak for disparaging remarks about turkish and arab communities sarrazin was quoted by german media as telling a gathering of businessmen on thursday , june 10 , that germany was " becoming on average more stupid " because " turkish , near and middle eastern and african " immigrants were poorly educated . " there is an increase in population groups with different levels of intelligence , " the 65-year-old was quoted as saying .
" intelligence is passed on from parents to children .
it is about 80 percent hereditary . " chancellor angela merkel told the bild am sonntag newspaper that such sweeping statements were " stupid and pointless . " she conceded , however , that it was true that the academic qualifications of pupils from immigrant communities needed to be improved , adding that the key to that was " mastering the german language . " " if we promoted and demanded that , then those coming to live in germany would have great opportunities and they would enrich our lives , " merkel said . criticism across party lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 3 million people of turkish origin live in germany the leader of the opposition green pary , claudia roth , also criticized sarrazin . “ i wonder how much longer the bundesbank is prepared to tolerate such an agitator and right-wing populist on its board , ” she told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper . roth said that for the bundesbank – one of the country 's most important public institutions – having a leading member with such an attitude was untenable . she also said the opposition social democratic party – of which sarrazin is a member – must also ask themselves whether and how long they were ready to accept him in their own ranks . a prominent spd member , michael mueller , has meanwhile said that “ the renewed provocation by sarrazin was without question intolerable . ”
he said sarrazin had already been warned to restrain himself but that he had apparently not learnt his lesson . not the first time the banker caused a row last year after he made disparaging remarks in a magazine interview about berlin 's large turkish and arab communities . sarrazin had to apologize for saying that many of berlin 's arab and turkish immigrants have " no production , apart from fruit and vegetable trading . " meanwhile , the bundesbank has distanced itself from sarrazin 's remarks . " the opinions expressed were personal , " said susanne kreutzer , spokeswoman for the bundesbank .
" we can not comment . " the central bank 's president axel weber said last year that the bank 's reputation had been hurt by sarrazin 's remarks . rb / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rather than offering artistic fictions , it presents alternative perspectives on reality . the berlin biennale , which opened on friday , june 11 , is taking place for the sixth time this year since its founding in 1996 .
it showcases top names like mark boulos -lrb- us -rrb- , phil collins -lrb- uk -rrb- , marcus geiger -lrb- switzerland -rrb- , nilbar gures -lrb- turkey -rrb- and michael schmidt -lrb- germany -rrb- . curator kathrin rhomberg of vienna delves into the relationship between art and reality , with this year 's show offering a heavy dose of reality .
rhomberg was responsible moving the biennale from its previous location in berlin 's trendy and expensive center to the rougher kreuzberg district . " kreuzberg is an interesting place because since the fifties , it has been largely shaped by working migrants and the consequences of the migration have become visible in many ways and have found an interesting coexistence with the so-called social majority , " said rhomberg .
" seen in this way , kreuzberg is an area that represents the european societies of the future . " bildunterschrift : petrit halilaj made a model of the house his family built after the kosovo war art versus reality for the berlin biennale , kreuzberg 's typical mixture of turkish immigrants , young left-wingers , students , academics and unemployed persons could itself practically serve as an exhibition in the festival under the motto " what 's waiting outside . "
rhomberg aims to show how current art reacts to the present world , with all its upheavals , terrorist attacks , migration , war and financial and environmental crises .
young kosovar artist petrit halilaj managed to capture this theme particularly well .
he created an authentic-looking copy of the frame of the house that his family built after the end of the kosovo war . " it is also a project for the future , because the family home was destroyed in the yugoslavian war , with all the traumas and migration stories that are connected to this , " said rhomberg .
" -lsb- halilaj -rsb- is now building a house in pristina that has no history and is future-oriented , and he has brought the insulation lumber to berlin to build a kind of negative of his family house . " family ties many of the works uncover the human relationship to the urban landscape .
algerian artist mohamed bourouissa , for example , shows a side of paris ' poor suburbs that does n't turn up in the news , while photographer minerva cuevas collects examples of political resistance in her native mexico . the theme of family ties also runs through the exhibition , including a film by artist anna witt , who convinced her mother to re-enact her birth .
the artist plays herself in the short video . bildunterschrift : anna witt and her mother re-enacted her birth it was berlin 's lack of an exhibition venue for contemporary art that led klaus biesenbach to found the biennale in 1996 .
biesenbach is credited with having a strong instinct for new trends , which allowed him to position the biennale firmly on the international art scene .

but how is it going to provide them ? defense ministers wrapping up a two-day nato summit in brussels welcomed improvements in the security situation in afghanistan , but also acknowledged the need for member countries to provide more military trainers to work with afghan troops .
" we welcomed the significant improvement in the capability of the afghan national security forces , and are committed to providing the trainers needed to support that steady progress , " ministers said in a joint declaration on friday .
but the ministers did n't commit to offering specific numbers of troops .
the nato-led international security assistance force includes about 120,000 soldiers from 28 nato member states - including germany - and another 18 allies .
but the training mission lacks about 20 percent of the personnel it needs - a shortfall of 450 trainers .
in february , the german parliament voted to send up to 850 troops in addition to the 4,300 already there .
it also agreed to send extra police trainers and to increase the proportion of troops focusing on training from 280 to 1,400 .
an expanding role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany recently agreed to increase its number of police trainers nato 's secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , told reporters that training would likely play a growing role in the defense alliance 's future missions .
" it 's quite a new thing for nato allies to engage in such training missions ...
we have to adapt our alliance to this new task to train and educate local forces in a country like afghanistan , and i think we will deal with this aspect in the new strategic concept , " rasmussen said after the talks .
rasmussen said that allies were ready to help , but stymied by a lack of qualified officers who could do the training .
in the defense ministers final statement , they hailed " measured progress " in the nine-year war while noting that " significant challenges remain , and success is not yet assured . "
" operations across afghanistan are making measured progress in extending the reach of the afghan government , changing the political conditions , and marginalizing the insurgency , " the ministers said in a statement .

earlier , argentina and south korea both picked up wins . a hard-fought match between group c favorites england and the united states ended in a 1-1 draw in rustenburg at the royal bafokeng stadium on saturday evening . steven gerrard gave england an early lead after flicking a goal home from inside the penalty area four minutes after the opening whistle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerrard 's goal was england 's highlight on the night the shock of the night came when team usa was literally given the equalizer by england keeper robert green .
the 29-year-old let a routine drive by clint dempsey slip through his hands and into the net in the 40th minute . green made no excuses for his mistake after the match .
" i just have to make sure this does n't happen again , " he said .
you know , you have a few hardships in life .
i 've made mistakes before .
i 'm strong enough to get through this .
the ball is no excuse . "
it was a shattering moment for england manager fabio capello who had gambled in giving green only his ninth start for england . but capello refused to lay the blame on green . " he made one mistake but then pulled off a great save in the second half .
i was pleased for him , " said the italian . " we had lots of chances in the game .
there were a lot of positives .
just the result was n't positive . " usa coach bob bradley , on the other hand , had reasons to be cheerful .

this comes as the opposition is turning up the heat on merkel 's coalition government . in the german cities of berlin and stuttgart , around 25,000 demonstrators marched through the streets to voice disapproval of the federal government 's recently announced austerity package , which consists of cuts primarily in the social-welfare and family-services sectors .
the march was organized by trade unions and left-wing opposition groups under the motto : " this is not social justice . "
police estimated that up 10,000 marched in the southwestern city of stuttgart while organizers in berlin said between 15,000 and 20,000 people took to the streets there .
protesters carried banners saying " the crisis is called capitalism " and " employment , human rights , a secure future for everyone . "
in the face of widespread criticism of the austerity measures which are supposed to bring germany 's deficit within european union limits by 2013 , chancellor angela merkel rejected charges that the country 's poor were being unfairly burdened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is getting heat from all sides over her budget-cutting plans " people must realize that we have to save money and reduce debt , " merkel said in an interview to be published on sunday in the mass-circulation bild am sonntag weekly , adding that the " measures in the job sector aim to bring significantly more long-term unemployed back to work than in the past . "
she added that the package - which looks to slash federal spending by at least 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 96 billion -rrb- by 2014 - was evenly distributed throughout the country 's sectors .
" alongside the necessary cuts in the social-welfare budget , business is also making a contribution along with the civil-service and administrative departments , " she said .
but a new poll by infratest dimap showed that 79 percent of germans thought the savings package was not socially balanced and 93 percent thought measures were not enough to meet the government 's savings goal .
opposition demands snap elections germany 's opposition , led by the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , intensified its criticism of merkel 's center-right coalition , with spd parliamentary leader frank-walter steinmeier even calling for snap elections on saturday .
" this government is a failure and once they accept it , the tidiest solution would be a snap general election , " steinmeier told the daily bild newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier 's social democrats demand snap elections steinmeier said the government was in " deep crisis " and accused merkel of trying to hold on to power at all costs . " i 'm worried that this government will simply try to muddle through , " he said . the former foreign minister was referring to the politically uncertain situation germany finds itself in following the surprise resignation of president horst koehler , also a member of merkel 's christian democrats , last month .
political analysts in germany are calling it critical for merkel 's government to have her candidate , lower saxony state premier christian wulff , chosen as president , which in itself is a largely ceremonial post .
an electoral college is set to meet at the end of the month to decide between wulff and the opposition 's candidate , joachim gauck , a widely respected figure .

this comes as the opposition is turning up the heat on merkel 's coalition government . in the german cities of berlin and stuttgart , around 25,000 demonstrators marched through the streets to voice disapproval of the federal government 's recently announced austerity package , which consists of cuts primarily in the social-welfare and family-services sectors .
the march was organized by trade unions and left-wing opposition groups under the motto : " this is not social justice . "
police estimated that up 10,000 marched in the southwestern city of stuttgart while organizers in berlin said between 15,000 and 20,000 people took to the streets there .
protesters carried banners saying " the crisis is called capitalism " and " employment , human rights , a secure future for everyone . "
in the face of widespread criticism of the austerity measures which are supposed to bring germany 's deficit within european union limits by 2013 , chancellor angela merkel rejected charges that the country 's poor were being unfairly burdened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is getting heat from all sides over her budget-cutting plans " people must realize that we have to save money and reduce debt , " merkel said in an interview to be published on sunday in the mass-circulation bild am sonntag weekly , adding that the " measures in the job sector aim to bring significantly more long-term unemployed back to work than in the past . "
she added that the package - which looks to slash federal spending by at least 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 96 billion -rrb- by 2014 - was evenly distributed throughout the country 's sectors .
" alongside the necessary cuts in the social-welfare budget , business is also making a contribution along with the civil-service and administrative departments , " she said .
but a new poll by infratest dimap showed that 79 percent of germans thought the savings package was not socially balanced and 93 percent thought measures were not enough to meet the government 's savings goal .
opposition demands snap elections germany 's opposition , led by the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , intensified its criticism of merkel 's center-right coalition , with spd parliamentary leader frank-walter steinmeier even calling for snap elections on saturday .

political analysts in germany are calling it critical for merkel 's government to have her candidate , lower saxony state premier christian wulff , chosen as president , which in itself is a largely ceremonial post .
an electoral college is set to meet at the end of the month to decide between wulff and the opposition 's candidate , joachim gauck , a widely respected figure .

but how is it going to provide them ? defense ministers wrapping up a two-day nato summit in brussels welcomed improvements in the security situation in afghanistan , but also acknowledged the need for member countries to provide more military trainers to work with afghan troops .
" we welcomed the significant improvement in the capability of the afghan national security forces , and are committed to providing the trainers needed to support that steady progress , " ministers said in a joint declaration on friday .
but the ministers did n't commit to offering specific numbers of troops .
the nato-led international security assistance force includes about 120,000 soldiers from 28 nato member states - including germany - and another 18 allies .
but the training mission lacks about 20 percent of the personnel it needs - a shortfall of 450 trainers .
in february , the german parliament voted to send up to 850 troops in addition to the 4,300 already there .
it also agreed to send extra police trainers and to increase the proportion of troops focusing on training from 280 to 1,400 .
an expanding role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany recently agreed to increase its number of police trainers nato 's secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , told reporters that training would likely play a growing role in the defense alliance 's future missions .
" it 's quite a new thing for nato allies to engage in such training missions ...
we have to adapt our alliance to this new task to train and educate local forces in a country like afghanistan , and i think we will deal with this aspect in the new strategic concept , " rasmussen said after the talks .
rasmussen said that allies were ready to help , but stymied by a lack of qualified officers who could do the training .
in the defense ministers final statement , they hailed " measured progress " in the nine-year war while noting that " significant challenges remain , and success is not yet assured . "
" operations across afghanistan are making measured progress in extending the reach of the afghan government , changing the political conditions , and marginalizing the insurgency , " the ministers said in a statement .

victoria falls is known as mosi oa-tunya or " the smoke that thunders " " the train ?
you 're taking the train ?
good luck , " they said .
everyone i mentioned it to seemed incredulous .
some insisted on driving me , others offered their 4x4s , one suggested a friend who owned a small plane .
i had been working in bulawayo for a week and had a few days free before heading home .
i was determined to have a night on the train and then a day visiting the one feature that still lures foreign visitors to zimbabwe - the victoria falls .
as recently as a decade ago , the bulawayo-vic falls sleeper was a key part of the central africa backpacker circuit , something to tick off a long list .
that is not the case any longer .
since 2000 , zimbabwe 's once-vital tourist industry has all but collapsed .
my friend and i were the only europeans in the line for tickets .
' stand clear ' the journey takes five hours by road .
by train it is scheduled to take 11 .
" so we 'll arrive around seven ? "
i asked the friendly ticket office clerk .
" you 'll certainly be in by 10 , " she answered , smiling .
that evening , clutching food , water and wine , i was back at bulawayo station .
an old , illuminated advertisement for gilbey 's gin helped light platform one .
easy listening music was piped through the loudspeakers and on platform four , sat the night train to victoria falls .
the carriages , built in birmingham in 1951 , were already packed and in total darkness .
as hawkers sold clothes , toys and mobile phone credits , families loaded parcels on board .
my compartment was in car 1068 .
as i approached , a man in a white tuxedo stepped out into the chaos of the platform and introduced himself as the night steward .
he was apologetic about the lack of electricity but was keen to show me the fold-down tin basin in the corner of the carriage .
then he solemnly apologised again for the fact there was no longer running water .
we pulled out at exactly 2000 , the well-spoken station announcer urging those not travelling to " stand clear " .
bygone days like so many elements of the surviving infrastructure of zimbabwe , the compartment was a reminder of times when this was a rich , productive country .
framed pictures hung on the teak panelling .
i walked the length of the train , to find the driver looking anxiously at his engine , its front wheels six inches clear of the track one was a view of bulawayo , smoke emerging from the six power station chimneys that form a famous part of the city 's skyline .
now zimbabwe has to export most of the limited amount of coal it produces and the cooling towers lie dormant .
another photo showed a train rolling through fertile agricultural land .
not far out of bulawayo our train passed near several formerly white-owned farms , seized by so-called war veterans .
in the moonlight a few small patches of tall maize created long shadows .
but this was mere subsistence farming , untended .
most of the fields were quickly turning back into scrubland .
clutching pangas pounds of fine fillet dripping with blood were stuffed into dirty white plastic bags through the night i slept fitfully , woken by shouting at remote stations as well as crashes and scrapes from the elderly train who lurched forward .
by dawn we were well on the way north , when suddenly we braked violently and ground to a halt .
a great cloud of acrid smoke blew back from the engine .
" buffalo ! " someone shouted : " we 've hit one . "
i quickly dressed and walked the length of the train to find the driver looking anxiously at his engine , its front wheels six inches clear of the track .
it turned out we had hit seven buffalo - all of them dead - their final act , to derail the victoria falls express .
within half an hour of the crash , locals arrived clutching pangas and started hacking away at the carcasses .
whole legs of meat were carried off over the shoulder and pounds of fine fillet dripping with blood were stuffed into dirty white plastic bags .
i went to look for the steward to see how long we might be stuck .
i found him in an empty compartment , white jacket long gone , frying up his breakfast over a gas canister stove .
he was vague .
" game on the tracks is a common problem , " he said , though full derailment was , he admitted , unusual .
scattered bones in the cutting where we had stopped , women and children gathered twigs , lit fires , and soon a dozen impromptu barbecues lined the length of the train .
the train can often hit buffalo and elephants on its cross-country journey i was offered a taste of the meat , blackened on the outside , rare within .
the buffalo meat was tough and fibrous , which was not surprising as it had been alive little more than an hour earlier .
some seasoning might have been nice but this was certainly one of the more exotic forms of railway catering i have ever encountered .
at least the buffalo did not die in vain .
by the time a rescue train arrived , several hours later , there was little of them left , save for odd piles of offal and bones scattered over the concrete railway sleepers .
everything edible had been carried off to the pots and fires of the remote trackside villages .
we eventually arrived at victoria falls at lunchtime after a 17-hour journey through the heart of today 's zimbabwe .
