analysts say the government needs to find a less hard-line approach . the battle between the thai government and the opposition red shirts , who support former president thaksin shinawatra , that took over the streets of bangkok earlier this year came to an end on may 19 when troops dispersed the crowds . the violence and bloodshed left some 90 people dead and more than 1,400 injured .
now the battlefront has changed with attacks against the government continuing on thai and english-language websites .
however , making use of the computer crime act and the emergency decree , the government has recently shut down thousands of websites , which have been critical of the administration and the royal family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the past state control of the media has been limited to criticism of the thai king bhumibol adulyadej " we have been implementing regulations on communication systems , based on national security like in many countries , " panitan wattanayagorn , the thai government spokesman , recently explained . " we regulate these activities in such a way that they do not harm our national interests .
specific activities may not be allowed on those websites . "
government control of media has shifted focus in the past , most government control of the media and the internet has been related to the royal family . however , media activist supinya klanarong says there has been a shift in focus since the protests . " after the conflict and the state of emergency , censorship has been extended to politics as well .
this means general opposition websites related to the red shirt movement or critics of the government are also being blocked . " pro-red shirt website blocked one news website that has been blocked several times this year is prachatai.com.
red shirt supporters had discussed the protests openly on its discussion board .
however , the government only succeeded in shutting the site down temporarily , with the website circumventing the government controls by changing its server and by using another url .
prachatai.com 's director , chiranuch premchaporn , who has been charged under the computer crimes act , says the discussion board was shut down in july .
she says there is a need to balance the interests of writers and the government . " even if i believe in freedom of expression , i understand there should be some limitations .
we should set up a system to moderate content that can be considered to violate the rights of the people or the law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 100 people were killed in political violence in may legal reform needed chris baker , an author and commentator on thai politics and business calls for " a cooperative framework in which all the parties are involved .
instead the government is using various forms of rather draconian legislation – the computer crimes act , the emergency decree .
at present , this is being rather inflammatory because people do n't like being closed down in this way .
and it 's also relatively ineffective . "
media groups are warning that intimidating web users and closing down sites may backfire against the government and lead to a radicalization of those who post comments online . chris baker says legal reform is needed to overcome the problem and to " control things in a permanent way as it 's very unsatisfactory for all sides at the moment .

as berlin remembers the event , new figures suggest more people than previously thought were killed on the inner german border from 1961-1989 . berlin commemorated on friday the 49th anniversary of the day the east german government began building the berlin wall . a memorial service was held at the chapel of reconciliation in the former death strip .
mayor klaus wowereit laid a wreath at the bernauer strasse memorial , in remembrance of those who were killed by gdr border guards . " it teaches us a lesson , " wowereit said .
" time and again , it is important to stand decisively against authoritarian regimes and dictatorships . " he urged that the memory of the berlin wall must sharpen appreciation of contemporary freedom and democracy . among a number of services held in berlin on friday , a street is to be renamed in memory of chris gueffroy , recognized as the last person killed trying to cross the border . greater number killed according to the official site that commemorates the berlin wall in the district of mitte , at least 136 people were killed by the east german border patrol while trying to escape from east to west berlin between 1961 and 1989 . but that 's not the whole story .
new figures from the privately-run wall museum , located at the former checkpoint charlie border crossing in berlin , say the total number of people who died trying to escape from east to west germany during those 28 years is 1,393 . " the number has risen by 46 compared with our research last year , " alexandra hildebrandt , chairwoman of the wall museum told deutsche welle . " the list includes those who died at the berlin wall , the baltic sea , the inner german border and neighboring countries like poland , bulgaria , czechoslovakia and hungary .
it also includes east german soldiers , for example those who committed suicide because they could n't deal with the regime , " she said . bildunterschrift : the wall became the symbol of the cold war tragic deaths one of those soldiers , whose suicide has only just come to light , took his own life just hours after construction on the wall had started .
" i cried all night when i read this , " hildebrandt said .
" he shot himself and left his wife a note saying : ' i ca n't do this anymore , i 'm too weak , forgive me , it 's better that way ' . "
in the early hours of august 13 , 1961 , the east german government took the west by surprise and ordered its army and police to stop all travel between east and west berlin and start work on the wall that would divide berlin until 1989 .
even the us secret service did not know of the project .
two months earlier , the east german leader walter ulbricht , head of the east german communist party -lrb- sed -rrb- , openly denied rumors that such a project was underway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germany had denied it was planning to build a wall on august 24 that year , just 11 days after the work on the wall had started , the first person was shot dead trying to escape .
guenter liftin 's murder shocked the world , but erich honecker , who was head of security then and would later become east germany 's leader and head of the sed , remained defiant .
" the building of the anti-fascist protective barrier stabilized the situation in europe and secured peace , " he said a desperate act in reality , the east german regime was in crisis .
by 1961 , 2.7 million people had decided to leave the country and live in the west .
communist ideology was starting to lose its luster , damaging the economy in the process .
in his famous ' ich bin ein berliner ' speech in 1963 in west berlin , then us president john f. kennedy described the berlin wall as " the most vivid and obvious demonstration of the failures of the communist system . "
today , 21 years after the wall came down , many are still afraid to talk about their own or their relatives ' experiences .
" they are still afraid , they are dominated by fear , possibly their whole lives , because the gdr was a dictatorship .
it was like a big prison , where people were afraid to talk , afraid to live , essentially , " hildebrandt told deutsche welle .
honecker firmly believed the wall would stand for 50 or even 100 years .
but the east german regime was powerless against the will of its people and a reform-oriented soviet union , which eventually , led to the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 .

secularists demand it be taken away from the presidential palace . supporters of late polish president lech kaczynski 's law and justice party have remained defiant in their vigil at the site of a cross erected in memory of their late hero - despite calls from church leaders to allow its removal .
those loyal to the former president see him as defender of polish roman catholic values and say that the cross should remain outside the presidential palace in a warsaw square until a more permanent structure is found for the site .
church officials have said that it is time for supporters to give up the fight - warning that they are being manipulated for political , not religious , reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secularists say the palace is not the place for a cross " to all those who pray at the cross we must say that - despite their good intentions - they are being exploited for political purposes .
we urge everyone to make the transfer of the cross possible , " press secretary for the polish episcopate , bishop stanislaw budzik , told reporters in warsaw on thursday .
the palace , now occupied by president bronislaw komorowski , unveiled a plaque on thursday commemorating the tragedy on the facade of a side-wing to the building .
a first attempt to move the cross - initially to a church in the old part of the city and later to a shrine in the south of the country - met with fierce opposition on august 3 .
both the church and the scout group that first erected the four-meter -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- wooden cross had agreed to the plan .
facebook campaign and rally but opposition is mounting to the cross staying in place .
secularists - many of them younger , and opposed to the policies of the former president - rallied on monday in response to a facebook campaign to have the cross removed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some think jaroslaw kaczynski is using the dispute for political capital by midnight , several thousand had gathered in front of the presidential palace chanting the slogan , " to a church ! "
the cross was spontaneously erected after the april 10 crash of the presidential plane in western russia , killing the president , his wife and 94 others .
as well as highlighting religious divisions , the row is indicative of the political tensions currently simmering in the country .
some critics of former president kaczynski were unhappy with his right-wing politics and traditional approach to family values .
opponents also say his nationalist and euroskeptic policies placed poland on an isolationist course within the european union .
current president komorowski is expected to take the country in a more pro-european direction .
commentators say kaczynski 's twin brother jaroslaw , who has called for the cross to stay in place , is possibly using the issue as a political weapon to gain support before the country 's parliamentary elections in 2011 .

analysts say the government needs to find a less hard-line approach . the battle between the thai government and the opposition red shirts , who support former president thaksin shinawatra , that took over the streets of bangkok earlier this year came to an end on may 19 when troops dispersed the crowds . the violence and bloodshed left some 90 people dead and more than 1,400 injured .
now the battlefront has changed with attacks against the government continuing on thai and english-language websites .
however , making use of the computer crime act and the emergency decree , the government has recently shut down thousands of websites , which have been critical of the administration and the royal family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the past state control of the media has been limited to criticism of the thai king bhumibol adulyadej " we have been implementing regulations on communication systems , based on national security like in many countries , " panitan wattanayagorn , the thai government spokesman , recently explained . " we regulate these activities in such a way that they do not harm our national interests .
specific activities may not be allowed on those websites . "
government control of media has shifted focus in the past , most government control of the media and the internet has been related to the royal family . however , media activist supinya klanarong says there has been a shift in focus since the protests . " after the conflict and the state of emergency , censorship has been extended to politics as well .
this means general opposition websites related to the red shirt movement or critics of the government are also being blocked . " pro-red shirt website blocked one news website that has been blocked several times this year is prachatai.com.
red shirt supporters had discussed the protests openly on its discussion board .
however , the government only succeeded in shutting the site down temporarily , with the website circumventing the government controls by changing its server and by using another url .
prachatai.com 's director , chiranuch premchaporn , who has been charged under the computer crimes act , says the discussion board was shut down in july .
she says there is a need to balance the interests of writers and the government . " even if i believe in freedom of expression , i understand there should be some limitations .
we should set up a system to moderate content that can be considered to violate the rights of the people or the law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 100 people were killed in political violence in may legal reform needed chris baker , an author and commentator on thai politics and business calls for " a cooperative framework in which all the parties are involved .
instead the government is using various forms of rather draconian legislation – the computer crimes act , the emergency decree .
at present , this is being rather inflammatory because people do n't like being closed down in this way .
and it 's also relatively ineffective . "
media groups are warning that intimidating web users and closing down sites may backfire against the government and lead to a radicalization of those who post comments online . chris baker says legal reform is needed to overcome the problem and to " control things in a permanent way as it 's very unsatisfactory for all sides at the moment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 12.08.2010 german town attracts medical tourists from arab nations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elisees clinic attracts patients from the middle east health tourism is a booming business in germany .
one in five medical tourists choose to visit clinics in bad godesberg , just south of bonn .
the town is especially popular with patients from the middle east . once upon a time when bonn was the capital of west germany , the nearby town of bad godesberg was home to many diplomats - almost all the ambassadors ' residences were located there .
today bad godesberg has become a magnet for arabs , not due to its diplomatic history , but for the healthcare services it offers .
the elisees clinic , in particular , has gained a shining reputation in the arab world .
recently , sheik abdulrahman al muftah from qatar set up an appointment at the clinic for 9 o 'clock .
but it was just before 10:30 that his car turned the corner - a simple blue vw family van .
not exactly the kind of vehicle the medical staff expects a middle eastern sheik to arrive in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sheik abdulrahman al mufti says german clinics have a good reputation a rather squat gentlemen gets out of the car , followed by his wife , dressed in a black burqa .
the sheik is n't wearing a caftan , since in germany he dresses to fit in .
today he 's sporting beige bermuda shorts and white socks with sandals .
he warmly shakes the hands of everyone present .
" i 'm sorry , i knew nothing about an appointment at 9 o 'clock , " he jokes while saying hello to the chief surgeon , natalia brenner .
different customs brenner waves the couple inside , smiling to herself - she knows the drill .
the clinic sees about 3,000 patients a year from the middle east , and during that time , she 's learned a lot about interacting with people from this part of the world .
" arab patients are a special clientele .
they are nice and kind , but they have their ways , " she says .
" for example , they always come late for appointments and then they usually take over our entire clinic . "
brenner has also learned that women from the arab world are not introduced by their own names , and that the price for an operation is often considered negotiable .
while she 's gotten used to most customs , there 's one she still has a hard time with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief surgeon natalia brenner has gotten used to most arab customs " the role of women , that 's something i still do n't understand , " she says .
" it is still strange for me to see that men make the decisions for arab women . "
sheik abdulrahman is no exception .
while his wife , sitting in an examination chair , might be the one about to undergo an operation , he 's the one who will have the final say .
brenner points to an ultrasound image and explains the details of the operation that will treat his wife 's varicose veins .
during the discussion , which takes place through an interpreter because the sheik does n't speak or understand german , his wife carefully watches her husband 's reactions .
despite the language barrier , comprehension is not a problem today in the elisee clinic .
nadhmi nefzi , a young man who follows the sheikh around like a shadow , is responsible for the interpreting at the clinic - he 's the clinic 's personal assistant .
he is dressed in a neat shirt , has carefully parted hair and is the model of discretion .
the young man translates the discussion into arabic , taking special care with the many medical terms .
sheik abdulrahman nods and looks at dr brenner - she can operate on his wife now .
he 's going to take a stroll through the city with nefzi .
known for its health care these kinds of health trips , the sheik says , cost a lot of money .
but as a professor of marine biology and a bank owner , he can afford it .
he 's been coming to germany for over 20 years ; recently , always to bad godesberg .
the sheik explains that the town 's clinics have acquired glowing reputations in the arab world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the whole family comes on these health trips " in the meantime , i 've gotten to know many doctors here , " he laughs .
" i 've become friends with a lot of them and even get special treatment . "
the doctors in bad godesberg are even recommended by the health section of the qatari embassy .
that 's common in arab countries , he says , strolling along the storefront windows of the city .
tailored to a new clientele a little while ago , munich was considered the place to go for medical care , but bad godesberg has knocked the bavarians off their perch , especially since many clinics here have tailored their services to a middle eastern clientele .
" and it 's quiet and safe and my family feels at home because there are so many other arabs here , " referring to those with diplomatic ties who did not move to berlin when the german government shifted capitals .
the sheik points to signs on local shops - the pharmacy , a jewelry store , a café and a souvenir shop - written in arabic .
personal assistant nefzi nods .
in addition to his translation duties he is also charged with making appointments to see high-end apartments .
arabs can be very discerning , he says .
" it 's very important that the environment is clean and that the apartment is representative of germany , " nefzi says .
" they want to have something to talk about back home . "
most health-related visitors from the middle east choose not to stay in hotels .
they consider the rooms impersonal and prefer to be able to prepare their own food .
once the stroll around town is done , the sheik returns to the clinic and waits for his wife to be released from the operating room .
the doctors report the procedure went well .
now it 's time to go shopping , but not in bad godesberg .
the family will have to head over to the bigger cities of cologne or dusseldorf , where they can visit shops with a selection of middle eastern foods wide enough to fit their discerning tastes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 12.08.2010 east germany was ready to attack west berlin , documentary says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eerie place of cold war confrontation - checkpoint charlie in the divided berlin a film aired on german television on thursday revealed how serious east germany was about taking control of west berlin .
plans for a military attack existed right up to the end of the regime . through the decades of berlin 's division , many west berliners had an inkling that east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- that surrounded their part of the city would at some stage be seeking to conquer it .
a tv documentary , " der fall x " -lrb- the case of x -rrb- , shown by germany 's public broadcaster rbb finally proved them right .
in the most comprehensive footage on east germany 's conquest plans so far , two filmmakers , supported by military experts , tell a fascinating story about how the defunct state planned to overrun west berlin in only three days .
" as far as we can tell , the planning was quite serious , " german military historian winfried heinemann told deutsche welle .
" but whether they would have managed to take the city within three days is another question . "
superior numbers heinemann pointed out that the western allies were quite serious about defending west berlin from a ground attack .
but he acknowledged that next to nothing was known about any defense strategies as the relevant documents are still classified .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahr knew that west berlin was never really a safe place egon bahr , a former west berlin radio commentator and later adviser to west german chancellor willy brandt , argued that the gdr 's national people 's army troops , and those of the soviet union deployed in the region , would have outnumbered the soldiers from the western allies by far .
" in the event of an attack , our defenses could have been maintained for no more than five to seven hours , " bahr concluded .
the plans found in the files of the east german secret police , the gdr army and the soviet military command reveal some details as to how the attackers would have gone about their job .
a detailed map available to the filmmakers showed the most important installations and infrastructure compounds in west berlin , which would have been targeted first .
among them were strategically important bridges that the french , british and us allies used to move around as well as airports and train stations .
a second phase of the operation would have included the imprisonment of leading west berlin politicians , policemen , public servants and journalists .
a corresponding list of names was updated by the gdr leadership several times until the collapse of the regime in 1989 .
a diehard obsession the research done by military historian winfried heinemann also revealed that plans to attack west berlin were , surprisingly , only developed fully in the early 1970s - a time when political relations between the two german states were in the process of improving considerably .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr soldiers trained for an attack as late as 1988 " whether it was just a question of the gdr military having grown up enough to feel fit for the job - we do n't really know , " said heinemann .
" but considering that the whole military posture of the gdr was kept up right until 1989 , it 's at least no surprise that the planning for an attack went on until the very end . "
in fact , east germany 's national people 's army -lrb- nva -rrb- carried out military maneuvers as late as 1988 to train for the takeover of west berlin .
exercises took place in the east german town of magdeburg some 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- west of berlin .
the training ground was designed to look as if the target territory were divided up between a french , british and us brigade , which reflected the fact the west berlin was seperated into sectors occupied by those three countries .
one year later , the berlin wall fell , and east german intelligence managed to destroy most of the documents regarding the gdr 's hostile intentions toward west berlin .

as berlin remembers the event , new figures suggest more people than previously thought were killed on the inner german border from 1961-1989 . berlin commemorated on friday the 49th anniversary of the day the east german government began building the berlin wall . a memorial service was held at the chapel of reconciliation in the former death strip .
mayor klaus wowereit laid a wreath at the bernauer strasse memorial , in remembrance of those who were killed by gdr border guards . " it teaches us a lesson , " wowereit said .
" time and again , it is important to stand decisively against authoritarian regimes and dictatorships . " he urged that the memory of the berlin wall must sharpen appreciation of contemporary freedom and democracy . among a number of services held in berlin on friday , a street is to be renamed in memory of chris gueffroy , recognized as the last person killed trying to cross the border . greater number killed according to the official site that commemorates the berlin wall in the district of mitte , at least 136 people were killed by the east german border patrol while trying to escape from east to west berlin between 1961 and 1989 . but that 's not the whole story .
new figures from the privately-run wall museum , located at the former checkpoint charlie border crossing in berlin , say the total number of people who died trying to escape from east to west germany during those 28 years is 1,393 . " the number has risen by 46 compared with our research last year , " alexandra hildebrandt , chairwoman of the wall museum told deutsche welle . " the list includes those who died at the berlin wall , the baltic sea , the inner german border and neighboring countries like poland , bulgaria , czechoslovakia and hungary .
it also includes east german soldiers , for example those who committed suicide because they could n't deal with the regime , " she said . bildunterschrift : the wall became the symbol of the cold war tragic deaths one of those soldiers , whose suicide has only just come to light , took his own life just hours after construction on the wall had started .
" i cried all night when i read this , " hildebrandt said .
" he shot himself and left his wife a note saying : ' i ca n't do this anymore , i 'm too weak , forgive me , it 's better that way ' . "
in the early hours of august 13 , 1961 , the east german government took the west by surprise and ordered its army and police to stop all travel between east and west berlin and start work on the wall that would divide berlin until 1989 .
even the us secret service did not know of the project .
two months earlier , the east german leader walter ulbricht , head of the east german communist party -lrb- sed -rrb- , openly denied rumors that such a project was underway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germany had denied it was planning to build a wall on august 24 that year , just 11 days after the work on the wall had started , the first person was shot dead trying to escape .
guenter liftin 's murder shocked the world , but erich honecker , who was head of security then and would later become east germany 's leader and head of the sed , remained defiant .
" the building of the anti-fascist protective barrier stabilized the situation in europe and secured peace , " he said a desperate act in reality , the east german regime was in crisis .
by 1961 , 2.7 million people had decided to leave the country and live in the west .
communist ideology was starting to lose its luster , damaging the economy in the process .
in his famous ' ich bin ein berliner ' speech in 1963 in west berlin , then us president john f. kennedy described the berlin wall as " the most vivid and obvious demonstration of the failures of the communist system . "
today , 21 years after the wall came down , many are still afraid to talk about their own or their relatives ' experiences .
" they are still afraid , they are dominated by fear , possibly their whole lives , because the gdr was a dictatorship .
it was like a big prison , where people were afraid to talk , afraid to live , essentially , " hildebrandt told deutsche welle .
honecker firmly believed the wall would stand for 50 or even 100 years .
but the east german regime was powerless against the will of its people and a reform-oriented soviet union , which eventually , led to the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 .

as berlin remembers the event , new figures suggest more people than previously thought were killed on the inner german border from 1961-1989 . berlin commemorated on friday the 49th anniversary of the day the east german government began building the berlin wall . a memorial service was held at the chapel of reconciliation in the former death strip .
mayor klaus wowereit laid a wreath at the bernauer strasse memorial , in remembrance of those who were killed by gdr border guards . " it teaches us a lesson , " wowereit said .
" time and again , it is important to stand decisively against authoritarian regimes and dictatorships . " he urged that the memory of the berlin wall must sharpen appreciation of contemporary freedom and democracy . among a number of services held in berlin on friday , a street is to be renamed in memory of chris gueffroy , recognized as the last person killed trying to cross the border . greater number killed according to the official site that commemorates the berlin wall in the district of mitte , at least 136 people were killed by the east german border patrol while trying to escape from east to west berlin between 1961 and 1989 . but that 's not the whole story .
new figures from the privately-run wall museum , located at the former checkpoint charlie border crossing in berlin , say the total number of people who died trying to escape from east to west germany during those 28 years is 1,393 . " the number has risen by 46 compared with our research last year , " alexandra hildebrandt , chairwoman of the wall museum told deutsche welle . " the list includes those who died at the berlin wall , the baltic sea , the inner german border and neighboring countries like poland , bulgaria , czechoslovakia and hungary .
it also includes east german soldiers , for example those who committed suicide because they could n't deal with the regime , " she said . bildunterschrift : the wall became the symbol of the cold war tragic deaths one of those soldiers , whose suicide has only just come to light , took his own life just hours after construction on the wall had started .
" i cried all night when i read this , " hildebrandt said .
" he shot himself and left his wife a note saying : ' i ca n't do this anymore , i 'm too weak , forgive me , it 's better that way ' . "
in the early hours of august 13 , 1961 , the east german government took the west by surprise and ordered its army and police to stop all travel between east and west berlin and start work on the wall that would divide berlin until 1989 .
even the us secret service did not know of the project .
two months earlier , the east german leader walter ulbricht , head of the east german communist party -lrb- sed -rrb- , openly denied rumors that such a project was underway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germany had denied it was planning to build a wall on august 24 that year , just 11 days after the work on the wall had started , the first person was shot dead trying to escape .
guenter liftin 's murder shocked the world , but erich honecker , who was head of security then and would later become east germany 's leader and head of the sed , remained defiant .
" the building of the anti-fascist protective barrier stabilized the situation in europe and secured peace , " he said a desperate act in reality , the east german regime was in crisis .
by 1961 , 2.7 million people had decided to leave the country and live in the west .
communist ideology was starting to lose its luster , damaging the economy in the process .
in his famous ' ich bin ein berliner ' speech in 1963 in west berlin , then us president john f. kennedy described the berlin wall as " the most vivid and obvious demonstration of the failures of the communist system . "
today , 21 years after the wall came down , many are still afraid to talk about their own or their relatives ' experiences .
" they are still afraid , they are dominated by fear , possibly their whole lives , because the gdr was a dictatorship .
it was like a big prison , where people were afraid to talk , afraid to live , essentially , " hildebrandt told deutsche welle .
honecker firmly believed the wall would stand for 50 or even 100 years .
but the east german regime was powerless against the will of its people and a reform-oriented soviet union , which eventually , led to the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 .

the un has appealed for $ 460 million -lrb- 360 million euros -rrb- in aid . two weeks after the floods struck , the extent of the catastrophe remains unclear .
hundreds of roads and bridges have been destroyed , making it difficult to reach the flooded areas by anything but air .
the us military has tripled the number of its helicopters in pakistan to help with the relief efforts . on wednesday , john holmes , the un emergency relief coordinator , appealed for help from the member states of the united nations in new york . " ladies and gentlemen , assessment of losses or damages are still underway as you can imagine but it 's already very clear that these floods – the worst in pakistan for over 80 years have caused and are continuing to cause immense destruction and immense suffering , " he said gravely . " scale of disaster is horrendous " pakistan 's un ambassador abdullah hussain haroon told the un it was hard to confirm the number of deaths .
" the scale of this disaster is horrendous , " he stated . "
so far we have lost , in the three northern provinces , 4772 villages completely - just gone - that 's why we do n't know what the death toll is because we have no way of calculating at the moment .

they need food , clothes , shelter and clean drinking water .
moreover , they urgently need medical assistance " as the incidence of acute diarrhea and other water-borne diseases is rising worryingly , " according to john holmes . " cholera is also breaking out , " abdullah hussain haroon explained .
" that is going to be very dangerous .
drinking water and sachets for purifying it are going to become very important over the next few days . " death toll could rapidly rise even if the death toll from this disaster is not as high yet as from the 2004 tsunami or january 's earthquake in haiti , the un has warned that disease and food shortages could fast become deadly if the urgent needs of the people are not attended to . in pakistan itself , despite president zardari 's visit to the flooded areas on thursday , victims continued to complain about the slow response to the disaster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whole villages have been evacuated because of heavy flooding this man in khyber pakhtunkhwa spoke for thousands when he spoke to reporters : " we have been on the roadside for the past 12 days , we need food and tents but we have n't received food or tents . " on wednesday , john holmes ended his appeal with a warning that the destruction was far from over : " far from it .
having already affected the north of the country in late july and early august , the flood wave now continues to make its way through the southern province of sindh where millions more are expected to suffer from the combined impact of continuing torrential rains .

secularists demand it be taken away from the presidential palace . supporters of late polish president lech kaczynski 's law and justice party have remained defiant in their vigil at the site of a cross erected in memory of their late hero - despite calls from church leaders to allow its removal .
those loyal to the former president see him as defender of polish roman catholic values and say that the cross should remain outside the presidential palace in a warsaw square until a more permanent structure is found for the site .
church officials have said that it is time for supporters to give up the fight - warning that they are being manipulated for political , not religious , reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secularists say the palace is not the place for a cross " to all those who pray at the cross we must say that - despite their good intentions - they are being exploited for political purposes .

the palace , now occupied by president bronislaw komorowski , unveiled a plaque on thursday commemorating the tragedy on the facade of a side-wing to the building .
a first attempt to move the cross - initially to a church in the old part of the city and later to a shrine in the south of the country - met with fierce opposition on august 3 .

as well as highlighting religious divisions , the row is indicative of the political tensions currently simmering in the country .
some critics of former president kaczynski were unhappy with his right-wing politics and traditional approach to family values .
opponents also say his nationalist and euroskeptic policies placed poland on an isolationist course within the european union .
current president komorowski is expected to take the country in a more pro-european direction .
commentators say kaczynski 's twin brother jaroslaw , who has called for the cross to stay in place , is possibly using the issue as a political weapon to gain support before the country 's parliamentary elections in 2011 .

one in five medical tourists choose to visit clinics in bad godesberg , just south of bonn .
the town is especially popular with patients from the middle east . once upon a time when bonn was the capital of west germany , the nearby town of bad godesberg was home to many diplomats - almost all the ambassadors ' residences were located there .
today bad godesberg has become a magnet for arabs , not due to its diplomatic history , but for the healthcare services it offers .
the elisees clinic , in particular , has gained a shining reputation in the arab world .
recently , sheik abdulrahman al muftah from qatar set up an appointment at the clinic for 9 o 'clock .
but it was just before 10:30 that his car turned the corner - a simple blue vw family van .
not exactly the kind of vehicle the medical staff expects a middle eastern sheik to arrive in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sheik abdulrahman al mufti says german clinics have a good reputation a rather squat gentlemen gets out of the car , followed by his wife , dressed in a black burqa .
the sheik is n't wearing a caftan , since in germany he dresses to fit in .
today he 's sporting beige bermuda shorts and white socks with sandals .
he warmly shakes the hands of everyone present .
" i 'm sorry , i knew nothing about an appointment at 9 o 'clock , " he jokes while saying hello to the chief surgeon , natalia brenner .
different customs brenner waves the couple inside , smiling to herself - she knows the drill .
the clinic sees about 3,000 patients a year from the middle east , and during that time , she 's learned a lot about interacting with people from this part of the world .
" arab patients are a special clientele .
they are nice and kind , but they have their ways , " she says .
" for example , they always come late for appointments and then they usually take over our entire clinic . "
brenner has also learned that women from the arab world are not introduced by their own names , and that the price for an operation is often considered negotiable .
while she 's gotten used to most customs , there 's one she still has a hard time with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief surgeon natalia brenner has gotten used to most arab customs " the role of women , that 's something i still do n't understand , " she says .
" it is still strange for me to see that men make the decisions for arab women . "
sheik abdulrahman is no exception .
while his wife , sitting in an examination chair , might be the one about to undergo an operation , he 's the one who will have the final say .
brenner points to an ultrasound image and explains the details of the operation that will treat his wife 's varicose veins .
during the discussion , which takes place through an interpreter because the sheik does n't speak or understand german , his wife carefully watches her husband 's reactions .
despite the language barrier , comprehension is not a problem today in the elisee clinic .
nadhmi nefzi , a young man who follows the sheikh around like a shadow , is responsible for the interpreting at the clinic - he 's the clinic 's personal assistant .
he is dressed in a neat shirt , has carefully parted hair and is the model of discretion .
the young man translates the discussion into arabic , taking special care with the many medical terms .
sheik abdulrahman nods and looks at dr brenner - she can operate on his wife now .
he 's going to take a stroll through the city with nefzi .
known for its health care these kinds of health trips , the sheik says , cost a lot of money .
but as a professor of marine biology and a bank owner , he can afford it .
he 's been coming to germany for over 20 years ; recently , always to bad godesberg .
the sheik explains that the town 's clinics have acquired glowing reputations in the arab world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the whole family comes on these health trips " in the meantime , i 've gotten to know many doctors here , " he laughs .
" i 've become friends with a lot of them and even get special treatment . "
the doctors in bad godesberg are even recommended by the health section of the qatari embassy .
that 's common in arab countries , he says , strolling along the storefront windows of the city .
tailored to a new clientele a little while ago , munich was considered the place to go for medical care , but bad godesberg has knocked the bavarians off their perch , especially since many clinics here have tailored their services to a middle eastern clientele .
" and it 's quiet and safe and my family feels at home because there are so many other arabs here , " referring to those with diplomatic ties who did not move to berlin when the german government shifted capitals .
the sheik points to signs on local shops - the pharmacy , a jewelry store , a café and a souvenir shop - written in arabic .
personal assistant nefzi nods .
in addition to his translation duties he is also charged with making appointments to see high-end apartments .
arabs can be very discerning , he says .
" it 's very important that the environment is clean and that the apartment is representative of germany , " nefzi says .
" they want to have something to talk about back home . "
most health-related visitors from the middle east choose not to stay in hotels .
they consider the rooms impersonal and prefer to be able to prepare their own food .
once the stroll around town is done , the sheik returns to the clinic and waits for his wife to be released from the operating room .
the doctors report the procedure went well .
now it 's time to go shopping , but not in bad godesberg .
the family will have to head over to the bigger cities of cologne or dusseldorf , where they can visit shops with a selection of middle eastern foods wide enough to fit their discerning tastes .

some critics of former president kaczynski were unhappy with his right-wing politics and traditional approach to family values .
opponents also say his nationalist and euroskeptic policies placed poland on an isolationist course within the european union .
current president komorowski is expected to take the country in a more pro-european direction .
commentators say kaczynski 's twin brother jaroslaw , who has called for the cross to stay in place , is possibly using the issue as a political weapon to gain support before the country 's parliamentary elections in 2011 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 12.08.2010 german town attracts medical tourists from arab nations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elisees clinic attracts patients from the middle east health tourism is a booming business in germany .
one in five medical tourists choose to visit clinics in bad godesberg , just south of bonn .
the town is especially popular with patients from the middle east . once upon a time when bonn was the capital of west germany , the nearby town of bad godesberg was home to many diplomats - almost all the ambassadors ' residences were located there .
today bad godesberg has become a magnet for arabs , not due to its diplomatic history , but for the healthcare services it offers .
the elisees clinic , in particular , has gained a shining reputation in the arab world .
recently , sheik abdulrahman al muftah from qatar set up an appointment at the clinic for 9 o 'clock .
but it was just before 10:30 that his car turned the corner - a simple blue vw family van .
not exactly the kind of vehicle the medical staff expects a middle eastern sheik to arrive in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sheik abdulrahman al mufti says german clinics have a good reputation a rather squat gentlemen gets out of the car , followed by his wife , dressed in a black burqa .
the sheik is n't wearing a caftan , since in germany he dresses to fit in .
today he 's sporting beige bermuda shorts and white socks with sandals .
he warmly shakes the hands of everyone present .
" i 'm sorry , i knew nothing about an appointment at 9 o 'clock , " he jokes while saying hello to the chief surgeon , natalia brenner .
different customs brenner waves the couple inside , smiling to herself - she knows the drill .
the clinic sees about 3,000 patients a year from the middle east , and during that time , she 's learned a lot about interacting with people from this part of the world .
" arab patients are a special clientele .
they are nice and kind , but they have their ways , " she says .
" for example , they always come late for appointments and then they usually take over our entire clinic . "
brenner has also learned that women from the arab world are not introduced by their own names , and that the price for an operation is often considered negotiable .
while she 's gotten used to most customs , there 's one she still has a hard time with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief surgeon natalia brenner has gotten used to most arab customs " the role of women , that 's something i still do n't understand , " she says .
" it is still strange for me to see that men make the decisions for arab women . "
sheik abdulrahman is no exception .
while his wife , sitting in an examination chair , might be the one about to undergo an operation , he 's the one who will have the final say .
brenner points to an ultrasound image and explains the details of the operation that will treat his wife 's varicose veins .
during the discussion , which takes place through an interpreter because the sheik does n't speak or understand german , his wife carefully watches her husband 's reactions .
despite the language barrier , comprehension is not a problem today in the elisee clinic .
nadhmi nefzi , a young man who follows the sheikh around like a shadow , is responsible for the interpreting at the clinic - he 's the clinic 's personal assistant .
he is dressed in a neat shirt , has carefully parted hair and is the model of discretion .
the young man translates the discussion into arabic , taking special care with the many medical terms .
sheik abdulrahman nods and looks at dr brenner - she can operate on his wife now .
he 's going to take a stroll through the city with nefzi .
known for its health care these kinds of health trips , the sheik says , cost a lot of money .
but as a professor of marine biology and a bank owner , he can afford it .
he 's been coming to germany for over 20 years ; recently , always to bad godesberg .
the sheik explains that the town 's clinics have acquired glowing reputations in the arab world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the whole family comes on these health trips " in the meantime , i 've gotten to know many doctors here , " he laughs .
" i 've become friends with a lot of them and even get special treatment . "
the doctors in bad godesberg are even recommended by the health section of the qatari embassy .
that 's common in arab countries , he says , strolling along the storefront windows of the city .
tailored to a new clientele a little while ago , munich was considered the place to go for medical care , but bad godesberg has knocked the bavarians off their perch , especially since many clinics here have tailored their services to a middle eastern clientele .
" and it 's quiet and safe and my family feels at home because there are so many other arabs here , " referring to those with diplomatic ties who did not move to berlin when the german government shifted capitals .
the sheik points to signs on local shops - the pharmacy , a jewelry store , a café and a souvenir shop - written in arabic .
personal assistant nefzi nods .
in addition to his translation duties he is also charged with making appointments to see high-end apartments .
arabs can be very discerning , he says .
" it 's very important that the environment is clean and that the apartment is representative of germany , " nefzi says .
" they want to have something to talk about back home . "
most health-related visitors from the middle east choose not to stay in hotels .
they consider the rooms impersonal and prefer to be able to prepare their own food .
once the stroll around town is done , the sheik returns to the clinic and waits for his wife to be released from the operating room .
the doctors report the procedure went well .
now it 's time to go shopping , but not in bad godesberg .
the family will have to head over to the bigger cities of cologne or dusseldorf , where they can visit shops with a selection of middle eastern foods wide enough to fit their discerning tastes .

secularists demand it be taken away from the presidential palace . supporters of late polish president lech kaczynski 's law and justice party have remained defiant in their vigil at the site of a cross erected in memory of their late hero - despite calls from church leaders to allow its removal .
those loyal to the former president see him as defender of polish roman catholic values and say that the cross should remain outside the presidential palace in a warsaw square until a more permanent structure is found for the site .
church officials have said that it is time for supporters to give up the fight - warning that they are being manipulated for political , not religious , reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secularists say the palace is not the place for a cross " to all those who pray at the cross we must say that - despite their good intentions - they are being exploited for political purposes .
we urge everyone to make the transfer of the cross possible , " press secretary for the polish episcopate , bishop stanislaw budzik , told reporters in warsaw on thursday .
the palace , now occupied by president bronislaw komorowski , unveiled a plaque on thursday commemorating the tragedy on the facade of a side-wing to the building .
a first attempt to move the cross - initially to a church in the old part of the city and later to a shrine in the south of the country - met with fierce opposition on august 3 .
both the church and the scout group that first erected the four-meter -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- wooden cross had agreed to the plan .
facebook campaign and rally but opposition is mounting to the cross staying in place .
secularists - many of them younger , and opposed to the policies of the former president - rallied on monday in response to a facebook campaign to have the cross removed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some think jaroslaw kaczynski is using the dispute for political capital by midnight , several thousand had gathered in front of the presidential palace chanting the slogan , " to a church ! "
the cross was spontaneously erected after the april 10 crash of the presidential plane in western russia , killing the president , his wife and 94 others .
as well as highlighting religious divisions , the row is indicative of the political tensions currently simmering in the country .
some critics of former president kaczynski were unhappy with his right-wing politics and traditional approach to family values .
opponents also say his nationalist and euroskeptic policies placed poland on an isolationist course within the european union .
current president komorowski is expected to take the country in a more pro-european direction .
commentators say kaczynski 's twin brother jaroslaw , who has called for the cross to stay in place , is possibly using the issue as a political weapon to gain support before the country 's parliamentary elections in 2011 .

as berlin remembers the event , new figures suggest more people than previously thought were killed on the inner german border from 1961-1989 . berlin commemorated on friday the 49th anniversary of the day the east german government began building the berlin wall . a memorial service was held at the chapel of reconciliation in the former death strip .
mayor klaus wowereit laid a wreath at the bernauer strasse memorial , in remembrance of those who were killed by gdr border guards . " it teaches us a lesson , " wowereit said .
" time and again , it is important to stand decisively against authoritarian regimes and dictatorships . " he urged that the memory of the berlin wall must sharpen appreciation of contemporary freedom and democracy . among a number of services held in berlin on friday , a street is to be renamed in memory of chris gueffroy , recognized as the last person killed trying to cross the border . greater number killed according to the official site that commemorates the berlin wall in the district of mitte , at least 136 people were killed by the east german border patrol while trying to escape from east to west berlin between 1961 and 1989 . but that 's not the whole story .
new figures from the privately-run wall museum , located at the former checkpoint charlie border crossing in berlin , say the total number of people who died trying to escape from east to west germany during those 28 years is 1,393 . " the number has risen by 46 compared with our research last year , " alexandra hildebrandt , chairwoman of the wall museum told deutsche welle . " the list includes those who died at the berlin wall , the baltic sea , the inner german border and neighboring countries like poland , bulgaria , czechoslovakia and hungary .
it also includes east german soldiers , for example those who committed suicide because they could n't deal with the regime , " she said . bildunterschrift : the wall became the symbol of the cold war tragic deaths one of those soldiers , whose suicide has only just come to light , took his own life just hours after construction on the wall had started .
" i cried all night when i read this , " hildebrandt said .
" he shot himself and left his wife a note saying : ' i ca n't do this anymore , i 'm too weak , forgive me , it 's better that way ' . "
in the early hours of august 13 , 1961 , the east german government took the west by surprise and ordered its army and police to stop all travel between east and west berlin and start work on the wall that would divide berlin until 1989 .
even the us secret service did not know of the project .
two months earlier , the east german leader walter ulbricht , head of the east german communist party -lrb- sed -rrb- , openly denied rumors that such a project was underway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germany had denied it was planning to build a wall on august 24 that year , just 11 days after the work on the wall had started , the first person was shot dead trying to escape .
guenter liftin 's murder shocked the world , but erich honecker , who was head of security then and would later become east germany 's leader and head of the sed , remained defiant .
" the building of the anti-fascist protective barrier stabilized the situation in europe and secured peace , " he said a desperate act in reality , the east german regime was in crisis .
by 1961 , 2.7 million people had decided to leave the country and live in the west .
communist ideology was starting to lose its luster , damaging the economy in the process .
in his famous ' ich bin ein berliner ' speech in 1963 in west berlin , then us president john f. kennedy described the berlin wall as " the most vivid and obvious demonstration of the failures of the communist system . "
today , 21 years after the wall came down , many are still afraid to talk about their own or their relatives ' experiences .
" they are still afraid , they are dominated by fear , possibly their whole lives , because the gdr was a dictatorship .
it was like a big prison , where people were afraid to talk , afraid to live , essentially , " hildebrandt told deutsche welle .
honecker firmly believed the wall would stand for 50 or even 100 years .
but the east german regime was powerless against the will of its people and a reform-oriented soviet union , which eventually , led to the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 .

in his work , renowned mexican author guillermo fadanelli portrays the dark side of his home - marked by drugs , prostitution and corruption . guillermo fadanelli , a tall man well over six feet , says he feels naked without his baseball cap on .
baseball is a favorite pastime in the city where he is at home - the largest city in all of latin america . " you ca n't reflect on a city like mexico city or turn it into fiction , " said fadanelli .
the city weighs on him ; it plays a central role in his books - the city with 108,000 taxis and 28,000 busses , and where the telephone books have 5,000 pages .
in mexico city , there 's no city planning worth speaking of , and city limits have long ceased to exist . it 's practically a euphemism to call this mass of concrete and people a city , says fadanelli .
rather than being a place that caters to the residents , it 's much more of an " urban territory , an ensemble of colonies , districts , suburbs - some hospitable , some hostile , " he adds . for fadanelli , mexico city is a " metastasis " that grows at random .
" here , there are people in power who want to make us think that they run this city , " he says , " but it 's a city that ca n't be governed . " bildunterschrift : nearly nine million people live in mexico city - many of them in poverty revolution in mexican storytelling in his novels , guillermo fadanelli conveys the pain of living here - and of being trapped here .
still , he 's not judgemental .
he simply shows reality : the good and the bad , without any moral conclusions . for silvia ruiz , director of the literature department at the universidad iberoamericana , one of the most renowned universities in latin america , fadanelli 's work - particularly his informal style and absence of moral judgement - represents a revolution in the mexican art of storytelling . " he can bring stories to an end wonderfully , " said ruiz , " he 's a writer who 's already secured a place in mexico 's literary history . " fadanelli knows his city so well because he is constantly walking through it .
" the romantic in me likes to walk from north to south in the early morning , " he said .
" i used to take the subway , i used to use all kinds of public transportation , but now i walk . " it takes him more than one and a half hours to walk from his house to the center of town . bildunterschrift : the sprawling city never seems to end the dark side of the city according to the author , corruption has practically become a national sport in mexico .
laws often go unheeded - and ensuring that they do n't is a daily struggle , whether it 's haggling with the taxi driver who demands too much money or with the police officer who is actually supposed to be upholding the laws . corruption and mexico 's crumbling justice system are touched on in fadanelli 's books .
he has experienced the problem first-hand . the author was framed and arrested just as he was about to introduce his novel " rock hudson 's other face " at the book fair in guadalajara . " they put a gram of cocaine in my pocket , accused me and brought me straight to a jail cell and did n't let me call anyone , " said fadanelli .
he spent two days in jail , without being able to place a single call .
after he was finally released , he returned to the book fair and presented his novel . however , no one believed what had happened to him , he said .
everyone thought he was just telling stories to make himself more interesting or to seem tough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guillermo fadanelli was born in mexico city in 1963 " i was really lucky , because it 's a really dangerous city , " said fadanelli .
" its dark side is really dark .
its bright side is beyond compare , but its dark side is horrible - practically hellish . " a love-hate relationship for everyone 's health , it would be better if mexico city did n't exist , fadanelli once wrote .
he would rather not grow old here and would prefer buenos aires or havanna , or even madrid , where he has many friends , or berlin , where he lived for a year . still , after his time in berlin , he was drawn back to mexico city , " as if pulled by a magnet . " some of guillermo fadanelli 's major works in english translation include " see you at breakfast ? " -lrb- 2009 -rrb- , " rock hudson 's other face " -lrb- 2006 -rrb- , and " compare un rifle " -lrb- 2004 -rrb- . author : claudia herrera-pahl -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 12.08.2010 second-stringers give loew food for thought ahead of euro qualifiers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew saw some things he liked but others he clearly did n't with the qualifying stage for the 2012 european championships beginning in september , a number of second-string stars were looking to impress germany coach joachim loew during wednesday 's friendly draw in denmark . for 74 minutes in copenhagen , it looked as though joachim loew had become one of those blessed coaches whose talent pool is such that he can throw a second string of players onto a pitch and get the same type of performance and result as he would have expected his a-listers to produce .
this was a germany team shorn of almost all of its world cup stars and filled with debutants , cameo performers and bit-part players charged with taking on a denmark team smarting from a hugely forgettable summer in south africa .
the danes , while introducing a few unknowns in the hope of kick-starting a new era , still had a number of experienced players on show and with a home crowd behind them , they may have been expected to give germany 's reserves a torrid time .
but despite never playing together as a full team before and in a formation rarely used by loew , the german players slowly started to look comfortable in each other 's company and for the majority of the game , they appeared in little danger of leaving copenhagen without a victory .
while loew is unlikely to ever field this team again or play his regular starters in this tactical shape , a number of players will have improved their chances of joining the first team for the upcoming euro 2012 qualifiers and perhaps the european championships themselves in poland and ukraine in two years time .
der hammer returns to form with added nuances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal one performance that will have given the germany coach food for though was that of thomas hitzlsperger .
given the captain 's armband in the absence of warring skippers philipp lahm and michael ballack , hitzlsperger 's inclusion as germany 's leader in the centre of midfield was just reward for der hammer after fighting back from a severe loss of form .
after losing confidence and his touch at vfb stuttgart – and his place in the germany team – hitzlsperger 's transfer to lazio in january could have been the moment he dropped off germany 's radar .
but despite being overlooked for the world cup , hitzlsperger – now with west ham in the english premiership – has shown the hunger to come back and has recaptured his form .
there was plenty of the marauding midfield work of old but a season in serie a 's less frenetic atmosphere appears to have refined parts of hitzlsperger 's game which contributed to some considering him a blunt instrument .
it was a delicately feigned shot followed by a deft , penetrating pass into the penalty area on 19 minutes that set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal and until he was replaced in the second half , hitzlsperger was a worthy stand-in for bastian schweinsteiger in the conductor 's role .
gentner 's craft catches the eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former wolfsburg star gentner made a good impression playing off hitzlsperger was another player who should have done enough to convince jogi loew to continue his freshening-up of the germany team .
germany 's midfield showed no signs of suffering from the loss of ballack in south africa , and with toni kroos also showing in copenhagen why he could soon be a first team regular , one might think it overly optimistic to think that christian gentner may force his way into the national team 's starting line-up .
while hitzlsperger will certainly give loew a new option in defensive midfield , gentner put on a performance that could see him challenging for a role in the creative trio the germany coach normally deploys behind his lone striker .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder was a livewire throughout .
gentner was mobile , showed great vision and provided a number of killer passes .
drifting across the pitch behind mario gomez and patrick helmes , gentner was consistently probing the danish defensive line .
it was his perfectly timed pass which led to germany 's second goal .
receiving a great pass from jerome boateng on the edge of the area , gentner held the ball up long enough for helmes to time his run before threading a pass between the center-backs and onto helmes ' boot .
the bayer leverkusen striker did the rest .
stand-in strikers score but leave much to be desired bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmes needs the composure he shows with leverkusen helmes , who missed the world cup through injury after a good season with leverkusen , showed signs that he could be a worthy understudy to miroslav klose in the germany attack but the frequency and ease of the opportunities he wasted suggested that he needs more composure at this level and will certainly remain behind klose and thomas mueller in the attacking pecking order in the euro qualifiers .
but gomez , his well taken goal aside , played in a way that only reinforced the opinion that he must have some incriminating photos of his coach in a vault somewhere .
only someone with some nefarious hold over the man who picks the team can continue to get a game when he plays so abjectly .
even in a second-string team , gomez rarely justified his inclusion as an international striker .
elsewhere , there were encouraging signs that christian traesch could make good on his potential and challenge for a consistent role in midfield while toni kroos and marko marin – building on their cameo performances at the world cup – will certainly feature in the euro qualifiers and would be good bets to see increased action at the 2012 tournament .
despite his woeful pass which led to dennis rommedahl pulling a goal back just a minute after helmes put germany 2-0 up , defender serdar tasci had a competent game at left back until that mistake wrecked his confidence .
on the other side of defence , sascha reither was also solid until the final 15 minutes ; although it is unlikely he will ever unseat philipp lahm in the starting line-up .
the makeshift german defence as a whole battled well until the 74th minute when rommedahl 's goal gave denmark belief and shattered that of germany 's back four .
wiese 's strong showing in goal tarnished by late blunder with their two-goal lead slashed in half , germany looked rattled in defence and nervous in attack with gomez and helmes blowing gilt-edged chances to make the score 3-1 in the final ten minutes .
instead , denmark seized their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese kept denmark at bay until the final 15 minutes stand-in keeper tim wiese – who had an excellent game until his defense imploded in front of him – chose to rush out to deal with a dangerous through ball .
finding himself on the edge of his area , the werder bremen stopper was caught in two minds whether to use his hands , choosing instead to chest the ball to mads junker .
the danish striker knocked the ball round the stranded wiese before slotting it into an empty net to complete denmark 's comeback and the german collapse .
it was wiese 's first real mistake of the game but it was glaring one .
with rene adler returning from the injury that kept him from being the number one in south africa , and germany 's world cup keeper manuel neuer enhancing his reputation this summer , even without his 87th minute howler wiese faced an uphill struggle to make ground on his rivals .
it 's likely he 'll remain the third choice throughout the euro qualifiers and beyond .

this was a germany team shorn of almost all of its world cup stars and filled with debutants , cameo performers and bit-part players charged with taking on a denmark team smarting from a hugely forgettable summer in south africa .
the danes , while introducing a few unknowns in the hope of kick-starting a new era , still had a number of experienced players on show and with a home crowd behind them , they may have been expected to give germany 's reserves a torrid time .
but despite never playing together as a full team before and in a formation rarely used by loew , the german players slowly started to look comfortable in each other 's company and for the majority of the game , they appeared in little danger of leaving copenhagen without a victory .
while loew is unlikely to ever field this team again or play his regular starters in this tactical shape , a number of players will have improved their chances of joining the first team for the upcoming euro 2012 qualifiers and perhaps the european championships themselves in poland and ukraine in two years time .
der hammer returns to form with added nuances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal one performance that will have given the germany coach food for though was that of thomas hitzlsperger .
given the captain 's armband in the absence of warring skippers philipp lahm and michael ballack , hitzlsperger 's inclusion as germany 's leader in the centre of midfield was just reward for der hammer after fighting back from a severe loss of form .
after losing confidence and his touch at vfb stuttgart – and his place in the germany team – hitzlsperger 's transfer to lazio in january could have been the moment he dropped off germany 's radar .
but despite being overlooked for the world cup , hitzlsperger – now with west ham in the english premiership – has shown the hunger to come back and has recaptured his form .
there was plenty of the marauding midfield work of old but a season in serie a 's less frenetic atmosphere appears to have refined parts of hitzlsperger 's game which contributed to some considering him a blunt instrument .
it was a delicately feigned shot followed by a deft , penetrating pass into the penalty area on 19 minutes that set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal and until he was replaced in the second half , hitzlsperger was a worthy stand-in for bastian schweinsteiger in the conductor 's role .
gentner 's craft catches the eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former wolfsburg star gentner made a good impression playing off hitzlsperger was another player who should have done enough to convince jogi loew to continue his freshening-up of the germany team .
germany 's midfield showed no signs of suffering from the loss of ballack in south africa , and with toni kroos also showing in copenhagen why he could soon be a first team regular , one might think it overly optimistic to think that christian gentner may force his way into the national team 's starting line-up .
while hitzlsperger will certainly give loew a new option in defensive midfield , gentner put on a performance that could see him challenging for a role in the creative trio the germany coach normally deploys behind his lone striker .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder was a livewire throughout .
gentner was mobile , showed great vision and provided a number of killer passes .
drifting across the pitch behind mario gomez and patrick helmes , gentner was consistently probing the danish defensive line .
it was his perfectly timed pass which led to germany 's second goal .
receiving a great pass from jerome boateng on the edge of the area , gentner held the ball up long enough for helmes to time his run before threading a pass between the center-backs and onto helmes ' boot .
the bayer leverkusen striker did the rest .
stand-in strikers score but leave much to be desired bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmes needs the composure he shows with leverkusen helmes , who missed the world cup through injury after a good season with leverkusen , showed signs that he could be a worthy understudy to miroslav klose in the germany attack but the frequency and ease of the opportunities he wasted suggested that he needs more composure at this level and will certainly remain behind klose and thomas mueller in the attacking pecking order in the euro qualifiers .
but gomez , his well taken goal aside , played in a way that only reinforced the opinion that he must have some incriminating photos of his coach in a vault somewhere .
only someone with some nefarious hold over the man who picks the team can continue to get a game when he plays so abjectly .
even in a second-string team , gomez rarely justified his inclusion as an international striker .
elsewhere , there were encouraging signs that christian traesch could make good on his potential and challenge for a consistent role in midfield while toni kroos and marko marin – building on their cameo performances at the world cup – will certainly feature in the euro qualifiers and would be good bets to see increased action at the 2012 tournament .
despite his woeful pass which led to dennis rommedahl pulling a goal back just a minute after helmes put germany 2-0 up , defender serdar tasci had a competent game at left back until that mistake wrecked his confidence .
on the other side of defence , sascha reither was also solid until the final 15 minutes ; although it is unlikely he will ever unseat philipp lahm in the starting line-up .
the makeshift german defence as a whole battled well until the 74th minute when rommedahl 's goal gave denmark belief and shattered that of germany 's back four .
wiese 's strong showing in goal tarnished by late blunder with their two-goal lead slashed in half , germany looked rattled in defence and nervous in attack with gomez and helmes blowing gilt-edged chances to make the score 3-1 in the final ten minutes .
instead , denmark seized their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese kept denmark at bay until the final 15 minutes stand-in keeper tim wiese – who had an excellent game until his defense imploded in front of him – chose to rush out to deal with a dangerous through ball .
finding himself on the edge of his area , the werder bremen stopper was caught in two minds whether to use his hands , choosing instead to chest the ball to mads junker .
the danish striker knocked the ball round the stranded wiese before slotting it into an empty net to complete denmark 's comeback and the german collapse .
it was wiese 's first real mistake of the game but it was glaring one .
with rene adler returning from the injury that kept him from being the number one in south africa , and germany 's world cup keeper manuel neuer enhancing his reputation this summer , even without his 87th minute howler wiese faced an uphill struggle to make ground on his rivals .
it 's likely he 'll remain the third choice throughout the euro qualifiers and beyond .

this was a germany team shorn of almost all of its world cup stars and filled with debutants , cameo performers and bit-part players charged with taking on a denmark team smarting from a hugely forgettable summer in south africa .
the danes , while introducing a few unknowns in the hope of kick-starting a new era , still had a number of experienced players on show and with a home crowd behind them , they may have been expected to give germany 's reserves a torrid time .
but despite never playing together as a full team before and in a formation rarely used by loew , the german players slowly started to look comfortable in each other 's company and for the majority of the game , they appeared in little danger of leaving copenhagen without a victory .
while loew is unlikely to ever field this team again or play his regular starters in this tactical shape , a number of players will have improved their chances of joining the first team for the upcoming euro 2012 qualifiers and perhaps the european championships themselves in poland and ukraine in two years time .
der hammer returns to form with added nuances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal one performance that will have given the germany coach food for though was that of thomas hitzlsperger .
given the captain 's armband in the absence of warring skippers philipp lahm and michael ballack , hitzlsperger 's inclusion as germany 's leader in the centre of midfield was just reward for der hammer after fighting back from a severe loss of form .
after losing confidence and his touch at vfb stuttgart – and his place in the germany team – hitzlsperger 's transfer to lazio in january could have been the moment he dropped off germany 's radar .
but despite being overlooked for the world cup , hitzlsperger – now with west ham in the english premiership – has shown the hunger to come back and has recaptured his form .
there was plenty of the marauding midfield work of old but a season in serie a 's less frenetic atmosphere appears to have refined parts of hitzlsperger 's game which contributed to some considering him a blunt instrument .
it was a delicately feigned shot followed by a deft , penetrating pass into the penalty area on 19 minutes that set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal and until he was replaced in the second half , hitzlsperger was a worthy stand-in for bastian schweinsteiger in the conductor 's role .
gentner 's craft catches the eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former wolfsburg star gentner made a good impression playing off hitzlsperger was another player who should have done enough to convince jogi loew to continue his freshening-up of the germany team .
germany 's midfield showed no signs of suffering from the loss of ballack in south africa , and with toni kroos also showing in copenhagen why he could soon be a first team regular , one might think it overly optimistic to think that christian gentner may force his way into the national team 's starting line-up .
while hitzlsperger will certainly give loew a new option in defensive midfield , gentner put on a performance that could see him challenging for a role in the creative trio the germany coach normally deploys behind his lone striker .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder was a livewire throughout .
gentner was mobile , showed great vision and provided a number of killer passes .
drifting across the pitch behind mario gomez and patrick helmes , gentner was consistently probing the danish defensive line .
it was his perfectly timed pass which led to germany 's second goal .
receiving a great pass from jerome boateng on the edge of the area , gentner held the ball up long enough for helmes to time his run before threading a pass between the center-backs and onto helmes ' boot .
the bayer leverkusen striker did the rest .
stand-in strikers score but leave much to be desired bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmes needs the composure he shows with leverkusen helmes , who missed the world cup through injury after a good season with leverkusen , showed signs that he could be a worthy understudy to miroslav klose in the germany attack but the frequency and ease of the opportunities he wasted suggested that he needs more composure at this level and will certainly remain behind klose and thomas mueller in the attacking pecking order in the euro qualifiers .
but gomez , his well taken goal aside , played in a way that only reinforced the opinion that he must have some incriminating photos of his coach in a vault somewhere .
only someone with some nefarious hold over the man who picks the team can continue to get a game when he plays so abjectly .
even in a second-string team , gomez rarely justified his inclusion as an international striker .
elsewhere , there were encouraging signs that christian traesch could make good on his potential and challenge for a consistent role in midfield while toni kroos and marko marin – building on their cameo performances at the world cup – will certainly feature in the euro qualifiers and would be good bets to see increased action at the 2012 tournament .
despite his woeful pass which led to dennis rommedahl pulling a goal back just a minute after helmes put germany 2-0 up , defender serdar tasci had a competent game at left back until that mistake wrecked his confidence .
on the other side of defence , sascha reither was also solid until the final 15 minutes ; although it is unlikely he will ever unseat philipp lahm in the starting line-up .
the makeshift german defence as a whole battled well until the 74th minute when rommedahl 's goal gave denmark belief and shattered that of germany 's back four .
wiese 's strong showing in goal tarnished by late blunder with their two-goal lead slashed in half , germany looked rattled in defence and nervous in attack with gomez and helmes blowing gilt-edged chances to make the score 3-1 in the final ten minutes .
instead , denmark seized their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese kept denmark at bay until the final 15 minutes stand-in keeper tim wiese – who had an excellent game until his defense imploded in front of him – chose to rush out to deal with a dangerous through ball .
finding himself on the edge of his area , the werder bremen stopper was caught in two minds whether to use his hands , choosing instead to chest the ball to mads junker .
the danish striker knocked the ball round the stranded wiese before slotting it into an empty net to complete denmark 's comeback and the german collapse .
it was wiese 's first real mistake of the game but it was glaring one .
with rene adler returning from the injury that kept him from being the number one in south africa , and germany 's world cup keeper manuel neuer enhancing his reputation this summer , even without his 87th minute howler wiese faced an uphill struggle to make ground on his rivals .
it 's likely he 'll remain the third choice throughout the euro qualifiers and beyond .

the eu has warned sofia to tackle organized crime and corruption . bulgaria 's government and its judiciary are sharply at odds with each other as sofia attempts to fight organized crime and corruption .
the government accuses many of the country 's judges of being corrupt .
magistrates and observers in turn accuse the government of trying to split the judiciary in order to establish a specialized court to deal with key cases .
bulgarian police recently made several arrests after discovering a plan to assassinate prime minister boyko borisov .
yet shortly after those arrests , three judges in a court in the capital sofia released the suspects " due to a lack of evidence . "
" that was irresponsible , " criticized interior minister tsvetan tsvetanov , highlighting the dispute between bulgaria 's executive body and its judiciary .
brussels pushes bulgaria to tackle crime brussels has been warning new eu member bulgaria to tackle organized crime and corruption since long before it joined the bloc in 2007 .
the eu has criticized sofia for delaying important trials and failing to impose sufficiently tough penalties .
eager to comply , the one-year old government has launched one raid after another in an effort to build trust and show that it is doing everything possible to meet these demands . raids with spectacular codenames like " everything hit " and " the killers " have been making headlines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premier was on a hit list , police said " the killers " led to the arrest of 20 people suspected of involvement in the june 20 shooting of 47-year-old yuri galev , a controversial municipal councilor and football club president .
galev died from his gunshot wounds 10 days later in a sofia hospital .
those arrested were suspected of having killed other high-profile individuals and of having others on their hit list - including prime minister borisov .
borisov was critical of the judges ' decision to release the suspects , suggesting in no uncertain terms that he believed they were in cahoots with the alleged plotters .
" i discovered about 10 days ago that there is an intention to boycott legal proceedings , " borisov said .
" i will leave it up to the consciences of the judges to decide whether this is true or not . "
borisov expressed his frustration with bulgaria 's judicial system years ago , when he himself was a police chief : " we take the criminals in - and the judges let them go . "
now the prime minister is trying to convince voters - and the european union - of this .
many bulgarians readily accept his statements ; the view is widespread that the country 's judges are indeed corrupt .
an inept government , critics say but critics say rising police violence , the show raids and the accusations of judicial incompetence are attempts on the part of the government to divert attention from its lack of success in tackling crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is still widespread in bulgaria " the government does n't have it easy , " said neli kutzkova , spokeswoman for bulgaria 's judges association .
" first it announces super results .
then three judges come along who discover there is insufficient evidence to convict the suspects . "
" twenty people were arrested in the ' killers ' raid .
the police released 15 themselves .
why did n't anyone get upset about that ? " she asked .
no one believes bulgaria 's judiciary is perfect .
but it 's become an open secret that the cabinet has been seeking a public confrontation with the country 's judges - so that it can go ahead with plans to set up a specialized court .
special jurisdiction , police violence , political pressure on the judiciary , accusations of corruption : all this has been unsettling bulgarians and damaging the country 's image abroad .
lazar gruev , the chairman of bulgaria 's supreme judicial council , has spoken out in an attempt to defuse the situation .
" i can assure bulgaria 's people , and our partners abroad , that bulgaria 's courts will in future also only make decisions based on the law . "
the only thing that can be concluded , three-and-a-half-years after joining the european union , is that bulgaria is a functioning democracy , but that but the rule of law is not upheld there - at least not in a european sense .

the un has appealed for $ 460 million -lrb- 360 million euros -rrb- in aid . two weeks after the floods struck , the extent of the catastrophe remains unclear .
hundreds of roads and bridges have been destroyed , making it difficult to reach the flooded areas by anything but air .
the us military has tripled the number of its helicopters in pakistan to help with the relief efforts . on wednesday , john holmes , the un emergency relief coordinator , appealed for help from the member states of the united nations in new york . " ladies and gentlemen , assessment of losses or damages are still underway as you can imagine but it 's already very clear that these floods – the worst in pakistan for over 80 years have caused and are continuing to cause immense destruction and immense suffering , " he said gravely . " scale of disaster is horrendous " pakistan 's un ambassador abdullah hussain haroon told the un it was hard to confirm the number of deaths .
" the scale of this disaster is horrendous , " he stated . "
so far we have lost , in the three northern provinces , 4772 villages completely - just gone - that 's why we do n't know what the death toll is because we have no way of calculating at the moment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 14 million pakistanis are thought to be affected by the floods so far , it is known that at least 1,600 people have died and an estimated 14 million people are affected – some 8 percent of the pakistani population . half of those affected need immediate emergency relief if they are to survive .
they need food , clothes , shelter and clean drinking water .
moreover , they urgently need medical assistance " as the incidence of acute diarrhea and other water-borne diseases is rising worryingly , " according to john holmes . " cholera is also breaking out , " abdullah hussain haroon explained .
" that is going to be very dangerous .
drinking water and sachets for purifying it are going to become very important over the next few days . " death toll could rapidly rise even if the death toll from this disaster is not as high yet as from the 2004 tsunami or january 's earthquake in haiti , the un has warned that disease and food shortages could fast become deadly if the urgent needs of the people are not attended to . in pakistan itself , despite president zardari 's visit to the flooded areas on thursday , victims continued to complain about the slow response to the disaster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whole villages have been evacuated because of heavy flooding this man in khyber pakhtunkhwa spoke for thousands when he spoke to reporters : " we have been on the roadside for the past 12 days , we need food and tents but we have n't received food or tents . " on wednesday , john holmes ended his appeal with a warning that the destruction was far from over : " far from it .
having already affected the north of the country in late july and early august , the flood wave now continues to make its way through the southern province of sindh where millions more are expected to suffer from the combined impact of continuing torrential rains .

the un has appealed for $ 460 million -lrb- 360 million euros -rrb- in aid . two weeks after the floods struck , the extent of the catastrophe remains unclear .
hundreds of roads and bridges have been destroyed , making it difficult to reach the flooded areas by anything but air .
the us military has tripled the number of its helicopters in pakistan to help with the relief efforts . on wednesday , john holmes , the un emergency relief coordinator , appealed for help from the member states of the united nations in new york . " ladies and gentlemen , assessment of losses or damages are still underway as you can imagine but it 's already very clear that these floods – the worst in pakistan for over 80 years have caused and are continuing to cause immense destruction and immense suffering , " he said gravely . " scale of disaster is horrendous " pakistan 's un ambassador abdullah hussain haroon told the un it was hard to confirm the number of deaths .
" the scale of this disaster is horrendous , " he stated . "
so far we have lost , in the three northern provinces , 4772 villages completely - just gone - that 's why we do n't know what the death toll is because we have no way of calculating at the moment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 14 million pakistanis are thought to be affected by the floods so far , it is known that at least 1,600 people have died and an estimated 14 million people are affected – some 8 percent of the pakistani population . half of those affected need immediate emergency relief if they are to survive .
they need food , clothes , shelter and clean drinking water .
moreover , they urgently need medical assistance " as the incidence of acute diarrhea and other water-borne diseases is rising worryingly , " according to john holmes . " cholera is also breaking out , " abdullah hussain haroon explained .
" that is going to be very dangerous .
drinking water and sachets for purifying it are going to become very important over the next few days . " death toll could rapidly rise even if the death toll from this disaster is not as high yet as from the 2004 tsunami or january 's earthquake in haiti , the un has warned that disease and food shortages could fast become deadly if the urgent needs of the people are not attended to . in pakistan itself , despite president zardari 's visit to the flooded areas on thursday , victims continued to complain about the slow response to the disaster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whole villages have been evacuated because of heavy flooding this man in khyber pakhtunkhwa spoke for thousands when he spoke to reporters : " we have been on the roadside for the past 12 days , we need food and tents but we have n't received food or tents . " on wednesday , john holmes ended his appeal with a warning that the destruction was far from over : " far from it .
having already affected the north of the country in late july and early august , the flood wave now continues to make its way through the southern province of sindh where millions more are expected to suffer from the combined impact of continuing torrential rains .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 12.08.2010 bulgaria 's government , judiciary at each other 's throats over alleged plot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria is under eu pressure to crack down on corruption bulgaria 's judiciary has been accused of corruption after suspects accused of plotting to kill the prime minister were released - due to lack of evidence .
the eu has warned sofia to tackle organized crime and corruption . bulgaria 's government and its judiciary are sharply at odds with each other as sofia attempts to fight organized crime and corruption .
the government accuses many of the country 's judges of being corrupt .
magistrates and observers in turn accuse the government of trying to split the judiciary in order to establish a specialized court to deal with key cases .
bulgarian police recently made several arrests after discovering a plan to assassinate prime minister boyko borisov .
yet shortly after those arrests , three judges in a court in the capital sofia released the suspects " due to a lack of evidence . "
" that was irresponsible , " criticized interior minister tsvetan tsvetanov , highlighting the dispute between bulgaria 's executive body and its judiciary .
brussels pushes bulgaria to tackle crime brussels has been warning new eu member bulgaria to tackle organized crime and corruption since long before it joined the bloc in 2007 .
the eu has criticized sofia for delaying important trials and failing to impose sufficiently tough penalties .
eager to comply , the one-year old government has launched one raid after another in an effort to build trust and show that it is doing everything possible to meet these demands . raids with spectacular codenames like " everything hit " and " the killers " have been making headlines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premier was on a hit list , police said " the killers " led to the arrest of 20 people suspected of involvement in the june 20 shooting of 47-year-old yuri galev , a controversial municipal councilor and football club president .
galev died from his gunshot wounds 10 days later in a sofia hospital .
those arrested were suspected of having killed other high-profile individuals and of having others on their hit list - including prime minister borisov .
borisov was critical of the judges ' decision to release the suspects , suggesting in no uncertain terms that he believed they were in cahoots with the alleged plotters .
" i discovered about 10 days ago that there is an intention to boycott legal proceedings , " borisov said .
" i will leave it up to the consciences of the judges to decide whether this is true or not . "
borisov expressed his frustration with bulgaria 's judicial system years ago , when he himself was a police chief : " we take the criminals in - and the judges let them go . "
now the prime minister is trying to convince voters - and the european union - of this .
many bulgarians readily accept his statements ; the view is widespread that the country 's judges are indeed corrupt .
an inept government , critics say but critics say rising police violence , the show raids and the accusations of judicial incompetence are attempts on the part of the government to divert attention from its lack of success in tackling crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is still widespread in bulgaria " the government does n't have it easy , " said neli kutzkova , spokeswoman for bulgaria 's judges association .
" first it announces super results .
then three judges come along who discover there is insufficient evidence to convict the suspects . "
" twenty people were arrested in the ' killers ' raid .
the police released 15 themselves .
why did n't anyone get upset about that ? " she asked .
no one believes bulgaria 's judiciary is perfect .
but it 's become an open secret that the cabinet has been seeking a public confrontation with the country 's judges - so that it can go ahead with plans to set up a specialized court .
special jurisdiction , police violence , political pressure on the judiciary , accusations of corruption : all this has been unsettling bulgarians and damaging the country 's image abroad .
lazar gruev , the chairman of bulgaria 's supreme judicial council , has spoken out in an attempt to defuse the situation .
" i can assure bulgaria 's people , and our partners abroad , that bulgaria 's courts will in future also only make decisions based on the law . "
the only thing that can be concluded , three-and-a-half-years after joining the european union , is that bulgaria is a functioning democracy , but that but the rule of law is not upheld there - at least not in a european sense .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 12.08.2010 east germany was ready to attack west berlin , documentary says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eerie place of cold war confrontation - checkpoint charlie in the divided berlin a film aired on german television on thursday revealed how serious east germany was about taking control of west berlin .
plans for a military attack existed right up to the end of the regime . through the decades of berlin 's division , many west berliners had an inkling that east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- that surrounded their part of the city would at some stage be seeking to conquer it .
a tv documentary , " der fall x " -lrb- the case of x -rrb- , shown by germany 's public broadcaster rbb finally proved them right .
in the most comprehensive footage on east germany 's conquest plans so far , two filmmakers , supported by military experts , tell a fascinating story about how the defunct state planned to overrun west berlin in only three days .
" as far as we can tell , the planning was quite serious , " german military historian winfried heinemann told deutsche welle .
" but whether they would have managed to take the city within three days is another question . "
superior numbers heinemann pointed out that the western allies were quite serious about defending west berlin from a ground attack .
but he acknowledged that next to nothing was known about any defense strategies as the relevant documents are still classified .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahr knew that west berlin was never really a safe place egon bahr , a former west berlin radio commentator and later adviser to west german chancellor willy brandt , argued that the gdr 's national people 's army troops , and those of the soviet union deployed in the region , would have outnumbered the soldiers from the western allies by far .
" in the event of an attack , our defenses could have been maintained for no more than five to seven hours , " bahr concluded .
the plans found in the files of the east german secret police , the gdr army and the soviet military command reveal some details as to how the attackers would have gone about their job .
a detailed map available to the filmmakers showed the most important installations and infrastructure compounds in west berlin , which would have been targeted first .
among them were strategically important bridges that the french , british and us allies used to move around as well as airports and train stations .
a second phase of the operation would have included the imprisonment of leading west berlin politicians , policemen , public servants and journalists .
a corresponding list of names was updated by the gdr leadership several times until the collapse of the regime in 1989 .
a diehard obsession the research done by military historian winfried heinemann also revealed that plans to attack west berlin were , surprisingly , only developed fully in the early 1970s - a time when political relations between the two german states were in the process of improving considerably .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr soldiers trained for an attack as late as 1988 " whether it was just a question of the gdr military having grown up enough to feel fit for the job - we do n't really know , " said heinemann .
" but considering that the whole military posture of the gdr was kept up right until 1989 , it 's at least no surprise that the planning for an attack went on until the very end . "
in fact , east germany 's national people 's army -lrb- nva -rrb- carried out military maneuvers as late as 1988 to train for the takeover of west berlin .
exercises took place in the east german town of magdeburg some 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- west of berlin .
the training ground was designed to look as if the target territory were divided up between a french , british and us brigade , which reflected the fact the west berlin was seperated into sectors occupied by those three countries .
one year later , the berlin wall fell , and east german intelligence managed to destroy most of the documents regarding the gdr 's hostile intentions toward west berlin .

exercises took place in the east german town of magdeburg some 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- west of berlin .
the training ground was designed to look as if the target territory were divided up between a french , british and us brigade , which reflected the fact the west berlin was seperated into sectors occupied by those three countries .
one year later , the berlin wall fell , and east german intelligence managed to destroy most of the documents regarding the gdr 's hostile intentions toward west berlin .

in the most comprehensive footage on east germany 's conquest plans so far , two filmmakers , supported by military experts , tell a fascinating story about how the defunct state planned to overrun west berlin in only three days .
" as far as we can tell , the planning was quite serious , " german military historian winfried heinemann told deutsche welle .

plans for a military attack existed right up to the end of the regime . through the decades of berlin 's division , many west berliners had an inkling that east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- that surrounded their part of the city would at some stage be seeking to conquer it .
a tv documentary , " der fall x " -lrb- the case of x -rrb- , shown by germany 's public broadcaster rbb finally proved them right .
in the most comprehensive footage on east germany 's conquest plans so far , two filmmakers , supported by military experts , tell a fascinating story about how the defunct state planned to overrun west berlin in only three days .
" as far as we can tell , the planning was quite serious , " german military historian winfried heinemann told deutsche welle .
" but whether they would have managed to take the city within three days is another question . "
superior numbers heinemann pointed out that the western allies were quite serious about defending west berlin from a ground attack .
but he acknowledged that next to nothing was known about any defense strategies as the relevant documents are still classified .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahr knew that west berlin was never really a safe place egon bahr , a former west berlin radio commentator and later adviser to west german chancellor willy brandt , argued that the gdr 's national people 's army troops , and those of the soviet union deployed in the region , would have outnumbered the soldiers from the western allies by far .
" in the event of an attack , our defenses could have been maintained for no more than five to seven hours , " bahr concluded .
the plans found in the files of the east german secret police , the gdr army and the soviet military command reveal some details as to how the attackers would have gone about their job .
a detailed map available to the filmmakers showed the most important installations and infrastructure compounds in west berlin , which would have been targeted first .
among them were strategically important bridges that the french , british and us allies used to move around as well as airports and train stations .
a second phase of the operation would have included the imprisonment of leading west berlin politicians , policemen , public servants and journalists .
a corresponding list of names was updated by the gdr leadership several times until the collapse of the regime in 1989 .
a diehard obsession the research done by military historian winfried heinemann also revealed that plans to attack west berlin were , surprisingly , only developed fully in the early 1970s - a time when political relations between the two german states were in the process of improving considerably .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr soldiers trained for an attack as late as 1988 " whether it was just a question of the gdr military having grown up enough to feel fit for the job - we do n't really know , " said heinemann .
" but considering that the whole military posture of the gdr was kept up right until 1989 , it 's at least no surprise that the planning for an attack went on until the very end . "
in fact , east germany 's national people 's army -lrb- nva -rrb- carried out military maneuvers as late as 1988 to train for the takeover of west berlin .
exercises took place in the east german town of magdeburg some 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- west of berlin .
the training ground was designed to look as if the target territory were divided up between a french , british and us brigade , which reflected the fact the west berlin was seperated into sectors occupied by those three countries .
one year later , the berlin wall fell , and east german intelligence managed to destroy most of the documents regarding the gdr 's hostile intentions toward west berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear -pipe- 12.08.2010 nuclear experts play down health threat from russian fires großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radioactive contamination stored in trees would be re-released when they burn fears have surfaced about the spread of radioactive material as russian wildfires burn in areas contaminated by the 1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster .
but experts say there is no significant nuclear health danger . revelations that wildfires have hit hundreds of hectares of land in russia 's western bryansk region contaminated in the chernobyl nuclear disaster have raised fears that radioactive material could be released and reach moscow or even europe .
but radiation experts have said while concern is warranted , any re-release of nuclear contamination would likely pose little risk to human health .
" every instance of increased radioactivity is a cause for concern , but even for the local population , the levels are going to be relatively low , " said ulrich abram , a professor in the chemistry department and radiation expert at the free university of berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" there wo n't be a resulting cloud of radioactive material that could pose a danger to europe , " he said .
fears about russia possibly covering up a new radiation threat were raised when the environmental organization greenpeace warned that fires in forests contaminated in the 1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster could trigger radiation pollution .
the group accused the russian government of playing down the threat .
" fires on these territories will without a doubt lead to an increase in radiation , " said vladimir chuprov , head of the energy program at greenpeace russia , in an interview with the new york times .
" the smoke will spread , and the radioactive traces will spread . "
but radiation experts from russia and other european countries have sought to calm fears , saying that while radioactive isotopes could indeed be released into the air as contaminated material burns , there is no chance that radioactive fallout from the fires could reach anywhere near the magnitude of the chernobyl disaster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radioactive isotopes from the chernobyl disaster are still present in the soil and vegetation fo the area the concerns come from the fact that large areas of ukraine , belarus and russia are still coated with radioactive residue released when reactor no. 4 at the chernobyl nuclear power plan exploded on april 26 , 1986 .
two isotopes are of concern most of the radioactive isotopes released by the chernobyl meltdown were caesium-137 and strontium-90 , both produced by nuclear fission .
because both are isotopes of metallic elements , they fell to the ground rather quickly , according to abram , working their way into the soil over the decades since their release and being taken up by plants and trees .
when the vegetation burns , the atoms are released .
" then people could breathe them in , of course , " said abram .
" they could be exposed to a higher radiation intensity , which can lead to illness . "
abram remarks that people in the affected areas have been living with chernobyl 's aftermath for decades , although ingesting atoms released by the current fires would expose them at higher levels , and more direct contact .
internal exposure to caesium-137 and strontium-90 , through ingestion or inhalation , allows for the radioactive material to be distributed in the body 's soft tissues , especially muscle tissue and bone matter .
these tissues are then exposed to the beta particles and gamma radiation of the isotopes , increasing the risk of developing cancer .
low risk of inhaling nuclear material still , abram says the risk of inhalation is low , because the relative weights of both strontium and caesium send them falling to the ground quickly .
therefore , the risk of breathing the isotopes is low , unless residents are in the immediate vicinity of burning material .
" i do n't want to play down the issue , but the overall radiation dosage will not increase significantly for the people who live there , " he said .
what he does think a likely outcome will be is that as these isotopes are released , they could travel before falling to the ground again in the presence of high winds .
the result would be a larger area of land with low levels of radiation contamination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fires will likely spread contaminants over a larger area other experts agree with his risk assessment , including philipp renaud , head of the environmental radiation laboratory at france 's irsn nuclear safety institute .
he said the previous major forest fires in russia , in 2002 , showed that the risk of exposure was minor .
radioactivity in neighboring countries jumped by a thousandth of a becquerel unit and in france , a millionth .
" this is n't dangerous at all , " he told the agence france presse .
irsn said that if the contaminated forests burn , local residents would be exposed to about two times the normal radiation levels , which while not ideal , is not a cause for panic .
more dangerous for local residents ' health are the non-radioactive toxic fumes caused by the fire , the organization said .
other nuclear dangers ?
some have been concerned that the fires could reach other nuclear sites in russia , such as power plants or atomic weapon depots .
but according to edmund lengfelder , a director at the german society for radiation protection , the danger of flames engulfing a nuclear reactor and leading to disaster is small .
his group has been active in the chernobyl region for 20 years and has observed that these days , the russians are relatively well prepared when it comes to keeping their nuclear facilities out of harm 's way .
" russia is pretty competent when it comes to disaster response and we do n't see a particular threat to its nuclear facilities , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but regarding the material already deposited from chernobyl , we need to keep an eye on that . "

but experts say there is no significant nuclear health danger . revelations that wildfires have hit hundreds of hectares of land in russia 's western bryansk region contaminated in the chernobyl nuclear disaster have raised fears that radioactive material could be released and reach moscow or even europe .
but radiation experts have said while concern is warranted , any re-release of nuclear contamination would likely pose little risk to human health .
" every instance of increased radioactivity is a cause for concern , but even for the local population , the levels are going to be relatively low , " said ulrich abram , a professor in the chemistry department and radiation expert at the free university of berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" there wo n't be a resulting cloud of radioactive material that could pose a danger to europe , " he said .
fears about russia possibly covering up a new radiation threat were raised when the environmental organization greenpeace warned that fires in forests contaminated in the 1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster could trigger radiation pollution .
the group accused the russian government of playing down the threat .
" fires on these territories will without a doubt lead to an increase in radiation , " said vladimir chuprov , head of the energy program at greenpeace russia , in an interview with the new york times .
" the smoke will spread , and the radioactive traces will spread . "
but radiation experts from russia and other european countries have sought to calm fears , saying that while radioactive isotopes could indeed be released into the air as contaminated material burns , there is no chance that radioactive fallout from the fires could reach anywhere near the magnitude of the chernobyl disaster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radioactive isotopes from the chernobyl disaster are still present in the soil and vegetation fo the area the concerns come from the fact that large areas of ukraine , belarus and russia are still coated with radioactive residue released when reactor no. 4 at the chernobyl nuclear power plan exploded on april 26 , 1986 .
two isotopes are of concern most of the radioactive isotopes released by the chernobyl meltdown were caesium-137 and strontium-90 , both produced by nuclear fission .
because both are isotopes of metallic elements , they fell to the ground rather quickly , according to abram , working their way into the soil over the decades since their release and being taken up by plants and trees .
when the vegetation burns , the atoms are released .
" then people could breathe them in , of course , " said abram .
" they could be exposed to a higher radiation intensity , which can lead to illness . "
abram remarks that people in the affected areas have been living with chernobyl 's aftermath for decades , although ingesting atoms released by the current fires would expose them at higher levels , and more direct contact .
internal exposure to caesium-137 and strontium-90 , through ingestion or inhalation , allows for the radioactive material to be distributed in the body 's soft tissues , especially muscle tissue and bone matter .
these tissues are then exposed to the beta particles and gamma radiation of the isotopes , increasing the risk of developing cancer .
low risk of inhaling nuclear material still , abram says the risk of inhalation is low , because the relative weights of both strontium and caesium send them falling to the ground quickly .
therefore , the risk of breathing the isotopes is low , unless residents are in the immediate vicinity of burning material .
" i do n't want to play down the issue , but the overall radiation dosage will not increase significantly for the people who live there , " he said .
what he does think a likely outcome will be is that as these isotopes are released , they could travel before falling to the ground again in the presence of high winds .
the result would be a larger area of land with low levels of radiation contamination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fires will likely spread contaminants over a larger area other experts agree with his risk assessment , including philipp renaud , head of the environmental radiation laboratory at france 's irsn nuclear safety institute .
he said the previous major forest fires in russia , in 2002 , showed that the risk of exposure was minor .
radioactivity in neighboring countries jumped by a thousandth of a becquerel unit and in france , a millionth .
" this is n't dangerous at all , " he told the agence france presse .
irsn said that if the contaminated forests burn , local residents would be exposed to about two times the normal radiation levels , which while not ideal , is not a cause for panic .
more dangerous for local residents ' health are the non-radioactive toxic fumes caused by the fire , the organization said .
other nuclear dangers ?
some have been concerned that the fires could reach other nuclear sites in russia , such as power plants or atomic weapon depots .
but according to edmund lengfelder , a director at the german society for radiation protection , the danger of flames engulfing a nuclear reactor and leading to disaster is small .
his group has been active in the chernobyl region for 20 years and has observed that these days , the russians are relatively well prepared when it comes to keeping their nuclear facilities out of harm 's way .
" russia is pretty competent when it comes to disaster response and we do n't see a particular threat to its nuclear facilities , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but regarding the material already deposited from chernobyl , we need to keep an eye on that . "

but experts say there is no significant nuclear health danger . revelations that wildfires have hit hundreds of hectares of land in russia 's western bryansk region contaminated in the chernobyl nuclear disaster have raised fears that radioactive material could be released and reach moscow or even europe .
but radiation experts have said while concern is warranted , any re-release of nuclear contamination would likely pose little risk to human health .
" every instance of increased radioactivity is a cause for concern , but even for the local population , the levels are going to be relatively low , " said ulrich abram , a professor in the chemistry department and radiation expert at the free university of berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" there wo n't be a resulting cloud of radioactive material that could pose a danger to europe , " he said .
fears about russia possibly covering up a new radiation threat were raised when the environmental organization greenpeace warned that fires in forests contaminated in the 1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster could trigger radiation pollution .
the group accused the russian government of playing down the threat .
" fires on these territories will without a doubt lead to an increase in radiation , " said vladimir chuprov , head of the energy program at greenpeace russia , in an interview with the new york times .
" the smoke will spread , and the radioactive traces will spread . "
but radiation experts from russia and other european countries have sought to calm fears , saying that while radioactive isotopes could indeed be released into the air as contaminated material burns , there is no chance that radioactive fallout from the fires could reach anywhere near the magnitude of the chernobyl disaster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radioactive isotopes from the chernobyl disaster are still present in the soil and vegetation fo the area the concerns come from the fact that large areas of ukraine , belarus and russia are still coated with radioactive residue released when reactor no. 4 at the chernobyl nuclear power plan exploded on april 26 , 1986 .
two isotopes are of concern most of the radioactive isotopes released by the chernobyl meltdown were caesium-137 and strontium-90 , both produced by nuclear fission .
because both are isotopes of metallic elements , they fell to the ground rather quickly , according to abram , working their way into the soil over the decades since their release and being taken up by plants and trees .
when the vegetation burns , the atoms are released .
" then people could breathe them in , of course , " said abram .
" they could be exposed to a higher radiation intensity , which can lead to illness . "
abram remarks that people in the affected areas have been living with chernobyl 's aftermath for decades , although ingesting atoms released by the current fires would expose them at higher levels , and more direct contact .
internal exposure to caesium-137 and strontium-90 , through ingestion or inhalation , allows for the radioactive material to be distributed in the body 's soft tissues , especially muscle tissue and bone matter .
these tissues are then exposed to the beta particles and gamma radiation of the isotopes , increasing the risk of developing cancer .
low risk of inhaling nuclear material still , abram says the risk of inhalation is low , because the relative weights of both strontium and caesium send them falling to the ground quickly .
therefore , the risk of breathing the isotopes is low , unless residents are in the immediate vicinity of burning material .
" i do n't want to play down the issue , but the overall radiation dosage will not increase significantly for the people who live there , " he said .
what he does think a likely outcome will be is that as these isotopes are released , they could travel before falling to the ground again in the presence of high winds .
the result would be a larger area of land with low levels of radiation contamination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fires will likely spread contaminants over a larger area other experts agree with his risk assessment , including philipp renaud , head of the environmental radiation laboratory at france 's irsn nuclear safety institute .
he said the previous major forest fires in russia , in 2002 , showed that the risk of exposure was minor .
radioactivity in neighboring countries jumped by a thousandth of a becquerel unit and in france , a millionth .
" this is n't dangerous at all , " he told the agence france presse .
irsn said that if the contaminated forests burn , local residents would be exposed to about two times the normal radiation levels , which while not ideal , is not a cause for panic .
more dangerous for local residents ' health are the non-radioactive toxic fumes caused by the fire , the organization said .
other nuclear dangers ?
some have been concerned that the fires could reach other nuclear sites in russia , such as power plants or atomic weapon depots .
but according to edmund lengfelder , a director at the german society for radiation protection , the danger of flames engulfing a nuclear reactor and leading to disaster is small .
his group has been active in the chernobyl region for 20 years and has observed that these days , the russians are relatively well prepared when it comes to keeping their nuclear facilities out of harm 's way .
" russia is pretty competent when it comes to disaster response and we do n't see a particular threat to its nuclear facilities , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but regarding the material already deposited from chernobyl , we need to keep an eye on that . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 12.08.2010 second-stringers give loew food for thought ahead of euro qualifiers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew saw some things he liked but others he clearly did n't with the qualifying stage for the 2012 european championships beginning in september , a number of second-string stars were looking to impress germany coach joachim loew during wednesday 's friendly draw in denmark . for 74 minutes in copenhagen , it looked as though joachim loew had become one of those blessed coaches whose talent pool is such that he can throw a second string of players onto a pitch and get the same type of performance and result as he would have expected his a-listers to produce .
this was a germany team shorn of almost all of its world cup stars and filled with debutants , cameo performers and bit-part players charged with taking on a denmark team smarting from a hugely forgettable summer in south africa .
the danes , while introducing a few unknowns in the hope of kick-starting a new era , still had a number of experienced players on show and with a home crowd behind them , they may have been expected to give germany 's reserves a torrid time .
but despite never playing together as a full team before and in a formation rarely used by loew , the german players slowly started to look comfortable in each other 's company and for the majority of the game , they appeared in little danger of leaving copenhagen without a victory .
while loew is unlikely to ever field this team again or play his regular starters in this tactical shape , a number of players will have improved their chances of joining the first team for the upcoming euro 2012 qualifiers and perhaps the european championships themselves in poland and ukraine in two years time .
der hammer returns to form with added nuances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal one performance that will have given the germany coach food for though was that of thomas hitzlsperger .
given the captain 's armband in the absence of warring skippers philipp lahm and michael ballack , hitzlsperger 's inclusion as germany 's leader in the centre of midfield was just reward for der hammer after fighting back from a severe loss of form .
after losing confidence and his touch at vfb stuttgart – and his place in the germany team – hitzlsperger 's transfer to lazio in january could have been the moment he dropped off germany 's radar .
but despite being overlooked for the world cup , hitzlsperger – now with west ham in the english premiership – has shown the hunger to come back and has recaptured his form .
there was plenty of the marauding midfield work of old but a season in serie a 's less frenetic atmosphere appears to have refined parts of hitzlsperger 's game which contributed to some considering him a blunt instrument .
it was a delicately feigned shot followed by a deft , penetrating pass into the penalty area on 19 minutes that set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal and until he was replaced in the second half , hitzlsperger was a worthy stand-in for bastian schweinsteiger in the conductor 's role .
gentner 's craft catches the eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former wolfsburg star gentner made a good impression playing off hitzlsperger was another player who should have done enough to convince jogi loew to continue his freshening-up of the germany team .
germany 's midfield showed no signs of suffering from the loss of ballack in south africa , and with toni kroos also showing in copenhagen why he could soon be a first team regular , one might think it overly optimistic to think that christian gentner may force his way into the national team 's starting line-up .
while hitzlsperger will certainly give loew a new option in defensive midfield , gentner put on a performance that could see him challenging for a role in the creative trio the germany coach normally deploys behind his lone striker .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder was a livewire throughout .
gentner was mobile , showed great vision and provided a number of killer passes .
drifting across the pitch behind mario gomez and patrick helmes , gentner was consistently probing the danish defensive line .
it was his perfectly timed pass which led to germany 's second goal .
receiving a great pass from jerome boateng on the edge of the area , gentner held the ball up long enough for helmes to time his run before threading a pass between the center-backs and onto helmes ' boot .
the bayer leverkusen striker did the rest .
stand-in strikers score but leave much to be desired bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmes needs the composure he shows with leverkusen helmes , who missed the world cup through injury after a good season with leverkusen , showed signs that he could be a worthy understudy to miroslav klose in the germany attack but the frequency and ease of the opportunities he wasted suggested that he needs more composure at this level and will certainly remain behind klose and thomas mueller in the attacking pecking order in the euro qualifiers .
but gomez , his well taken goal aside , played in a way that only reinforced the opinion that he must have some incriminating photos of his coach in a vault somewhere .
only someone with some nefarious hold over the man who picks the team can continue to get a game when he plays so abjectly .
even in a second-string team , gomez rarely justified his inclusion as an international striker .
elsewhere , there were encouraging signs that christian traesch could make good on his potential and challenge for a consistent role in midfield while toni kroos and marko marin – building on their cameo performances at the world cup – will certainly feature in the euro qualifiers and would be good bets to see increased action at the 2012 tournament .
despite his woeful pass which led to dennis rommedahl pulling a goal back just a minute after helmes put germany 2-0 up , defender serdar tasci had a competent game at left back until that mistake wrecked his confidence .
on the other side of defence , sascha reither was also solid until the final 15 minutes ; although it is unlikely he will ever unseat philipp lahm in the starting line-up .
the makeshift german defence as a whole battled well until the 74th minute when rommedahl 's goal gave denmark belief and shattered that of germany 's back four .
wiese 's strong showing in goal tarnished by late blunder with their two-goal lead slashed in half , germany looked rattled in defence and nervous in attack with gomez and helmes blowing gilt-edged chances to make the score 3-1 in the final ten minutes .
instead , denmark seized their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese kept denmark at bay until the final 15 minutes stand-in keeper tim wiese – who had an excellent game until his defense imploded in front of him – chose to rush out to deal with a dangerous through ball .
finding himself on the edge of his area , the werder bremen stopper was caught in two minds whether to use his hands , choosing instead to chest the ball to mads junker .
the danish striker knocked the ball round the stranded wiese before slotting it into an empty net to complete denmark 's comeback and the german collapse .
it was wiese 's first real mistake of the game but it was glaring one .
with rene adler returning from the injury that kept him from being the number one in south africa , and germany 's world cup keeper manuel neuer enhancing his reputation this summer , even without his 87th minute howler wiese faced an uphill struggle to make ground on his rivals .
it 's likely he 'll remain the third choice throughout the euro qualifiers and beyond .

one in five medical tourists choose to visit clinics in bad godesberg , just south of bonn .
the town is especially popular with patients from the middle east . once upon a time when bonn was the capital of west germany , the nearby town of bad godesberg was home to many diplomats - almost all the ambassadors ' residences were located there .
today bad godesberg has become a magnet for arabs , not due to its diplomatic history , but for the healthcare services it offers .
the elisees clinic , in particular , has gained a shining reputation in the arab world .
recently , sheik abdulrahman al muftah from qatar set up an appointment at the clinic for 9 o 'clock .
but it was just before 10:30 that his car turned the corner - a simple blue vw family van .
not exactly the kind of vehicle the medical staff expects a middle eastern sheik to arrive in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sheik abdulrahman al mufti says german clinics have a good reputation a rather squat gentlemen gets out of the car , followed by his wife , dressed in a black burqa .
the sheik is n't wearing a caftan , since in germany he dresses to fit in .
today he 's sporting beige bermuda shorts and white socks with sandals .
he warmly shakes the hands of everyone present .
" i 'm sorry , i knew nothing about an appointment at 9 o 'clock , " he jokes while saying hello to the chief surgeon , natalia brenner .
different customs brenner waves the couple inside , smiling to herself - she knows the drill .
the clinic sees about 3,000 patients a year from the middle east , and during that time , she 's learned a lot about interacting with people from this part of the world .
" arab patients are a special clientele .
they are nice and kind , but they have their ways , " she says .
" for example , they always come late for appointments and then they usually take over our entire clinic . "
brenner has also learned that women from the arab world are not introduced by their own names , and that the price for an operation is often considered negotiable .
while she 's gotten used to most customs , there 's one she still has a hard time with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief surgeon natalia brenner has gotten used to most arab customs " the role of women , that 's something i still do n't understand , " she says .
" it is still strange for me to see that men make the decisions for arab women . "
sheik abdulrahman is no exception .
while his wife , sitting in an examination chair , might be the one about to undergo an operation , he 's the one who will have the final say .
brenner points to an ultrasound image and explains the details of the operation that will treat his wife 's varicose veins .
during the discussion , which takes place through an interpreter because the sheik does n't speak or understand german , his wife carefully watches her husband 's reactions .
despite the language barrier , comprehension is not a problem today in the elisee clinic .
nadhmi nefzi , a young man who follows the sheikh around like a shadow , is responsible for the interpreting at the clinic - he 's the clinic 's personal assistant .
he is dressed in a neat shirt , has carefully parted hair and is the model of discretion .
the young man translates the discussion into arabic , taking special care with the many medical terms .
sheik abdulrahman nods and looks at dr brenner - she can operate on his wife now .
he 's going to take a stroll through the city with nefzi .
known for its health care these kinds of health trips , the sheik says , cost a lot of money .
but as a professor of marine biology and a bank owner , he can afford it .
he 's been coming to germany for over 20 years ; recently , always to bad godesberg .
the sheik explains that the town 's clinics have acquired glowing reputations in the arab world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the whole family comes on these health trips " in the meantime , i 've gotten to know many doctors here , " he laughs .
" i 've become friends with a lot of them and even get special treatment . "
the doctors in bad godesberg are even recommended by the health section of the qatari embassy .
that 's common in arab countries , he says , strolling along the storefront windows of the city .
tailored to a new clientele a little while ago , munich was considered the place to go for medical care , but bad godesberg has knocked the bavarians off their perch , especially since many clinics here have tailored their services to a middle eastern clientele .
" and it 's quiet and safe and my family feels at home because there are so many other arabs here , " referring to those with diplomatic ties who did not move to berlin when the german government shifted capitals .
the sheik points to signs on local shops - the pharmacy , a jewelry store , a café and a souvenir shop - written in arabic .
personal assistant nefzi nods .
in addition to his translation duties he is also charged with making appointments to see high-end apartments .
arabs can be very discerning , he says .
" it 's very important that the environment is clean and that the apartment is representative of germany , " nefzi says .
" they want to have something to talk about back home . "
most health-related visitors from the middle east choose not to stay in hotels .
they consider the rooms impersonal and prefer to be able to prepare their own food .
once the stroll around town is done , the sheik returns to the clinic and waits for his wife to be released from the operating room .
the doctors report the procedure went well .
now it 's time to go shopping , but not in bad godesberg .
the family will have to head over to the bigger cities of cologne or dusseldorf , where they can visit shops with a selection of middle eastern foods wide enough to fit their discerning tastes .

despite the language barrier , comprehension is not a problem today in the elisee clinic .
nadhmi nefzi , a young man who follows the sheikh around like a shadow , is responsible for the interpreting at the clinic - he 's the clinic 's personal assistant .
he is dressed in a neat shirt , has carefully parted hair and is the model of discretion .
the young man translates the discussion into arabic , taking special care with the many medical terms .
sheik abdulrahman nods and looks at dr brenner - she can operate on his wife now .
he 's going to take a stroll through the city with nefzi .
known for its health care these kinds of health trips , the sheik says , cost a lot of money .
but as a professor of marine biology and a bank owner , he can afford it .
he 's been coming to germany for over 20 years ; recently , always to bad godesberg .
the sheik explains that the town 's clinics have acquired glowing reputations in the arab world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the whole family comes on these health trips " in the meantime , i 've gotten to know many doctors here , " he laughs .
" i 've become friends with a lot of them and even get special treatment . "
the doctors in bad godesberg are even recommended by the health section of the qatari embassy .
that 's common in arab countries , he says , strolling along the storefront windows of the city .
tailored to a new clientele a little while ago , munich was considered the place to go for medical care , but bad godesberg has knocked the bavarians off their perch , especially since many clinics here have tailored their services to a middle eastern clientele .
" and it 's quiet and safe and my family feels at home because there are so many other arabs here , " referring to those with diplomatic ties who did not move to berlin when the german government shifted capitals .
the sheik points to signs on local shops - the pharmacy , a jewelry store , a café and a souvenir shop - written in arabic .
personal assistant nefzi nods .
in addition to his translation duties he is also charged with making appointments to see high-end apartments .
arabs can be very discerning , he says .
" it 's very important that the environment is clean and that the apartment is representative of germany , " nefzi says .
" they want to have something to talk about back home . "
most health-related visitors from the middle east choose not to stay in hotels .
they consider the rooms impersonal and prefer to be able to prepare their own food .
once the stroll around town is done , the sheik returns to the clinic and waits for his wife to be released from the operating room .
the doctors report the procedure went well .
now it 's time to go shopping , but not in bad godesberg .
the family will have to head over to the bigger cities of cologne or dusseldorf , where they can visit shops with a selection of middle eastern foods wide enough to fit their discerning tastes .

the eu has warned sofia to tackle organized crime and corruption . bulgaria 's government and its judiciary are sharply at odds with each other as sofia attempts to fight organized crime and corruption .
the government accuses many of the country 's judges of being corrupt .
magistrates and observers in turn accuse the government of trying to split the judiciary in order to establish a specialized court to deal with key cases .
bulgarian police recently made several arrests after discovering a plan to assassinate prime minister boyko borisov .
yet shortly after those arrests , three judges in a court in the capital sofia released the suspects " due to a lack of evidence . "
" that was irresponsible , " criticized interior minister tsvetan tsvetanov , highlighting the dispute between bulgaria 's executive body and its judiciary .
brussels pushes bulgaria to tackle crime brussels has been warning new eu member bulgaria to tackle organized crime and corruption since long before it joined the bloc in 2007 .
the eu has criticized sofia for delaying important trials and failing to impose sufficiently tough penalties .
eager to comply , the one-year old government has launched one raid after another in an effort to build trust and show that it is doing everything possible to meet these demands . raids with spectacular codenames like " everything hit " and " the killers " have been making headlines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premier was on a hit list , police said " the killers " led to the arrest of 20 people suspected of involvement in the june 20 shooting of 47-year-old yuri galev , a controversial municipal councilor and football club president .
galev died from his gunshot wounds 10 days later in a sofia hospital .
those arrested were suspected of having killed other high-profile individuals and of having others on their hit list - including prime minister borisov .
borisov was critical of the judges ' decision to release the suspects , suggesting in no uncertain terms that he believed they were in cahoots with the alleged plotters .
" i discovered about 10 days ago that there is an intention to boycott legal proceedings , " borisov said .
" i will leave it up to the consciences of the judges to decide whether this is true or not . "
borisov expressed his frustration with bulgaria 's judicial system years ago , when he himself was a police chief : " we take the criminals in - and the judges let them go . "
now the prime minister is trying to convince voters - and the european union - of this .
many bulgarians readily accept his statements ; the view is widespread that the country 's judges are indeed corrupt .
an inept government , critics say but critics say rising police violence , the show raids and the accusations of judicial incompetence are attempts on the part of the government to divert attention from its lack of success in tackling crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is still widespread in bulgaria " the government does n't have it easy , " said neli kutzkova , spokeswoman for bulgaria 's judges association .
" first it announces super results .
then three judges come along who discover there is insufficient evidence to convict the suspects . "
" twenty people were arrested in the ' killers ' raid .
the police released 15 themselves .
why did n't anyone get upset about that ? " she asked .
no one believes bulgaria 's judiciary is perfect .
but it 's become an open secret that the cabinet has been seeking a public confrontation with the country 's judges - so that it can go ahead with plans to set up a specialized court .
special jurisdiction , police violence , political pressure on the judiciary , accusations of corruption : all this has been unsettling bulgarians and damaging the country 's image abroad .
lazar gruev , the chairman of bulgaria 's supreme judicial council , has spoken out in an attempt to defuse the situation .
" i can assure bulgaria 's people , and our partners abroad , that bulgaria 's courts will in future also only make decisions based on the law . "
the only thing that can be concluded , three-and-a-half-years after joining the european union , is that bulgaria is a functioning democracy , but that but the rule of law is not upheld there - at least not in a european sense .

one in five medical tourists choose to visit clinics in bad godesberg , just south of bonn .
the town is especially popular with patients from the middle east . once upon a time when bonn was the capital of west germany , the nearby town of bad godesberg was home to many diplomats - almost all the ambassadors ' residences were located there .
today bad godesberg has become a magnet for arabs , not due to its diplomatic history , but for the healthcare services it offers .
the elisees clinic , in particular , has gained a shining reputation in the arab world .
recently , sheik abdulrahman al muftah from qatar set up an appointment at the clinic for 9 o 'clock .
but it was just before 10:30 that his car turned the corner - a simple blue vw family van .
not exactly the kind of vehicle the medical staff expects a middle eastern sheik to arrive in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sheik abdulrahman al mufti says german clinics have a good reputation a rather squat gentlemen gets out of the car , followed by his wife , dressed in a black burqa .
the sheik is n't wearing a caftan , since in germany he dresses to fit in .
today he 's sporting beige bermuda shorts and white socks with sandals .
he warmly shakes the hands of everyone present .
" i 'm sorry , i knew nothing about an appointment at 9 o 'clock , " he jokes while saying hello to the chief surgeon , natalia brenner .
different customs brenner waves the couple inside , smiling to herself - she knows the drill .
the clinic sees about 3,000 patients a year from the middle east , and during that time , she 's learned a lot about interacting with people from this part of the world .
" arab patients are a special clientele .
they are nice and kind , but they have their ways , " she says .
" for example , they always come late for appointments and then they usually take over our entire clinic . "
brenner has also learned that women from the arab world are not introduced by their own names , and that the price for an operation is often considered negotiable .
while she 's gotten used to most customs , there 's one she still has a hard time with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief surgeon natalia brenner has gotten used to most arab customs " the role of women , that 's something i still do n't understand , " she says .
" it is still strange for me to see that men make the decisions for arab women . "
sheik abdulrahman is no exception .
while his wife , sitting in an examination chair , might be the one about to undergo an operation , he 's the one who will have the final say .
brenner points to an ultrasound image and explains the details of the operation that will treat his wife 's varicose veins .
during the discussion , which takes place through an interpreter because the sheik does n't speak or understand german , his wife carefully watches her husband 's reactions .
despite the language barrier , comprehension is not a problem today in the elisee clinic .
nadhmi nefzi , a young man who follows the sheikh around like a shadow , is responsible for the interpreting at the clinic - he 's the clinic 's personal assistant .
he is dressed in a neat shirt , has carefully parted hair and is the model of discretion .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief surgeon natalia brenner has gotten used to most arab customs " the role of women , that 's something i still do n't understand , " she says .
" it is still strange for me to see that men make the decisions for arab women . "
sheik abdulrahman is no exception .
while his wife , sitting in an examination chair , might be the one about to undergo an operation , he 's the one who will have the final say .
brenner points to an ultrasound image and explains the details of the operation that will treat his wife 's varicose veins .
during the discussion , which takes place through an interpreter because the sheik does n't speak or understand german , his wife carefully watches her husband 's reactions .
despite the language barrier , comprehension is not a problem today in the elisee clinic .
nadhmi nefzi , a young man who follows the sheikh around like a shadow , is responsible for the interpreting at the clinic - he 's the clinic 's personal assistant .
he is dressed in a neat shirt , has carefully parted hair and is the model of discretion .
the young man translates the discussion into arabic , taking special care with the many medical terms .
sheik abdulrahman nods and looks at dr brenner - she can operate on his wife now .
he 's going to take a stroll through the city with nefzi .
known for its health care these kinds of health trips , the sheik says , cost a lot of money .
but as a professor of marine biology and a bank owner , he can afford it .
he 's been coming to germany for over 20 years ; recently , always to bad godesberg .
the sheik explains that the town 's clinics have acquired glowing reputations in the arab world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the whole family comes on these health trips " in the meantime , i 've gotten to know many doctors here , " he laughs .
" i 've become friends with a lot of them and even get special treatment . "
the doctors in bad godesberg are even recommended by the health section of the qatari embassy .
that 's common in arab countries , he says , strolling along the storefront windows of the city .
tailored to a new clientele a little while ago , munich was considered the place to go for medical care , but bad godesberg has knocked the bavarians off their perch , especially since many clinics here have tailored their services to a middle eastern clientele .
" and it 's quiet and safe and my family feels at home because there are so many other arabs here , " referring to those with diplomatic ties who did not move to berlin when the german government shifted capitals .
the sheik points to signs on local shops - the pharmacy , a jewelry store , a café and a souvenir shop - written in arabic .
personal assistant nefzi nods .
in addition to his translation duties he is also charged with making appointments to see high-end apartments .
arabs can be very discerning , he says .
" it 's very important that the environment is clean and that the apartment is representative of germany , " nefzi says .
" they want to have something to talk about back home . "
most health-related visitors from the middle east choose not to stay in hotels .
they consider the rooms impersonal and prefer to be able to prepare their own food .
once the stroll around town is done , the sheik returns to the clinic and waits for his wife to be released from the operating room .
the doctors report the procedure went well .
now it 's time to go shopping , but not in bad godesberg .
the family will have to head over to the bigger cities of cologne or dusseldorf , where they can visit shops with a selection of middle eastern foods wide enough to fit their discerning tastes .

the eu has warned sofia to tackle organized crime and corruption . bulgaria 's government and its judiciary are sharply at odds with each other as sofia attempts to fight organized crime and corruption .
the government accuses many of the country 's judges of being corrupt .
magistrates and observers in turn accuse the government of trying to split the judiciary in order to establish a specialized court to deal with key cases .
bulgarian police recently made several arrests after discovering a plan to assassinate prime minister boyko borisov .
yet shortly after those arrests , three judges in a court in the capital sofia released the suspects " due to a lack of evidence . "
" that was irresponsible , " criticized interior minister tsvetan tsvetanov , highlighting the dispute between bulgaria 's executive body and its judiciary .
brussels pushes bulgaria to tackle crime brussels has been warning new eu member bulgaria to tackle organized crime and corruption since long before it joined the bloc in 2007 .
the eu has criticized sofia for delaying important trials and failing to impose sufficiently tough penalties .
eager to comply , the one-year old government has launched one raid after another in an effort to build trust and show that it is doing everything possible to meet these demands . raids with spectacular codenames like " everything hit " and " the killers " have been making headlines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premier was on a hit list , police said " the killers " led to the arrest of 20 people suspected of involvement in the june 20 shooting of 47-year-old yuri galev , a controversial municipal councilor and football club president .
galev died from his gunshot wounds 10 days later in a sofia hospital .
those arrested were suspected of having killed other high-profile individuals and of having others on their hit list - including prime minister borisov .
borisov was critical of the judges ' decision to release the suspects , suggesting in no uncertain terms that he believed they were in cahoots with the alleged plotters .
" i discovered about 10 days ago that there is an intention to boycott legal proceedings , " borisov said .
" i will leave it up to the consciences of the judges to decide whether this is true or not . "
borisov expressed his frustration with bulgaria 's judicial system years ago , when he himself was a police chief : " we take the criminals in - and the judges let them go . "
now the prime minister is trying to convince voters - and the european union - of this .
many bulgarians readily accept his statements ; the view is widespread that the country 's judges are indeed corrupt .
an inept government , critics say but critics say rising police violence , the show raids and the accusations of judicial incompetence are attempts on the part of the government to divert attention from its lack of success in tackling crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is still widespread in bulgaria " the government does n't have it easy , " said neli kutzkova , spokeswoman for bulgaria 's judges association .
" first it announces super results .
then three judges come along who discover there is insufficient evidence to convict the suspects . "
" twenty people were arrested in the ' killers ' raid .
the police released 15 themselves .
why did n't anyone get upset about that ? " she asked .
no one believes bulgaria 's judiciary is perfect .
but it 's become an open secret that the cabinet has been seeking a public confrontation with the country 's judges - so that it can go ahead with plans to set up a specialized court .
special jurisdiction , police violence , political pressure on the judiciary , accusations of corruption : all this has been unsettling bulgarians and damaging the country 's image abroad .
lazar gruev , the chairman of bulgaria 's supreme judicial council , has spoken out in an attempt to defuse the situation .
" i can assure bulgaria 's people , and our partners abroad , that bulgaria 's courts will in future also only make decisions based on the law . "
the only thing that can be concluded , three-and-a-half-years after joining the european union , is that bulgaria is a functioning democracy , but that but the rule of law is not upheld there - at least not in a european sense .

plans for a military attack existed right up to the end of the regime . through the decades of berlin 's division , many west berliners had an inkling that east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- that surrounded their part of the city would at some stage be seeking to conquer it .
a tv documentary , " der fall x " -lrb- the case of x -rrb- , shown by germany 's public broadcaster rbb finally proved them right .
in the most comprehensive footage on east germany 's conquest plans so far , two filmmakers , supported by military experts , tell a fascinating story about how the defunct state planned to overrun west berlin in only three days .
" as far as we can tell , the planning was quite serious , " german military historian winfried heinemann told deutsche welle .
" but whether they would have managed to take the city within three days is another question . "
superior numbers heinemann pointed out that the western allies were quite serious about defending west berlin from a ground attack .
but he acknowledged that next to nothing was known about any defense strategies as the relevant documents are still classified .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahr knew that west berlin was never really a safe place egon bahr , a former west berlin radio commentator and later adviser to west german chancellor willy brandt , argued that the gdr 's national people 's army troops , and those of the soviet union deployed in the region , would have outnumbered the soldiers from the western allies by far .
" in the event of an attack , our defenses could have been maintained for no more than five to seven hours , " bahr concluded .
the plans found in the files of the east german secret police , the gdr army and the soviet military command reveal some details as to how the attackers would have gone about their job .
a detailed map available to the filmmakers showed the most important installations and infrastructure compounds in west berlin , which would have been targeted first .
among them were strategically important bridges that the french , british and us allies used to move around as well as airports and train stations .
a second phase of the operation would have included the imprisonment of leading west berlin politicians , policemen , public servants and journalists .
a corresponding list of names was updated by the gdr leadership several times until the collapse of the regime in 1989 .
a diehard obsession the research done by military historian winfried heinemann also revealed that plans to attack west berlin were , surprisingly , only developed fully in the early 1970s - a time when political relations between the two german states were in the process of improving considerably .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr soldiers trained for an attack as late as 1988 " whether it was just a question of the gdr military having grown up enough to feel fit for the job - we do n't really know , " said heinemann .
" but considering that the whole military posture of the gdr was kept up right until 1989 , it 's at least no surprise that the planning for an attack went on until the very end . "
in fact , east germany 's national people 's army -lrb- nva -rrb- carried out military maneuvers as late as 1988 to train for the takeover of west berlin .
exercises took place in the east german town of magdeburg some 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- west of berlin .
the training ground was designed to look as if the target territory were divided up between a french , british and us brigade , which reflected the fact the west berlin was seperated into sectors occupied by those three countries .
one year later , the berlin wall fell , and east german intelligence managed to destroy most of the documents regarding the gdr 's hostile intentions toward west berlin .

plans for a military attack existed right up to the end of the regime . through the decades of berlin 's division , many west berliners had an inkling that east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- that surrounded their part of the city would at some stage be seeking to conquer it .
a tv documentary , " der fall x " -lrb- the case of x -rrb- , shown by germany 's public broadcaster rbb finally proved them right .
in the most comprehensive footage on east germany 's conquest plans so far , two filmmakers , supported by military experts , tell a fascinating story about how the defunct state planned to overrun west berlin in only three days .
" as far as we can tell , the planning was quite serious , " german military historian winfried heinemann told deutsche welle .
" but whether they would have managed to take the city within three days is another question . "
superior numbers heinemann pointed out that the western allies were quite serious about defending west berlin from a ground attack .
but he acknowledged that next to nothing was known about any defense strategies as the relevant documents are still classified .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahr knew that west berlin was never really a safe place egon bahr , a former west berlin radio commentator and later adviser to west german chancellor willy brandt , argued that the gdr 's national people 's army troops , and those of the soviet union deployed in the region , would have outnumbered the soldiers from the western allies by far .
" in the event of an attack , our defenses could have been maintained for no more than five to seven hours , " bahr concluded .
the plans found in the files of the east german secret police , the gdr army and the soviet military command reveal some details as to how the attackers would have gone about their job .
a detailed map available to the filmmakers showed the most important installations and infrastructure compounds in west berlin , which would have been targeted first .
among them were strategically important bridges that the french , british and us allies used to move around as well as airports and train stations .
a second phase of the operation would have included the imprisonment of leading west berlin politicians , policemen , public servants and journalists .
a corresponding list of names was updated by the gdr leadership several times until the collapse of the regime in 1989 .
a diehard obsession the research done by military historian winfried heinemann also revealed that plans to attack west berlin were , surprisingly , only developed fully in the early 1970s - a time when political relations between the two german states were in the process of improving considerably .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr soldiers trained for an attack as late as 1988 " whether it was just a question of the gdr military having grown up enough to feel fit for the job - we do n't really know , " said heinemann .
" but considering that the whole military posture of the gdr was kept up right until 1989 , it 's at least no surprise that the planning for an attack went on until the very end . "
in fact , east germany 's national people 's army -lrb- nva -rrb- carried out military maneuvers as late as 1988 to train for the takeover of west berlin .
exercises took place in the east german town of magdeburg some 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- west of berlin .
the training ground was designed to look as if the target territory were divided up between a french , british and us brigade , which reflected the fact the west berlin was seperated into sectors occupied by those three countries .
one year later , the berlin wall fell , and east german intelligence managed to destroy most of the documents regarding the gdr 's hostile intentions toward west berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear -pipe- 12.08.2010 nuclear experts play down health threat from russian fires großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radioactive contamination stored in trees would be re-released when they burn fears have surfaced about the spread of radioactive material as russian wildfires burn in areas contaminated by the 1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster .
but experts say there is no significant nuclear health danger . revelations that wildfires have hit hundreds of hectares of land in russia 's western bryansk region contaminated in the chernobyl nuclear disaster have raised fears that radioactive material could be released and reach moscow or even europe .
but radiation experts have said while concern is warranted , any re-release of nuclear contamination would likely pose little risk to human health .
" every instance of increased radioactivity is a cause for concern , but even for the local population , the levels are going to be relatively low , " said ulrich abram , a professor in the chemistry department and radiation expert at the free university of berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" there wo n't be a resulting cloud of radioactive material that could pose a danger to europe , " he said .
fears about russia possibly covering up a new radiation threat were raised when the environmental organization greenpeace warned that fires in forests contaminated in the 1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster could trigger radiation pollution .
the group accused the russian government of playing down the threat .
" fires on these territories will without a doubt lead to an increase in radiation , " said vladimir chuprov , head of the energy program at greenpeace russia , in an interview with the new york times .
" the smoke will spread , and the radioactive traces will spread . "
but radiation experts from russia and other european countries have sought to calm fears , saying that while radioactive isotopes could indeed be released into the air as contaminated material burns , there is no chance that radioactive fallout from the fires could reach anywhere near the magnitude of the chernobyl disaster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radioactive isotopes from the chernobyl disaster are still present in the soil and vegetation fo the area the concerns come from the fact that large areas of ukraine , belarus and russia are still coated with radioactive residue released when reactor no. 4 at the chernobyl nuclear power plan exploded on april 26 , 1986 .
two isotopes are of concern most of the radioactive isotopes released by the chernobyl meltdown were caesium-137 and strontium-90 , both produced by nuclear fission .
because both are isotopes of metallic elements , they fell to the ground rather quickly , according to abram , working their way into the soil over the decades since their release and being taken up by plants and trees .
when the vegetation burns , the atoms are released .
" then people could breathe them in , of course , " said abram .
" they could be exposed to a higher radiation intensity , which can lead to illness . "
abram remarks that people in the affected areas have been living with chernobyl 's aftermath for decades , although ingesting atoms released by the current fires would expose them at higher levels , and more direct contact .
internal exposure to caesium-137 and strontium-90 , through ingestion or inhalation , allows for the radioactive material to be distributed in the body 's soft tissues , especially muscle tissue and bone matter .
these tissues are then exposed to the beta particles and gamma radiation of the isotopes , increasing the risk of developing cancer .
low risk of inhaling nuclear material still , abram says the risk of inhalation is low , because the relative weights of both strontium and caesium send them falling to the ground quickly .
therefore , the risk of breathing the isotopes is low , unless residents are in the immediate vicinity of burning material .
" i do n't want to play down the issue , but the overall radiation dosage will not increase significantly for the people who live there , " he said .
what he does think a likely outcome will be is that as these isotopes are released , they could travel before falling to the ground again in the presence of high winds .
the result would be a larger area of land with low levels of radiation contamination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fires will likely spread contaminants over a larger area other experts agree with his risk assessment , including philipp renaud , head of the environmental radiation laboratory at france 's irsn nuclear safety institute .
he said the previous major forest fires in russia , in 2002 , showed that the risk of exposure was minor .
radioactivity in neighboring countries jumped by a thousandth of a becquerel unit and in france , a millionth .
" this is n't dangerous at all , " he told the agence france presse .
irsn said that if the contaminated forests burn , local residents would be exposed to about two times the normal radiation levels , which while not ideal , is not a cause for panic .
more dangerous for local residents ' health are the non-radioactive toxic fumes caused by the fire , the organization said .
other nuclear dangers ?
some have been concerned that the fires could reach other nuclear sites in russia , such as power plants or atomic weapon depots .
but according to edmund lengfelder , a director at the german society for radiation protection , the danger of flames engulfing a nuclear reactor and leading to disaster is small .
his group has been active in the chernobyl region for 20 years and has observed that these days , the russians are relatively well prepared when it comes to keeping their nuclear facilities out of harm 's way .
" russia is pretty competent when it comes to disaster response and we do n't see a particular threat to its nuclear facilities , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but regarding the material already deposited from chernobyl , we need to keep an eye on that . "

but experts say there is no significant nuclear health danger . revelations that wildfires have hit hundreds of hectares of land in russia 's western bryansk region contaminated in the chernobyl nuclear disaster have raised fears that radioactive material could be released and reach moscow or even europe .
but radiation experts have said while concern is warranted , any re-release of nuclear contamination would likely pose little risk to human health .
" every instance of increased radioactivity is a cause for concern , but even for the local population , the levels are going to be relatively low , " said ulrich abram , a professor in the chemistry department and radiation expert at the free university of berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" there wo n't be a resulting cloud of radioactive material that could pose a danger to europe , " he said .
fears about russia possibly covering up a new radiation threat were raised when the environmental organization greenpeace warned that fires in forests contaminated in the 1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster could trigger radiation pollution .
the group accused the russian government of playing down the threat .
" fires on these territories will without a doubt lead to an increase in radiation , " said vladimir chuprov , head of the energy program at greenpeace russia , in an interview with the new york times .
" the smoke will spread , and the radioactive traces will spread . "
but radiation experts from russia and other european countries have sought to calm fears , saying that while radioactive isotopes could indeed be released into the air as contaminated material burns , there is no chance that radioactive fallout from the fires could reach anywhere near the magnitude of the chernobyl disaster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radioactive isotopes from the chernobyl disaster are still present in the soil and vegetation fo the area the concerns come from the fact that large areas of ukraine , belarus and russia are still coated with radioactive residue released when reactor no. 4 at the chernobyl nuclear power plan exploded on april 26 , 1986 .
two isotopes are of concern most of the radioactive isotopes released by the chernobyl meltdown were caesium-137 and strontium-90 , both produced by nuclear fission .
because both are isotopes of metallic elements , they fell to the ground rather quickly , according to abram , working their way into the soil over the decades since their release and being taken up by plants and trees .
when the vegetation burns , the atoms are released .
" then people could breathe them in , of course , " said abram .
" they could be exposed to a higher radiation intensity , which can lead to illness . "
abram remarks that people in the affected areas have been living with chernobyl 's aftermath for decades , although ingesting atoms released by the current fires would expose them at higher levels , and more direct contact .
internal exposure to caesium-137 and strontium-90 , through ingestion or inhalation , allows for the radioactive material to be distributed in the body 's soft tissues , especially muscle tissue and bone matter .
these tissues are then exposed to the beta particles and gamma radiation of the isotopes , increasing the risk of developing cancer .
low risk of inhaling nuclear material still , abram says the risk of inhalation is low , because the relative weights of both strontium and caesium send them falling to the ground quickly .
therefore , the risk of breathing the isotopes is low , unless residents are in the immediate vicinity of burning material .
" i do n't want to play down the issue , but the overall radiation dosage will not increase significantly for the people who live there , " he said .
what he does think a likely outcome will be is that as these isotopes are released , they could travel before falling to the ground again in the presence of high winds .
the result would be a larger area of land with low levels of radiation contamination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fires will likely spread contaminants over a larger area other experts agree with his risk assessment , including philipp renaud , head of the environmental radiation laboratory at france 's irsn nuclear safety institute .
he said the previous major forest fires in russia , in 2002 , showed that the risk of exposure was minor .
radioactivity in neighboring countries jumped by a thousandth of a becquerel unit and in france , a millionth .
" this is n't dangerous at all , " he told the agence france presse .
irsn said that if the contaminated forests burn , local residents would be exposed to about two times the normal radiation levels , which while not ideal , is not a cause for panic .
more dangerous for local residents ' health are the non-radioactive toxic fumes caused by the fire , the organization said .
other nuclear dangers ?
some have been concerned that the fires could reach other nuclear sites in russia , such as power plants or atomic weapon depots .
but according to edmund lengfelder , a director at the german society for radiation protection , the danger of flames engulfing a nuclear reactor and leading to disaster is small .
his group has been active in the chernobyl region for 20 years and has observed that these days , the russians are relatively well prepared when it comes to keeping their nuclear facilities out of harm 's way .
" russia is pretty competent when it comes to disaster response and we do n't see a particular threat to its nuclear facilities , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but regarding the material already deposited from chernobyl , we need to keep an eye on that . "

one in five medical tourists choose to visit clinics in bad godesberg , just south of bonn .
the town is especially popular with patients from the middle east . once upon a time when bonn was the capital of west germany , the nearby town of bad godesberg was home to many diplomats - almost all the ambassadors ' residences were located there .
today bad godesberg has become a magnet for arabs , not due to its diplomatic history , but for the healthcare services it offers .
the elisees clinic , in particular , has gained a shining reputation in the arab world .
recently , sheik abdulrahman al muftah from qatar set up an appointment at the clinic for 9 o 'clock .
but it was just before 10:30 that his car turned the corner - a simple blue vw family van .
not exactly the kind of vehicle the medical staff expects a middle eastern sheik to arrive in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sheik abdulrahman al mufti says german clinics have a good reputation a rather squat gentlemen gets out of the car , followed by his wife , dressed in a black burqa .
the sheik is n't wearing a caftan , since in germany he dresses to fit in .
today he 's sporting beige bermuda shorts and white socks with sandals .
he warmly shakes the hands of everyone present .
" i 'm sorry , i knew nothing about an appointment at 9 o 'clock , " he jokes while saying hello to the chief surgeon , natalia brenner .
different customs brenner waves the couple inside , smiling to herself - she knows the drill .
the clinic sees about 3,000 patients a year from the middle east , and during that time , she 's learned a lot about interacting with people from this part of the world .
" arab patients are a special clientele .
they are nice and kind , but they have their ways , " she says .
" for example , they always come late for appointments and then they usually take over our entire clinic . "
brenner has also learned that women from the arab world are not introduced by their own names , and that the price for an operation is often considered negotiable .
while she 's gotten used to most customs , there 's one she still has a hard time with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief surgeon natalia brenner has gotten used to most arab customs " the role of women , that 's something i still do n't understand , " she says .
" it is still strange for me to see that men make the decisions for arab women . "
sheik abdulrahman is no exception .
while his wife , sitting in an examination chair , might be the one about to undergo an operation , he 's the one who will have the final say .
brenner points to an ultrasound image and explains the details of the operation that will treat his wife 's varicose veins .
during the discussion , which takes place through an interpreter because the sheik does n't speak or understand german , his wife carefully watches her husband 's reactions .
despite the language barrier , comprehension is not a problem today in the elisee clinic .
nadhmi nefzi , a young man who follows the sheikh around like a shadow , is responsible for the interpreting at the clinic - he 's the clinic 's personal assistant .
he is dressed in a neat shirt , has carefully parted hair and is the model of discretion .
the young man translates the discussion into arabic , taking special care with the many medical terms .
sheik abdulrahman nods and looks at dr brenner - she can operate on his wife now .
he 's going to take a stroll through the city with nefzi .
known for its health care these kinds of health trips , the sheik says , cost a lot of money .
but as a professor of marine biology and a bank owner , he can afford it .
he 's been coming to germany for over 20 years ; recently , always to bad godesberg .
the sheik explains that the town 's clinics have acquired glowing reputations in the arab world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the whole family comes on these health trips " in the meantime , i 've gotten to know many doctors here , " he laughs .
" i 've become friends with a lot of them and even get special treatment . "
the doctors in bad godesberg are even recommended by the health section of the qatari embassy .
that 's common in arab countries , he says , strolling along the storefront windows of the city .
tailored to a new clientele a little while ago , munich was considered the place to go for medical care , but bad godesberg has knocked the bavarians off their perch , especially since many clinics here have tailored their services to a middle eastern clientele .
" and it 's quiet and safe and my family feels at home because there are so many other arabs here , " referring to those with diplomatic ties who did not move to berlin when the german government shifted capitals .
the sheik points to signs on local shops - the pharmacy , a jewelry store , a café and a souvenir shop - written in arabic .
personal assistant nefzi nods .
in addition to his translation duties he is also charged with making appointments to see high-end apartments .
arabs can be very discerning , he says .
" it 's very important that the environment is clean and that the apartment is representative of germany , " nefzi says .
" they want to have something to talk about back home . "
most health-related visitors from the middle east choose not to stay in hotels .
they consider the rooms impersonal and prefer to be able to prepare their own food .
once the stroll around town is done , the sheik returns to the clinic and waits for his wife to be released from the operating room .
the doctors report the procedure went well .
now it 's time to go shopping , but not in bad godesberg .
the family will have to head over to the bigger cities of cologne or dusseldorf , where they can visit shops with a selection of middle eastern foods wide enough to fit their discerning tastes .

the un has appealed for $ 460 million -lrb- 360 million euros -rrb- in aid . two weeks after the floods struck , the extent of the catastrophe remains unclear .
hundreds of roads and bridges have been destroyed , making it difficult to reach the flooded areas by anything but air .
the us military has tripled the number of its helicopters in pakistan to help with the relief efforts . on wednesday , john holmes , the un emergency relief coordinator , appealed for help from the member states of the united nations in new york . " ladies and gentlemen , assessment of losses or damages are still underway as you can imagine but it 's already very clear that these floods – the worst in pakistan for over 80 years have caused and are continuing to cause immense destruction and immense suffering , " he said gravely . " scale of disaster is horrendous " pakistan 's un ambassador abdullah hussain haroon told the un it was hard to confirm the number of deaths .
" the scale of this disaster is horrendous , " he stated . "

they need food , clothes , shelter and clean drinking water .
moreover , they urgently need medical assistance " as the incidence of acute diarrhea and other water-borne diseases is rising worryingly , " according to john holmes . " cholera is also breaking out , " abdullah hussain haroon explained .
" that is going to be very dangerous .
drinking water and sachets for purifying it are going to become very important over the next few days . " death toll could rapidly rise even if the death toll from this disaster is not as high yet as from the 2004 tsunami or january 's earthquake in haiti , the un has warned that disease and food shortages could fast become deadly if the urgent needs of the people are not attended to . in pakistan itself , despite president zardari 's visit to the flooded areas on thursday , victims continued to complain about the slow response to the disaster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whole villages have been evacuated because of heavy flooding this man in khyber pakhtunkhwa spoke for thousands when he spoke to reporters : " we have been on the roadside for the past 12 days , we need food and tents but we have n't received food or tents . " on wednesday , john holmes ended his appeal with a warning that the destruction was far from over : " far from it .
having already affected the north of the country in late july and early august , the flood wave now continues to make its way through the southern province of sindh where millions more are expected to suffer from the combined impact of continuing torrential rains .

as berlin remembers the event , new figures suggest more people than previously thought were killed on the inner german border from 1961-1989 . berlin commemorated on friday the 49th anniversary of the day the east german government began building the berlin wall . a memorial service was held at the chapel of reconciliation in the former death strip .
mayor klaus wowereit laid a wreath at the bernauer strasse memorial , in remembrance of those who were killed by gdr border guards . " it teaches us a lesson , " wowereit said .
" time and again , it is important to stand decisively against authoritarian regimes and dictatorships . " he urged that the memory of the berlin wall must sharpen appreciation of contemporary freedom and democracy . among a number of services held in berlin on friday , a street is to be renamed in memory of chris gueffroy , recognized as the last person killed trying to cross the border . greater number killed according to the official site that commemorates the berlin wall in the district of mitte , at least 136 people were killed by the east german border patrol while trying to escape from east to west berlin between 1961 and 1989 . but that 's not the whole story .
new figures from the privately-run wall museum , located at the former checkpoint charlie border crossing in berlin , say the total number of people who died trying to escape from east to west germany during those 28 years is 1,393 . " the number has risen by 46 compared with our research last year , " alexandra hildebrandt , chairwoman of the wall museum told deutsche welle . " the list includes those who died at the berlin wall , the baltic sea , the inner german border and neighboring countries like poland , bulgaria , czechoslovakia and hungary .
it also includes east german soldiers , for example those who committed suicide because they could n't deal with the regime , " she said . bildunterschrift : the wall became the symbol of the cold war tragic deaths one of those soldiers , whose suicide has only just come to light , took his own life just hours after construction on the wall had started .
" i cried all night when i read this , " hildebrandt said .
" he shot himself and left his wife a note saying : ' i ca n't do this anymore , i 'm too weak , forgive me , it 's better that way ' . "
in the early hours of august 13 , 1961 , the east german government took the west by surprise and ordered its army and police to stop all travel between east and west berlin and start work on the wall that would divide berlin until 1989 .
even the us secret service did not know of the project .
two months earlier , the east german leader walter ulbricht , head of the east german communist party -lrb- sed -rrb- , openly denied rumors that such a project was underway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germany had denied it was planning to build a wall on august 24 that year , just 11 days after the work on the wall had started , the first person was shot dead trying to escape .
guenter liftin 's murder shocked the world , but erich honecker , who was head of security then and would later become east germany 's leader and head of the sed , remained defiant .
" the building of the anti-fascist protective barrier stabilized the situation in europe and secured peace , " he said a desperate act in reality , the east german regime was in crisis .
by 1961 , 2.7 million people had decided to leave the country and live in the west .
communist ideology was starting to lose its luster , damaging the economy in the process .
in his famous ' ich bin ein berliner ' speech in 1963 in west berlin , then us president john f. kennedy described the berlin wall as " the most vivid and obvious demonstration of the failures of the communist system . "
today , 21 years after the wall came down , many are still afraid to talk about their own or their relatives ' experiences .
" they are still afraid , they are dominated by fear , possibly their whole lives , because the gdr was a dictatorship .
it was like a big prison , where people were afraid to talk , afraid to live , essentially , " hildebrandt told deutsche welle .
honecker firmly believed the wall would stand for 50 or even 100 years .
but the east german regime was powerless against the will of its people and a reform-oriented soviet union , which eventually , led to the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 .

this was a germany team shorn of almost all of its world cup stars and filled with debutants , cameo performers and bit-part players charged with taking on a denmark team smarting from a hugely forgettable summer in south africa .
the danes , while introducing a few unknowns in the hope of kick-starting a new era , still had a number of experienced players on show and with a home crowd behind them , they may have been expected to give germany 's reserves a torrid time .
but despite never playing together as a full team before and in a formation rarely used by loew , the german players slowly started to look comfortable in each other 's company and for the majority of the game , they appeared in little danger of leaving copenhagen without a victory .
while loew is unlikely to ever field this team again or play his regular starters in this tactical shape , a number of players will have improved their chances of joining the first team for the upcoming euro 2012 qualifiers and perhaps the european championships themselves in poland and ukraine in two years time .
der hammer returns to form with added nuances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal one performance that will have given the germany coach food for though was that of thomas hitzlsperger .
given the captain 's armband in the absence of warring skippers philipp lahm and michael ballack , hitzlsperger 's inclusion as germany 's leader in the centre of midfield was just reward for der hammer after fighting back from a severe loss of form .
after losing confidence and his touch at vfb stuttgart – and his place in the germany team – hitzlsperger 's transfer to lazio in january could have been the moment he dropped off germany 's radar .
but despite being overlooked for the world cup , hitzlsperger – now with west ham in the english premiership – has shown the hunger to come back and has recaptured his form .
there was plenty of the marauding midfield work of old but a season in serie a 's less frenetic atmosphere appears to have refined parts of hitzlsperger 's game which contributed to some considering him a blunt instrument .
it was a delicately feigned shot followed by a deft , penetrating pass into the penalty area on 19 minutes that set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal and until he was replaced in the second half , hitzlsperger was a worthy stand-in for bastian schweinsteiger in the conductor 's role .
gentner 's craft catches the eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former wolfsburg star gentner made a good impression playing off hitzlsperger was another player who should have done enough to convince jogi loew to continue his freshening-up of the germany team .
germany 's midfield showed no signs of suffering from the loss of ballack in south africa , and with toni kroos also showing in copenhagen why he could soon be a first team regular , one might think it overly optimistic to think that christian gentner may force his way into the national team 's starting line-up .
while hitzlsperger will certainly give loew a new option in defensive midfield , gentner put on a performance that could see him challenging for a role in the creative trio the germany coach normally deploys behind his lone striker .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder was a livewire throughout .
gentner was mobile , showed great vision and provided a number of killer passes .
drifting across the pitch behind mario gomez and patrick helmes , gentner was consistently probing the danish defensive line .
it was his perfectly timed pass which led to germany 's second goal .
receiving a great pass from jerome boateng on the edge of the area , gentner held the ball up long enough for helmes to time his run before threading a pass between the center-backs and onto helmes ' boot .
the bayer leverkusen striker did the rest .
stand-in strikers score but leave much to be desired bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmes needs the composure he shows with leverkusen helmes , who missed the world cup through injury after a good season with leverkusen , showed signs that he could be a worthy understudy to miroslav klose in the germany attack but the frequency and ease of the opportunities he wasted suggested that he needs more composure at this level and will certainly remain behind klose and thomas mueller in the attacking pecking order in the euro qualifiers .
but gomez , his well taken goal aside , played in a way that only reinforced the opinion that he must have some incriminating photos of his coach in a vault somewhere .
only someone with some nefarious hold over the man who picks the team can continue to get a game when he plays so abjectly .
even in a second-string team , gomez rarely justified his inclusion as an international striker .
elsewhere , there were encouraging signs that christian traesch could make good on his potential and challenge for a consistent role in midfield while toni kroos and marko marin – building on their cameo performances at the world cup – will certainly feature in the euro qualifiers and would be good bets to see increased action at the 2012 tournament .
despite his woeful pass which led to dennis rommedahl pulling a goal back just a minute after helmes put germany 2-0 up , defender serdar tasci had a competent game at left back until that mistake wrecked his confidence .
on the other side of defence , sascha reither was also solid until the final 15 minutes ; although it is unlikely he will ever unseat philipp lahm in the starting line-up .
the makeshift german defence as a whole battled well until the 74th minute when rommedahl 's goal gave denmark belief and shattered that of germany 's back four .
wiese 's strong showing in goal tarnished by late blunder with their two-goal lead slashed in half , germany looked rattled in defence and nervous in attack with gomez and helmes blowing gilt-edged chances to make the score 3-1 in the final ten minutes .
instead , denmark seized their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese kept denmark at bay until the final 15 minutes stand-in keeper tim wiese – who had an excellent game until his defense imploded in front of him – chose to rush out to deal with a dangerous through ball .
finding himself on the edge of his area , the werder bremen stopper was caught in two minds whether to use his hands , choosing instead to chest the ball to mads junker .
the danish striker knocked the ball round the stranded wiese before slotting it into an empty net to complete denmark 's comeback and the german collapse .
it was wiese 's first real mistake of the game but it was glaring one .
with rene adler returning from the injury that kept him from being the number one in south africa , and germany 's world cup keeper manuel neuer enhancing his reputation this summer , even without his 87th minute howler wiese faced an uphill struggle to make ground on his rivals .
it 's likely he 'll remain the third choice throughout the euro qualifiers and beyond .

while loew is unlikely to ever field this team again or play his regular starters in this tactical shape , a number of players will have improved their chances of joining the first team for the upcoming euro 2012 qualifiers and perhaps the european championships themselves in poland and ukraine in two years time .

given the captain 's armband in the absence of warring skippers philipp lahm and michael ballack , hitzlsperger 's inclusion as germany 's leader in the centre of midfield was just reward for der hammer after fighting back from a severe loss of form .
after losing confidence and his touch at vfb stuttgart – and his place in the germany team – hitzlsperger 's transfer to lazio in january could have been the moment he dropped off germany 's radar .
but despite being overlooked for the world cup , hitzlsperger – now with west ham in the english premiership – has shown the hunger to come back and has recaptured his form .
there was plenty of the marauding midfield work of old but a season in serie a 's less frenetic atmosphere appears to have refined parts of hitzlsperger 's game which contributed to some considering him a blunt instrument .
it was a delicately feigned shot followed by a deft , penetrating pass into the penalty area on 19 minutes that set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal and until he was replaced in the second half , hitzlsperger was a worthy stand-in for bastian schweinsteiger in the conductor 's role .
gentner 's craft catches the eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former wolfsburg star gentner made a good impression playing off hitzlsperger was another player who should have done enough to convince jogi loew to continue his freshening-up of the germany team .
germany 's midfield showed no signs of suffering from the loss of ballack in south africa , and with toni kroos also showing in copenhagen why he could soon be a first team regular , one might think it overly optimistic to think that christian gentner may force his way into the national team 's starting line-up .
while hitzlsperger will certainly give loew a new option in defensive midfield , gentner put on a performance that could see him challenging for a role in the creative trio the germany coach normally deploys behind his lone striker .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder was a livewire throughout .
gentner was mobile , showed great vision and provided a number of killer passes .
drifting across the pitch behind mario gomez and patrick helmes , gentner was consistently probing the danish defensive line .
it was his perfectly timed pass which led to germany 's second goal .
receiving a great pass from jerome boateng on the edge of the area , gentner held the ball up long enough for helmes to time his run before threading a pass between the center-backs and onto helmes ' boot .
the bayer leverkusen striker did the rest .
stand-in strikers score but leave much to be desired bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmes needs the composure he shows with leverkusen helmes , who missed the world cup through injury after a good season with leverkusen , showed signs that he could be a worthy understudy to miroslav klose in the germany attack but the frequency and ease of the opportunities he wasted suggested that he needs more composure at this level and will certainly remain behind klose and thomas mueller in the attacking pecking order in the euro qualifiers .
but gomez , his well taken goal aside , played in a way that only reinforced the opinion that he must have some incriminating photos of his coach in a vault somewhere .
only someone with some nefarious hold over the man who picks the team can continue to get a game when he plays so abjectly .
even in a second-string team , gomez rarely justified his inclusion as an international striker .
elsewhere , there were encouraging signs that christian traesch could make good on his potential and challenge for a consistent role in midfield while toni kroos and marko marin – building on their cameo performances at the world cup – will certainly feature in the euro qualifiers and would be good bets to see increased action at the 2012 tournament .
despite his woeful pass which led to dennis rommedahl pulling a goal back just a minute after helmes put germany 2-0 up , defender serdar tasci had a competent game at left back until that mistake wrecked his confidence .
on the other side of defence , sascha reither was also solid until the final 15 minutes ; although it is unlikely he will ever unseat philipp lahm in the starting line-up .
the makeshift german defence as a whole battled well until the 74th minute when rommedahl 's goal gave denmark belief and shattered that of germany 's back four .
wiese 's strong showing in goal tarnished by late blunder with their two-goal lead slashed in half , germany looked rattled in defence and nervous in attack with gomez and helmes blowing gilt-edged chances to make the score 3-1 in the final ten minutes .
instead , denmark seized their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese kept denmark at bay until the final 15 minutes stand-in keeper tim wiese – who had an excellent game until his defense imploded in front of him – chose to rush out to deal with a dangerous through ball .
finding himself on the edge of his area , the werder bremen stopper was caught in two minds whether to use his hands , choosing instead to chest the ball to mads junker .
the danish striker knocked the ball round the stranded wiese before slotting it into an empty net to complete denmark 's comeback and the german collapse .
it was wiese 's first real mistake of the game but it was glaring one .
with rene adler returning from the injury that kept him from being the number one in south africa , and germany 's world cup keeper manuel neuer enhancing his reputation this summer , even without his 87th minute howler wiese faced an uphill struggle to make ground on his rivals .
it 's likely he 'll remain the third choice throughout the euro qualifiers and beyond .

as berlin remembers the event , new figures suggest more people than previously thought were killed on the inner german border from 1961-1989 . berlin commemorated on friday the 49th anniversary of the day the east german government began building the berlin wall . a memorial service was held at the chapel of reconciliation in the former death strip .
mayor klaus wowereit laid a wreath at the bernauer strasse memorial , in remembrance of those who were killed by gdr border guards . " it teaches us a lesson , " wowereit said .

the un has appealed for $ 460 million -lrb- 360 million euros -rrb- in aid . two weeks after the floods struck , the extent of the catastrophe remains unclear .
hundreds of roads and bridges have been destroyed , making it difficult to reach the flooded areas by anything but air .
the us military has tripled the number of its helicopters in pakistan to help with the relief efforts . on wednesday , john holmes , the un emergency relief coordinator , appealed for help from the member states of the united nations in new york . " ladies and gentlemen , assessment of losses or damages are still underway as you can imagine but it 's already very clear that these floods – the worst in pakistan for over 80 years have caused and are continuing to cause immense destruction and immense suffering , " he said gravely . " scale of disaster is horrendous " pakistan 's un ambassador abdullah hussain haroon told the un it was hard to confirm the number of deaths .
" the scale of this disaster is horrendous , " he stated . "
so far we have lost , in the three northern provinces , 4772 villages completely - just gone - that 's why we do n't know what the death toll is because we have no way of calculating at the moment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 14 million pakistanis are thought to be affected by the floods so far , it is known that at least 1,600 people have died and an estimated 14 million people are affected – some 8 percent of the pakistani population . half of those affected need immediate emergency relief if they are to survive .
they need food , clothes , shelter and clean drinking water .
moreover , they urgently need medical assistance " as the incidence of acute diarrhea and other water-borne diseases is rising worryingly , " according to john holmes . " cholera is also breaking out , " abdullah hussain haroon explained .
" that is going to be very dangerous .
drinking water and sachets for purifying it are going to become very important over the next few days . " death toll could rapidly rise even if the death toll from this disaster is not as high yet as from the 2004 tsunami or january 's earthquake in haiti , the un has warned that disease and food shortages could fast become deadly if the urgent needs of the people are not attended to . in pakistan itself , despite president zardari 's visit to the flooded areas on thursday , victims continued to complain about the slow response to the disaster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whole villages have been evacuated because of heavy flooding this man in khyber pakhtunkhwa spoke for thousands when he spoke to reporters : " we have been on the roadside for the past 12 days , we need food and tents but we have n't received food or tents . " on wednesday , john holmes ended his appeal with a warning that the destruction was far from over : " far from it .
having already affected the north of the country in late july and early august , the flood wave now continues to make its way through the southern province of sindh where millions more are expected to suffer from the combined impact of continuing torrential rains .

the un has appealed for $ 460 million -lrb- 360 million euros -rrb- in aid . two weeks after the floods struck , the extent of the catastrophe remains unclear .
hundreds of roads and bridges have been destroyed , making it difficult to reach the flooded areas by anything but air .
the us military has tripled the number of its helicopters in pakistan to help with the relief efforts . on wednesday , john holmes , the un emergency relief coordinator , appealed for help from the member states of the united nations in new york . " ladies and gentlemen , assessment of losses or damages are still underway as you can imagine but it 's already very clear that these floods – the worst in pakistan for over 80 years have caused and are continuing to cause immense destruction and immense suffering , " he said gravely . " scale of disaster is horrendous " pakistan 's un ambassador abdullah hussain haroon told the un it was hard to confirm the number of deaths .
" the scale of this disaster is horrendous , " he stated . "

moreover , they urgently need medical assistance " as the incidence of acute diarrhea and other water-borne diseases is rising worryingly , " according to john holmes . " cholera is also breaking out , " abdullah hussain haroon explained .
" that is going to be very dangerous .
drinking water and sachets for purifying it are going to become very important over the next few days . " death toll could rapidly rise even if the death toll from this disaster is not as high yet as from the 2004 tsunami or january 's earthquake in haiti , the un has warned that disease and food shortages could fast become deadly if the urgent needs of the people are not attended to . in pakistan itself , despite president zardari 's visit to the flooded areas on thursday , victims continued to complain about the slow response to the disaster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whole villages have been evacuated because of heavy flooding this man in khyber pakhtunkhwa spoke for thousands when he spoke to reporters : " we have been on the roadside for the past 12 days , we need food and tents but we have n't received food or tents . " on wednesday , john holmes ended his appeal with a warning that the destruction was far from over : " far from it .

secularists demand it be taken away from the presidential palace . supporters of late polish president lech kaczynski 's law and justice party have remained defiant in their vigil at the site of a cross erected in memory of their late hero - despite calls from church leaders to allow its removal .
those loyal to the former president see him as defender of polish roman catholic values and say that the cross should remain outside the presidential palace in a warsaw square until a more permanent structure is found for the site .
church officials have said that it is time for supporters to give up the fight - warning that they are being manipulated for political , not religious , reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secularists say the palace is not the place for a cross " to all those who pray at the cross we must say that - despite their good intentions - they are being exploited for political purposes .
we urge everyone to make the transfer of the cross possible , " press secretary for the polish episcopate , bishop stanislaw budzik , told reporters in warsaw on thursday .
the palace , now occupied by president bronislaw komorowski , unveiled a plaque on thursday commemorating the tragedy on the facade of a side-wing to the building .
a first attempt to move the cross - initially to a church in the old part of the city and later to a shrine in the south of the country - met with fierce opposition on august 3 .
both the church and the scout group that first erected the four-meter -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- wooden cross had agreed to the plan .
facebook campaign and rally but opposition is mounting to the cross staying in place .
secularists - many of them younger , and opposed to the policies of the former president - rallied on monday in response to a facebook campaign to have the cross removed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some think jaroslaw kaczynski is using the dispute for political capital by midnight , several thousand had gathered in front of the presidential palace chanting the slogan , " to a church ! "
the cross was spontaneously erected after the april 10 crash of the presidential plane in western russia , killing the president , his wife and 94 others .
as well as highlighting religious divisions , the row is indicative of the political tensions currently simmering in the country .
some critics of former president kaczynski were unhappy with his right-wing politics and traditional approach to family values .
opponents also say his nationalist and euroskeptic policies placed poland on an isolationist course within the european union .
current president komorowski is expected to take the country in a more pro-european direction .
commentators say kaczynski 's twin brother jaroslaw , who has called for the cross to stay in place , is possibly using the issue as a political weapon to gain support before the country 's parliamentary elections in 2011 .

analysts say the government needs to find a less hard-line approach . the battle between the thai government and the opposition red shirts , who support former president thaksin shinawatra , that took over the streets of bangkok earlier this year came to an end on may 19 when troops dispersed the crowds . the violence and bloodshed left some 90 people dead and more than 1,400 injured .
now the battlefront has changed with attacks against the government continuing on thai and english-language websites .
however , making use of the computer crime act and the emergency decree , the government has recently shut down thousands of websites , which have been critical of the administration and the royal family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the past state control of the media has been limited to criticism of the thai king bhumibol adulyadej " we have been implementing regulations on communication systems , based on national security like in many countries , " panitan wattanayagorn , the thai government spokesman , recently explained . " we regulate these activities in such a way that they do not harm our national interests .
specific activities may not be allowed on those websites . "
government control of media has shifted focus in the past , most government control of the media and the internet has been related to the royal family . however , media activist supinya klanarong says there has been a shift in focus since the protests . " after the conflict and the state of emergency , censorship has been extended to politics as well .
this means general opposition websites related to the red shirt movement or critics of the government are also being blocked . " pro-red shirt website blocked one news website that has been blocked several times this year is prachatai.com.
red shirt supporters had discussed the protests openly on its discussion board .
however , the government only succeeded in shutting the site down temporarily , with the website circumventing the government controls by changing its server and by using another url .
prachatai.com 's director , chiranuch premchaporn , who has been charged under the computer crimes act , says the discussion board was shut down in july .
she says there is a need to balance the interests of writers and the government . " even if i believe in freedom of expression , i understand there should be some limitations .
we should set up a system to moderate content that can be considered to violate the rights of the people or the law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 100 people were killed in political violence in may legal reform needed chris baker , an author and commentator on thai politics and business calls for " a cooperative framework in which all the parties are involved .
instead the government is using various forms of rather draconian legislation – the computer crimes act , the emergency decree .
at present , this is being rather inflammatory because people do n't like being closed down in this way .
and it 's also relatively ineffective . "
media groups are warning that intimidating web users and closing down sites may backfire against the government and lead to a radicalization of those who post comments online . chris baker says legal reform is needed to overcome the problem and to " control things in a permanent way as it 's very unsatisfactory for all sides at the moment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 12.08.2010 german town attracts medical tourists from arab nations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elisees clinic attracts patients from the middle east health tourism is a booming business in germany .
one in five medical tourists choose to visit clinics in bad godesberg , just south of bonn .
the town is especially popular with patients from the middle east . once upon a time when bonn was the capital of west germany , the nearby town of bad godesberg was home to many diplomats - almost all the ambassadors ' residences were located there .
today bad godesberg has become a magnet for arabs , not due to its diplomatic history , but for the healthcare services it offers .
the elisees clinic , in particular , has gained a shining reputation in the arab world .
recently , sheik abdulrahman al muftah from qatar set up an appointment at the clinic for 9 o 'clock .
but it was just before 10:30 that his car turned the corner - a simple blue vw family van .
not exactly the kind of vehicle the medical staff expects a middle eastern sheik to arrive in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sheik abdulrahman al mufti says german clinics have a good reputation a rather squat gentlemen gets out of the car , followed by his wife , dressed in a black burqa .
the sheik is n't wearing a caftan , since in germany he dresses to fit in .
today he 's sporting beige bermuda shorts and white socks with sandals .
he warmly shakes the hands of everyone present .
" i 'm sorry , i knew nothing about an appointment at 9 o 'clock , " he jokes while saying hello to the chief surgeon , natalia brenner .
different customs brenner waves the couple inside , smiling to herself - she knows the drill .
the clinic sees about 3,000 patients a year from the middle east , and during that time , she 's learned a lot about interacting with people from this part of the world .
" arab patients are a special clientele .
they are nice and kind , but they have their ways , " she says .
" for example , they always come late for appointments and then they usually take over our entire clinic . "
brenner has also learned that women from the arab world are not introduced by their own names , and that the price for an operation is often considered negotiable .
while she 's gotten used to most customs , there 's one she still has a hard time with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief surgeon natalia brenner has gotten used to most arab customs " the role of women , that 's something i still do n't understand , " she says .
" it is still strange for me to see that men make the decisions for arab women . "
sheik abdulrahman is no exception .
while his wife , sitting in an examination chair , might be the one about to undergo an operation , he 's the one who will have the final say .
brenner points to an ultrasound image and explains the details of the operation that will treat his wife 's varicose veins .
during the discussion , which takes place through an interpreter because the sheik does n't speak or understand german , his wife carefully watches her husband 's reactions .
despite the language barrier , comprehension is not a problem today in the elisee clinic .
nadhmi nefzi , a young man who follows the sheikh around like a shadow , is responsible for the interpreting at the clinic - he 's the clinic 's personal assistant .
he is dressed in a neat shirt , has carefully parted hair and is the model of discretion .
the young man translates the discussion into arabic , taking special care with the many medical terms .
sheik abdulrahman nods and looks at dr brenner - she can operate on his wife now .
he 's going to take a stroll through the city with nefzi .
known for its health care these kinds of health trips , the sheik says , cost a lot of money .
but as a professor of marine biology and a bank owner , he can afford it .
he 's been coming to germany for over 20 years ; recently , always to bad godesberg .
the sheik explains that the town 's clinics have acquired glowing reputations in the arab world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the whole family comes on these health trips " in the meantime , i 've gotten to know many doctors here , " he laughs .
" i 've become friends with a lot of them and even get special treatment . "
the doctors in bad godesberg are even recommended by the health section of the qatari embassy .
that 's common in arab countries , he says , strolling along the storefront windows of the city .
tailored to a new clientele a little while ago , munich was considered the place to go for medical care , but bad godesberg has knocked the bavarians off their perch , especially since many clinics here have tailored their services to a middle eastern clientele .
" and it 's quiet and safe and my family feels at home because there are so many other arabs here , " referring to those with diplomatic ties who did not move to berlin when the german government shifted capitals .
the sheik points to signs on local shops - the pharmacy , a jewelry store , a café and a souvenir shop - written in arabic .
personal assistant nefzi nods .
in addition to his translation duties he is also charged with making appointments to see high-end apartments .
arabs can be very discerning , he says .
" it 's very important that the environment is clean and that the apartment is representative of germany , " nefzi says .
" they want to have something to talk about back home . "
most health-related visitors from the middle east choose not to stay in hotels .
they consider the rooms impersonal and prefer to be able to prepare their own food .
once the stroll around town is done , the sheik returns to the clinic and waits for his wife to be released from the operating room .
the doctors report the procedure went well .
now it 's time to go shopping , but not in bad godesberg .
the family will have to head over to the bigger cities of cologne or dusseldorf , where they can visit shops with a selection of middle eastern foods wide enough to fit their discerning tastes .

secularists demand it be taken away from the presidential palace . supporters of late polish president lech kaczynski 's law and justice party have remained defiant in their vigil at the site of a cross erected in memory of their late hero - despite calls from church leaders to allow its removal .
those loyal to the former president see him as defender of polish roman catholic values and say that the cross should remain outside the presidential palace in a warsaw square until a more permanent structure is found for the site .
church officials have said that it is time for supporters to give up the fight - warning that they are being manipulated for political , not religious , reasons .

the palace , now occupied by president bronislaw komorowski , unveiled a plaque on thursday commemorating the tragedy on the facade of a side-wing to the building .
a first attempt to move the cross - initially to a church in the old part of the city and later to a shrine in the south of the country - met with fierce opposition on august 3 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 12.08.2010 german town attracts medical tourists from arab nations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elisees clinic attracts patients from the middle east health tourism is a booming business in germany .
one in five medical tourists choose to visit clinics in bad godesberg , just south of bonn .
the town is especially popular with patients from the middle east . once upon a time when bonn was the capital of west germany , the nearby town of bad godesberg was home to many diplomats - almost all the ambassadors ' residences were located there .
today bad godesberg has become a magnet for arabs , not due to its diplomatic history , but for the healthcare services it offers .
the elisees clinic , in particular , has gained a shining reputation in the arab world .
recently , sheik abdulrahman al muftah from qatar set up an appointment at the clinic for 9 o 'clock .
but it was just before 10:30 that his car turned the corner - a simple blue vw family van .
not exactly the kind of vehicle the medical staff expects a middle eastern sheik to arrive in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sheik abdulrahman al mufti says german clinics have a good reputation a rather squat gentlemen gets out of the car , followed by his wife , dressed in a black burqa .
the sheik is n't wearing a caftan , since in germany he dresses to fit in .
today he 's sporting beige bermuda shorts and white socks with sandals .
he warmly shakes the hands of everyone present .
" i 'm sorry , i knew nothing about an appointment at 9 o 'clock , " he jokes while saying hello to the chief surgeon , natalia brenner .
different customs brenner waves the couple inside , smiling to herself - she knows the drill .
the clinic sees about 3,000 patients a year from the middle east , and during that time , she 's learned a lot about interacting with people from this part of the world .
" arab patients are a special clientele .
they are nice and kind , but they have their ways , " she says .
" for example , they always come late for appointments and then they usually take over our entire clinic . "
brenner has also learned that women from the arab world are not introduced by their own names , and that the price for an operation is often considered negotiable .
while she 's gotten used to most customs , there 's one she still has a hard time with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief surgeon natalia brenner has gotten used to most arab customs " the role of women , that 's something i still do n't understand , " she says .
" it is still strange for me to see that men make the decisions for arab women . "
sheik abdulrahman is no exception .
while his wife , sitting in an examination chair , might be the one about to undergo an operation , he 's the one who will have the final say .
brenner points to an ultrasound image and explains the details of the operation that will treat his wife 's varicose veins .
during the discussion , which takes place through an interpreter because the sheik does n't speak or understand german , his wife carefully watches her husband 's reactions .
despite the language barrier , comprehension is not a problem today in the elisee clinic .
nadhmi nefzi , a young man who follows the sheikh around like a shadow , is responsible for the interpreting at the clinic - he 's the clinic 's personal assistant .
he is dressed in a neat shirt , has carefully parted hair and is the model of discretion .
the young man translates the discussion into arabic , taking special care with the many medical terms .
sheik abdulrahman nods and looks at dr brenner - she can operate on his wife now .
he 's going to take a stroll through the city with nefzi .
known for its health care these kinds of health trips , the sheik says , cost a lot of money .
but as a professor of marine biology and a bank owner , he can afford it .
he 's been coming to germany for over 20 years ; recently , always to bad godesberg .
the sheik explains that the town 's clinics have acquired glowing reputations in the arab world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the whole family comes on these health trips " in the meantime , i 've gotten to know many doctors here , " he laughs .
" i 've become friends with a lot of them and even get special treatment . "
the doctors in bad godesberg are even recommended by the health section of the qatari embassy .
that 's common in arab countries , he says , strolling along the storefront windows of the city .
tailored to a new clientele a little while ago , munich was considered the place to go for medical care , but bad godesberg has knocked the bavarians off their perch , especially since many clinics here have tailored their services to a middle eastern clientele .
" and it 's quiet and safe and my family feels at home because there are so many other arabs here , " referring to those with diplomatic ties who did not move to berlin when the german government shifted capitals .
the sheik points to signs on local shops - the pharmacy , a jewelry store , a café and a souvenir shop - written in arabic .
personal assistant nefzi nods .
in addition to his translation duties he is also charged with making appointments to see high-end apartments .
arabs can be very discerning , he says .
" it 's very important that the environment is clean and that the apartment is representative of germany , " nefzi says .
" they want to have something to talk about back home . "
most health-related visitors from the middle east choose not to stay in hotels .
they consider the rooms impersonal and prefer to be able to prepare their own food .
once the stroll around town is done , the sheik returns to the clinic and waits for his wife to be released from the operating room .
the doctors report the procedure went well .
now it 's time to go shopping , but not in bad godesberg .
the family will have to head over to the bigger cities of cologne or dusseldorf , where they can visit shops with a selection of middle eastern foods wide enough to fit their discerning tastes .

but experts say there is no significant nuclear health danger . revelations that wildfires have hit hundreds of hectares of land in russia 's western bryansk region contaminated in the chernobyl nuclear disaster have raised fears that radioactive material could be released and reach moscow or even europe .
but radiation experts have said while concern is warranted , any re-release of nuclear contamination would likely pose little risk to human health .
" every instance of increased radioactivity is a cause for concern , but even for the local population , the levels are going to be relatively low , " said ulrich abram , a professor in the chemistry department and radiation expert at the free university of berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" there wo n't be a resulting cloud of radioactive material that could pose a danger to europe , " he said .
fears about russia possibly covering up a new radiation threat were raised when the environmental organization greenpeace warned that fires in forests contaminated in the 1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster could trigger radiation pollution .
the group accused the russian government of playing down the threat .
" fires on these territories will without a doubt lead to an increase in radiation , " said vladimir chuprov , head of the energy program at greenpeace russia , in an interview with the new york times .
" the smoke will spread , and the radioactive traces will spread . "
but radiation experts from russia and other european countries have sought to calm fears , saying that while radioactive isotopes could indeed be released into the air as contaminated material burns , there is no chance that radioactive fallout from the fires could reach anywhere near the magnitude of the chernobyl disaster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radioactive isotopes from the chernobyl disaster are still present in the soil and vegetation fo the area the concerns come from the fact that large areas of ukraine , belarus and russia are still coated with radioactive residue released when reactor no. 4 at the chernobyl nuclear power plan exploded on april 26 , 1986 .
two isotopes are of concern most of the radioactive isotopes released by the chernobyl meltdown were caesium-137 and strontium-90 , both produced by nuclear fission .
because both are isotopes of metallic elements , they fell to the ground rather quickly , according to abram , working their way into the soil over the decades since their release and being taken up by plants and trees .
when the vegetation burns , the atoms are released .
" then people could breathe them in , of course , " said abram .
" they could be exposed to a higher radiation intensity , which can lead to illness . "
abram remarks that people in the affected areas have been living with chernobyl 's aftermath for decades , although ingesting atoms released by the current fires would expose them at higher levels , and more direct contact .
internal exposure to caesium-137 and strontium-90 , through ingestion or inhalation , allows for the radioactive material to be distributed in the body 's soft tissues , especially muscle tissue and bone matter .
these tissues are then exposed to the beta particles and gamma radiation of the isotopes , increasing the risk of developing cancer .
low risk of inhaling nuclear material still , abram says the risk of inhalation is low , because the relative weights of both strontium and caesium send them falling to the ground quickly .
therefore , the risk of breathing the isotopes is low , unless residents are in the immediate vicinity of burning material .
" i do n't want to play down the issue , but the overall radiation dosage will not increase significantly for the people who live there , " he said .
what he does think a likely outcome will be is that as these isotopes are released , they could travel before falling to the ground again in the presence of high winds .
the result would be a larger area of land with low levels of radiation contamination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fires will likely spread contaminants over a larger area other experts agree with his risk assessment , including philipp renaud , head of the environmental radiation laboratory at france 's irsn nuclear safety institute .
he said the previous major forest fires in russia , in 2002 , showed that the risk of exposure was minor .
radioactivity in neighboring countries jumped by a thousandth of a becquerel unit and in france , a millionth .
" this is n't dangerous at all , " he told the agence france presse .
irsn said that if the contaminated forests burn , local residents would be exposed to about two times the normal radiation levels , which while not ideal , is not a cause for panic .
more dangerous for local residents ' health are the non-radioactive toxic fumes caused by the fire , the organization said .
other nuclear dangers ?
some have been concerned that the fires could reach other nuclear sites in russia , such as power plants or atomic weapon depots .
but according to edmund lengfelder , a director at the german society for radiation protection , the danger of flames engulfing a nuclear reactor and leading to disaster is small .
his group has been active in the chernobyl region for 20 years and has observed that these days , the russians are relatively well prepared when it comes to keeping their nuclear facilities out of harm 's way .
" russia is pretty competent when it comes to disaster response and we do n't see a particular threat to its nuclear facilities , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but regarding the material already deposited from chernobyl , we need to keep an eye on that . "

the eu has warned sofia to tackle organized crime and corruption . bulgaria 's government and its judiciary are sharply at odds with each other as sofia attempts to fight organized crime and corruption .
the government accuses many of the country 's judges of being corrupt .
magistrates and observers in turn accuse the government of trying to split the judiciary in order to establish a specialized court to deal with key cases .
bulgarian police recently made several arrests after discovering a plan to assassinate prime minister boyko borisov .
yet shortly after those arrests , three judges in a court in the capital sofia released the suspects " due to a lack of evidence . "
" that was irresponsible , " criticized interior minister tsvetan tsvetanov , highlighting the dispute between bulgaria 's executive body and its judiciary .
brussels pushes bulgaria to tackle crime brussels has been warning new eu member bulgaria to tackle organized crime and corruption since long before it joined the bloc in 2007 .
the eu has criticized sofia for delaying important trials and failing to impose sufficiently tough penalties .
eager to comply , the one-year old government has launched one raid after another in an effort to build trust and show that it is doing everything possible to meet these demands . raids with spectacular codenames like " everything hit " and " the killers " have been making headlines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the premier was on a hit list , police said " the killers " led to the arrest of 20 people suspected of involvement in the june 20 shooting of 47-year-old yuri galev , a controversial municipal councilor and football club president .
galev died from his gunshot wounds 10 days later in a sofia hospital .
those arrested were suspected of having killed other high-profile individuals and of having others on their hit list - including prime minister borisov .
borisov was critical of the judges ' decision to release the suspects , suggesting in no uncertain terms that he believed they were in cahoots with the alleged plotters .
" i discovered about 10 days ago that there is an intention to boycott legal proceedings , " borisov said .
" i will leave it up to the consciences of the judges to decide whether this is true or not . "
borisov expressed his frustration with bulgaria 's judicial system years ago , when he himself was a police chief : " we take the criminals in - and the judges let them go . "
now the prime minister is trying to convince voters - and the european union - of this .
many bulgarians readily accept his statements ; the view is widespread that the country 's judges are indeed corrupt .
an inept government , critics say but critics say rising police violence , the show raids and the accusations of judicial incompetence are attempts on the part of the government to divert attention from its lack of success in tackling crime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is still widespread in bulgaria " the government does n't have it easy , " said neli kutzkova , spokeswoman for bulgaria 's judges association .
" first it announces super results .
then three judges come along who discover there is insufficient evidence to convict the suspects . "
" twenty people were arrested in the ' killers ' raid .
the police released 15 themselves .
why did n't anyone get upset about that ? " she asked .
no one believes bulgaria 's judiciary is perfect .
but it 's become an open secret that the cabinet has been seeking a public confrontation with the country 's judges - so that it can go ahead with plans to set up a specialized court .
special jurisdiction , police violence , political pressure on the judiciary , accusations of corruption : all this has been unsettling bulgarians and damaging the country 's image abroad .
lazar gruev , the chairman of bulgaria 's supreme judicial council , has spoken out in an attempt to defuse the situation .
" i can assure bulgaria 's people , and our partners abroad , that bulgaria 's courts will in future also only make decisions based on the law . "
the only thing that can be concluded , three-and-a-half-years after joining the european union , is that bulgaria is a functioning democracy , but that but the rule of law is not upheld there - at least not in a european sense .

but experts say there is no significant nuclear health danger . revelations that wildfires have hit hundreds of hectares of land in russia 's western bryansk region contaminated in the chernobyl nuclear disaster have raised fears that radioactive material could be released and reach moscow or even europe .
but radiation experts have said while concern is warranted , any re-release of nuclear contamination would likely pose little risk to human health .
" every instance of increased radioactivity is a cause for concern , but even for the local population , the levels are going to be relatively low , " said ulrich abram , a professor in the chemistry department and radiation expert at the free university of berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" there wo n't be a resulting cloud of radioactive material that could pose a danger to europe , " he said .
fears about russia possibly covering up a new radiation threat were raised when the environmental organization greenpeace warned that fires in forests contaminated in the 1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster could trigger radiation pollution .
the group accused the russian government of playing down the threat .
" fires on these territories will without a doubt lead to an increase in radiation , " said vladimir chuprov , head of the energy program at greenpeace russia , in an interview with the new york times .
" the smoke will spread , and the radioactive traces will spread . "
but radiation experts from russia and other european countries have sought to calm fears , saying that while radioactive isotopes could indeed be released into the air as contaminated material burns , there is no chance that radioactive fallout from the fires could reach anywhere near the magnitude of the chernobyl disaster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radioactive isotopes from the chernobyl disaster are still present in the soil and vegetation fo the area the concerns come from the fact that large areas of ukraine , belarus and russia are still coated with radioactive residue released when reactor no. 4 at the chernobyl nuclear power plan exploded on april 26 , 1986 .
two isotopes are of concern most of the radioactive isotopes released by the chernobyl meltdown were caesium-137 and strontium-90 , both produced by nuclear fission .
because both are isotopes of metallic elements , they fell to the ground rather quickly , according to abram , working their way into the soil over the decades since their release and being taken up by plants and trees .
when the vegetation burns , the atoms are released .
" then people could breathe them in , of course , " said abram .
" they could be exposed to a higher radiation intensity , which can lead to illness . "
abram remarks that people in the affected areas have been living with chernobyl 's aftermath for decades , although ingesting atoms released by the current fires would expose them at higher levels , and more direct contact .
internal exposure to caesium-137 and strontium-90 , through ingestion or inhalation , allows for the radioactive material to be distributed in the body 's soft tissues , especially muscle tissue and bone matter .
these tissues are then exposed to the beta particles and gamma radiation of the isotopes , increasing the risk of developing cancer .
low risk of inhaling nuclear material still , abram says the risk of inhalation is low , because the relative weights of both strontium and caesium send them falling to the ground quickly .
therefore , the risk of breathing the isotopes is low , unless residents are in the immediate vicinity of burning material .
" i do n't want to play down the issue , but the overall radiation dosage will not increase significantly for the people who live there , " he said .
what he does think a likely outcome will be is that as these isotopes are released , they could travel before falling to the ground again in the presence of high winds .
the result would be a larger area of land with low levels of radiation contamination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fires will likely spread contaminants over a larger area other experts agree with his risk assessment , including philipp renaud , head of the environmental radiation laboratory at france 's irsn nuclear safety institute .
he said the previous major forest fires in russia , in 2002 , showed that the risk of exposure was minor .
radioactivity in neighboring countries jumped by a thousandth of a becquerel unit and in france , a millionth .
" this is n't dangerous at all , " he told the agence france presse .
irsn said that if the contaminated forests burn , local residents would be exposed to about two times the normal radiation levels , which while not ideal , is not a cause for panic .
more dangerous for local residents ' health are the non-radioactive toxic fumes caused by the fire , the organization said .
other nuclear dangers ?
some have been concerned that the fires could reach other nuclear sites in russia , such as power plants or atomic weapon depots .
but according to edmund lengfelder , a director at the german society for radiation protection , the danger of flames engulfing a nuclear reactor and leading to disaster is small .
his group has been active in the chernobyl region for 20 years and has observed that these days , the russians are relatively well prepared when it comes to keeping their nuclear facilities out of harm 's way .
" russia is pretty competent when it comes to disaster response and we do n't see a particular threat to its nuclear facilities , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but regarding the material already deposited from chernobyl , we need to keep an eye on that . "

a probe into its accounts has led to an investigation into submarine deals with germany and alleged corruption in the grey areas of the eu 's defense sector . after months of haggling over its involvement in the unprecedented european union bailout to save greece from defaulting , germany finds itself at the center of another financial tangle with the debt-ridden mediterranean nation - this time involving defense contracts greece could ill afford and the shadowy deals behind them .
at the same time that german chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet was approving 22.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 29.7 billion -rrb- in aid to greece , prosecutors in germany began investigating whether defense contractors had paid millions of euros in bribes to greek officials in connection with the sale of two german submarines in a deal worth more than a billion euros .
the investigation , which began in may , is focussing on the deal - part of a larger , complicated decade-old contract to provide greece with a total of six submarines - struck between berlin and athens in march as greece lurched toward bankruptcy .
the investigation is also looking at similar defense deals struck between germany and portugal , another eu member state teetering on the brink of financial collapse .
german firm at the heart of bribery allegations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german company is suspected of being involved in bribery the probe is looking into allegations that ferrostaal ag , one of the german companies helping to build the submarines , was involved in bribery .
ferrostaal executives are suspected by munich prosecutors of authorizing payments worth millions of euros to politicians to win the initial deal in 2000 through a greek company called marine industrial enterprises .
according to records unearthed by the german investigation , ferrostaal allegedly used false consulting contracts to cover up the bribes before distributing payments to " officials and decision-makers " in greece .
the prosecutors also allege that ferrostaal accepted fees from other companies for bribes paid on their behalf , in effect operating a policy of subcontracted bribery .
while no charges have been brought in the on-going investigation into the submarine deal , several ferrostaal executives stepped down in may and three company representatives have been indicted , along with individuals in portugal linked to the portuguese deals .
the company itself could face fines in excess of 120 million euros if found guilty of bribing officials in greece and portugal .
greece 's economic crimes unit is also probing the transaction as part of its investigation into all weapons deals made by athens over the past decade , deals said to be in the region of 16 billion euros in total , to determine whether greece overpaid or agreed to deals for military equipment it did n't need .
greece is the largest importer of conventional weapons in europe and its military spending , the highest in the european union , is widely accepted as one of the main reasons for the parlous state of its finances .
eu urged to clamp down on defence sector corruption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government has denied exploiting greece the revelations and investigations in the deals between germany , greece and portugal have also prompted members of the european parliament to call for the eu to launch its own probe , with some officials accusing germany of making their military dealings with greece a condition for its involvement in the country 's bailout and profiting from athens ' profligacy .
german government officials have vehemently denied that germany took advantage of greece 's spending habits to land lucrative defense deals and have dismissed claims that its involvement in the rescue package , in which germany was the largest eu contributor of financial aid , was dependent on agreements being signed .
" this is a very difficult matter , " dr. christian moelling , a european defense expert from the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" if greece wants to spend the money , then of course it can but at the moment it is spending eu money ... or , in fact , mostly germany 's money . "
" the problem is that this submarine deal is an old deal .
it was signed in 2000 before greece had this level of financial problems .
as with any deal , it is very hard to get out of the contract and the private actors in this deal have every right to get their money . "
as well as the submarine deals themselves , it is thought that " offset contracts " were also signed to the tune of one billion euros .
offsets are arrangements made by purchasing governments with their suppliers , requiring the contractors to reinvest a percentage of the value of the deal in the importing country .
offset deals under scrutiny in addition to illegal payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buying military hardware sometimes comes with extras " the arms trade is already an incubator of corruption with such large sums of money flowing around , and all that secrecy , " nick whitney , a european defence expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it 's so easy to avoid clear accountability about what you 've bought , and why .
the best antidotes are transparency , and competition .
but if you add offsets to the deal , it only gets murkier . " " the temptation to look for offsets - compensation for a big export of state capital - is understandable for some countries especially if you do n't have an armaments industry of your own , and so ca n't expect to get compensated on a ' swings and roundabouts ' basis . "
dr. moelling describes offsets as side deals .
" direct offsets are deals which happen thus : the purchaser will say , for example , ' we want to buy your fighter aircraft but we also want you to provide us with the industrial capability to build the missiles which goes with it . '
the seller will perhaps build the factory , pass on the technical knowledge or include the license to build the missiles in the deal for the plane . " " indirect offsets work in much the same way but the additional deal will include something not attached to original product ; we buy the plane , you build a hospital , " he added .
" these offsets often go beyond just the supplying company and can include participation by the supplier 's government .
in the case of the submarines , this would be the german government . "
grey area of eu defense sector open to abuse under many trade agreements and in most industries , offsets are illegal but the eu allows them in defense procurement where member states can invoke a " national security " exemption .
opponents of offset agreements say they are negotiated among companies with government favoritism and violate the eu 's internal market competition rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense deals within the eu are sweetened by offsets " in the civilian field , offsets are illegal but in the defense sector , they are legal , " dr. moelling added .
" in the eu , article 346 of the current treaty says that any agreement can be overruled if it is claimed to be in the national security .
the problem is that there are many different opinions on offsets in the eu .
germany says they are not helpful as they blur the actual price of products .
greece meanwhile has a very active offset policy while other countries have no official policy .
offests are n't part of any typical market so they 're very hard to monitor and are highly politicized . "
" the european defense agency recently brokered an agreement amongst european member states to limit offset to 100 percent of the value of the arms contract , " nick witney said . " previously , many member states were looking for a lot more .
austria was the most striking case - they used to demand 300 percent offset .
in such circumstances , weapon-buying becomes the least important part of the transaction - the big money is in the offset .
so any pretence that you are buying the best weapon at the best price for your military needs goes out of the window - noone can really disentangle why you 've bought what you 've bought . " the eu has been called upon to tackle the " national security " exemption invoked by member states when dealing in offsets .
the eu is planning to introduce a new " defense procurement directive " which will restrict the areas in which governments can use the exemption and demand that the offsets they are involved in are necessary for the protection of security interests and do not break competition rules . " it 's not only on the weapons side of the deal that competition gets distorted , " witney added . " if the arms seller agrees to buy 1,000 trucks from you in compensation , what 's that done to all the rules of the single market about fair trade in trucks ?
the treaties make clear that , although ' national security ' gives member states latitude to ignore single market rules in their arms purchases , they must not in doing so distort competition in non-military goods .

one in five medical tourists choose to visit clinics in bad godesberg , just south of bonn .
the town is especially popular with patients from the middle east . once upon a time when bonn was the capital of west germany , the nearby town of bad godesberg was home to many diplomats - almost all the ambassadors ' residences were located there .
today bad godesberg has become a magnet for arabs , not due to its diplomatic history , but for the healthcare services it offers .
the elisees clinic , in particular , has gained a shining reputation in the arab world .
recently , sheik abdulrahman al muftah from qatar set up an appointment at the clinic for 9 o 'clock .
but it was just before 10:30 that his car turned the corner - a simple blue vw family van .
not exactly the kind of vehicle the medical staff expects a middle eastern sheik to arrive in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sheik abdulrahman al mufti says german clinics have a good reputation a rather squat gentlemen gets out of the car , followed by his wife , dressed in a black burqa .
the sheik is n't wearing a caftan , since in germany he dresses to fit in .
today he 's sporting beige bermuda shorts and white socks with sandals .
he warmly shakes the hands of everyone present .
" i 'm sorry , i knew nothing about an appointment at 9 o 'clock , " he jokes while saying hello to the chief surgeon , natalia brenner .
different customs brenner waves the couple inside , smiling to herself - she knows the drill .
the clinic sees about 3,000 patients a year from the middle east , and during that time , she 's learned a lot about interacting with people from this part of the world .
" arab patients are a special clientele .
they are nice and kind , but they have their ways , " she says .
" for example , they always come late for appointments and then they usually take over our entire clinic . "
brenner has also learned that women from the arab world are not introduced by their own names , and that the price for an operation is often considered negotiable .
while she 's gotten used to most customs , there 's one she still has a hard time with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief surgeon natalia brenner has gotten used to most arab customs " the role of women , that 's something i still do n't understand , " she says .
" it is still strange for me to see that men make the decisions for arab women . "
sheik abdulrahman is no exception .
while his wife , sitting in an examination chair , might be the one about to undergo an operation , he 's the one who will have the final say .
brenner points to an ultrasound image and explains the details of the operation that will treat his wife 's varicose veins .
during the discussion , which takes place through an interpreter because the sheik does n't speak or understand german , his wife carefully watches her husband 's reactions .
despite the language barrier , comprehension is not a problem today in the elisee clinic .
nadhmi nefzi , a young man who follows the sheikh around like a shadow , is responsible for the interpreting at the clinic - he 's the clinic 's personal assistant .
he is dressed in a neat shirt , has carefully parted hair and is the model of discretion .
the young man translates the discussion into arabic , taking special care with the many medical terms .
sheik abdulrahman nods and looks at dr brenner - she can operate on his wife now .
he 's going to take a stroll through the city with nefzi .
known for its health care these kinds of health trips , the sheik says , cost a lot of money .
but as a professor of marine biology and a bank owner , he can afford it .
he 's been coming to germany for over 20 years ; recently , always to bad godesberg .
the sheik explains that the town 's clinics have acquired glowing reputations in the arab world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the whole family comes on these health trips " in the meantime , i 've gotten to know many doctors here , " he laughs .
" i 've become friends with a lot of them and even get special treatment . "
the doctors in bad godesberg are even recommended by the health section of the qatari embassy .
that 's common in arab countries , he says , strolling along the storefront windows of the city .
tailored to a new clientele a little while ago , munich was considered the place to go for medical care , but bad godesberg has knocked the bavarians off their perch , especially since many clinics here have tailored their services to a middle eastern clientele .
" and it 's quiet and safe and my family feels at home because there are so many other arabs here , " referring to those with diplomatic ties who did not move to berlin when the german government shifted capitals .
the sheik points to signs on local shops - the pharmacy , a jewelry store , a café and a souvenir shop - written in arabic .
personal assistant nefzi nods .
in addition to his translation duties he is also charged with making appointments to see high-end apartments .
arabs can be very discerning , he says .
" it 's very important that the environment is clean and that the apartment is representative of germany , " nefzi says .
" they want to have something to talk about back home . "
most health-related visitors from the middle east choose not to stay in hotels .
they consider the rooms impersonal and prefer to be able to prepare their own food .
once the stroll around town is done , the sheik returns to the clinic and waits for his wife to be released from the operating room .
the doctors report the procedure went well .
now it 's time to go shopping , but not in bad godesberg .
the family will have to head over to the bigger cities of cologne or dusseldorf , where they can visit shops with a selection of middle eastern foods wide enough to fit their discerning tastes .

one in five medical tourists choose to visit clinics in bad godesberg , just south of bonn .
the town is especially popular with patients from the middle east . once upon a time when bonn was the capital of west germany , the nearby town of bad godesberg was home to many diplomats - almost all the ambassadors ' residences were located there .
today bad godesberg has become a magnet for arabs , not due to its diplomatic history , but for the healthcare services it offers .
the elisees clinic , in particular , has gained a shining reputation in the arab world .
recently , sheik abdulrahman al muftah from qatar set up an appointment at the clinic for 9 o 'clock .
but it was just before 10:30 that his car turned the corner - a simple blue vw family van .
not exactly the kind of vehicle the medical staff expects a middle eastern sheik to arrive in .

the sheik is n't wearing a caftan , since in germany he dresses to fit in .
today he 's sporting beige bermuda shorts and white socks with sandals .
he warmly shakes the hands of everyone present .
" i 'm sorry , i knew nothing about an appointment at 9 o 'clock , " he jokes while saying hello to the chief surgeon , natalia brenner .
different customs brenner waves the couple inside , smiling to herself - she knows the drill .
the clinic sees about 3,000 patients a year from the middle east , and during that time , she 's learned a lot about interacting with people from this part of the world .
" arab patients are a special clientele .
they are nice and kind , but they have their ways , " she says .
" for example , they always come late for appointments and then they usually take over our entire clinic . "
brenner has also learned that women from the arab world are not introduced by their own names , and that the price for an operation is often considered negotiable .
while she 's gotten used to most customs , there 's one she still has a hard time with .

" it is still strange for me to see that men make the decisions for arab women . "
sheik abdulrahman is no exception .
while his wife , sitting in an examination chair , might be the one about to undergo an operation , he 's the one who will have the final say .
brenner points to an ultrasound image and explains the details of the operation that will treat his wife 's varicose veins .
during the discussion , which takes place through an interpreter because the sheik does n't speak or understand german , his wife carefully watches her husband 's reactions .
despite the language barrier , comprehension is not a problem today in the elisee clinic .
nadhmi nefzi , a young man who follows the sheikh around like a shadow , is responsible for the interpreting at the clinic - he 's the clinic 's personal assistant .
he is dressed in a neat shirt , has carefully parted hair and is the model of discretion .
the young man translates the discussion into arabic , taking special care with the many medical terms .
sheik abdulrahman nods and looks at dr brenner - she can operate on his wife now .
he 's going to take a stroll through the city with nefzi .
known for its health care these kinds of health trips , the sheik says , cost a lot of money .
but as a professor of marine biology and a bank owner , he can afford it .
he 's been coming to germany for over 20 years ; recently , always to bad godesberg .
the sheik explains that the town 's clinics have acquired glowing reputations in the arab world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the whole family comes on these health trips " in the meantime , i 've gotten to know many doctors here , " he laughs .
" i 've become friends with a lot of them and even get special treatment . "
the doctors in bad godesberg are even recommended by the health section of the qatari embassy .
that 's common in arab countries , he says , strolling along the storefront windows of the city .
tailored to a new clientele a little while ago , munich was considered the place to go for medical care , but bad godesberg has knocked the bavarians off their perch , especially since many clinics here have tailored their services to a middle eastern clientele .
" and it 's quiet and safe and my family feels at home because there are so many other arabs here , " referring to those with diplomatic ties who did not move to berlin when the german government shifted capitals .
the sheik points to signs on local shops - the pharmacy , a jewelry store , a café and a souvenir shop - written in arabic .
personal assistant nefzi nods .
in addition to his translation duties he is also charged with making appointments to see high-end apartments .
arabs can be very discerning , he says .
" it 's very important that the environment is clean and that the apartment is representative of germany , " nefzi says .
" they want to have something to talk about back home . "
most health-related visitors from the middle east choose not to stay in hotels .
they consider the rooms impersonal and prefer to be able to prepare their own food .
once the stroll around town is done , the sheik returns to the clinic and waits for his wife to be released from the operating room .
the doctors report the procedure went well .
now it 's time to go shopping , but not in bad godesberg .
the family will have to head over to the bigger cities of cologne or dusseldorf , where they can visit shops with a selection of middle eastern foods wide enough to fit their discerning tastes .

over 80 million 15 to 24-year-olds are without work , the report said , with increases in developed countries most extreme . according to a united nations report released on thursday , labor market trends for young people have taken a drastic turn for the worse since 2007 , when global youth unemployment remained fairly stagnant .
for the 10 years prior to the economic crisis , the report noted the number of unemployed youth around the world had increased by an average of 200,000 per year .
in 2009 , however , youth unemployment increased by a staggering 6.7 million .
sara elder , an economist with the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- and co-author of the report , says youth unemployment is most severe in the developed economies and non-eu , central and southeastern europe .
" in these two regions alone , we saw the highest annual increases that we have ever seen for any region since we began observing the trend in 1991 .
overall , the youth unemployment rate of 17.7 percent in developed economies also marks the highest we have ever seen , " elder told deutsche welle . eu governments looking to fend off hopelessness the report finds young women are hardest hit by unemployment in most regions .
the only exceptions are in the developed economies and the european union , where nearly twice as many males as females are unemployed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's apprentice system keeps most youths busy in the european union , germany displayed the lowest rate of youth unemployment .
around 8 percent of all germans between 16 and 24 looking for a job are out of work .
this is based most of all on the country 's apprentice system , in which companies offer three-year training positions to young germans regardless of education level .
this is a great contrast to the situation in other eu states such as estonia , latvia and lithuania , which according to the ilo report had the highest rates of youth unemployment in the 27-nation bloc .
in other developed eu countries , such as spain and the united kingdom , elder said many unemployed youth have become so discouraged that they are no longer even looking for work .
" governments everywhere are struggling to prevent a situation in which young people detach themselves completely from the labor market , having lost all hope of being able to provide themselves with a decent living .
unemployment is more a concern for developed economies than developing economies , " she said .
drastic unemployment in developing countries while only 10 percent of the global youth labor force lives in developed economies , youth unemployment there increased by 45 percent last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unofficial jobs are most common in developing nations the report added that roughly 90 percent of the world 's young people are living in developing countries - where under-employment and poverty are two of the most prevalent and serious problems .
steven kapsos , an ilo economist and also a co-author of the report , told deutsche welle that unemployed young people in developing countries do n't receive any benefits . thus , they are left with no choice : " they are forced by necessity to work in the informal economy , where they will most likely remain for the rest of their lives . "
" we estimate that 152 million youth were classified as working ' poor ' in 2008 and that is based on the standard international poverty line of $ 1.25 -lrb- 0.77 euro -rrb- per day .
this accounts for some 28 percent of all young workers around the world , " kapsos added .
the ilo , meanwhile , forecasts slight improvements in youth unemployment for almost all of the world 's regions next year .
the largest decrease in youth unemployment is expected in central and southeastern europe and the states formerly belonging to the soviet union .

a probe into its accounts has led to an investigation into submarine deals with germany and alleged corruption in the grey areas of the eu 's defense sector . after months of haggling over its involvement in the unprecedented european union bailout to save greece from defaulting , germany finds itself at the center of another financial tangle with the debt-ridden mediterranean nation - this time involving defense contracts greece could ill afford and the shadowy deals behind them .
at the same time that german chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet was approving 22.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 29.7 billion -rrb- in aid to greece , prosecutors in germany began investigating whether defense contractors had paid millions of euros in bribes to greek officials in connection with the sale of two german submarines in a deal worth more than a billion euros .
the investigation , which began in may , is focussing on the deal - part of a larger , complicated decade-old contract to provide greece with a total of six submarines - struck between berlin and athens in march as greece lurched toward bankruptcy .
the investigation is also looking at similar defense deals struck between germany and portugal , another eu member state teetering on the brink of financial collapse .
german firm at the heart of bribery allegations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german company is suspected of being involved in bribery the probe is looking into allegations that ferrostaal ag , one of the german companies helping to build the submarines , was involved in bribery .
ferrostaal executives are suspected by munich prosecutors of authorizing payments worth millions of euros to politicians to win the initial deal in 2000 through a greek company called marine industrial enterprises .
according to records unearthed by the german investigation , ferrostaal allegedly used false consulting contracts to cover up the bribes before distributing payments to " officials and decision-makers " in greece .
the prosecutors also allege that ferrostaal accepted fees from other companies for bribes paid on their behalf , in effect operating a policy of subcontracted bribery .
while no charges have been brought in the on-going investigation into the submarine deal , several ferrostaal executives stepped down in may and three company representatives have been indicted , along with individuals in portugal linked to the portuguese deals .
the company itself could face fines in excess of 120 million euros if found guilty of bribing officials in greece and portugal .
greece 's economic crimes unit is also probing the transaction as part of its investigation into all weapons deals made by athens over the past decade , deals said to be in the region of 16 billion euros in total , to determine whether greece overpaid or agreed to deals for military equipment it did n't need .
greece is the largest importer of conventional weapons in europe and its military spending , the highest in the european union , is widely accepted as one of the main reasons for the parlous state of its finances .
eu urged to clamp down on defence sector corruption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government has denied exploiting greece the revelations and investigations in the deals between germany , greece and portugal have also prompted members of the european parliament to call for the eu to launch its own probe , with some officials accusing germany of making their military dealings with greece a condition for its involvement in the country 's bailout and profiting from athens ' profligacy .
german government officials have vehemently denied that germany took advantage of greece 's spending habits to land lucrative defense deals and have dismissed claims that its involvement in the rescue package , in which germany was the largest eu contributor of financial aid , was dependent on agreements being signed .
" this is a very difficult matter , " dr. christian moelling , a european defense expert from the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" if greece wants to spend the money , then of course it can but at the moment it is spending eu money ... or , in fact , mostly germany 's money . "
" the problem is that this submarine deal is an old deal .
it was signed in 2000 before greece had this level of financial problems .
as with any deal , it is very hard to get out of the contract and the private actors in this deal have every right to get their money . "
as well as the submarine deals themselves , it is thought that " offset contracts " were also signed to the tune of one billion euros .
offsets are arrangements made by purchasing governments with their suppliers , requiring the contractors to reinvest a percentage of the value of the deal in the importing country .
offset deals under scrutiny in addition to illegal payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buying military hardware sometimes comes with extras " the arms trade is already an incubator of corruption with such large sums of money flowing around , and all that secrecy , " nick whitney , a european defence expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it 's so easy to avoid clear accountability about what you 've bought , and why .
the best antidotes are transparency , and competition .
but if you add offsets to the deal , it only gets murkier . " " the temptation to look for offsets - compensation for a big export of state capital - is understandable for some countries especially if you do n't have an armaments industry of your own , and so ca n't expect to get compensated on a ' swings and roundabouts ' basis . "
dr. moelling describes offsets as side deals .
" direct offsets are deals which happen thus : the purchaser will say , for example , ' we want to buy your fighter aircraft but we also want you to provide us with the industrial capability to build the missiles which goes with it . '
the seller will perhaps build the factory , pass on the technical knowledge or include the license to build the missiles in the deal for the plane . " " indirect offsets work in much the same way but the additional deal will include something not attached to original product ; we buy the plane , you build a hospital , " he added .
" these offsets often go beyond just the supplying company and can include participation by the supplier 's government .
in the case of the submarines , this would be the german government . "
grey area of eu defense sector open to abuse under many trade agreements and in most industries , offsets are illegal but the eu allows them in defense procurement where member states can invoke a " national security " exemption .
opponents of offset agreements say they are negotiated among companies with government favoritism and violate the eu 's internal market competition rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense deals within the eu are sweetened by offsets " in the civilian field , offsets are illegal but in the defense sector , they are legal , " dr. moelling added .
" in the eu , article 346 of the current treaty says that any agreement can be overruled if it is claimed to be in the national security .
the problem is that there are many different opinions on offsets in the eu .
germany says they are not helpful as they blur the actual price of products .
greece meanwhile has a very active offset policy while other countries have no official policy .
offests are n't part of any typical market so they 're very hard to monitor and are highly politicized . "
" the european defense agency recently brokered an agreement amongst european member states to limit offset to 100 percent of the value of the arms contract , " nick witney said . " previously , many member states were looking for a lot more .
austria was the most striking case - they used to demand 300 percent offset .
in such circumstances , weapon-buying becomes the least important part of the transaction - the big money is in the offset .
so any pretence that you are buying the best weapon at the best price for your military needs goes out of the window - noone can really disentangle why you 've bought what you 've bought . " the eu has been called upon to tackle the " national security " exemption invoked by member states when dealing in offsets .
the eu is planning to introduce a new " defense procurement directive " which will restrict the areas in which governments can use the exemption and demand that the offsets they are involved in are necessary for the protection of security interests and do not break competition rules . " it 's not only on the weapons side of the deal that competition gets distorted , " witney added . " if the arms seller agrees to buy 1,000 trucks from you in compensation , what 's that done to all the rules of the single market about fair trade in trucks ?
the treaties make clear that , although ' national security ' gives member states latitude to ignore single market rules in their arms purchases , they must not in doing so distort competition in non-military goods .

one in five medical tourists choose to visit clinics in bad godesberg , just south of bonn .
the town is especially popular with patients from the middle east . once upon a time when bonn was the capital of west germany , the nearby town of bad godesberg was home to many diplomats - almost all the ambassadors ' residences were located there .
today bad godesberg has become a magnet for arabs , not due to its diplomatic history , but for the healthcare services it offers .
the elisees clinic , in particular , has gained a shining reputation in the arab world .
recently , sheik abdulrahman al muftah from qatar set up an appointment at the clinic for 9 o 'clock .
but it was just before 10:30 that his car turned the corner - a simple blue vw family van .
not exactly the kind of vehicle the medical staff expects a middle eastern sheik to arrive in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sheik abdulrahman al mufti says german clinics have a good reputation a rather squat gentlemen gets out of the car , followed by his wife , dressed in a black burqa .
the sheik is n't wearing a caftan , since in germany he dresses to fit in .
today he 's sporting beige bermuda shorts and white socks with sandals .
he warmly shakes the hands of everyone present .
" i 'm sorry , i knew nothing about an appointment at 9 o 'clock , " he jokes while saying hello to the chief surgeon , natalia brenner .
different customs brenner waves the couple inside , smiling to herself - she knows the drill .
the clinic sees about 3,000 patients a year from the middle east , and during that time , she 's learned a lot about interacting with people from this part of the world .
" arab patients are a special clientele .
they are nice and kind , but they have their ways , " she says .
" for example , they always come late for appointments and then they usually take over our entire clinic . "
brenner has also learned that women from the arab world are not introduced by their own names , and that the price for an operation is often considered negotiable .
while she 's gotten used to most customs , there 's one she still has a hard time with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief surgeon natalia brenner has gotten used to most arab customs " the role of women , that 's something i still do n't understand , " she says .
" it is still strange for me to see that men make the decisions for arab women . "
sheik abdulrahman is no exception .
while his wife , sitting in an examination chair , might be the one about to undergo an operation , he 's the one who will have the final say .
brenner points to an ultrasound image and explains the details of the operation that will treat his wife 's varicose veins .
during the discussion , which takes place through an interpreter because the sheik does n't speak or understand german , his wife carefully watches her husband 's reactions .
despite the language barrier , comprehension is not a problem today in the elisee clinic .
nadhmi nefzi , a young man who follows the sheikh around like a shadow , is responsible for the interpreting at the clinic - he 's the clinic 's personal assistant .
he is dressed in a neat shirt , has carefully parted hair and is the model of discretion .
the young man translates the discussion into arabic , taking special care with the many medical terms .
sheik abdulrahman nods and looks at dr brenner - she can operate on his wife now .
he 's going to take a stroll through the city with nefzi .
known for its health care these kinds of health trips , the sheik says , cost a lot of money .
but as a professor of marine biology and a bank owner , he can afford it .
he 's been coming to germany for over 20 years ; recently , always to bad godesberg .
the sheik explains that the town 's clinics have acquired glowing reputations in the arab world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the whole family comes on these health trips " in the meantime , i 've gotten to know many doctors here , " he laughs .
" i 've become friends with a lot of them and even get special treatment . "
the doctors in bad godesberg are even recommended by the health section of the qatari embassy .
that 's common in arab countries , he says , strolling along the storefront windows of the city .
tailored to a new clientele a little while ago , munich was considered the place to go for medical care , but bad godesberg has knocked the bavarians off their perch , especially since many clinics here have tailored their services to a middle eastern clientele .
" and it 's quiet and safe and my family feels at home because there are so many other arabs here , " referring to those with diplomatic ties who did not move to berlin when the german government shifted capitals .
the sheik points to signs on local shops - the pharmacy , a jewelry store , a café and a souvenir shop - written in arabic .
personal assistant nefzi nods .
in addition to his translation duties he is also charged with making appointments to see high-end apartments .
arabs can be very discerning , he says .
" it 's very important that the environment is clean and that the apartment is representative of germany , " nefzi says .
" they want to have something to talk about back home . "
most health-related visitors from the middle east choose not to stay in hotels .
they consider the rooms impersonal and prefer to be able to prepare their own food .
once the stroll around town is done , the sheik returns to the clinic and waits for his wife to be released from the operating room .
the doctors report the procedure went well .
now it 's time to go shopping , but not in bad godesberg .
the family will have to head over to the bigger cities of cologne or dusseldorf , where they can visit shops with a selection of middle eastern foods wide enough to fit their discerning tastes .

one in five medical tourists choose to visit clinics in bad godesberg , just south of bonn .
the town is especially popular with patients from the middle east . once upon a time when bonn was the capital of west germany , the nearby town of bad godesberg was home to many diplomats - almost all the ambassadors ' residences were located there .
today bad godesberg has become a magnet for arabs , not due to its diplomatic history , but for the healthcare services it offers .
the elisees clinic , in particular , has gained a shining reputation in the arab world .
recently , sheik abdulrahman al muftah from qatar set up an appointment at the clinic for 9 o 'clock .
but it was just before 10:30 that his car turned the corner - a simple blue vw family van .
not exactly the kind of vehicle the medical staff expects a middle eastern sheik to arrive in .

" i 'm sorry , i knew nothing about an appointment at 9 o 'clock , " he jokes while saying hello to the chief surgeon , natalia brenner .

the clinic sees about 3,000 patients a year from the middle east , and during that time , she 's learned a lot about interacting with people from this part of the world .
" arab patients are a special clientele .
they are nice and kind , but they have their ways , " she says .
" for example , they always come late for appointments and then they usually take over our entire clinic . "
brenner has also learned that women from the arab world are not introduced by their own names , and that the price for an operation is often considered negotiable .

sheik abdulrahman is no exception .
while his wife , sitting in an examination chair , might be the one about to undergo an operation , he 's the one who will have the final say .
brenner points to an ultrasound image and explains the details of the operation that will treat his wife 's varicose veins .
during the discussion , which takes place through an interpreter because the sheik does n't speak or understand german , his wife carefully watches her husband 's reactions .
despite the language barrier , comprehension is not a problem today in the elisee clinic .
nadhmi nefzi , a young man who follows the sheikh around like a shadow , is responsible for the interpreting at the clinic - he 's the clinic 's personal assistant .
he is dressed in a neat shirt , has carefully parted hair and is the model of discretion .
the young man translates the discussion into arabic , taking special care with the many medical terms .
sheik abdulrahman nods and looks at dr brenner - she can operate on his wife now .
he 's going to take a stroll through the city with nefzi .
known for its health care these kinds of health trips , the sheik says , cost a lot of money .
but as a professor of marine biology and a bank owner , he can afford it .
he 's been coming to germany for over 20 years ; recently , always to bad godesberg .
the sheik explains that the town 's clinics have acquired glowing reputations in the arab world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the whole family comes on these health trips " in the meantime , i 've gotten to know many doctors here , " he laughs .
" i 've become friends with a lot of them and even get special treatment . "
the doctors in bad godesberg are even recommended by the health section of the qatari embassy .
that 's common in arab countries , he says , strolling along the storefront windows of the city .
tailored to a new clientele a little while ago , munich was considered the place to go for medical care , but bad godesberg has knocked the bavarians off their perch , especially since many clinics here have tailored their services to a middle eastern clientele .
" and it 's quiet and safe and my family feels at home because there are so many other arabs here , " referring to those with diplomatic ties who did not move to berlin when the german government shifted capitals .
the sheik points to signs on local shops - the pharmacy , a jewelry store , a café and a souvenir shop - written in arabic .
personal assistant nefzi nods .
in addition to his translation duties he is also charged with making appointments to see high-end apartments .
arabs can be very discerning , he says .
" it 's very important that the environment is clean and that the apartment is representative of germany , " nefzi says .
" they want to have something to talk about back home . "
most health-related visitors from the middle east choose not to stay in hotels .
they consider the rooms impersonal and prefer to be able to prepare their own food .
once the stroll around town is done , the sheik returns to the clinic and waits for his wife to be released from the operating room .
the doctors report the procedure went well .
now it 's time to go shopping , but not in bad godesberg .
the family will have to head over to the bigger cities of cologne or dusseldorf , where they can visit shops with a selection of middle eastern foods wide enough to fit their discerning tastes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 12.08.2010 second-stringers give loew food for thought ahead of euro qualifiers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew saw some things he liked but others he clearly did n't with the qualifying stage for the 2012 european championships beginning in september , a number of second-string stars were looking to impress germany coach joachim loew during wednesday 's friendly draw in denmark . for 74 minutes in copenhagen , it looked as though joachim loew had become one of those blessed coaches whose talent pool is such that he can throw a second string of players onto a pitch and get the same type of performance and result as he would have expected his a-listers to produce .
this was a germany team shorn of almost all of its world cup stars and filled with debutants , cameo performers and bit-part players charged with taking on a denmark team smarting from a hugely forgettable summer in south africa .
the danes , while introducing a few unknowns in the hope of kick-starting a new era , still had a number of experienced players on show and with a home crowd behind them , they may have been expected to give germany 's reserves a torrid time .
but despite never playing together as a full team before and in a formation rarely used by loew , the german players slowly started to look comfortable in each other 's company and for the majority of the game , they appeared in little danger of leaving copenhagen without a victory .
while loew is unlikely to ever field this team again or play his regular starters in this tactical shape , a number of players will have improved their chances of joining the first team for the upcoming euro 2012 qualifiers and perhaps the european championships themselves in poland and ukraine in two years time .
der hammer returns to form with added nuances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal one performance that will have given the germany coach food for though was that of thomas hitzlsperger .
given the captain 's armband in the absence of warring skippers philipp lahm and michael ballack , hitzlsperger 's inclusion as germany 's leader in the centre of midfield was just reward for der hammer after fighting back from a severe loss of form .
after losing confidence and his touch at vfb stuttgart – and his place in the germany team – hitzlsperger 's transfer to lazio in january could have been the moment he dropped off germany 's radar .
but despite being overlooked for the world cup , hitzlsperger – now with west ham in the english premiership – has shown the hunger to come back and has recaptured his form .
there was plenty of the marauding midfield work of old but a season in serie a 's less frenetic atmosphere appears to have refined parts of hitzlsperger 's game which contributed to some considering him a blunt instrument .
it was a delicately feigned shot followed by a deft , penetrating pass into the penalty area on 19 minutes that set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal and until he was replaced in the second half , hitzlsperger was a worthy stand-in for bastian schweinsteiger in the conductor 's role .
gentner 's craft catches the eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former wolfsburg star gentner made a good impression playing off hitzlsperger was another player who should have done enough to convince jogi loew to continue his freshening-up of the germany team .
germany 's midfield showed no signs of suffering from the loss of ballack in south africa , and with toni kroos also showing in copenhagen why he could soon be a first team regular , one might think it overly optimistic to think that christian gentner may force his way into the national team 's starting line-up .
while hitzlsperger will certainly give loew a new option in defensive midfield , gentner put on a performance that could see him challenging for a role in the creative trio the germany coach normally deploys behind his lone striker .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder was a livewire throughout .
gentner was mobile , showed great vision and provided a number of killer passes .
drifting across the pitch behind mario gomez and patrick helmes , gentner was consistently probing the danish defensive line .
it was his perfectly timed pass which led to germany 's second goal .

only someone with some nefarious hold over the man who picks the team can continue to get a game when he plays so abjectly .
even in a second-string team , gomez rarely justified his inclusion as an international striker .
elsewhere , there were encouraging signs that christian traesch could make good on his potential and challenge for a consistent role in midfield while toni kroos and marko marin – building on their cameo performances at the world cup – will certainly feature in the euro qualifiers and would be good bets to see increased action at the 2012 tournament .

the makeshift german defence as a whole battled well until the 74th minute when rommedahl 's goal gave denmark belief and shattered that of germany 's back four .
wiese 's strong showing in goal tarnished by late blunder with their two-goal lead slashed in half , germany looked rattled in defence and nervous in attack with gomez and helmes blowing gilt-edged chances to make the score 3-1 in the final ten minutes .

the danish striker knocked the ball round the stranded wiese before slotting it into an empty net to complete denmark 's comeback and the german collapse .
it was wiese 's first real mistake of the game but it was glaring one .
with rene adler returning from the injury that kept him from being the number one in south africa , and germany 's world cup keeper manuel neuer enhancing his reputation this summer , even without his 87th minute howler wiese faced an uphill struggle to make ground on his rivals .
it 's likely he 'll remain the third choice throughout the euro qualifiers and beyond .

this was a germany team shorn of almost all of its world cup stars and filled with debutants , cameo performers and bit-part players charged with taking on a denmark team smarting from a hugely forgettable summer in south africa .
the danes , while introducing a few unknowns in the hope of kick-starting a new era , still had a number of experienced players on show and with a home crowd behind them , they may have been expected to give germany 's reserves a torrid time .
but despite never playing together as a full team before and in a formation rarely used by loew , the german players slowly started to look comfortable in each other 's company and for the majority of the game , they appeared in little danger of leaving copenhagen without a victory .
while loew is unlikely to ever field this team again or play his regular starters in this tactical shape , a number of players will have improved their chances of joining the first team for the upcoming euro 2012 qualifiers and perhaps the european championships themselves in poland and ukraine in two years time .
der hammer returns to form with added nuances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal one performance that will have given the germany coach food for though was that of thomas hitzlsperger .
given the captain 's armband in the absence of warring skippers philipp lahm and michael ballack , hitzlsperger 's inclusion as germany 's leader in the centre of midfield was just reward for der hammer after fighting back from a severe loss of form .
after losing confidence and his touch at vfb stuttgart – and his place in the germany team – hitzlsperger 's transfer to lazio in january could have been the moment he dropped off germany 's radar .
but despite being overlooked for the world cup , hitzlsperger – now with west ham in the english premiership – has shown the hunger to come back and has recaptured his form .
there was plenty of the marauding midfield work of old but a season in serie a 's less frenetic atmosphere appears to have refined parts of hitzlsperger 's game which contributed to some considering him a blunt instrument .
it was a delicately feigned shot followed by a deft , penetrating pass into the penalty area on 19 minutes that set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal and until he was replaced in the second half , hitzlsperger was a worthy stand-in for bastian schweinsteiger in the conductor 's role .
gentner 's craft catches the eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former wolfsburg star gentner made a good impression playing off hitzlsperger was another player who should have done enough to convince jogi loew to continue his freshening-up of the germany team .
germany 's midfield showed no signs of suffering from the loss of ballack in south africa , and with toni kroos also showing in copenhagen why he could soon be a first team regular , one might think it overly optimistic to think that christian gentner may force his way into the national team 's starting line-up .
while hitzlsperger will certainly give loew a new option in defensive midfield , gentner put on a performance that could see him challenging for a role in the creative trio the germany coach normally deploys behind his lone striker .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder was a livewire throughout .
gentner was mobile , showed great vision and provided a number of killer passes .
drifting across the pitch behind mario gomez and patrick helmes , gentner was consistently probing the danish defensive line .
it was his perfectly timed pass which led to germany 's second goal .
receiving a great pass from jerome boateng on the edge of the area , gentner held the ball up long enough for helmes to time his run before threading a pass between the center-backs and onto helmes ' boot .

this was a germany team shorn of almost all of its world cup stars and filled with debutants , cameo performers and bit-part players charged with taking on a denmark team smarting from a hugely forgettable summer in south africa .
the danes , while introducing a few unknowns in the hope of kick-starting a new era , still had a number of experienced players on show and with a home crowd behind them , they may have been expected to give germany 's reserves a torrid time .
but despite never playing together as a full team before and in a formation rarely used by loew , the german players slowly started to look comfortable in each other 's company and for the majority of the game , they appeared in little danger of leaving copenhagen without a victory .
while loew is unlikely to ever field this team again or play his regular starters in this tactical shape , a number of players will have improved their chances of joining the first team for the upcoming euro 2012 qualifiers and perhaps the european championships themselves in poland and ukraine in two years time .
der hammer returns to form with added nuances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal one performance that will have given the germany coach food for though was that of thomas hitzlsperger .
given the captain 's armband in the absence of warring skippers philipp lahm and michael ballack , hitzlsperger 's inclusion as germany 's leader in the centre of midfield was just reward for der hammer after fighting back from a severe loss of form .
after losing confidence and his touch at vfb stuttgart – and his place in the germany team – hitzlsperger 's transfer to lazio in january could have been the moment he dropped off germany 's radar .
but despite being overlooked for the world cup , hitzlsperger – now with west ham in the english premiership – has shown the hunger to come back and has recaptured his form .
there was plenty of the marauding midfield work of old but a season in serie a 's less frenetic atmosphere appears to have refined parts of hitzlsperger 's game which contributed to some considering him a blunt instrument .
it was a delicately feigned shot followed by a deft , penetrating pass into the penalty area on 19 minutes that set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal and until he was replaced in the second half , hitzlsperger was a worthy stand-in for bastian schweinsteiger in the conductor 's role .
gentner 's craft catches the eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former wolfsburg star gentner made a good impression playing off hitzlsperger was another player who should have done enough to convince jogi loew to continue his freshening-up of the germany team .
germany 's midfield showed no signs of suffering from the loss of ballack in south africa , and with toni kroos also showing in copenhagen why he could soon be a first team regular , one might think it overly optimistic to think that christian gentner may force his way into the national team 's starting line-up .
while hitzlsperger will certainly give loew a new option in defensive midfield , gentner put on a performance that could see him challenging for a role in the creative trio the germany coach normally deploys behind his lone striker .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder was a livewire throughout .
gentner was mobile , showed great vision and provided a number of killer passes .
drifting across the pitch behind mario gomez and patrick helmes , gentner was consistently probing the danish defensive line .
it was his perfectly timed pass which led to germany 's second goal .
receiving a great pass from jerome boateng on the edge of the area , gentner held the ball up long enough for helmes to time his run before threading a pass between the center-backs and onto helmes ' boot .
the bayer leverkusen striker did the rest .
stand-in strikers score but leave much to be desired bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmes needs the composure he shows with leverkusen helmes , who missed the world cup through injury after a good season with leverkusen , showed signs that he could be a worthy understudy to miroslav klose in the germany attack but the frequency and ease of the opportunities he wasted suggested that he needs more composure at this level and will certainly remain behind klose and thomas mueller in the attacking pecking order in the euro qualifiers .
but gomez , his well taken goal aside , played in a way that only reinforced the opinion that he must have some incriminating photos of his coach in a vault somewhere .
only someone with some nefarious hold over the man who picks the team can continue to get a game when he plays so abjectly .
even in a second-string team , gomez rarely justified his inclusion as an international striker .
elsewhere , there were encouraging signs that christian traesch could make good on his potential and challenge for a consistent role in midfield while toni kroos and marko marin – building on their cameo performances at the world cup – will certainly feature in the euro qualifiers and would be good bets to see increased action at the 2012 tournament .
despite his woeful pass which led to dennis rommedahl pulling a goal back just a minute after helmes put germany 2-0 up , defender serdar tasci had a competent game at left back until that mistake wrecked his confidence .
on the other side of defence , sascha reither was also solid until the final 15 minutes ; although it is unlikely he will ever unseat philipp lahm in the starting line-up .
the makeshift german defence as a whole battled well until the 74th minute when rommedahl 's goal gave denmark belief and shattered that of germany 's back four .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 12.08.2010 un labor report shows drastic increase in youth unemployment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more young people around the world are unemployed the international labor organization says global youth unemployment has reached record levels .
over 80 million 15 to 24-year-olds are without work , the report said , with increases in developed countries most extreme . according to a united nations report released on thursday , labor market trends for young people have taken a drastic turn for the worse since 2007 , when global youth unemployment remained fairly stagnant .
for the 10 years prior to the economic crisis , the report noted the number of unemployed youth around the world had increased by an average of 200,000 per year .
in 2009 , however , youth unemployment increased by a staggering 6.7 million .
sara elder , an economist with the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- and co-author of the report , says youth unemployment is most severe in the developed economies and non-eu , central and southeastern europe .
" in these two regions alone , we saw the highest annual increases that we have ever seen for any region since we began observing the trend in 1991 .
overall , the youth unemployment rate of 17.7 percent in developed economies also marks the highest we have ever seen , " elder told deutsche welle . eu governments looking to fend off hopelessness the report finds young women are hardest hit by unemployment in most regions .
the only exceptions are in the developed economies and the european union , where nearly twice as many males as females are unemployed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's apprentice system keeps most youths busy in the european union , germany displayed the lowest rate of youth unemployment .
around 8 percent of all germans between 16 and 24 looking for a job are out of work .
this is based most of all on the country 's apprentice system , in which companies offer three-year training positions to young germans regardless of education level .
this is a great contrast to the situation in other eu states such as estonia , latvia and lithuania , which according to the ilo report had the highest rates of youth unemployment in the 27-nation bloc .
in other developed eu countries , such as spain and the united kingdom , elder said many unemployed youth have become so discouraged that they are no longer even looking for work .
" governments everywhere are struggling to prevent a situation in which young people detach themselves completely from the labor market , having lost all hope of being able to provide themselves with a decent living .
unemployment is more a concern for developed economies than developing economies , " she said .
drastic unemployment in developing countries while only 10 percent of the global youth labor force lives in developed economies , youth unemployment there increased by 45 percent last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unofficial jobs are most common in developing nations the report added that roughly 90 percent of the world 's young people are living in developing countries - where under-employment and poverty are two of the most prevalent and serious problems .
steven kapsos , an ilo economist and also a co-author of the report , told deutsche welle that unemployed young people in developing countries do n't receive any benefits . thus , they are left with no choice : " they are forced by necessity to work in the informal economy , where they will most likely remain for the rest of their lives . "
" we estimate that 152 million youth were classified as working ' poor ' in 2008 and that is based on the standard international poverty line of $ 1.25 -lrb- 0.77 euro -rrb- per day .
this accounts for some 28 percent of all young workers around the world , " kapsos added .
the ilo , meanwhile , forecasts slight improvements in youth unemployment for almost all of the world 's regions next year .
the largest decrease in youth unemployment is expected in central and southeastern europe and the states formerly belonging to the soviet union .

the eu 's economic affairs commissioner hit out at bratislava for breaking a commitment . european union officials have accused the slovak government of breaching legal commitments , after it rejected participation in a bailout loan for greece .
the slovak parliament voted on wednesday to confirm the country 's refusal to participate in the lending package drawn up by the eu and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
slovakia was to commit 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1 million -rrb- to a 110-billion-euro fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn voiced concern that slovakia had gone back on its commitment eu economic affairs commissioner olli rehn described the decision as a " breach of the commitment undertaken by slovakia in the eurogroup , " and said that the finance ministers of all 27 eu members would " return to the matter in their next meeting " early in september .
the slovak parliament did , however , approve a potentially greater framework agreement on a 440-billion-euro loan mechanism aimed at stabilizing other member states that may need help in the future .
" it is somehow surprising because the underlying principle for both is exactly the same , " a spokesman for rehn 's office said .
rehn said that bratislava 's move would not prevent other countries from bailing out greece , as the loan has already been put in place alongside stiff austerity measures .
only two votes in favor the bill on bratislava 's participation in the eu rescue package gained only two approving votes amongst the parliamentarians present at wednesday 's session ; 69 deputies voted against participation , with 13 abstaining .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister radicova criticized greek policies the german government said it regretted the outcome of the slovak vote .
government spokesman steffen seibert told the german edition of the financial times ' chancellor angela merkel would address the issue in talks with the slovakian government on a visit to bratislava later in the month . slovakia 's previous government , under social democratic prime minister robert fico , pledged in may that bratislava would fulfill its share of the greek loans but delayed a final decision until after parliamentary elections in june .
the center-right government under prime minister iveta radicova then took power .
radicova had criticized greece 's " undisciplined budget policy " and sought to overturn the previous government 's decision .
slovakia is the newest member of the eurozone , having adopted the currency in 2009 .
the country joined the eu in 2004 .

plans for a military attack existed right up to the end of the regime . through the decades of berlin 's division , many west berliners had an inkling that east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- that surrounded their part of the city would at some stage be seeking to conquer it .
a tv documentary , " der fall x " -lrb- the case of x -rrb- , shown by germany 's public broadcaster rbb finally proved them right .
in the most comprehensive footage on east germany 's conquest plans so far , two filmmakers , supported by military experts , tell a fascinating story about how the defunct state planned to overrun west berlin in only three days .
" as far as we can tell , the planning was quite serious , " german military historian winfried heinemann told deutsche welle .
" but whether they would have managed to take the city within three days is another question . "
superior numbers heinemann pointed out that the western allies were quite serious about defending west berlin from a ground attack .
but he acknowledged that next to nothing was known about any defense strategies as the relevant documents are still classified .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahr knew that west berlin was never really a safe place egon bahr , a former west berlin radio commentator and later adviser to west german chancellor willy brandt , argued that the gdr 's national people 's army troops , and those of the soviet union deployed in the region , would have outnumbered the soldiers from the western allies by far .
" in the event of an attack , our defenses could have been maintained for no more than five to seven hours , " bahr concluded .
the plans found in the files of the east german secret police , the gdr army and the soviet military command reveal some details as to how the attackers would have gone about their job .
a detailed map available to the filmmakers showed the most important installations and infrastructure compounds in west berlin , which would have been targeted first .
among them were strategically important bridges that the french , british and us allies used to move around as well as airports and train stations .
a second phase of the operation would have included the imprisonment of leading west berlin politicians , policemen , public servants and journalists .
a corresponding list of names was updated by the gdr leadership several times until the collapse of the regime in 1989 .
a diehard obsession the research done by military historian winfried heinemann also revealed that plans to attack west berlin were , surprisingly , only developed fully in the early 1970s - a time when political relations between the two german states were in the process of improving considerably .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr soldiers trained for an attack as late as 1988 " whether it was just a question of the gdr military having grown up enough to feel fit for the job - we do n't really know , " said heinemann .
" but considering that the whole military posture of the gdr was kept up right until 1989 , it 's at least no surprise that the planning for an attack went on until the very end . "
in fact , east germany 's national people 's army -lrb- nva -rrb- carried out military maneuvers as late as 1988 to train for the takeover of west berlin .
exercises took place in the east german town of magdeburg some 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- west of berlin .
the training ground was designed to look as if the target territory were divided up between a french , british and us brigade , which reflected the fact the west berlin was seperated into sectors occupied by those three countries .
one year later , the berlin wall fell , and east german intelligence managed to destroy most of the documents regarding the gdr 's hostile intentions toward west berlin .

a tv documentary , " der fall x " -lrb- the case of x -rrb- , shown by germany 's public broadcaster rbb finally proved them right .

but experts say there is no significant nuclear health danger . revelations that wildfires have hit hundreds of hectares of land in russia 's western bryansk region contaminated in the chernobyl nuclear disaster have raised fears that radioactive material could be released and reach moscow or even europe .
but radiation experts have said while concern is warranted , any re-release of nuclear contamination would likely pose little risk to human health .
" every instance of increased radioactivity is a cause for concern , but even for the local population , the levels are going to be relatively low , " said ulrich abram , a professor in the chemistry department and radiation expert at the free university of berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" there wo n't be a resulting cloud of radioactive material that could pose a danger to europe , " he said .
fears about russia possibly covering up a new radiation threat were raised when the environmental organization greenpeace warned that fires in forests contaminated in the 1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster could trigger radiation pollution .
the group accused the russian government of playing down the threat .
" fires on these territories will without a doubt lead to an increase in radiation , " said vladimir chuprov , head of the energy program at greenpeace russia , in an interview with the new york times .
" the smoke will spread , and the radioactive traces will spread . "
but radiation experts from russia and other european countries have sought to calm fears , saying that while radioactive isotopes could indeed be released into the air as contaminated material burns , there is no chance that radioactive fallout from the fires could reach anywhere near the magnitude of the chernobyl disaster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radioactive isotopes from the chernobyl disaster are still present in the soil and vegetation fo the area the concerns come from the fact that large areas of ukraine , belarus and russia are still coated with radioactive residue released when reactor no. 4 at the chernobyl nuclear power plan exploded on april 26 , 1986 .
two isotopes are of concern most of the radioactive isotopes released by the chernobyl meltdown were caesium-137 and strontium-90 , both produced by nuclear fission .
because both are isotopes of metallic elements , they fell to the ground rather quickly , according to abram , working their way into the soil over the decades since their release and being taken up by plants and trees .
when the vegetation burns , the atoms are released .
" then people could breathe them in , of course , " said abram .
" they could be exposed to a higher radiation intensity , which can lead to illness . "
abram remarks that people in the affected areas have been living with chernobyl 's aftermath for decades , although ingesting atoms released by the current fires would expose them at higher levels , and more direct contact .
internal exposure to caesium-137 and strontium-90 , through ingestion or inhalation , allows for the radioactive material to be distributed in the body 's soft tissues , especially muscle tissue and bone matter .
these tissues are then exposed to the beta particles and gamma radiation of the isotopes , increasing the risk of developing cancer .
low risk of inhaling nuclear material still , abram says the risk of inhalation is low , because the relative weights of both strontium and caesium send them falling to the ground quickly .
therefore , the risk of breathing the isotopes is low , unless residents are in the immediate vicinity of burning material .
" i do n't want to play down the issue , but the overall radiation dosage will not increase significantly for the people who live there , " he said .
what he does think a likely outcome will be is that as these isotopes are released , they could travel before falling to the ground again in the presence of high winds .
the result would be a larger area of land with low levels of radiation contamination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fires will likely spread contaminants over a larger area other experts agree with his risk assessment , including philipp renaud , head of the environmental radiation laboratory at france 's irsn nuclear safety institute .
he said the previous major forest fires in russia , in 2002 , showed that the risk of exposure was minor .
radioactivity in neighboring countries jumped by a thousandth of a becquerel unit and in france , a millionth .
" this is n't dangerous at all , " he told the agence france presse .
irsn said that if the contaminated forests burn , local residents would be exposed to about two times the normal radiation levels , which while not ideal , is not a cause for panic .
more dangerous for local residents ' health are the non-radioactive toxic fumes caused by the fire , the organization said .
other nuclear dangers ?
some have been concerned that the fires could reach other nuclear sites in russia , such as power plants or atomic weapon depots .
but according to edmund lengfelder , a director at the german society for radiation protection , the danger of flames engulfing a nuclear reactor and leading to disaster is small .
his group has been active in the chernobyl region for 20 years and has observed that these days , the russians are relatively well prepared when it comes to keeping their nuclear facilities out of harm 's way .
" russia is pretty competent when it comes to disaster response and we do n't see a particular threat to its nuclear facilities , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but regarding the material already deposited from chernobyl , we need to keep an eye on that . "

but experts say there is no significant nuclear health danger . revelations that wildfires have hit hundreds of hectares of land in russia 's western bryansk region contaminated in the chernobyl nuclear disaster have raised fears that radioactive material could be released and reach moscow or even europe .
but radiation experts have said while concern is warranted , any re-release of nuclear contamination would likely pose little risk to human health .
" every instance of increased radioactivity is a cause for concern , but even for the local population , the levels are going to be relatively low , " said ulrich abram , a professor in the chemistry department and radiation expert at the free university of berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" there wo n't be a resulting cloud of radioactive material that could pose a danger to europe , " he said .
fears about russia possibly covering up a new radiation threat were raised when the environmental organization greenpeace warned that fires in forests contaminated in the 1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster could trigger radiation pollution .
the group accused the russian government of playing down the threat .
" fires on these territories will without a doubt lead to an increase in radiation , " said vladimir chuprov , head of the energy program at greenpeace russia , in an interview with the new york times .
" the smoke will spread , and the radioactive traces will spread . "
but radiation experts from russia and other european countries have sought to calm fears , saying that while radioactive isotopes could indeed be released into the air as contaminated material burns , there is no chance that radioactive fallout from the fires could reach anywhere near the magnitude of the chernobyl disaster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radioactive isotopes from the chernobyl disaster are still present in the soil and vegetation fo the area the concerns come from the fact that large areas of ukraine , belarus and russia are still coated with radioactive residue released when reactor no. 4 at the chernobyl nuclear power plan exploded on april 26 , 1986 .
two isotopes are of concern most of the radioactive isotopes released by the chernobyl meltdown were caesium-137 and strontium-90 , both produced by nuclear fission .
because both are isotopes of metallic elements , they fell to the ground rather quickly , according to abram , working their way into the soil over the decades since their release and being taken up by plants and trees .
when the vegetation burns , the atoms are released .
" then people could breathe them in , of course , " said abram .
" they could be exposed to a higher radiation intensity , which can lead to illness . "
abram remarks that people in the affected areas have been living with chernobyl 's aftermath for decades , although ingesting atoms released by the current fires would expose them at higher levels , and more direct contact .
internal exposure to caesium-137 and strontium-90 , through ingestion or inhalation , allows for the radioactive material to be distributed in the body 's soft tissues , especially muscle tissue and bone matter .
these tissues are then exposed to the beta particles and gamma radiation of the isotopes , increasing the risk of developing cancer .
low risk of inhaling nuclear material still , abram says the risk of inhalation is low , because the relative weights of both strontium and caesium send them falling to the ground quickly .
therefore , the risk of breathing the isotopes is low , unless residents are in the immediate vicinity of burning material .
" i do n't want to play down the issue , but the overall radiation dosage will not increase significantly for the people who live there , " he said .
what he does think a likely outcome will be is that as these isotopes are released , they could travel before falling to the ground again in the presence of high winds .
the result would be a larger area of land with low levels of radiation contamination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fires will likely spread contaminants over a larger area other experts agree with his risk assessment , including philipp renaud , head of the environmental radiation laboratory at france 's irsn nuclear safety institute .
he said the previous major forest fires in russia , in 2002 , showed that the risk of exposure was minor .
radioactivity in neighboring countries jumped by a thousandth of a becquerel unit and in france , a millionth .
" this is n't dangerous at all , " he told the agence france presse .
irsn said that if the contaminated forests burn , local residents would be exposed to about two times the normal radiation levels , which while not ideal , is not a cause for panic .
more dangerous for local residents ' health are the non-radioactive toxic fumes caused by the fire , the organization said .
other nuclear dangers ?
some have been concerned that the fires could reach other nuclear sites in russia , such as power plants or atomic weapon depots .
but according to edmund lengfelder , a director at the german society for radiation protection , the danger of flames engulfing a nuclear reactor and leading to disaster is small .
his group has been active in the chernobyl region for 20 years and has observed that these days , the russians are relatively well prepared when it comes to keeping their nuclear facilities out of harm 's way .
" russia is pretty competent when it comes to disaster response and we do n't see a particular threat to its nuclear facilities , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but regarding the material already deposited from chernobyl , we need to keep an eye on that . "

but according to edmund lengfelder , a director at the german society for radiation protection , the danger of flames engulfing a nuclear reactor and leading to disaster is small .
his group has been active in the chernobyl region for 20 years and has observed that these days , the russians are relatively well prepared when it comes to keeping their nuclear facilities out of harm 's way .
" russia is pretty competent when it comes to disaster response and we do n't see a particular threat to its nuclear facilities , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but regarding the material already deposited from chernobyl , we need to keep an eye on that . "

" after the conflict and the state of emergency , censorship has been extended to politics as well .
this means general opposition websites related to the red shirt movement or critics of the government are also being blocked . " pro-red shirt website blocked one news website that has been blocked several times this year is prachatai.com.
red shirt supporters had discussed the protests openly on its discussion board .
however , the government only succeeded in shutting the site down temporarily , with the website circumventing the government controls by changing its server and by using another url .
prachatai.com 's director , chiranuch premchaporn , who has been charged under the computer crimes act , says the discussion board was shut down in july .
she says there is a need to balance the interests of writers and the government . " even if i believe in freedom of expression , i understand there should be some limitations .
we should set up a system to moderate content that can be considered to violate the rights of the people or the law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 100 people were killed in political violence in may legal reform needed chris baker , an author and commentator on thai politics and business calls for " a cooperative framework in which all the parties are involved .
instead the government is using various forms of rather draconian legislation – the computer crimes act , the emergency decree .
at present , this is being rather inflammatory because people do n't like being closed down in this way .
and it 's also relatively ineffective . "
media groups are warning that intimidating web users and closing down sites may backfire against the government and lead to a radicalization of those who post comments online . chris baker says legal reform is needed to overcome the problem and to " control things in a permanent way as it 's very unsatisfactory for all sides at the moment .

secularists demand it be taken away from the presidential palace . supporters of late polish president lech kaczynski 's law and justice party have remained defiant in their vigil at the site of a cross erected in memory of their late hero - despite calls from church leaders to allow its removal .
those loyal to the former president see him as defender of polish roman catholic values and say that the cross should remain outside the presidential palace in a warsaw square until a more permanent structure is found for the site .
church officials have said that it is time for supporters to give up the fight - warning that they are being manipulated for political , not religious , reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secularists say the palace is not the place for a cross " to all those who pray at the cross we must say that - despite their good intentions - they are being exploited for political purposes .
we urge everyone to make the transfer of the cross possible , " press secretary for the polish episcopate , bishop stanislaw budzik , told reporters in warsaw on thursday .
the palace , now occupied by president bronislaw komorowski , unveiled a plaque on thursday commemorating the tragedy on the facade of a side-wing to the building .
a first attempt to move the cross - initially to a church in the old part of the city and later to a shrine in the south of the country - met with fierce opposition on august 3 .
both the church and the scout group that first erected the four-meter -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- wooden cross had agreed to the plan .
facebook campaign and rally but opposition is mounting to the cross staying in place .
secularists - many of them younger , and opposed to the policies of the former president - rallied on monday in response to a facebook campaign to have the cross removed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some think jaroslaw kaczynski is using the dispute for political capital by midnight , several thousand had gathered in front of the presidential palace chanting the slogan , " to a church ! "
the cross was spontaneously erected after the april 10 crash of the presidential plane in western russia , killing the president , his wife and 94 others .
as well as highlighting religious divisions , the row is indicative of the political tensions currently simmering in the country .
some critics of former president kaczynski were unhappy with his right-wing politics and traditional approach to family values .
opponents also say his nationalist and euroskeptic policies placed poland on an isolationist course within the european union .
current president komorowski is expected to take the country in a more pro-european direction .
commentators say kaczynski 's twin brother jaroslaw , who has called for the cross to stay in place , is possibly using the issue as a political weapon to gain support before the country 's parliamentary elections in 2011 .

as berlin remembers the event , new figures suggest more people than previously thought were killed on the inner german border from 1961-1989 . berlin commemorated on friday the 49th anniversary of the day the east german government began building the berlin wall . a memorial service was held at the chapel of reconciliation in the former death strip .
mayor klaus wowereit laid a wreath at the bernauer strasse memorial , in remembrance of those who were killed by gdr border guards . " it teaches us a lesson , " wowereit said .
" time and again , it is important to stand decisively against authoritarian regimes and dictatorships . " he urged that the memory of the berlin wall must sharpen appreciation of contemporary freedom and democracy . among a number of services held in berlin on friday , a street is to be renamed in memory of chris gueffroy , recognized as the last person killed trying to cross the border . greater number killed according to the official site that commemorates the berlin wall in the district of mitte , at least 136 people were killed by the east german border patrol while trying to escape from east to west berlin between 1961 and 1989 . but that 's not the whole story .
new figures from the privately-run wall museum , located at the former checkpoint charlie border crossing in berlin , say the total number of people who died trying to escape from east to west germany during those 28 years is 1,393 . " the number has risen by 46 compared with our research last year , " alexandra hildebrandt , chairwoman of the wall museum told deutsche welle .

it also includes east german soldiers , for example those who committed suicide because they could n't deal with the regime , " she said . bildunterschrift : the wall became the symbol of the cold war tragic deaths one of those soldiers , whose suicide has only just come to light , took his own life just hours after construction on the wall had started .
" i cried all night when i read this , " hildebrandt said .
" he shot himself and left his wife a note saying : ' i ca n't do this anymore , i 'm too weak , forgive me , it 's better that way ' . "
in the early hours of august 13 , 1961 , the east german government took the west by surprise and ordered its army and police to stop all travel between east and west berlin and start work on the wall that would divide berlin until 1989 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 12.08.2010 second-stringers give loew food for thought ahead of euro qualifiers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew saw some things he liked but others he clearly did n't with the qualifying stage for the 2012 european championships beginning in september , a number of second-string stars were looking to impress germany coach joachim loew during wednesday 's friendly draw in denmark . for 74 minutes in copenhagen , it looked as though joachim loew had become one of those blessed coaches whose talent pool is such that he can throw a second string of players onto a pitch and get the same type of performance and result as he would have expected his a-listers to produce .
this was a germany team shorn of almost all of its world cup stars and filled with debutants , cameo performers and bit-part players charged with taking on a denmark team smarting from a hugely forgettable summer in south africa .
the danes , while introducing a few unknowns in the hope of kick-starting a new era , still had a number of experienced players on show and with a home crowd behind them , they may have been expected to give germany 's reserves a torrid time .
but despite never playing together as a full team before and in a formation rarely used by loew , the german players slowly started to look comfortable in each other 's company and for the majority of the game , they appeared in little danger of leaving copenhagen without a victory .
while loew is unlikely to ever field this team again or play his regular starters in this tactical shape , a number of players will have improved their chances of joining the first team for the upcoming euro 2012 qualifiers and perhaps the european championships themselves in poland and ukraine in two years time .
der hammer returns to form with added nuances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal one performance that will have given the germany coach food for though was that of thomas hitzlsperger .
given the captain 's armband in the absence of warring skippers philipp lahm and michael ballack , hitzlsperger 's inclusion as germany 's leader in the centre of midfield was just reward for der hammer after fighting back from a severe loss of form .
after losing confidence and his touch at vfb stuttgart – and his place in the germany team – hitzlsperger 's transfer to lazio in january could have been the moment he dropped off germany 's radar .
but despite being overlooked for the world cup , hitzlsperger – now with west ham in the english premiership – has shown the hunger to come back and has recaptured his form .
there was plenty of the marauding midfield work of old but a season in serie a 's less frenetic atmosphere appears to have refined parts of hitzlsperger 's game which contributed to some considering him a blunt instrument .
it was a delicately feigned shot followed by a deft , penetrating pass into the penalty area on 19 minutes that set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal and until he was replaced in the second half , hitzlsperger was a worthy stand-in for bastian schweinsteiger in the conductor 's role .
gentner 's craft catches the eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former wolfsburg star gentner made a good impression playing off hitzlsperger was another player who should have done enough to convince jogi loew to continue his freshening-up of the germany team .
germany 's midfield showed no signs of suffering from the loss of ballack in south africa , and with toni kroos also showing in copenhagen why he could soon be a first team regular , one might think it overly optimistic to think that christian gentner may force his way into the national team 's starting line-up .
while hitzlsperger will certainly give loew a new option in defensive midfield , gentner put on a performance that could see him challenging for a role in the creative trio the germany coach normally deploys behind his lone striker .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder was a livewire throughout .
gentner was mobile , showed great vision and provided a number of killer passes .
drifting across the pitch behind mario gomez and patrick helmes , gentner was consistently probing the danish defensive line .
it was his perfectly timed pass which led to germany 's second goal .
receiving a great pass from jerome boateng on the edge of the area , gentner held the ball up long enough for helmes to time his run before threading a pass between the center-backs and onto helmes ' boot .
the bayer leverkusen striker did the rest .
stand-in strikers score but leave much to be desired bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmes needs the composure he shows with leverkusen helmes , who missed the world cup through injury after a good season with leverkusen , showed signs that he could be a worthy understudy to miroslav klose in the germany attack but the frequency and ease of the opportunities he wasted suggested that he needs more composure at this level and will certainly remain behind klose and thomas mueller in the attacking pecking order in the euro qualifiers .
but gomez , his well taken goal aside , played in a way that only reinforced the opinion that he must have some incriminating photos of his coach in a vault somewhere .
only someone with some nefarious hold over the man who picks the team can continue to get a game when he plays so abjectly .
even in a second-string team , gomez rarely justified his inclusion as an international striker .
elsewhere , there were encouraging signs that christian traesch could make good on his potential and challenge for a consistent role in midfield while toni kroos and marko marin – building on their cameo performances at the world cup – will certainly feature in the euro qualifiers and would be good bets to see increased action at the 2012 tournament .
despite his woeful pass which led to dennis rommedahl pulling a goal back just a minute after helmes put germany 2-0 up , defender serdar tasci had a competent game at left back until that mistake wrecked his confidence .
on the other side of defence , sascha reither was also solid until the final 15 minutes ; although it is unlikely he will ever unseat philipp lahm in the starting line-up .
the makeshift german defence as a whole battled well until the 74th minute when rommedahl 's goal gave denmark belief and shattered that of germany 's back four .
wiese 's strong showing in goal tarnished by late blunder with their two-goal lead slashed in half , germany looked rattled in defence and nervous in attack with gomez and helmes blowing gilt-edged chances to make the score 3-1 in the final ten minutes .
instead , denmark seized their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese kept denmark at bay until the final 15 minutes stand-in keeper tim wiese – who had an excellent game until his defense imploded in front of him – chose to rush out to deal with a dangerous through ball .
finding himself on the edge of his area , the werder bremen stopper was caught in two minds whether to use his hands , choosing instead to chest the ball to mads junker .
the danish striker knocked the ball round the stranded wiese before slotting it into an empty net to complete denmark 's comeback and the german collapse .
it was wiese 's first real mistake of the game but it was glaring one .
with rene adler returning from the injury that kept him from being the number one in south africa , and germany 's world cup keeper manuel neuer enhancing his reputation this summer , even without his 87th minute howler wiese faced an uphill struggle to make ground on his rivals .
it 's likely he 'll remain the third choice throughout the euro qualifiers and beyond .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 12.08.2010 second-stringers give loew food for thought ahead of euro qualifiers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew saw some things he liked but others he clearly did n't with the qualifying stage for the 2012 european championships beginning in september , a number of second-string stars were looking to impress germany coach joachim loew during wednesday 's friendly draw in denmark . for 74 minutes in copenhagen , it looked as though joachim loew had become one of those blessed coaches whose talent pool is such that he can throw a second string of players onto a pitch and get the same type of performance and result as he would have expected his a-listers to produce .
this was a germany team shorn of almost all of its world cup stars and filled with debutants , cameo performers and bit-part players charged with taking on a denmark team smarting from a hugely forgettable summer in south africa .
the danes , while introducing a few unknowns in the hope of kick-starting a new era , still had a number of experienced players on show and with a home crowd behind them , they may have been expected to give germany 's reserves a torrid time .
but despite never playing together as a full team before and in a formation rarely used by loew , the german players slowly started to look comfortable in each other 's company and for the majority of the game , they appeared in little danger of leaving copenhagen without a victory .
while loew is unlikely to ever field this team again or play his regular starters in this tactical shape , a number of players will have improved their chances of joining the first team for the upcoming euro 2012 qualifiers and perhaps the european championships themselves in poland and ukraine in two years time .
der hammer returns to form with added nuances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal one performance that will have given the germany coach food for though was that of thomas hitzlsperger .
given the captain 's armband in the absence of warring skippers philipp lahm and michael ballack , hitzlsperger 's inclusion as germany 's leader in the centre of midfield was just reward for der hammer after fighting back from a severe loss of form .
after losing confidence and his touch at vfb stuttgart – and his place in the germany team – hitzlsperger 's transfer to lazio in january could have been the moment he dropped off germany 's radar .
but despite being overlooked for the world cup , hitzlsperger – now with west ham in the english premiership – has shown the hunger to come back and has recaptured his form .
there was plenty of the marauding midfield work of old but a season in serie a 's less frenetic atmosphere appears to have refined parts of hitzlsperger 's game which contributed to some considering him a blunt instrument .
it was a delicately feigned shot followed by a deft , penetrating pass into the penalty area on 19 minutes that set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal and until he was replaced in the second half , hitzlsperger was a worthy stand-in for bastian schweinsteiger in the conductor 's role .
gentner 's craft catches the eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former wolfsburg star gentner made a good impression playing off hitzlsperger was another player who should have done enough to convince jogi loew to continue his freshening-up of the germany team .
germany 's midfield showed no signs of suffering from the loss of ballack in south africa , and with toni kroos also showing in copenhagen why he could soon be a first team regular , one might think it overly optimistic to think that christian gentner may force his way into the national team 's starting line-up .
while hitzlsperger will certainly give loew a new option in defensive midfield , gentner put on a performance that could see him challenging for a role in the creative trio the germany coach normally deploys behind his lone striker .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder was a livewire throughout .
gentner was mobile , showed great vision and provided a number of killer passes .
drifting across the pitch behind mario gomez and patrick helmes , gentner was consistently probing the danish defensive line .
it was his perfectly timed pass which led to germany 's second goal .
receiving a great pass from jerome boateng on the edge of the area , gentner held the ball up long enough for helmes to time his run before threading a pass between the center-backs and onto helmes ' boot .
the bayer leverkusen striker did the rest .
stand-in strikers score but leave much to be desired bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmes needs the composure he shows with leverkusen helmes , who missed the world cup through injury after a good season with leverkusen , showed signs that he could be a worthy understudy to miroslav klose in the germany attack but the frequency and ease of the opportunities he wasted suggested that he needs more composure at this level and will certainly remain behind klose and thomas mueller in the attacking pecking order in the euro qualifiers .
but gomez , his well taken goal aside , played in a way that only reinforced the opinion that he must have some incriminating photos of his coach in a vault somewhere .
only someone with some nefarious hold over the man who picks the team can continue to get a game when he plays so abjectly .
even in a second-string team , gomez rarely justified his inclusion as an international striker .
elsewhere , there were encouraging signs that christian traesch could make good on his potential and challenge for a consistent role in midfield while toni kroos and marko marin – building on their cameo performances at the world cup – will certainly feature in the euro qualifiers and would be good bets to see increased action at the 2012 tournament .
despite his woeful pass which led to dennis rommedahl pulling a goal back just a minute after helmes put germany 2-0 up , defender serdar tasci had a competent game at left back until that mistake wrecked his confidence .
on the other side of defence , sascha reither was also solid until the final 15 minutes ; although it is unlikely he will ever unseat philipp lahm in the starting line-up .
the makeshift german defence as a whole battled well until the 74th minute when rommedahl 's goal gave denmark belief and shattered that of germany 's back four .
wiese 's strong showing in goal tarnished by late blunder with their two-goal lead slashed in half , germany looked rattled in defence and nervous in attack with gomez and helmes blowing gilt-edged chances to make the score 3-1 in the final ten minutes .
instead , denmark seized their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese kept denmark at bay until the final 15 minutes stand-in keeper tim wiese – who had an excellent game until his defense imploded in front of him – chose to rush out to deal with a dangerous through ball .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de natural disasters -pipe- 12.08.2010 russia beginning to win battle against wildfires großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the firefighting effort seems to be helping strong firefighting efforts have caused a drop in the number of fires threatening western russia .
meanwhile , authorities have said radiation levels have not increased despite wildfires reaching chernobyl-affected areas . russia is starting to deal more effectively with the wildfires which have been ravishing its western regions , senior government officials said on thursday . vladimir stepanov , head of the national crisis center , told russia 's interfax news agency that the area of burning land had gotten smaller in the last 24 hours , and there had been less fires with 562 fires covering around 80,000 hectares -lrb- 197,684 acres -rrb- of forest and peat land , the number of fires was down more than 10 percent from wednesday . officials also said environmental radiation levels had not shown any increase despite fires hitting areas contaminated by the 1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster . " a worsening of the radiation situation and a growth in the background radiation as a result of a transfer of materials from the fires have not been recorded anywhere in russia , " valery dyadyuchenko , the deputy head of russian state weather forecaster rosgidromet , told interfax . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fires are perilously close to the outer fence of the sarov nuclear facility russia ’ s state forest watchdog admitted on wednesday that fires had reached contaminated parts of the western bryansk region , sparking fears that radioactive particles would be released into the air . strong winds on thursday released moscow from the thick smog which has clouded its skies for much of the last week .
the number of fires close to the capital fell by more than a quarter in one day , as emergency services stepped up their firefighting efforts , flooding peat bogs around the city . nuclear sites still in danger more than 3,400 firefighters are battling to douse wildfires close to russia 's leading nuclear research facility in sarov , a town in the nizhny novgorod province . a spokesman for the emergencies ministry confirmed that two special firefighting trains , with large amounts of water and high-pressure hoses , had been sent to aid efforts at the site . no blazes had been recorded at the research center itself , but a nearby nature reserve has been on fire for the last week .
two soldiers were killed while trying to put out a nearby fire on monday . ukrainian authorities have played down fears over a two-hectare peat bog fire burning just 60 kilometers -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- south of the chernobyl site . " the fire presents no danger , " said viktoria ruban , spokeswoman for the ukrainian emergency situations ministry .
" there is no threat . " the fire started on august 9 , and is expected to be extinguished on thursday or friday , ruban added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : record temperatures and minimal rainfall have left parched fields prone to fires end not yet in sight environmentalists and nuclear experts have suggested that forest fires on contaminated land could result in radioactive particles blowing across central europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 12.08.2010 second-stringers give loew food for thought ahead of euro qualifiers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew saw some things he liked but others he clearly did n't with the qualifying stage for the 2012 european championships beginning in september , a number of second-string stars were looking to impress germany coach joachim loew during wednesday 's friendly draw in denmark . for 74 minutes in copenhagen , it looked as though joachim loew had become one of those blessed coaches whose talent pool is such that he can throw a second string of players onto a pitch and get the same type of performance and result as he would have expected his a-listers to produce .
this was a germany team shorn of almost all of its world cup stars and filled with debutants , cameo performers and bit-part players charged with taking on a denmark team smarting from a hugely forgettable summer in south africa .
the danes , while introducing a few unknowns in the hope of kick-starting a new era , still had a number of experienced players on show and with a home crowd behind them , they may have been expected to give germany 's reserves a torrid time .
but despite never playing together as a full team before and in a formation rarely used by loew , the german players slowly started to look comfortable in each other 's company and for the majority of the game , they appeared in little danger of leaving copenhagen without a victory .
while loew is unlikely to ever field this team again or play his regular starters in this tactical shape , a number of players will have improved their chances of joining the first team for the upcoming euro 2012 qualifiers and perhaps the european championships themselves in poland and ukraine in two years time .
der hammer returns to form with added nuances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal one performance that will have given the germany coach food for though was that of thomas hitzlsperger .
given the captain 's armband in the absence of warring skippers philipp lahm and michael ballack , hitzlsperger 's inclusion as germany 's leader in the centre of midfield was just reward for der hammer after fighting back from a severe loss of form .
after losing confidence and his touch at vfb stuttgart – and his place in the germany team – hitzlsperger 's transfer to lazio in january could have been the moment he dropped off germany 's radar .
but despite being overlooked for the world cup , hitzlsperger – now with west ham in the english premiership – has shown the hunger to come back and has recaptured his form .
there was plenty of the marauding midfield work of old but a season in serie a 's less frenetic atmosphere appears to have refined parts of hitzlsperger 's game which contributed to some considering him a blunt instrument .
it was a delicately feigned shot followed by a deft , penetrating pass into the penalty area on 19 minutes that set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal and until he was replaced in the second half , hitzlsperger was a worthy stand-in for bastian schweinsteiger in the conductor 's role .
gentner 's craft catches the eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former wolfsburg star gentner made a good impression playing off hitzlsperger was another player who should have done enough to convince jogi loew to continue his freshening-up of the germany team .
germany 's midfield showed no signs of suffering from the loss of ballack in south africa , and with toni kroos also showing in copenhagen why he could soon be a first team regular , one might think it overly optimistic to think that christian gentner may force his way into the national team 's starting line-up .
while hitzlsperger will certainly give loew a new option in defensive midfield , gentner put on a performance that could see him challenging for a role in the creative trio the germany coach normally deploys behind his lone striker .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder was a livewire throughout .
gentner was mobile , showed great vision and provided a number of killer passes .
drifting across the pitch behind mario gomez and patrick helmes , gentner was consistently probing the danish defensive line .
it was his perfectly timed pass which led to germany 's second goal .
receiving a great pass from jerome boateng on the edge of the area , gentner held the ball up long enough for helmes to time his run before threading a pass between the center-backs and onto helmes ' boot .
the bayer leverkusen striker did the rest .
stand-in strikers score but leave much to be desired bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmes needs the composure he shows with leverkusen helmes , who missed the world cup through injury after a good season with leverkusen , showed signs that he could be a worthy understudy to miroslav klose in the germany attack but the frequency and ease of the opportunities he wasted suggested that he needs more composure at this level and will certainly remain behind klose and thomas mueller in the attacking pecking order in the euro qualifiers .
but gomez , his well taken goal aside , played in a way that only reinforced the opinion that he must have some incriminating photos of his coach in a vault somewhere .
only someone with some nefarious hold over the man who picks the team can continue to get a game when he plays so abjectly .
even in a second-string team , gomez rarely justified his inclusion as an international striker .
elsewhere , there were encouraging signs that christian traesch could make good on his potential and challenge for a consistent role in midfield while toni kroos and marko marin – building on their cameo performances at the world cup – will certainly feature in the euro qualifiers and would be good bets to see increased action at the 2012 tournament .
despite his woeful pass which led to dennis rommedahl pulling a goal back just a minute after helmes put germany 2-0 up , defender serdar tasci had a competent game at left back until that mistake wrecked his confidence .
on the other side of defence , sascha reither was also solid until the final 15 minutes ; although it is unlikely he will ever unseat philipp lahm in the starting line-up .
the makeshift german defence as a whole battled well until the 74th minute when rommedahl 's goal gave denmark belief and shattered that of germany 's back four .
wiese 's strong showing in goal tarnished by late blunder with their two-goal lead slashed in half , germany looked rattled in defence and nervous in attack with gomez and helmes blowing gilt-edged chances to make the score 3-1 in the final ten minutes .
instead , denmark seized their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese kept denmark at bay until the final 15 minutes stand-in keeper tim wiese – who had an excellent game until his defense imploded in front of him – chose to rush out to deal with a dangerous through ball .
finding himself on the edge of his area , the werder bremen stopper was caught in two minds whether to use his hands , choosing instead to chest the ball to mads junker .
the danish striker knocked the ball round the stranded wiese before slotting it into an empty net to complete denmark 's comeback and the german collapse .
it was wiese 's first real mistake of the game but it was glaring one .
with rene adler returning from the injury that kept him from being the number one in south africa , and germany 's world cup keeper manuel neuer enhancing his reputation this summer , even without his 87th minute howler wiese faced an uphill struggle to make ground on his rivals .
it 's likely he 'll remain the third choice throughout the euro qualifiers and beyond .

this was a germany team shorn of almost all of its world cup stars and filled with debutants , cameo performers and bit-part players charged with taking on a denmark team smarting from a hugely forgettable summer in south africa .
the danes , while introducing a few unknowns in the hope of kick-starting a new era , still had a number of experienced players on show and with a home crowd behind them , they may have been expected to give germany 's reserves a torrid time .
but despite never playing together as a full team before and in a formation rarely used by loew , the german players slowly started to look comfortable in each other 's company and for the majority of the game , they appeared in little danger of leaving copenhagen without a victory .
while loew is unlikely to ever field this team again or play his regular starters in this tactical shape , a number of players will have improved their chances of joining the first team for the upcoming euro 2012 qualifiers and perhaps the european championships themselves in poland and ukraine in two years time .
der hammer returns to form with added nuances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal one performance that will have given the germany coach food for though was that of thomas hitzlsperger .
given the captain 's armband in the absence of warring skippers philipp lahm and michael ballack , hitzlsperger 's inclusion as germany 's leader in the centre of midfield was just reward for der hammer after fighting back from a severe loss of form .
after losing confidence and his touch at vfb stuttgart – and his place in the germany team – hitzlsperger 's transfer to lazio in january could have been the moment he dropped off germany 's radar .
but despite being overlooked for the world cup , hitzlsperger – now with west ham in the english premiership – has shown the hunger to come back and has recaptured his form .
there was plenty of the marauding midfield work of old but a season in serie a 's less frenetic atmosphere appears to have refined parts of hitzlsperger 's game which contributed to some considering him a blunt instrument .
it was a delicately feigned shot followed by a deft , penetrating pass into the penalty area on 19 minutes that set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal and until he was replaced in the second half , hitzlsperger was a worthy stand-in for bastian schweinsteiger in the conductor 's role .
gentner 's craft catches the eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former wolfsburg star gentner made a good impression playing off hitzlsperger was another player who should have done enough to convince jogi loew to continue his freshening-up of the germany team .
germany 's midfield showed no signs of suffering from the loss of ballack in south africa , and with toni kroos also showing in copenhagen why he could soon be a first team regular , one might think it overly optimistic to think that christian gentner may force his way into the national team 's starting line-up .
while hitzlsperger will certainly give loew a new option in defensive midfield , gentner put on a performance that could see him challenging for a role in the creative trio the germany coach normally deploys behind his lone striker .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder was a livewire throughout .
gentner was mobile , showed great vision and provided a number of killer passes .
drifting across the pitch behind mario gomez and patrick helmes , gentner was consistently probing the danish defensive line .
it was his perfectly timed pass which led to germany 's second goal .
receiving a great pass from jerome boateng on the edge of the area , gentner held the ball up long enough for helmes to time his run before threading a pass between the center-backs and onto helmes ' boot .
the bayer leverkusen striker did the rest .
stand-in strikers score but leave much to be desired bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmes needs the composure he shows with leverkusen helmes , who missed the world cup through injury after a good season with leverkusen , showed signs that he could be a worthy understudy to miroslav klose in the germany attack but the frequency and ease of the opportunities he wasted suggested that he needs more composure at this level and will certainly remain behind klose and thomas mueller in the attacking pecking order in the euro qualifiers .
but gomez , his well taken goal aside , played in a way that only reinforced the opinion that he must have some incriminating photos of his coach in a vault somewhere .
only someone with some nefarious hold over the man who picks the team can continue to get a game when he plays so abjectly .
even in a second-string team , gomez rarely justified his inclusion as an international striker .
elsewhere , there were encouraging signs that christian traesch could make good on his potential and challenge for a consistent role in midfield while toni kroos and marko marin – building on their cameo performances at the world cup – will certainly feature in the euro qualifiers and would be good bets to see increased action at the 2012 tournament .
despite his woeful pass which led to dennis rommedahl pulling a goal back just a minute after helmes put germany 2-0 up , defender serdar tasci had a competent game at left back until that mistake wrecked his confidence .
on the other side of defence , sascha reither was also solid until the final 15 minutes ; although it is unlikely he will ever unseat philipp lahm in the starting line-up .
the makeshift german defence as a whole battled well until the 74th minute when rommedahl 's goal gave denmark belief and shattered that of germany 's back four .
wiese 's strong showing in goal tarnished by late blunder with their two-goal lead slashed in half , germany looked rattled in defence and nervous in attack with gomez and helmes blowing gilt-edged chances to make the score 3-1 in the final ten minutes .
instead , denmark seized their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese kept denmark at bay until the final 15 minutes stand-in keeper tim wiese – who had an excellent game until his defense imploded in front of him – chose to rush out to deal with a dangerous through ball .
finding himself on the edge of his area , the werder bremen stopper was caught in two minds whether to use his hands , choosing instead to chest the ball to mads junker .
the danish striker knocked the ball round the stranded wiese before slotting it into an empty net to complete denmark 's comeback and the german collapse .
it was wiese 's first real mistake of the game but it was glaring one .
with rene adler returning from the injury that kept him from being the number one in south africa , and germany 's world cup keeper manuel neuer enhancing his reputation this summer , even without his 87th minute howler wiese faced an uphill struggle to make ground on his rivals .
it 's likely he 'll remain the third choice throughout the euro qualifiers and beyond .

meanwhile , authorities have said radiation levels have not increased despite wildfires reaching chernobyl-affected areas . russia is starting to deal more effectively with the wildfires which have been ravishing its western regions , senior government officials said on thursday . vladimir stepanov , head of the national crisis center , told russia 's interfax news agency that the area of burning land had gotten smaller in the last 24 hours , and there had been less fires with 562 fires covering around 80,000 hectares -lrb- 197,684 acres -rrb- of forest and peat land , the number of fires was down more than 10 percent from wednesday . officials also said environmental radiation levels had not shown any increase despite fires hitting areas contaminated by the 1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster . " a worsening of the radiation situation and a growth in the background radiation as a result of a transfer of materials from the fires have not been recorded anywhere in russia , " valery dyadyuchenko , the deputy head of russian state weather forecaster rosgidromet , told interfax . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fires are perilously close to the outer fence of the sarov nuclear facility russia ’ s state forest watchdog admitted on wednesday that fires had reached contaminated parts of the western bryansk region , sparking fears that radioactive particles would be released into the air . strong winds on thursday released moscow from the thick smog which has clouded its skies for much of the last week .
the number of fires close to the capital fell by more than a quarter in one day , as emergency services stepped up their firefighting efforts , flooding peat bogs around the city . nuclear sites still in danger more than 3,400 firefighters are battling to douse wildfires close to russia 's leading nuclear research facility in sarov , a town in the nizhny novgorod province . a spokesman for the emergencies ministry confirmed that two special firefighting trains , with large amounts of water and high-pressure hoses , had been sent to aid efforts at the site . no blazes had been recorded at the research center itself , but a nearby nature reserve has been on fire for the last week .
two soldiers were killed while trying to put out a nearby fire on monday . ukrainian authorities have played down fears over a two-hectare peat bog fire burning just 60 kilometers -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- south of the chernobyl site . " the fire presents no danger , " said viktoria ruban , spokeswoman for the ukrainian emergency situations ministry .
" there is no threat . " the fire started on august 9 , and is expected to be extinguished on thursday or friday , ruban added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : record temperatures and minimal rainfall have left parched fields prone to fires end not yet in sight environmentalists and nuclear experts have suggested that forest fires on contaminated land could result in radioactive particles blowing across central europe . " the particles could be transferred hundreds of kilometers depending on the weather conditions , " said alexei yablokov , a founder of greenpeace in the soviet union . but germany 's federal office for radiation protection played down fears of germany or western europe being affected . the smog which has covered moscow could well return this weekend , with weather forecasts predicting hot and dry conditions , and no rain in sight . monitoring officials have said this is russia ’ s hottest summer in a millennium .

there was plenty of the marauding midfield work of old but a season in serie a 's less frenetic atmosphere appears to have refined parts of hitzlsperger 's game which contributed to some considering him a blunt instrument .
it was a delicately feigned shot followed by a deft , penetrating pass into the penalty area on 19 minutes that set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal and until he was replaced in the second half , hitzlsperger was a worthy stand-in for bastian schweinsteiger in the conductor 's role .

it was his perfectly timed pass which led to germany 's second goal .
receiving a great pass from jerome boateng on the edge of the area , gentner held the ball up long enough for helmes to time his run before threading a pass between the center-backs and onto helmes ' boot .
the bayer leverkusen striker did the rest .
stand-in strikers score but leave much to be desired bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmes needs the composure he shows with leverkusen helmes , who missed the world cup through injury after a good season with leverkusen , showed signs that he could be a worthy understudy to miroslav klose in the germany attack but the frequency and ease of the opportunities he wasted suggested that he needs more composure at this level and will certainly remain behind klose and thomas mueller in the attacking pecking order in the euro qualifiers .
but gomez , his well taken goal aside , played in a way that only reinforced the opinion that he must have some incriminating photos of his coach in a vault somewhere .
only someone with some nefarious hold over the man who picks the team can continue to get a game when he plays so abjectly .
even in a second-string team , gomez rarely justified his inclusion as an international striker .
elsewhere , there were encouraging signs that christian traesch could make good on his potential and challenge for a consistent role in midfield while toni kroos and marko marin – building on their cameo performances at the world cup – will certainly feature in the euro qualifiers and would be good bets to see increased action at the 2012 tournament .
despite his woeful pass which led to dennis rommedahl pulling a goal back just a minute after helmes put germany 2-0 up , defender serdar tasci had a competent game at left back until that mistake wrecked his confidence .
on the other side of defence , sascha reither was also solid until the final 15 minutes ; although it is unlikely he will ever unseat philipp lahm in the starting line-up .
the makeshift german defence as a whole battled well until the 74th minute when rommedahl 's goal gave denmark belief and shattered that of germany 's back four .
wiese 's strong showing in goal tarnished by late blunder with their two-goal lead slashed in half , germany looked rattled in defence and nervous in attack with gomez and helmes blowing gilt-edged chances to make the score 3-1 in the final ten minutes .
instead , denmark seized their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese kept denmark at bay until the final 15 minutes stand-in keeper tim wiese – who had an excellent game until his defense imploded in front of him – chose to rush out to deal with a dangerous through ball .
finding himself on the edge of his area , the werder bremen stopper was caught in two minds whether to use his hands , choosing instead to chest the ball to mads junker .
the danish striker knocked the ball round the stranded wiese before slotting it into an empty net to complete denmark 's comeback and the german collapse .
it was wiese 's first real mistake of the game but it was glaring one .
with rene adler returning from the injury that kept him from being the number one in south africa , and germany 's world cup keeper manuel neuer enhancing his reputation this summer , even without his 87th minute howler wiese faced an uphill struggle to make ground on his rivals .
it 's likely he 'll remain the third choice throughout the euro qualifiers and beyond .

plans for a military attack existed right up to the end of the regime . through the decades of berlin 's division , many west berliners had an inkling that east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- that surrounded their part of the city would at some stage be seeking to conquer it .
a tv documentary , " der fall x " -lrb- the case of x -rrb- , shown by germany 's public broadcaster rbb finally proved them right .
in the most comprehensive footage on east germany 's conquest plans so far , two filmmakers , supported by military experts , tell a fascinating story about how the defunct state planned to overrun west berlin in only three days .
" as far as we can tell , the planning was quite serious , " german military historian winfried heinemann told deutsche welle .
" but whether they would have managed to take the city within three days is another question . "
superior numbers heinemann pointed out that the western allies were quite serious about defending west berlin from a ground attack .
but he acknowledged that next to nothing was known about any defense strategies as the relevant documents are still classified .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahr knew that west berlin was never really a safe place egon bahr , a former west berlin radio commentator and later adviser to west german chancellor willy brandt , argued that the gdr 's national people 's army troops , and those of the soviet union deployed in the region , would have outnumbered the soldiers from the western allies by far .
" in the event of an attack , our defenses could have been maintained for no more than five to seven hours , " bahr concluded .
the plans found in the files of the east german secret police , the gdr army and the soviet military command reveal some details as to how the attackers would have gone about their job .
a detailed map available to the filmmakers showed the most important installations and infrastructure compounds in west berlin , which would have been targeted first .
among them were strategically important bridges that the french , british and us allies used to move around as well as airports and train stations .
a second phase of the operation would have included the imprisonment of leading west berlin politicians , policemen , public servants and journalists .
a corresponding list of names was updated by the gdr leadership several times until the collapse of the regime in 1989 .
a diehard obsession the research done by military historian winfried heinemann also revealed that plans to attack west berlin were , surprisingly , only developed fully in the early 1970s - a time when political relations between the two german states were in the process of improving considerably .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr soldiers trained for an attack as late as 1988 " whether it was just a question of the gdr military having grown up enough to feel fit for the job - we do n't really know , " said heinemann .
" but considering that the whole military posture of the gdr was kept up right until 1989 , it 's at least no surprise that the planning for an attack went on until the very end . "
in fact , east germany 's national people 's army -lrb- nva -rrb- carried out military maneuvers as late as 1988 to train for the takeover of west berlin .
exercises took place in the east german town of magdeburg some 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- west of berlin .
the training ground was designed to look as if the target territory were divided up between a french , british and us brigade , which reflected the fact the west berlin was seperated into sectors occupied by those three countries .
one year later , the berlin wall fell , and east german intelligence managed to destroy most of the documents regarding the gdr 's hostile intentions toward west berlin .

the eu 's economic affairs commissioner hit out at bratislava for breaking a commitment . european union officials have accused the slovak government of breaching legal commitments , after it rejected participation in a bailout loan for greece .
the slovak parliament voted on wednesday to confirm the country 's refusal to participate in the lending package drawn up by the eu and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
slovakia was to commit 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1 million -rrb- to a 110-billion-euro fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn voiced concern that slovakia had gone back on its commitment eu economic affairs commissioner olli rehn described the decision as a " breach of the commitment undertaken by slovakia in the eurogroup , " and said that the finance ministers of all 27 eu members would " return to the matter in their next meeting " early in september .
the slovak parliament did , however , approve a potentially greater framework agreement on a 440-billion-euro loan mechanism aimed at stabilizing other member states that may need help in the future .
" it is somehow surprising because the underlying principle for both is exactly the same , " a spokesman for rehn 's office said .
rehn said that bratislava 's move would not prevent other countries from bailing out greece , as the loan has already been put in place alongside stiff austerity measures .
only two votes in favor the bill on bratislava 's participation in the eu rescue package gained only two approving votes amongst the parliamentarians present at wednesday 's session ; 69 deputies voted against participation , with 13 abstaining .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister radicova criticized greek policies the german government said it regretted the outcome of the slovak vote .
government spokesman steffen seibert told the german edition of the financial times ' chancellor angela merkel would address the issue in talks with the slovakian government on a visit to bratislava later in the month . slovakia 's previous government , under social democratic prime minister robert fico , pledged in may that bratislava would fulfill its share of the greek loans but delayed a final decision until after parliamentary elections in june .
the center-right government under prime minister iveta radicova then took power .
radicova had criticized greece 's " undisciplined budget policy " and sought to overturn the previous government 's decision .

but experts say there is no significant nuclear health danger . revelations that wildfires have hit hundreds of hectares of land in russia 's western bryansk region contaminated in the chernobyl nuclear disaster have raised fears that radioactive material could be released and reach moscow or even europe .
but radiation experts have said while concern is warranted , any re-release of nuclear contamination would likely pose little risk to human health .
" every instance of increased radioactivity is a cause for concern , but even for the local population , the levels are going to be relatively low , " said ulrich abram , a professor in the chemistry department and radiation expert at the free university of berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" there wo n't be a resulting cloud of radioactive material that could pose a danger to europe , " he said .
fears about russia possibly covering up a new radiation threat were raised when the environmental organization greenpeace warned that fires in forests contaminated in the 1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster could trigger radiation pollution .
the group accused the russian government of playing down the threat .
" fires on these territories will without a doubt lead to an increase in radiation , " said vladimir chuprov , head of the energy program at greenpeace russia , in an interview with the new york times .
" the smoke will spread , and the radioactive traces will spread . "
but radiation experts from russia and other european countries have sought to calm fears , saying that while radioactive isotopes could indeed be released into the air as contaminated material burns , there is no chance that radioactive fallout from the fires could reach anywhere near the magnitude of the chernobyl disaster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radioactive isotopes from the chernobyl disaster are still present in the soil and vegetation fo the area the concerns come from the fact that large areas of ukraine , belarus and russia are still coated with radioactive residue released when reactor no. 4 at the chernobyl nuclear power plan exploded on april 26 , 1986 .
two isotopes are of concern most of the radioactive isotopes released by the chernobyl meltdown were caesium-137 and strontium-90 , both produced by nuclear fission .
because both are isotopes of metallic elements , they fell to the ground rather quickly , according to abram , working their way into the soil over the decades since their release and being taken up by plants and trees .
when the vegetation burns , the atoms are released .
" then people could breathe them in , of course , " said abram .
" they could be exposed to a higher radiation intensity , which can lead to illness . "
abram remarks that people in the affected areas have been living with chernobyl 's aftermath for decades , although ingesting atoms released by the current fires would expose them at higher levels , and more direct contact .
internal exposure to caesium-137 and strontium-90 , through ingestion or inhalation , allows for the radioactive material to be distributed in the body 's soft tissues , especially muscle tissue and bone matter .
these tissues are then exposed to the beta particles and gamma radiation of the isotopes , increasing the risk of developing cancer .
low risk of inhaling nuclear material still , abram says the risk of inhalation is low , because the relative weights of both strontium and caesium send them falling to the ground quickly .
therefore , the risk of breathing the isotopes is low , unless residents are in the immediate vicinity of burning material .
" i do n't want to play down the issue , but the overall radiation dosage will not increase significantly for the people who live there , " he said .
what he does think a likely outcome will be is that as these isotopes are released , they could travel before falling to the ground again in the presence of high winds .
the result would be a larger area of land with low levels of radiation contamination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fires will likely spread contaminants over a larger area other experts agree with his risk assessment , including philipp renaud , head of the environmental radiation laboratory at france 's irsn nuclear safety institute .
he said the previous major forest fires in russia , in 2002 , showed that the risk of exposure was minor .
radioactivity in neighboring countries jumped by a thousandth of a becquerel unit and in france , a millionth .
" this is n't dangerous at all , " he told the agence france presse .
irsn said that if the contaminated forests burn , local residents would be exposed to about two times the normal radiation levels , which while not ideal , is not a cause for panic .
more dangerous for local residents ' health are the non-radioactive toxic fumes caused by the fire , the organization said .
other nuclear dangers ?
some have been concerned that the fires could reach other nuclear sites in russia , such as power plants or atomic weapon depots .
but according to edmund lengfelder , a director at the german society for radiation protection , the danger of flames engulfing a nuclear reactor and leading to disaster is small .
his group has been active in the chernobyl region for 20 years and has observed that these days , the russians are relatively well prepared when it comes to keeping their nuclear facilities out of harm 's way .
" russia is pretty competent when it comes to disaster response and we do n't see a particular threat to its nuclear facilities , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but regarding the material already deposited from chernobyl , we need to keep an eye on that . "

but experts say there is no significant nuclear health danger . revelations that wildfires have hit hundreds of hectares of land in russia 's western bryansk region contaminated in the chernobyl nuclear disaster have raised fears that radioactive material could be released and reach moscow or even europe .
but radiation experts have said while concern is warranted , any re-release of nuclear contamination would likely pose little risk to human health .
" every instance of increased radioactivity is a cause for concern , but even for the local population , the levels are going to be relatively low , " said ulrich abram , a professor in the chemistry department and radiation expert at the free university of berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" there wo n't be a resulting cloud of radioactive material that could pose a danger to europe , " he said .
fears about russia possibly covering up a new radiation threat were raised when the environmental organization greenpeace warned that fires in forests contaminated in the 1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster could trigger radiation pollution .
the group accused the russian government of playing down the threat .
" fires on these territories will without a doubt lead to an increase in radiation , " said vladimir chuprov , head of the energy program at greenpeace russia , in an interview with the new york times .
" the smoke will spread , and the radioactive traces will spread . "
but radiation experts from russia and other european countries have sought to calm fears , saying that while radioactive isotopes could indeed be released into the air as contaminated material burns , there is no chance that radioactive fallout from the fires could reach anywhere near the magnitude of the chernobyl disaster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radioactive isotopes from the chernobyl disaster are still present in the soil and vegetation fo the area the concerns come from the fact that large areas of ukraine , belarus and russia are still coated with radioactive residue released when reactor no. 4 at the chernobyl nuclear power plan exploded on april 26 , 1986 .
two isotopes are of concern most of the radioactive isotopes released by the chernobyl meltdown were caesium-137 and strontium-90 , both produced by nuclear fission .
because both are isotopes of metallic elements , they fell to the ground rather quickly , according to abram , working their way into the soil over the decades since their release and being taken up by plants and trees .
when the vegetation burns , the atoms are released .
" then people could breathe them in , of course , " said abram .
" they could be exposed to a higher radiation intensity , which can lead to illness . "
abram remarks that people in the affected areas have been living with chernobyl 's aftermath for decades , although ingesting atoms released by the current fires would expose them at higher levels , and more direct contact .
internal exposure to caesium-137 and strontium-90 , through ingestion or inhalation , allows for the radioactive material to be distributed in the body 's soft tissues , especially muscle tissue and bone matter .
these tissues are then exposed to the beta particles and gamma radiation of the isotopes , increasing the risk of developing cancer .
low risk of inhaling nuclear material still , abram says the risk of inhalation is low , because the relative weights of both strontium and caesium send them falling to the ground quickly .
therefore , the risk of breathing the isotopes is low , unless residents are in the immediate vicinity of burning material .
" i do n't want to play down the issue , but the overall radiation dosage will not increase significantly for the people who live there , " he said .
what he does think a likely outcome will be is that as these isotopes are released , they could travel before falling to the ground again in the presence of high winds .
the result would be a larger area of land with low levels of radiation contamination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fires will likely spread contaminants over a larger area other experts agree with his risk assessment , including philipp renaud , head of the environmental radiation laboratory at france 's irsn nuclear safety institute .
he said the previous major forest fires in russia , in 2002 , showed that the risk of exposure was minor .
radioactivity in neighboring countries jumped by a thousandth of a becquerel unit and in france , a millionth .
" this is n't dangerous at all , " he told the agence france presse .
irsn said that if the contaminated forests burn , local residents would be exposed to about two times the normal radiation levels , which while not ideal , is not a cause for panic .
more dangerous for local residents ' health are the non-radioactive toxic fumes caused by the fire , the organization said .
other nuclear dangers ?
some have been concerned that the fires could reach other nuclear sites in russia , such as power plants or atomic weapon depots .
but according to edmund lengfelder , a director at the german society for radiation protection , the danger of flames engulfing a nuclear reactor and leading to disaster is small .
his group has been active in the chernobyl region for 20 years and has observed that these days , the russians are relatively well prepared when it comes to keeping their nuclear facilities out of harm 's way .
" russia is pretty competent when it comes to disaster response and we do n't see a particular threat to its nuclear facilities , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but regarding the material already deposited from chernobyl , we need to keep an eye on that . "

plans for a military attack existed right up to the end of the regime . through the decades of berlin 's division , many west berliners had an inkling that east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- that surrounded their part of the city would at some stage be seeking to conquer it .
a tv documentary , " der fall x " -lrb- the case of x -rrb- , shown by germany 's public broadcaster rbb finally proved them right .
in the most comprehensive footage on east germany 's conquest plans so far , two filmmakers , supported by military experts , tell a fascinating story about how the defunct state planned to overrun west berlin in only three days .
" as far as we can tell , the planning was quite serious , " german military historian winfried heinemann told deutsche welle .
" but whether they would have managed to take the city within three days is another question . "
superior numbers heinemann pointed out that the western allies were quite serious about defending west berlin from a ground attack .
but he acknowledged that next to nothing was known about any defense strategies as the relevant documents are still classified .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahr knew that west berlin was never really a safe place egon bahr , a former west berlin radio commentator and later adviser to west german chancellor willy brandt , argued that the gdr 's national people 's army troops , and those of the soviet union deployed in the region , would have outnumbered the soldiers from the western allies by far .
" in the event of an attack , our defenses could have been maintained for no more than five to seven hours , " bahr concluded .
the plans found in the files of the east german secret police , the gdr army and the soviet military command reveal some details as to how the attackers would have gone about their job .
a detailed map available to the filmmakers showed the most important installations and infrastructure compounds in west berlin , which would have been targeted first .
among them were strategically important bridges that the french , british and us allies used to move around as well as airports and train stations .
a second phase of the operation would have included the imprisonment of leading west berlin politicians , policemen , public servants and journalists .
a corresponding list of names was updated by the gdr leadership several times until the collapse of the regime in 1989 .
a diehard obsession the research done by military historian winfried heinemann also revealed that plans to attack west berlin were , surprisingly , only developed fully in the early 1970s - a time when political relations between the two german states were in the process of improving considerably .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr soldiers trained for an attack as late as 1988 " whether it was just a question of the gdr military having grown up enough to feel fit for the job - we do n't really know , " said heinemann .
" but considering that the whole military posture of the gdr was kept up right until 1989 , it 's at least no surprise that the planning for an attack went on until the very end . "
in fact , east germany 's national people 's army -lrb- nva -rrb- carried out military maneuvers as late as 1988 to train for the takeover of west berlin .
exercises took place in the east german town of magdeburg some 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- west of berlin .
the training ground was designed to look as if the target territory were divided up between a french , british and us brigade , which reflected the fact the west berlin was seperated into sectors occupied by those three countries .
one year later , the berlin wall fell , and east german intelligence managed to destroy most of the documents regarding the gdr 's hostile intentions toward west berlin .

but experts say there is no significant nuclear health danger . revelations that wildfires have hit hundreds of hectares of land in russia 's western bryansk region contaminated in the chernobyl nuclear disaster have raised fears that radioactive material could be released and reach moscow or even europe .
but radiation experts have said while concern is warranted , any re-release of nuclear contamination would likely pose little risk to human health .
" every instance of increased radioactivity is a cause for concern , but even for the local population , the levels are going to be relatively low , " said ulrich abram , a professor in the chemistry department and radiation expert at the free university of berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" there wo n't be a resulting cloud of radioactive material that could pose a danger to europe , " he said .
fears about russia possibly covering up a new radiation threat were raised when the environmental organization greenpeace warned that fires in forests contaminated in the 1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster could trigger radiation pollution .
the group accused the russian government of playing down the threat .
" fires on these territories will without a doubt lead to an increase in radiation , " said vladimir chuprov , head of the energy program at greenpeace russia , in an interview with the new york times .
" the smoke will spread , and the radioactive traces will spread . "
but radiation experts from russia and other european countries have sought to calm fears , saying that while radioactive isotopes could indeed be released into the air as contaminated material burns , there is no chance that radioactive fallout from the fires could reach anywhere near the magnitude of the chernobyl disaster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radioactive isotopes from the chernobyl disaster are still present in the soil and vegetation fo the area the concerns come from the fact that large areas of ukraine , belarus and russia are still coated with radioactive residue released when reactor no. 4 at the chernobyl nuclear power plan exploded on april 26 , 1986 .
two isotopes are of concern most of the radioactive isotopes released by the chernobyl meltdown were caesium-137 and strontium-90 , both produced by nuclear fission .
because both are isotopes of metallic elements , they fell to the ground rather quickly , according to abram , working their way into the soil over the decades since their release and being taken up by plants and trees .
when the vegetation burns , the atoms are released .
" then people could breathe them in , of course , " said abram .
" they could be exposed to a higher radiation intensity , which can lead to illness . "
abram remarks that people in the affected areas have been living with chernobyl 's aftermath for decades , although ingesting atoms released by the current fires would expose them at higher levels , and more direct contact .
internal exposure to caesium-137 and strontium-90 , through ingestion or inhalation , allows for the radioactive material to be distributed in the body 's soft tissues , especially muscle tissue and bone matter .
these tissues are then exposed to the beta particles and gamma radiation of the isotopes , increasing the risk of developing cancer .
low risk of inhaling nuclear material still , abram says the risk of inhalation is low , because the relative weights of both strontium and caesium send them falling to the ground quickly .
therefore , the risk of breathing the isotopes is low , unless residents are in the immediate vicinity of burning material .
" i do n't want to play down the issue , but the overall radiation dosage will not increase significantly for the people who live there , " he said .
what he does think a likely outcome will be is that as these isotopes are released , they could travel before falling to the ground again in the presence of high winds .
the result would be a larger area of land with low levels of radiation contamination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fires will likely spread contaminants over a larger area other experts agree with his risk assessment , including philipp renaud , head of the environmental radiation laboratory at france 's irsn nuclear safety institute .
he said the previous major forest fires in russia , in 2002 , showed that the risk of exposure was minor .
radioactivity in neighboring countries jumped by a thousandth of a becquerel unit and in france , a millionth .
" this is n't dangerous at all , " he told the agence france presse .
irsn said that if the contaminated forests burn , local residents would be exposed to about two times the normal radiation levels , which while not ideal , is not a cause for panic .
more dangerous for local residents ' health are the non-radioactive toxic fumes caused by the fire , the organization said .
other nuclear dangers ?
some have been concerned that the fires could reach other nuclear sites in russia , such as power plants or atomic weapon depots .
but according to edmund lengfelder , a director at the german society for radiation protection , the danger of flames engulfing a nuclear reactor and leading to disaster is small .
his group has been active in the chernobyl region for 20 years and has observed that these days , the russians are relatively well prepared when it comes to keeping their nuclear facilities out of harm 's way .
" russia is pretty competent when it comes to disaster response and we do n't see a particular threat to its nuclear facilities , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but regarding the material already deposited from chernobyl , we need to keep an eye on that . "

but experts say there is no significant nuclear health danger . revelations that wildfires have hit hundreds of hectares of land in russia 's western bryansk region contaminated in the chernobyl nuclear disaster have raised fears that radioactive material could be released and reach moscow or even europe .
but radiation experts have said while concern is warranted , any re-release of nuclear contamination would likely pose little risk to human health .
" every instance of increased radioactivity is a cause for concern , but even for the local population , the levels are going to be relatively low , " said ulrich abram , a professor in the chemistry department and radiation expert at the free university of berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" there wo n't be a resulting cloud of radioactive material that could pose a danger to europe , " he said .
fears about russia possibly covering up a new radiation threat were raised when the environmental organization greenpeace warned that fires in forests contaminated in the 1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster could trigger radiation pollution .
the group accused the russian government of playing down the threat .
" fires on these territories will without a doubt lead to an increase in radiation , " said vladimir chuprov , head of the energy program at greenpeace russia , in an interview with the new york times .
" the smoke will spread , and the radioactive traces will spread . "
but radiation experts from russia and other european countries have sought to calm fears , saying that while radioactive isotopes could indeed be released into the air as contaminated material burns , there is no chance that radioactive fallout from the fires could reach anywhere near the magnitude of the chernobyl disaster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radioactive isotopes from the chernobyl disaster are still present in the soil and vegetation fo the area the concerns come from the fact that large areas of ukraine , belarus and russia are still coated with radioactive residue released when reactor no. 4 at the chernobyl nuclear power plan exploded on april 26 , 1986 .
two isotopes are of concern most of the radioactive isotopes released by the chernobyl meltdown were caesium-137 and strontium-90 , both produced by nuclear fission .
because both are isotopes of metallic elements , they fell to the ground rather quickly , according to abram , working their way into the soil over the decades since their release and being taken up by plants and trees .
when the vegetation burns , the atoms are released .
" then people could breathe them in , of course , " said abram .
" they could be exposed to a higher radiation intensity , which can lead to illness . "
abram remarks that people in the affected areas have been living with chernobyl 's aftermath for decades , although ingesting atoms released by the current fires would expose them at higher levels , and more direct contact .
internal exposure to caesium-137 and strontium-90 , through ingestion or inhalation , allows for the radioactive material to be distributed in the body 's soft tissues , especially muscle tissue and bone matter .
these tissues are then exposed to the beta particles and gamma radiation of the isotopes , increasing the risk of developing cancer .
low risk of inhaling nuclear material still , abram says the risk of inhalation is low , because the relative weights of both strontium and caesium send them falling to the ground quickly .
therefore , the risk of breathing the isotopes is low , unless residents are in the immediate vicinity of burning material .
" i do n't want to play down the issue , but the overall radiation dosage will not increase significantly for the people who live there , " he said .
what he does think a likely outcome will be is that as these isotopes are released , they could travel before falling to the ground again in the presence of high winds .
the result would be a larger area of land with low levels of radiation contamination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fires will likely spread contaminants over a larger area other experts agree with his risk assessment , including philipp renaud , head of the environmental radiation laboratory at france 's irsn nuclear safety institute .
he said the previous major forest fires in russia , in 2002 , showed that the risk of exposure was minor .
radioactivity in neighboring countries jumped by a thousandth of a becquerel unit and in france , a millionth .
" this is n't dangerous at all , " he told the agence france presse .
irsn said that if the contaminated forests burn , local residents would be exposed to about two times the normal radiation levels , which while not ideal , is not a cause for panic .
more dangerous for local residents ' health are the non-radioactive toxic fumes caused by the fire , the organization said .
other nuclear dangers ?
some have been concerned that the fires could reach other nuclear sites in russia , such as power plants or atomic weapon depots .
but according to edmund lengfelder , a director at the german society for radiation protection , the danger of flames engulfing a nuclear reactor and leading to disaster is small .
his group has been active in the chernobyl region for 20 years and has observed that these days , the russians are relatively well prepared when it comes to keeping their nuclear facilities out of harm 's way .
" russia is pretty competent when it comes to disaster response and we do n't see a particular threat to its nuclear facilities , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but regarding the material already deposited from chernobyl , we need to keep an eye on that . "

the eu 's economic affairs commissioner hit out at bratislava for breaking a commitment . european union officials have accused the slovak government of breaching legal commitments , after it rejected participation in a bailout loan for greece .
the slovak parliament voted on wednesday to confirm the country 's refusal to participate in the lending package drawn up by the eu and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
slovakia was to commit 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1 million -rrb- to a 110-billion-euro fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn voiced concern that slovakia had gone back on its commitment eu economic affairs commissioner olli rehn described the decision as a " breach of the commitment undertaken by slovakia in the eurogroup , " and said that the finance ministers of all 27 eu members would " return to the matter in their next meeting " early in september .
the slovak parliament did , however , approve a potentially greater framework agreement on a 440-billion-euro loan mechanism aimed at stabilizing other member states that may need help in the future .
" it is somehow surprising because the underlying principle for both is exactly the same , " a spokesman for rehn 's office said .
rehn said that bratislava 's move would not prevent other countries from bailing out greece , as the loan has already been put in place alongside stiff austerity measures .
only two votes in favor the bill on bratislava 's participation in the eu rescue package gained only two approving votes amongst the parliamentarians present at wednesday 's session ; 69 deputies voted against participation , with 13 abstaining .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister radicova criticized greek policies the german government said it regretted the outcome of the slovak vote .
government spokesman steffen seibert told the german edition of the financial times ' chancellor angela merkel would address the issue in talks with the slovakian government on a visit to bratislava later in the month . slovakia 's previous government , under social democratic prime minister robert fico , pledged in may that bratislava would fulfill its share of the greek loans but delayed a final decision until after parliamentary elections in june .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 12.08.2010 berliners commemorate construction of the wall that divided the city großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners were amazed to see their city divided construction of the berlin wall began on august 13 , 1961 .
as berlin remembers the event , new figures suggest more people than previously thought were killed on the inner german border from 1961-1989 . berlin commemorated on friday the 49th anniversary of the day the east german government began building the berlin wall . a memorial service was held at the chapel of reconciliation in the former death strip .
mayor klaus wowereit laid a wreath at the bernauer strasse memorial , in remembrance of those who were killed by gdr border guards . " it teaches us a lesson , " wowereit said .
" time and again , it is important to stand decisively against authoritarian regimes and dictatorships . " he urged that the memory of the berlin wall must sharpen appreciation of contemporary freedom and democracy . among a number of services held in berlin on friday , a street is to be renamed in memory of chris gueffroy , recognized as the last person killed trying to cross the border . greater number killed according to the official site that commemorates the berlin wall in the district of mitte , at least 136 people were killed by the east german border patrol while trying to escape from east to west berlin between 1961 and 1989 . but that 's not the whole story .
new figures from the privately-run wall museum , located at the former checkpoint charlie border crossing in berlin , say the total number of people who died trying to escape from east to west germany during those 28 years is 1,393 . " the number has risen by 46 compared with our research last year , " alexandra hildebrandt , chairwoman of the wall museum told deutsche welle . " the list includes those who died at the berlin wall , the baltic sea , the inner german border and neighboring countries like poland , bulgaria , czechoslovakia and hungary .
it also includes east german soldiers , for example those who committed suicide because they could n't deal with the regime , " she said . bildunterschrift : the wall became the symbol of the cold war tragic deaths one of those soldiers , whose suicide has only just come to light , took his own life just hours after construction on the wall had started .
" i cried all night when i read this , " hildebrandt said .
" he shot himself and left his wife a note saying : ' i ca n't do this anymore , i 'm too weak , forgive me , it 's better that way ' . "
in the early hours of august 13 , 1961 , the east german government took the west by surprise and ordered its army and police to stop all travel between east and west berlin and start work on the wall that would divide berlin until 1989 .
even the us secret service did not know of the project .
two months earlier , the east german leader walter ulbricht , head of the east german communist party -lrb- sed -rrb- , openly denied rumors that such a project was underway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germany had denied it was planning to build a wall on august 24 that year , just 11 days after the work on the wall had started , the first person was shot dead trying to escape .
guenter liftin 's murder shocked the world , but erich honecker , who was head of security then and would later become east germany 's leader and head of the sed , remained defiant .
" the building of the anti-fascist protective barrier stabilized the situation in europe and secured peace , " he said a desperate act in reality , the east german regime was in crisis .
by 1961 , 2.7 million people had decided to leave the country and live in the west .
communist ideology was starting to lose its luster , damaging the economy in the process .
in his famous ' ich bin ein berliner ' speech in 1963 in west berlin , then us president john f. kennedy described the berlin wall as " the most vivid and obvious demonstration of the failures of the communist system . "
today , 21 years after the wall came down , many are still afraid to talk about their own or their relatives ' experiences .
" they are still afraid , they are dominated by fear , possibly their whole lives , because the gdr was a dictatorship .
it was like a big prison , where people were afraid to talk , afraid to live , essentially , " hildebrandt told deutsche welle .
honecker firmly believed the wall would stand for 50 or even 100 years .
but the east german regime was powerless against the will of its people and a reform-oriented soviet union , which eventually , led to the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 .

this was a germany team shorn of almost all of its world cup stars and filled with debutants , cameo performers and bit-part players charged with taking on a denmark team smarting from a hugely forgettable summer in south africa .
the danes , while introducing a few unknowns in the hope of kick-starting a new era , still had a number of experienced players on show and with a home crowd behind them , they may have been expected to give germany 's reserves a torrid time .
but despite never playing together as a full team before and in a formation rarely used by loew , the german players slowly started to look comfortable in each other 's company and for the majority of the game , they appeared in little danger of leaving copenhagen without a victory .
while loew is unlikely to ever field this team again or play his regular starters in this tactical shape , a number of players will have improved their chances of joining the first team for the upcoming euro 2012 qualifiers and perhaps the european championships themselves in poland and ukraine in two years time .
der hammer returns to form with added nuances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal one performance that will have given the germany coach food for though was that of thomas hitzlsperger .
given the captain 's armband in the absence of warring skippers philipp lahm and michael ballack , hitzlsperger 's inclusion as germany 's leader in the centre of midfield was just reward for der hammer after fighting back from a severe loss of form .
after losing confidence and his touch at vfb stuttgart – and his place in the germany team – hitzlsperger 's transfer to lazio in january could have been the moment he dropped off germany 's radar .
but despite being overlooked for the world cup , hitzlsperger – now with west ham in the english premiership – has shown the hunger to come back and has recaptured his form .
there was plenty of the marauding midfield work of old but a season in serie a 's less frenetic atmosphere appears to have refined parts of hitzlsperger 's game which contributed to some considering him a blunt instrument .
it was a delicately feigned shot followed by a deft , penetrating pass into the penalty area on 19 minutes that set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal and until he was replaced in the second half , hitzlsperger was a worthy stand-in for bastian schweinsteiger in the conductor 's role .
gentner 's craft catches the eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former wolfsburg star gentner made a good impression playing off hitzlsperger was another player who should have done enough to convince jogi loew to continue his freshening-up of the germany team .
germany 's midfield showed no signs of suffering from the loss of ballack in south africa , and with toni kroos also showing in copenhagen why he could soon be a first team regular , one might think it overly optimistic to think that christian gentner may force his way into the national team 's starting line-up .
while hitzlsperger will certainly give loew a new option in defensive midfield , gentner put on a performance that could see him challenging for a role in the creative trio the germany coach normally deploys behind his lone striker .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder was a livewire throughout .
gentner was mobile , showed great vision and provided a number of killer passes .
drifting across the pitch behind mario gomez and patrick helmes , gentner was consistently probing the danish defensive line .
it was his perfectly timed pass which led to germany 's second goal .
receiving a great pass from jerome boateng on the edge of the area , gentner held the ball up long enough for helmes to time his run before threading a pass between the center-backs and onto helmes ' boot .
the bayer leverkusen striker did the rest .
stand-in strikers score but leave much to be desired bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmes needs the composure he shows with leverkusen helmes , who missed the world cup through injury after a good season with leverkusen , showed signs that he could be a worthy understudy to miroslav klose in the germany attack but the frequency and ease of the opportunities he wasted suggested that he needs more composure at this level and will certainly remain behind klose and thomas mueller in the attacking pecking order in the euro qualifiers .
but gomez , his well taken goal aside , played in a way that only reinforced the opinion that he must have some incriminating photos of his coach in a vault somewhere .
only someone with some nefarious hold over the man who picks the team can continue to get a game when he plays so abjectly .
even in a second-string team , gomez rarely justified his inclusion as an international striker .
elsewhere , there were encouraging signs that christian traesch could make good on his potential and challenge for a consistent role in midfield while toni kroos and marko marin – building on their cameo performances at the world cup – will certainly feature in the euro qualifiers and would be good bets to see increased action at the 2012 tournament .
despite his woeful pass which led to dennis rommedahl pulling a goal back just a minute after helmes put germany 2-0 up , defender serdar tasci had a competent game at left back until that mistake wrecked his confidence .
on the other side of defence , sascha reither was also solid until the final 15 minutes ; although it is unlikely he will ever unseat philipp lahm in the starting line-up .
the makeshift german defence as a whole battled well until the 74th minute when rommedahl 's goal gave denmark belief and shattered that of germany 's back four .
wiese 's strong showing in goal tarnished by late blunder with their two-goal lead slashed in half , germany looked rattled in defence and nervous in attack with gomez and helmes blowing gilt-edged chances to make the score 3-1 in the final ten minutes .
instead , denmark seized their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese kept denmark at bay until the final 15 minutes stand-in keeper tim wiese – who had an excellent game until his defense imploded in front of him – chose to rush out to deal with a dangerous through ball .
finding himself on the edge of his area , the werder bremen stopper was caught in two minds whether to use his hands , choosing instead to chest the ball to mads junker .
the danish striker knocked the ball round the stranded wiese before slotting it into an empty net to complete denmark 's comeback and the german collapse .
it was wiese 's first real mistake of the game but it was glaring one .
with rene adler returning from the injury that kept him from being the number one in south africa , and germany 's world cup keeper manuel neuer enhancing his reputation this summer , even without his 87th minute howler wiese faced an uphill struggle to make ground on his rivals .
it 's likely he 'll remain the third choice throughout the euro qualifiers and beyond .

after losing confidence and his touch at vfb stuttgart – and his place in the germany team – hitzlsperger 's transfer to lazio in january could have been the moment he dropped off germany 's radar .
but despite being overlooked for the world cup , hitzlsperger – now with west ham in the english premiership – has shown the hunger to come back and has recaptured his form .
there was plenty of the marauding midfield work of old but a season in serie a 's less frenetic atmosphere appears to have refined parts of hitzlsperger 's game which contributed to some considering him a blunt instrument .
it was a delicately feigned shot followed by a deft , penetrating pass into the penalty area on 19 minutes that set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal and until he was replaced in the second half , hitzlsperger was a worthy stand-in for bastian schweinsteiger in the conductor 's role .
gentner 's craft catches the eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former wolfsburg star gentner made a good impression playing off hitzlsperger was another player who should have done enough to convince jogi loew to continue his freshening-up of the germany team .
germany 's midfield showed no signs of suffering from the loss of ballack in south africa , and with toni kroos also showing in copenhagen why he could soon be a first team regular , one might think it overly optimistic to think that christian gentner may force his way into the national team 's starting line-up .
while hitzlsperger will certainly give loew a new option in defensive midfield , gentner put on a performance that could see him challenging for a role in the creative trio the germany coach normally deploys behind his lone striker .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder was a livewire throughout .
gentner was mobile , showed great vision and provided a number of killer passes .
drifting across the pitch behind mario gomez and patrick helmes , gentner was consistently probing the danish defensive line .
it was his perfectly timed pass which led to germany 's second goal .
receiving a great pass from jerome boateng on the edge of the area , gentner held the ball up long enough for helmes to time his run before threading a pass between the center-backs and onto helmes ' boot .
the bayer leverkusen striker did the rest .
stand-in strikers score but leave much to be desired bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmes needs the composure he shows with leverkusen helmes , who missed the world cup through injury after a good season with leverkusen , showed signs that he could be a worthy understudy to miroslav klose in the germany attack but the frequency and ease of the opportunities he wasted suggested that he needs more composure at this level and will certainly remain behind klose and thomas mueller in the attacking pecking order in the euro qualifiers .
but gomez , his well taken goal aside , played in a way that only reinforced the opinion that he must have some incriminating photos of his coach in a vault somewhere .
only someone with some nefarious hold over the man who picks the team can continue to get a game when he plays so abjectly .
even in a second-string team , gomez rarely justified his inclusion as an international striker .
elsewhere , there were encouraging signs that christian traesch could make good on his potential and challenge for a consistent role in midfield while toni kroos and marko marin – building on their cameo performances at the world cup – will certainly feature in the euro qualifiers and would be good bets to see increased action at the 2012 tournament .
despite his woeful pass which led to dennis rommedahl pulling a goal back just a minute after helmes put germany 2-0 up , defender serdar tasci had a competent game at left back until that mistake wrecked his confidence .
on the other side of defence , sascha reither was also solid until the final 15 minutes ; although it is unlikely he will ever unseat philipp lahm in the starting line-up .
the makeshift german defence as a whole battled well until the 74th minute when rommedahl 's goal gave denmark belief and shattered that of germany 's back four .
wiese 's strong showing in goal tarnished by late blunder with their two-goal lead slashed in half , germany looked rattled in defence and nervous in attack with gomez and helmes blowing gilt-edged chances to make the score 3-1 in the final ten minutes .
instead , denmark seized their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese kept denmark at bay until the final 15 minutes stand-in keeper tim wiese – who had an excellent game until his defense imploded in front of him – chose to rush out to deal with a dangerous through ball .
finding himself on the edge of his area , the werder bremen stopper was caught in two minds whether to use his hands , choosing instead to chest the ball to mads junker .
the danish striker knocked the ball round the stranded wiese before slotting it into an empty net to complete denmark 's comeback and the german collapse .
it was wiese 's first real mistake of the game but it was glaring one .
with rene adler returning from the injury that kept him from being the number one in south africa , and germany 's world cup keeper manuel neuer enhancing his reputation this summer , even without his 87th minute howler wiese faced an uphill struggle to make ground on his rivals .
it 's likely he 'll remain the third choice throughout the euro qualifiers and beyond .

this was a germany team shorn of almost all of its world cup stars and filled with debutants , cameo performers and bit-part players charged with taking on a denmark team smarting from a hugely forgettable summer in south africa .
the danes , while introducing a few unknowns in the hope of kick-starting a new era , still had a number of experienced players on show and with a home crowd behind them , they may have been expected to give germany 's reserves a torrid time .
but despite never playing together as a full team before and in a formation rarely used by loew , the german players slowly started to look comfortable in each other 's company and for the majority of the game , they appeared in little danger of leaving copenhagen without a victory .
while loew is unlikely to ever field this team again or play his regular starters in this tactical shape , a number of players will have improved their chances of joining the first team for the upcoming euro 2012 qualifiers and perhaps the european championships themselves in poland and ukraine in two years time .

after losing confidence and his touch at vfb stuttgart – and his place in the germany team – hitzlsperger 's transfer to lazio in january could have been the moment he dropped off germany 's radar .
but despite being overlooked for the world cup , hitzlsperger – now with west ham in the english premiership – has shown the hunger to come back and has recaptured his form .
there was plenty of the marauding midfield work of old but a season in serie a 's less frenetic atmosphere appears to have refined parts of hitzlsperger 's game which contributed to some considering him a blunt instrument .
it was a delicately feigned shot followed by a deft , penetrating pass into the penalty area on 19 minutes that set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal and until he was replaced in the second half , hitzlsperger was a worthy stand-in for bastian schweinsteiger in the conductor 's role .
gentner 's craft catches the eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former wolfsburg star gentner made a good impression playing off hitzlsperger was another player who should have done enough to convince jogi loew to continue his freshening-up of the germany team .
germany 's midfield showed no signs of suffering from the loss of ballack in south africa , and with toni kroos also showing in copenhagen why he could soon be a first team regular , one might think it overly optimistic to think that christian gentner may force his way into the national team 's starting line-up .
while hitzlsperger will certainly give loew a new option in defensive midfield , gentner put on a performance that could see him challenging for a role in the creative trio the germany coach normally deploys behind his lone striker .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder was a livewire throughout .
gentner was mobile , showed great vision and provided a number of killer passes .
drifting across the pitch behind mario gomez and patrick helmes , gentner was consistently probing the danish defensive line .
it was his perfectly timed pass which led to germany 's second goal .
receiving a great pass from jerome boateng on the edge of the area , gentner held the ball up long enough for helmes to time his run before threading a pass between the center-backs and onto helmes ' boot .
the bayer leverkusen striker did the rest .
stand-in strikers score but leave much to be desired bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmes needs the composure he shows with leverkusen helmes , who missed the world cup through injury after a good season with leverkusen , showed signs that he could be a worthy understudy to miroslav klose in the germany attack but the frequency and ease of the opportunities he wasted suggested that he needs more composure at this level and will certainly remain behind klose and thomas mueller in the attacking pecking order in the euro qualifiers .
but gomez , his well taken goal aside , played in a way that only reinforced the opinion that he must have some incriminating photos of his coach in a vault somewhere .
only someone with some nefarious hold over the man who picks the team can continue to get a game when he plays so abjectly .
even in a second-string team , gomez rarely justified his inclusion as an international striker .
elsewhere , there were encouraging signs that christian traesch could make good on his potential and challenge for a consistent role in midfield while toni kroos and marko marin – building on their cameo performances at the world cup – will certainly feature in the euro qualifiers and would be good bets to see increased action at the 2012 tournament .
despite his woeful pass which led to dennis rommedahl pulling a goal back just a minute after helmes put germany 2-0 up , defender serdar tasci had a competent game at left back until that mistake wrecked his confidence .
on the other side of defence , sascha reither was also solid until the final 15 minutes ; although it is unlikely he will ever unseat philipp lahm in the starting line-up .
the makeshift german defence as a whole battled well until the 74th minute when rommedahl 's goal gave denmark belief and shattered that of germany 's back four .
wiese 's strong showing in goal tarnished by late blunder with their two-goal lead slashed in half , germany looked rattled in defence and nervous in attack with gomez and helmes blowing gilt-edged chances to make the score 3-1 in the final ten minutes .
instead , denmark seized their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese kept denmark at bay until the final 15 minutes stand-in keeper tim wiese – who had an excellent game until his defense imploded in front of him – chose to rush out to deal with a dangerous through ball .
finding himself on the edge of his area , the werder bremen stopper was caught in two minds whether to use his hands , choosing instead to chest the ball to mads junker .
the danish striker knocked the ball round the stranded wiese before slotting it into an empty net to complete denmark 's comeback and the german collapse .
it was wiese 's first real mistake of the game but it was glaring one .
with rene adler returning from the injury that kept him from being the number one in south africa , and germany 's world cup keeper manuel neuer enhancing his reputation this summer , even without his 87th minute howler wiese faced an uphill struggle to make ground on his rivals .
it 's likely he 'll remain the third choice throughout the euro qualifiers and beyond .

secularists demand it be taken away from the presidential palace . supporters of late polish president lech kaczynski 's law and justice party have remained defiant in their vigil at the site of a cross erected in memory of their late hero - despite calls from church leaders to allow its removal .
those loyal to the former president see him as defender of polish roman catholic values and say that the cross should remain outside the presidential palace in a warsaw square until a more permanent structure is found for the site .
church officials have said that it is time for supporters to give up the fight - warning that they are being manipulated for political , not religious , reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secularists say the palace is not the place for a cross " to all those who pray at the cross we must say that - despite their good intentions - they are being exploited for political purposes .
we urge everyone to make the transfer of the cross possible , " press secretary for the polish episcopate , bishop stanislaw budzik , told reporters in warsaw on thursday .
the palace , now occupied by president bronislaw komorowski , unveiled a plaque on thursday commemorating the tragedy on the facade of a side-wing to the building .
a first attempt to move the cross - initially to a church in the old part of the city and later to a shrine in the south of the country - met with fierce opposition on august 3 .
both the church and the scout group that first erected the four-meter -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- wooden cross had agreed to the plan .
facebook campaign and rally but opposition is mounting to the cross staying in place .
secularists - many of them younger , and opposed to the policies of the former president - rallied on monday in response to a facebook campaign to have the cross removed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some think jaroslaw kaczynski is using the dispute for political capital by midnight , several thousand had gathered in front of the presidential palace chanting the slogan , " to a church ! "
the cross was spontaneously erected after the april 10 crash of the presidential plane in western russia , killing the president , his wife and 94 others .
as well as highlighting religious divisions , the row is indicative of the political tensions currently simmering in the country .
some critics of former president kaczynski were unhappy with his right-wing politics and traditional approach to family values .
opponents also say his nationalist and euroskeptic policies placed poland on an isolationist course within the european union .
current president komorowski is expected to take the country in a more pro-european direction .
commentators say kaczynski 's twin brother jaroslaw , who has called for the cross to stay in place , is possibly using the issue as a political weapon to gain support before the country 's parliamentary elections in 2011 .

analysts say the government needs to find a less hard-line approach . the battle between the thai government and the opposition red shirts , who support former president thaksin shinawatra , that took over the streets of bangkok earlier this year came to an end on may 19 when troops dispersed the crowds . the violence and bloodshed left some 90 people dead and more than 1,400 injured .
now the battlefront has changed with attacks against the government continuing on thai and english-language websites .
however , making use of the computer crime act and the emergency decree , the government has recently shut down thousands of websites , which have been critical of the administration and the royal family . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the past state control of the media has been limited to criticism of the thai king bhumibol adulyadej " we have been implementing regulations on communication systems , based on national security like in many countries , " panitan wattanayagorn , the thai government spokesman , recently explained . " we regulate these activities in such a way that they do not harm our national interests .
specific activities may not be allowed on those websites . "
government control of media has shifted focus in the past , most government control of the media and the internet has been related to the royal family . however , media activist supinya klanarong says there has been a shift in focus since the protests . " after the conflict and the state of emergency , censorship has been extended to politics as well .
this means general opposition websites related to the red shirt movement or critics of the government are also being blocked . " pro-red shirt website blocked one news website that has been blocked several times this year is prachatai.com.
red shirt supporters had discussed the protests openly on its discussion board .
however , the government only succeeded in shutting the site down temporarily , with the website circumventing the government controls by changing its server and by using another url .
prachatai.com 's director , chiranuch premchaporn , who has been charged under the computer crimes act , says the discussion board was shut down in july .
she says there is a need to balance the interests of writers and the government . " even if i believe in freedom of expression , i understand there should be some limitations .
we should set up a system to moderate content that can be considered to violate the rights of the people or the law . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 100 people were killed in political violence in may legal reform needed chris baker , an author and commentator on thai politics and business calls for " a cooperative framework in which all the parties are involved .
instead the government is using various forms of rather draconian legislation – the computer crimes act , the emergency decree .
at present , this is being rather inflammatory because people do n't like being closed down in this way .
and it 's also relatively ineffective . "
media groups are warning that intimidating web users and closing down sites may backfire against the government and lead to a radicalization of those who post comments online . chris baker says legal reform is needed to overcome the problem and to " control things in a permanent way as it 's very unsatisfactory for all sides at the moment .

as berlin remembers the event , new figures suggest more people than previously thought were killed on the inner german border from 1961-1989 . berlin commemorated on friday the 49th anniversary of the day the east german government began building the berlin wall . a memorial service was held at the chapel of reconciliation in the former death strip .
mayor klaus wowereit laid a wreath at the bernauer strasse memorial , in remembrance of those who were killed by gdr border guards . " it teaches us a lesson , " wowereit said .
" time and again , it is important to stand decisively against authoritarian regimes and dictatorships . " he urged that the memory of the berlin wall must sharpen appreciation of contemporary freedom and democracy . among a number of services held in berlin on friday , a street is to be renamed in memory of chris gueffroy , recognized as the last person killed trying to cross the border . greater number killed according to the official site that commemorates the berlin wall in the district of mitte , at least 136 people were killed by the east german border patrol while trying to escape from east to west berlin between 1961 and 1989 . but that 's not the whole story .
new figures from the privately-run wall museum , located at the former checkpoint charlie border crossing in berlin , say the total number of people who died trying to escape from east to west germany during those 28 years is 1,393 . " the number has risen by 46 compared with our research last year , " alexandra hildebrandt , chairwoman of the wall museum told deutsche welle . " the list includes those who died at the berlin wall , the baltic sea , the inner german border and neighboring countries like poland , bulgaria , czechoslovakia and hungary .
it also includes east german soldiers , for example those who committed suicide because they could n't deal with the regime , " she said . bildunterschrift : the wall became the symbol of the cold war tragic deaths one of those soldiers , whose suicide has only just come to light , took his own life just hours after construction on the wall had started .
" i cried all night when i read this , " hildebrandt said .
" he shot himself and left his wife a note saying : ' i ca n't do this anymore , i 'm too weak , forgive me , it 's better that way ' . "
in the early hours of august 13 , 1961 , the east german government took the west by surprise and ordered its army and police to stop all travel between east and west berlin and start work on the wall that would divide berlin until 1989 .
even the us secret service did not know of the project .
two months earlier , the east german leader walter ulbricht , head of the east german communist party -lrb- sed -rrb- , openly denied rumors that such a project was underway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germany had denied it was planning to build a wall on august 24 that year , just 11 days after the work on the wall had started , the first person was shot dead trying to escape .
guenter liftin 's murder shocked the world , but erich honecker , who was head of security then and would later become east germany 's leader and head of the sed , remained defiant .
" the building of the anti-fascist protective barrier stabilized the situation in europe and secured peace , " he said a desperate act in reality , the east german regime was in crisis .
by 1961 , 2.7 million people had decided to leave the country and live in the west .
communist ideology was starting to lose its luster , damaging the economy in the process .
in his famous ' ich bin ein berliner ' speech in 1963 in west berlin , then us president john f. kennedy described the berlin wall as " the most vivid and obvious demonstration of the failures of the communist system . "
today , 21 years after the wall came down , many are still afraid to talk about their own or their relatives ' experiences .
" they are still afraid , they are dominated by fear , possibly their whole lives , because the gdr was a dictatorship .
it was like a big prison , where people were afraid to talk , afraid to live , essentially , " hildebrandt told deutsche welle .
honecker firmly believed the wall would stand for 50 or even 100 years .
but the east german regime was powerless against the will of its people and a reform-oriented soviet union , which eventually , led to the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 .

meanwhile , authorities have said radiation levels have not increased despite wildfires reaching chernobyl-affected areas . russia is starting to deal more effectively with the wildfires which have been ravishing its western regions , senior government officials said on thursday . vladimir stepanov , head of the national crisis center , told russia 's interfax news agency that the area of burning land had gotten smaller in the last 24 hours , and there had been less fires with 562 fires covering around 80,000 hectares -lrb- 197,684 acres -rrb- of forest and peat land , the number of fires was down more than 10 percent from wednesday . officials also said environmental radiation levels had not shown any increase despite fires hitting areas contaminated by the 1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster . " a worsening of the radiation situation and a growth in the background radiation as a result of a transfer of materials from the fires have not been recorded anywhere in russia , " valery dyadyuchenko , the deputy head of russian state weather forecaster rosgidromet , told interfax . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fires are perilously close to the outer fence of the sarov nuclear facility russia ’ s state forest watchdog admitted on wednesday that fires had reached contaminated parts of the western bryansk region , sparking fears that radioactive particles would be released into the air . strong winds on thursday released moscow from the thick smog which has clouded its skies for much of the last week .
the number of fires close to the capital fell by more than a quarter in one day , as emergency services stepped up their firefighting efforts , flooding peat bogs around the city . nuclear sites still in danger more than 3,400 firefighters are battling to douse wildfires close to russia 's leading nuclear research facility in sarov , a town in the nizhny novgorod province . a spokesman for the emergencies ministry confirmed that two special firefighting trains , with large amounts of water and high-pressure hoses , had been sent to aid efforts at the site . no blazes had been recorded at the research center itself , but a nearby nature reserve has been on fire for the last week .
two soldiers were killed while trying to put out a nearby fire on monday . ukrainian authorities have played down fears over a two-hectare peat bog fire burning just 60 kilometers -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- south of the chernobyl site . " the fire presents no danger , " said viktoria ruban , spokeswoman for the ukrainian emergency situations ministry .
" there is no threat . " the fire started on august 9 , and is expected to be extinguished on thursday or friday , ruban added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : record temperatures and minimal rainfall have left parched fields prone to fires end not yet in sight environmentalists and nuclear experts have suggested that forest fires on contaminated land could result in radioactive particles blowing across central europe . " the particles could be transferred hundreds of kilometers depending on the weather conditions , " said alexei yablokov , a founder of greenpeace in the soviet union . but germany 's federal office for radiation protection played down fears of germany or western europe being affected . the smog which has covered moscow could well return this weekend , with weather forecasts predicting hot and dry conditions , and no rain in sight . monitoring officials have said this is russia ’ s hottest summer in a millennium .
at least 54 people have been killed by wildfires in the last weeks . author : thomas sheldrick -lrb- afp / dpa -rrb- editor : martin kuebler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 12.08.2010 east germany was ready to attack west berlin , documentary says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eerie place of cold war confrontation - checkpoint charlie in the divided berlin a film aired on german television on thursday revealed how serious east germany was about taking control of west berlin .
plans for a military attack existed right up to the end of the regime . through the decades of berlin 's division , many west berliners had an inkling that east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- that surrounded their part of the city would at some stage be seeking to conquer it .
a tv documentary , " der fall x " -lrb- the case of x -rrb- , shown by germany 's public broadcaster rbb finally proved them right .
in the most comprehensive footage on east germany 's conquest plans so far , two filmmakers , supported by military experts , tell a fascinating story about how the defunct state planned to overrun west berlin in only three days .
" as far as we can tell , the planning was quite serious , " german military historian winfried heinemann told deutsche welle .
" but whether they would have managed to take the city within three days is another question . "
superior numbers heinemann pointed out that the western allies were quite serious about defending west berlin from a ground attack .
but he acknowledged that next to nothing was known about any defense strategies as the relevant documents are still classified .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahr knew that west berlin was never really a safe place egon bahr , a former west berlin radio commentator and later adviser to west german chancellor willy brandt , argued that the gdr 's national people 's army troops , and those of the soviet union deployed in the region , would have outnumbered the soldiers from the western allies by far .
" in the event of an attack , our defenses could have been maintained for no more than five to seven hours , " bahr concluded .
the plans found in the files of the east german secret police , the gdr army and the soviet military command reveal some details as to how the attackers would have gone about their job .
a detailed map available to the filmmakers showed the most important installations and infrastructure compounds in west berlin , which would have been targeted first .
among them were strategically important bridges that the french , british and us allies used to move around as well as airports and train stations .
a second phase of the operation would have included the imprisonment of leading west berlin politicians , policemen , public servants and journalists .
a corresponding list of names was updated by the gdr leadership several times until the collapse of the regime in 1989 .
a diehard obsession the research done by military historian winfried heinemann also revealed that plans to attack west berlin were , surprisingly , only developed fully in the early 1970s - a time when political relations between the two german states were in the process of improving considerably .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr soldiers trained for an attack as late as 1988 " whether it was just a question of the gdr military having grown up enough to feel fit for the job - we do n't really know , " said heinemann .
" but considering that the whole military posture of the gdr was kept up right until 1989 , it 's at least no surprise that the planning for an attack went on until the very end . "
in fact , east germany 's national people 's army -lrb- nva -rrb- carried out military maneuvers as late as 1988 to train for the takeover of west berlin .
exercises took place in the east german town of magdeburg some 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- west of berlin .
the training ground was designed to look as if the target territory were divided up between a french , british and us brigade , which reflected the fact the west berlin was seperated into sectors occupied by those three countries .
one year later , the berlin wall fell , and east german intelligence managed to destroy most of the documents regarding the gdr 's hostile intentions toward west berlin .

plans for a military attack existed right up to the end of the regime . through the decades of berlin 's division , many west berliners had an inkling that east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- that surrounded their part of the city would at some stage be seeking to conquer it .
a tv documentary , " der fall x " -lrb- the case of x -rrb- , shown by germany 's public broadcaster rbb finally proved them right .
in the most comprehensive footage on east germany 's conquest plans so far , two filmmakers , supported by military experts , tell a fascinating story about how the defunct state planned to overrun west berlin in only three days .
" as far as we can tell , the planning was quite serious , " german military historian winfried heinemann told deutsche welle .
" but whether they would have managed to take the city within three days is another question . "
superior numbers heinemann pointed out that the western allies were quite serious about defending west berlin from a ground attack .
but he acknowledged that next to nothing was known about any defense strategies as the relevant documents are still classified .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahr knew that west berlin was never really a safe place egon bahr , a former west berlin radio commentator and later adviser to west german chancellor willy brandt , argued that the gdr 's national people 's army troops , and those of the soviet union deployed in the region , would have outnumbered the soldiers from the western allies by far .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 12.08.2010 second-stringers give loew food for thought ahead of euro qualifiers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew saw some things he liked but others he clearly did n't with the qualifying stage for the 2012 european championships beginning in september , a number of second-string stars were looking to impress germany coach joachim loew during wednesday 's friendly draw in denmark . for 74 minutes in copenhagen , it looked as though joachim loew had become one of those blessed coaches whose talent pool is such that he can throw a second string of players onto a pitch and get the same type of performance and result as he would have expected his a-listers to produce .
this was a germany team shorn of almost all of its world cup stars and filled with debutants , cameo performers and bit-part players charged with taking on a denmark team smarting from a hugely forgettable summer in south africa .
the danes , while introducing a few unknowns in the hope of kick-starting a new era , still had a number of experienced players on show and with a home crowd behind them , they may have been expected to give germany 's reserves a torrid time .
but despite never playing together as a full team before and in a formation rarely used by loew , the german players slowly started to look comfortable in each other 's company and for the majority of the game , they appeared in little danger of leaving copenhagen without a victory .
while loew is unlikely to ever field this team again or play his regular starters in this tactical shape , a number of players will have improved their chances of joining the first team for the upcoming euro 2012 qualifiers and perhaps the european championships themselves in poland and ukraine in two years time .
der hammer returns to form with added nuances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal one performance that will have given the germany coach food for though was that of thomas hitzlsperger .
given the captain 's armband in the absence of warring skippers philipp lahm and michael ballack , hitzlsperger 's inclusion as germany 's leader in the centre of midfield was just reward for der hammer after fighting back from a severe loss of form .
after losing confidence and his touch at vfb stuttgart – and his place in the germany team – hitzlsperger 's transfer to lazio in january could have been the moment he dropped off germany 's radar .
but despite being overlooked for the world cup , hitzlsperger – now with west ham in the english premiership – has shown the hunger to come back and has recaptured his form .
there was plenty of the marauding midfield work of old but a season in serie a 's less frenetic atmosphere appears to have refined parts of hitzlsperger 's game which contributed to some considering him a blunt instrument .
it was a delicately feigned shot followed by a deft , penetrating pass into the penalty area on 19 minutes that set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal and until he was replaced in the second half , hitzlsperger was a worthy stand-in for bastian schweinsteiger in the conductor 's role .
gentner 's craft catches the eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former wolfsburg star gentner made a good impression playing off hitzlsperger was another player who should have done enough to convince jogi loew to continue his freshening-up of the germany team .
germany 's midfield showed no signs of suffering from the loss of ballack in south africa , and with toni kroos also showing in copenhagen why he could soon be a first team regular , one might think it overly optimistic to think that christian gentner may force his way into the national team 's starting line-up .
while hitzlsperger will certainly give loew a new option in defensive midfield , gentner put on a performance that could see him challenging for a role in the creative trio the germany coach normally deploys behind his lone striker .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder was a livewire throughout .
gentner was mobile , showed great vision and provided a number of killer passes .
drifting across the pitch behind mario gomez and patrick helmes , gentner was consistently probing the danish defensive line .
it was his perfectly timed pass which led to germany 's second goal .
receiving a great pass from jerome boateng on the edge of the area , gentner held the ball up long enough for helmes to time his run before threading a pass between the center-backs and onto helmes ' boot .
the bayer leverkusen striker did the rest .
stand-in strikers score but leave much to be desired bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmes needs the composure he shows with leverkusen helmes , who missed the world cup through injury after a good season with leverkusen , showed signs that he could be a worthy understudy to miroslav klose in the germany attack but the frequency and ease of the opportunities he wasted suggested that he needs more composure at this level and will certainly remain behind klose and thomas mueller in the attacking pecking order in the euro qualifiers .
but gomez , his well taken goal aside , played in a way that only reinforced the opinion that he must have some incriminating photos of his coach in a vault somewhere .
only someone with some nefarious hold over the man who picks the team can continue to get a game when he plays so abjectly .
even in a second-string team , gomez rarely justified his inclusion as an international striker .
elsewhere , there were encouraging signs that christian traesch could make good on his potential and challenge for a consistent role in midfield while toni kroos and marko marin – building on their cameo performances at the world cup – will certainly feature in the euro qualifiers and would be good bets to see increased action at the 2012 tournament .
despite his woeful pass which led to dennis rommedahl pulling a goal back just a minute after helmes put germany 2-0 up , defender serdar tasci had a competent game at left back until that mistake wrecked his confidence .
on the other side of defence , sascha reither was also solid until the final 15 minutes ; although it is unlikely he will ever unseat philipp lahm in the starting line-up .
the makeshift german defence as a whole battled well until the 74th minute when rommedahl 's goal gave denmark belief and shattered that of germany 's back four .
wiese 's strong showing in goal tarnished by late blunder with their two-goal lead slashed in half , germany looked rattled in defence and nervous in attack with gomez and helmes blowing gilt-edged chances to make the score 3-1 in the final ten minutes .
instead , denmark seized their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese kept denmark at bay until the final 15 minutes stand-in keeper tim wiese – who had an excellent game until his defense imploded in front of him – chose to rush out to deal with a dangerous through ball .
finding himself on the edge of his area , the werder bremen stopper was caught in two minds whether to use his hands , choosing instead to chest the ball to mads junker .
the danish striker knocked the ball round the stranded wiese before slotting it into an empty net to complete denmark 's comeback and the german collapse .
it was wiese 's first real mistake of the game but it was glaring one .
with rene adler returning from the injury that kept him from being the number one in south africa , and germany 's world cup keeper manuel neuer enhancing his reputation this summer , even without his 87th minute howler wiese faced an uphill struggle to make ground on his rivals .
it 's likely he 'll remain the third choice throughout the euro qualifiers and beyond .

this was a germany team shorn of almost all of its world cup stars and filled with debutants , cameo performers and bit-part players charged with taking on a denmark team smarting from a hugely forgettable summer in south africa .
the danes , while introducing a few unknowns in the hope of kick-starting a new era , still had a number of experienced players on show and with a home crowd behind them , they may have been expected to give germany 's reserves a torrid time .
but despite never playing together as a full team before and in a formation rarely used by loew , the german players slowly started to look comfortable in each other 's company and for the majority of the game , they appeared in little danger of leaving copenhagen without a victory .
while loew is unlikely to ever field this team again or play his regular starters in this tactical shape , a number of players will have improved their chances of joining the first team for the upcoming euro 2012 qualifiers and perhaps the european championships themselves in poland and ukraine in two years time .
der hammer returns to form with added nuances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal one performance that will have given the germany coach food for though was that of thomas hitzlsperger .
given the captain 's armband in the absence of warring skippers philipp lahm and michael ballack , hitzlsperger 's inclusion as germany 's leader in the centre of midfield was just reward for der hammer after fighting back from a severe loss of form .
after losing confidence and his touch at vfb stuttgart – and his place in the germany team – hitzlsperger 's transfer to lazio in january could have been the moment he dropped off germany 's radar .
but despite being overlooked for the world cup , hitzlsperger – now with west ham in the english premiership – has shown the hunger to come back and has recaptured his form .
there was plenty of the marauding midfield work of old but a season in serie a 's less frenetic atmosphere appears to have refined parts of hitzlsperger 's game which contributed to some considering him a blunt instrument .
it was a delicately feigned shot followed by a deft , penetrating pass into the penalty area on 19 minutes that set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal and until he was replaced in the second half , hitzlsperger was a worthy stand-in for bastian schweinsteiger in the conductor 's role .
gentner 's craft catches the eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former wolfsburg star gentner made a good impression playing off hitzlsperger was another player who should have done enough to convince jogi loew to continue his freshening-up of the germany team .
germany 's midfield showed no signs of suffering from the loss of ballack in south africa , and with toni kroos also showing in copenhagen why he could soon be a first team regular , one might think it overly optimistic to think that christian gentner may force his way into the national team 's starting line-up .
while hitzlsperger will certainly give loew a new option in defensive midfield , gentner put on a performance that could see him challenging for a role in the creative trio the germany coach normally deploys behind his lone striker .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder was a livewire throughout .
gentner was mobile , showed great vision and provided a number of killer passes .
drifting across the pitch behind mario gomez and patrick helmes , gentner was consistently probing the danish defensive line .
it was his perfectly timed pass which led to germany 's second goal .
receiving a great pass from jerome boateng on the edge of the area , gentner held the ball up long enough for helmes to time his run before threading a pass between the center-backs and onto helmes ' boot .
the bayer leverkusen striker did the rest .
stand-in strikers score but leave much to be desired bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmes needs the composure he shows with leverkusen helmes , who missed the world cup through injury after a good season with leverkusen , showed signs that he could be a worthy understudy to miroslav klose in the germany attack but the frequency and ease of the opportunities he wasted suggested that he needs more composure at this level and will certainly remain behind klose and thomas mueller in the attacking pecking order in the euro qualifiers .
but gomez , his well taken goal aside , played in a way that only reinforced the opinion that he must have some incriminating photos of his coach in a vault somewhere .
only someone with some nefarious hold over the man who picks the team can continue to get a game when he plays so abjectly .
even in a second-string team , gomez rarely justified his inclusion as an international striker .
elsewhere , there were encouraging signs that christian traesch could make good on his potential and challenge for a consistent role in midfield while toni kroos and marko marin – building on their cameo performances at the world cup – will certainly feature in the euro qualifiers and would be good bets to see increased action at the 2012 tournament .
despite his woeful pass which led to dennis rommedahl pulling a goal back just a minute after helmes put germany 2-0 up , defender serdar tasci had a competent game at left back until that mistake wrecked his confidence .
on the other side of defence , sascha reither was also solid until the final 15 minutes ; although it is unlikely he will ever unseat philipp lahm in the starting line-up .
the makeshift german defence as a whole battled well until the 74th minute when rommedahl 's goal gave denmark belief and shattered that of germany 's back four .
wiese 's strong showing in goal tarnished by late blunder with their two-goal lead slashed in half , germany looked rattled in defence and nervous in attack with gomez and helmes blowing gilt-edged chances to make the score 3-1 in the final ten minutes .
instead , denmark seized their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese kept denmark at bay until the final 15 minutes stand-in keeper tim wiese – who had an excellent game until his defense imploded in front of him – chose to rush out to deal with a dangerous through ball .
finding himself on the edge of his area , the werder bremen stopper was caught in two minds whether to use his hands , choosing instead to chest the ball to mads junker .
the danish striker knocked the ball round the stranded wiese before slotting it into an empty net to complete denmark 's comeback and the german collapse .
it was wiese 's first real mistake of the game but it was glaring one .
with rene adler returning from the injury that kept him from being the number one in south africa , and germany 's world cup keeper manuel neuer enhancing his reputation this summer , even without his 87th minute howler wiese faced an uphill struggle to make ground on his rivals .
it 's likely he 'll remain the third choice throughout the euro qualifiers and beyond .

as berlin remembers the event , new figures suggest more people than previously thought were killed on the inner german border from 1961-1989 . berlin commemorated on friday the 49th anniversary of the day the east german government began building the berlin wall . a memorial service was held at the chapel of reconciliation in the former death strip .
mayor klaus wowereit laid a wreath at the bernauer strasse memorial , in remembrance of those who were killed by gdr border guards . " it teaches us a lesson , " wowereit said .
" time and again , it is important to stand decisively against authoritarian regimes and dictatorships . " he urged that the memory of the berlin wall must sharpen appreciation of contemporary freedom and democracy . among a number of services held in berlin on friday , a street is to be renamed in memory of chris gueffroy , recognized as the last person killed trying to cross the border . greater number killed according to the official site that commemorates the berlin wall in the district of mitte , at least 136 people were killed by the east german border patrol while trying to escape from east to west berlin between 1961 and 1989 . but that 's not the whole story .
new figures from the privately-run wall museum , located at the former checkpoint charlie border crossing in berlin , say the total number of people who died trying to escape from east to west germany during those 28 years is 1,393 . " the number has risen by 46 compared with our research last year , " alexandra hildebrandt , chairwoman of the wall museum told deutsche welle .

as berlin remembers the event , new figures suggest more people than previously thought were killed on the inner german border from 1961-1989 . berlin commemorated on friday the 49th anniversary of the day the east german government began building the berlin wall . a memorial service was held at the chapel of reconciliation in the former death strip .

" time and again , it is important to stand decisively against authoritarian regimes and dictatorships . " he urged that the memory of the berlin wall must sharpen appreciation of contemporary freedom and democracy . among a number of services held in berlin on friday , a street is to be renamed in memory of chris gueffroy , recognized as the last person killed trying to cross the border . greater number killed according to the official site that commemorates the berlin wall in the district of mitte , at least 136 people were killed by the east german border patrol while trying to escape from east to west berlin between 1961 and 1989 . but that 's not the whole story .
new figures from the privately-run wall museum , located at the former checkpoint charlie border crossing in berlin , say the total number of people who died trying to escape from east to west germany during those 28 years is 1,393 . " the number has risen by 46 compared with our research last year , " alexandra hildebrandt , chairwoman of the wall museum told deutsche welle .

" i cried all night when i read this , " hildebrandt said .
" he shot himself and left his wife a note saying : ' i ca n't do this anymore , i 'm too weak , forgive me , it 's better that way ' . "
in the early hours of august 13 , 1961 , the east german government took the west by surprise and ordered its army and police to stop all travel between east and west berlin and start work on the wall that would divide berlin until 1989 .
even the us secret service did not know of the project .
two months earlier , the east german leader walter ulbricht , head of the east german communist party -lrb- sed -rrb- , openly denied rumors that such a project was underway .

guenter liftin 's murder shocked the world , but erich honecker , who was head of security then and would later become east germany 's leader and head of the sed , remained defiant .
" the building of the anti-fascist protective barrier stabilized the situation in europe and secured peace , " he said a desperate act in reality , the east german regime was in crisis .
by 1961 , 2.7 million people had decided to leave the country and live in the west .

it was like a big prison , where people were afraid to talk , afraid to live , essentially , " hildebrandt told deutsche welle .
honecker firmly believed the wall would stand for 50 or even 100 years .
but the east german regime was powerless against the will of its people and a reform-oriented soviet union , which eventually , led to the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 12.08.2010 second-stringers give loew food for thought ahead of euro qualifiers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew saw some things he liked but others he clearly did n't with the qualifying stage for the 2012 european championships beginning in september , a number of second-string stars were looking to impress germany coach joachim loew during wednesday 's friendly draw in denmark . for 74 minutes in copenhagen , it looked as though joachim loew had become one of those blessed coaches whose talent pool is such that he can throw a second string of players onto a pitch and get the same type of performance and result as he would have expected his a-listers to produce .
this was a germany team shorn of almost all of its world cup stars and filled with debutants , cameo performers and bit-part players charged with taking on a denmark team smarting from a hugely forgettable summer in south africa .
the danes , while introducing a few unknowns in the hope of kick-starting a new era , still had a number of experienced players on show and with a home crowd behind them , they may have been expected to give germany 's reserves a torrid time .
but despite never playing together as a full team before and in a formation rarely used by loew , the german players slowly started to look comfortable in each other 's company and for the majority of the game , they appeared in little danger of leaving copenhagen without a victory .
while loew is unlikely to ever field this team again or play his regular starters in this tactical shape , a number of players will have improved their chances of joining the first team for the upcoming euro 2012 qualifiers and perhaps the european championships themselves in poland and ukraine in two years time .
der hammer returns to form with added nuances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal one performance that will have given the germany coach food for though was that of thomas hitzlsperger .
given the captain 's armband in the absence of warring skippers philipp lahm and michael ballack , hitzlsperger 's inclusion as germany 's leader in the centre of midfield was just reward for der hammer after fighting back from a severe loss of form .
after losing confidence and his touch at vfb stuttgart – and his place in the germany team – hitzlsperger 's transfer to lazio in january could have been the moment he dropped off germany 's radar .
but despite being overlooked for the world cup , hitzlsperger – now with west ham in the english premiership – has shown the hunger to come back and has recaptured his form .
there was plenty of the marauding midfield work of old but a season in serie a 's less frenetic atmosphere appears to have refined parts of hitzlsperger 's game which contributed to some considering him a blunt instrument .
it was a delicately feigned shot followed by a deft , penetrating pass into the penalty area on 19 minutes that set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal and until he was replaced in the second half , hitzlsperger was a worthy stand-in for bastian schweinsteiger in the conductor 's role .
gentner 's craft catches the eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former wolfsburg star gentner made a good impression playing off hitzlsperger was another player who should have done enough to convince jogi loew to continue his freshening-up of the germany team .
germany 's midfield showed no signs of suffering from the loss of ballack in south africa , and with toni kroos also showing in copenhagen why he could soon be a first team regular , one might think it overly optimistic to think that christian gentner may force his way into the national team 's starting line-up .
while hitzlsperger will certainly give loew a new option in defensive midfield , gentner put on a performance that could see him challenging for a role in the creative trio the germany coach normally deploys behind his lone striker .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder was a livewire throughout .
gentner was mobile , showed great vision and provided a number of killer passes .
drifting across the pitch behind mario gomez and patrick helmes , gentner was consistently probing the danish defensive line .
it was his perfectly timed pass which led to germany 's second goal .
receiving a great pass from jerome boateng on the edge of the area , gentner held the ball up long enough for helmes to time his run before threading a pass between the center-backs and onto helmes ' boot .
the bayer leverkusen striker did the rest .
stand-in strikers score but leave much to be desired bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmes needs the composure he shows with leverkusen helmes , who missed the world cup through injury after a good season with leverkusen , showed signs that he could be a worthy understudy to miroslav klose in the germany attack but the frequency and ease of the opportunities he wasted suggested that he needs more composure at this level and will certainly remain behind klose and thomas mueller in the attacking pecking order in the euro qualifiers .
but gomez , his well taken goal aside , played in a way that only reinforced the opinion that he must have some incriminating photos of his coach in a vault somewhere .
only someone with some nefarious hold over the man who picks the team can continue to get a game when he plays so abjectly .
even in a second-string team , gomez rarely justified his inclusion as an international striker .
elsewhere , there were encouraging signs that christian traesch could make good on his potential and challenge for a consistent role in midfield while toni kroos and marko marin – building on their cameo performances at the world cup – will certainly feature in the euro qualifiers and would be good bets to see increased action at the 2012 tournament .
despite his woeful pass which led to dennis rommedahl pulling a goal back just a minute after helmes put germany 2-0 up , defender serdar tasci had a competent game at left back until that mistake wrecked his confidence .
on the other side of defence , sascha reither was also solid until the final 15 minutes ; although it is unlikely he will ever unseat philipp lahm in the starting line-up .
the makeshift german defence as a whole battled well until the 74th minute when rommedahl 's goal gave denmark belief and shattered that of germany 's back four .
wiese 's strong showing in goal tarnished by late blunder with their two-goal lead slashed in half , germany looked rattled in defence and nervous in attack with gomez and helmes blowing gilt-edged chances to make the score 3-1 in the final ten minutes .
instead , denmark seized their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese kept denmark at bay until the final 15 minutes stand-in keeper tim wiese – who had an excellent game until his defense imploded in front of him – chose to rush out to deal with a dangerous through ball .
finding himself on the edge of his area , the werder bremen stopper was caught in two minds whether to use his hands , choosing instead to chest the ball to mads junker .
the danish striker knocked the ball round the stranded wiese before slotting it into an empty net to complete denmark 's comeback and the german collapse .
it was wiese 's first real mistake of the game but it was glaring one .
with rene adler returning from the injury that kept him from being the number one in south africa , and germany 's world cup keeper manuel neuer enhancing his reputation this summer , even without his 87th minute howler wiese faced an uphill struggle to make ground on his rivals .
it 's likely he 'll remain the third choice throughout the euro qualifiers and beyond .

secularists demand it be taken away from the presidential palace . supporters of late polish president lech kaczynski 's law and justice party have remained defiant in their vigil at the site of a cross erected in memory of their late hero - despite calls from church leaders to allow its removal .
those loyal to the former president see him as defender of polish roman catholic values and say that the cross should remain outside the presidential palace in a warsaw square until a more permanent structure is found for the site .
church officials have said that it is time for supporters to give up the fight - warning that they are being manipulated for political , not religious , reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secularists say the palace is not the place for a cross " to all those who pray at the cross we must say that - despite their good intentions - they are being exploited for political purposes .
we urge everyone to make the transfer of the cross possible , " press secretary for the polish episcopate , bishop stanislaw budzik , told reporters in warsaw on thursday .
the palace , now occupied by president bronislaw komorowski , unveiled a plaque on thursday commemorating the tragedy on the facade of a side-wing to the building .
a first attempt to move the cross - initially to a church in the old part of the city and later to a shrine in the south of the country - met with fierce opposition on august 3 .
both the church and the scout group that first erected the four-meter -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- wooden cross had agreed to the plan .
facebook campaign and rally but opposition is mounting to the cross staying in place .

the cross was spontaneously erected after the april 10 crash of the presidential plane in western russia , killing the president , his wife and 94 others .
as well as highlighting religious divisions , the row is indicative of the political tensions currently simmering in the country .
some critics of former president kaczynski were unhappy with his right-wing politics and traditional approach to family values .
opponents also say his nationalist and euroskeptic policies placed poland on an isolationist course within the european union .
current president komorowski is expected to take the country in a more pro-european direction .
commentators say kaczynski 's twin brother jaroslaw , who has called for the cross to stay in place , is possibly using the issue as a political weapon to gain support before the country 's parliamentary elections in 2011 .

secularists demand it be taken away from the presidential palace . supporters of late polish president lech kaczynski 's law and justice party have remained defiant in their vigil at the site of a cross erected in memory of their late hero - despite calls from church leaders to allow its removal .
those loyal to the former president see him as defender of polish roman catholic values and say that the cross should remain outside the presidential palace in a warsaw square until a more permanent structure is found for the site .
church officials have said that it is time for supporters to give up the fight - warning that they are being manipulated for political , not religious , reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secularists say the palace is not the place for a cross " to all those who pray at the cross we must say that - despite their good intentions - they are being exploited for political purposes .
we urge everyone to make the transfer of the cross possible , " press secretary for the polish episcopate , bishop stanislaw budzik , told reporters in warsaw on thursday .
the palace , now occupied by president bronislaw komorowski , unveiled a plaque on thursday commemorating the tragedy on the facade of a side-wing to the building .
a first attempt to move the cross - initially to a church in the old part of the city and later to a shrine in the south of the country - met with fierce opposition on august 3 .
both the church and the scout group that first erected the four-meter -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- wooden cross had agreed to the plan .
facebook campaign and rally but opposition is mounting to the cross staying in place .
secularists - many of them younger , and opposed to the policies of the former president - rallied on monday in response to a facebook campaign to have the cross removed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some think jaroslaw kaczynski is using the dispute for political capital by midnight , several thousand had gathered in front of the presidential palace chanting the slogan , " to a church ! "
the cross was spontaneously erected after the april 10 crash of the presidential plane in western russia , killing the president , his wife and 94 others .
as well as highlighting religious divisions , the row is indicative of the political tensions currently simmering in the country .
some critics of former president kaczynski were unhappy with his right-wing politics and traditional approach to family values .
opponents also say his nationalist and euroskeptic policies placed poland on an isolationist course within the european union .
current president komorowski is expected to take the country in a more pro-european direction .
commentators say kaczynski 's twin brother jaroslaw , who has called for the cross to stay in place , is possibly using the issue as a political weapon to gain support before the country 's parliamentary elections in 2011 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 12.08.2010 un labor report shows drastic increase in youth unemployment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more young people around the world are unemployed the international labor organization says global youth unemployment has reached record levels .
over 80 million 15 to 24-year-olds are without work , the report said , with increases in developed countries most extreme . according to a united nations report released on thursday , labor market trends for young people have taken a drastic turn for the worse since 2007 , when global youth unemployment remained fairly stagnant .
for the 10 years prior to the economic crisis , the report noted the number of unemployed youth around the world had increased by an average of 200,000 per year .
in 2009 , however , youth unemployment increased by a staggering 6.7 million .
sara elder , an economist with the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- and co-author of the report , says youth unemployment is most severe in the developed economies and non-eu , central and southeastern europe .
" in these two regions alone , we saw the highest annual increases that we have ever seen for any region since we began observing the trend in 1991 .
overall , the youth unemployment rate of 17.7 percent in developed economies also marks the highest we have ever seen , " elder told deutsche welle . eu governments looking to fend off hopelessness the report finds young women are hardest hit by unemployment in most regions .
the only exceptions are in the developed economies and the european union , where nearly twice as many males as females are unemployed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's apprentice system keeps most youths busy in the european union , germany displayed the lowest rate of youth unemployment .
around 8 percent of all germans between 16 and 24 looking for a job are out of work .
this is based most of all on the country 's apprentice system , in which companies offer three-year training positions to young germans regardless of education level .
this is a great contrast to the situation in other eu states such as estonia , latvia and lithuania , which according to the ilo report had the highest rates of youth unemployment in the 27-nation bloc .
in other developed eu countries , such as spain and the united kingdom , elder said many unemployed youth have become so discouraged that they are no longer even looking for work .
" governments everywhere are struggling to prevent a situation in which young people detach themselves completely from the labor market , having lost all hope of being able to provide themselves with a decent living .
unemployment is more a concern for developed economies than developing economies , " she said .
drastic unemployment in developing countries while only 10 percent of the global youth labor force lives in developed economies , youth unemployment there increased by 45 percent last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unofficial jobs are most common in developing nations the report added that roughly 90 percent of the world 's young people are living in developing countries - where under-employment and poverty are two of the most prevalent and serious problems .
steven kapsos , an ilo economist and also a co-author of the report , told deutsche welle that unemployed young people in developing countries do n't receive any benefits . thus , they are left with no choice : " they are forced by necessity to work in the informal economy , where they will most likely remain for the rest of their lives . "
" we estimate that 152 million youth were classified as working ' poor ' in 2008 and that is based on the standard international poverty line of $ 1.25 -lrb- 0.77 euro -rrb- per day .
this accounts for some 28 percent of all young workers around the world , " kapsos added .
the ilo , meanwhile , forecasts slight improvements in youth unemployment for almost all of the world 's regions next year .
the largest decrease in youth unemployment is expected in central and southeastern europe and the states formerly belonging to the soviet union .

over 80 million 15 to 24-year-olds are without work , the report said , with increases in developed countries most extreme . according to a united nations report released on thursday , labor market trends for young people have taken a drastic turn for the worse since 2007 , when global youth unemployment remained fairly stagnant .
for the 10 years prior to the economic crisis , the report noted the number of unemployed youth around the world had increased by an average of 200,000 per year .
in 2009 , however , youth unemployment increased by a staggering 6.7 million .
sara elder , an economist with the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- and co-author of the report , says youth unemployment is most severe in the developed economies and non-eu , central and southeastern europe .
" in these two regions alone , we saw the highest annual increases that we have ever seen for any region since we began observing the trend in 1991 .
overall , the youth unemployment rate of 17.7 percent in developed economies also marks the highest we have ever seen , " elder told deutsche welle . eu governments looking to fend off hopelessness the report finds young women are hardest hit by unemployment in most regions .
the only exceptions are in the developed economies and the european union , where nearly twice as many males as females are unemployed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's apprentice system keeps most youths busy in the european union , germany displayed the lowest rate of youth unemployment .
around 8 percent of all germans between 16 and 24 looking for a job are out of work .
this is based most of all on the country 's apprentice system , in which companies offer three-year training positions to young germans regardless of education level .
this is a great contrast to the situation in other eu states such as estonia , latvia and lithuania , which according to the ilo report had the highest rates of youth unemployment in the 27-nation bloc .
in other developed eu countries , such as spain and the united kingdom , elder said many unemployed youth have become so discouraged that they are no longer even looking for work .
" governments everywhere are struggling to prevent a situation in which young people detach themselves completely from the labor market , having lost all hope of being able to provide themselves with a decent living .
unemployment is more a concern for developed economies than developing economies , " she said .
drastic unemployment in developing countries while only 10 percent of the global youth labor force lives in developed economies , youth unemployment there increased by 45 percent last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unofficial jobs are most common in developing nations the report added that roughly 90 percent of the world 's young people are living in developing countries - where under-employment and poverty are two of the most prevalent and serious problems .
steven kapsos , an ilo economist and also a co-author of the report , told deutsche welle that unemployed young people in developing countries do n't receive any benefits . thus , they are left with no choice : " they are forced by necessity to work in the informal economy , where they will most likely remain for the rest of their lives . "
" we estimate that 152 million youth were classified as working ' poor ' in 2008 and that is based on the standard international poverty line of $ 1.25 -lrb- 0.77 euro -rrb- per day .
this accounts for some 28 percent of all young workers around the world , " kapsos added .
the ilo , meanwhile , forecasts slight improvements in youth unemployment for almost all of the world 's regions next year .
the largest decrease in youth unemployment is expected in central and southeastern europe and the states formerly belonging to the soviet union .

the eu 's economic affairs commissioner hit out at bratislava for breaking a commitment . european union officials have accused the slovak government of breaching legal commitments , after it rejected participation in a bailout loan for greece .
the slovak parliament voted on wednesday to confirm the country 's refusal to participate in the lending package drawn up by the eu and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
slovakia was to commit 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1 million -rrb- to a 110-billion-euro fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn voiced concern that slovakia had gone back on its commitment eu economic affairs commissioner olli rehn described the decision as a " breach of the commitment undertaken by slovakia in the eurogroup , " and said that the finance ministers of all 27 eu members would " return to the matter in their next meeting " early in september .
the slovak parliament did , however , approve a potentially greater framework agreement on a 440-billion-euro loan mechanism aimed at stabilizing other member states that may need help in the future .
" it is somehow surprising because the underlying principle for both is exactly the same , " a spokesman for rehn 's office said .
rehn said that bratislava 's move would not prevent other countries from bailing out greece , as the loan has already been put in place alongside stiff austerity measures .
only two votes in favor the bill on bratislava 's participation in the eu rescue package gained only two approving votes amongst the parliamentarians present at wednesday 's session ; 69 deputies voted against participation , with 13 abstaining .

the eu 's economic affairs commissioner hit out at bratislava for breaking a commitment . european union officials have accused the slovak government of breaching legal commitments , after it rejected participation in a bailout loan for greece .
the slovak parliament voted on wednesday to confirm the country 's refusal to participate in the lending package drawn up by the eu and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
slovakia was to commit 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1 million -rrb- to a 110-billion-euro fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn voiced concern that slovakia had gone back on its commitment eu economic affairs commissioner olli rehn described the decision as a " breach of the commitment undertaken by slovakia in the eurogroup , " and said that the finance ministers of all 27 eu members would " return to the matter in their next meeting " early in september .
the slovak parliament did , however , approve a potentially greater framework agreement on a 440-billion-euro loan mechanism aimed at stabilizing other member states that may need help in the future .
" it is somehow surprising because the underlying principle for both is exactly the same , " a spokesman for rehn 's office said .
rehn said that bratislava 's move would not prevent other countries from bailing out greece , as the loan has already been put in place alongside stiff austerity measures .
only two votes in favor the bill on bratislava 's participation in the eu rescue package gained only two approving votes amongst the parliamentarians present at wednesday 's session ; 69 deputies voted against participation , with 13 abstaining .

the center-right government under prime minister iveta radicova then took power .
radicova had criticized greece 's " undisciplined budget policy " and sought to overturn the previous government 's decision .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 12.08.2010 un labor report shows drastic increase in youth unemployment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more young people around the world are unemployed the international labor organization says global youth unemployment has reached record levels .
over 80 million 15 to 24-year-olds are without work , the report said , with increases in developed countries most extreme . according to a united nations report released on thursday , labor market trends for young people have taken a drastic turn for the worse since 2007 , when global youth unemployment remained fairly stagnant .
for the 10 years prior to the economic crisis , the report noted the number of unemployed youth around the world had increased by an average of 200,000 per year .
in 2009 , however , youth unemployment increased by a staggering 6.7 million .
sara elder , an economist with the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- and co-author of the report , says youth unemployment is most severe in the developed economies and non-eu , central and southeastern europe .
" in these two regions alone , we saw the highest annual increases that we have ever seen for any region since we began observing the trend in 1991 .
overall , the youth unemployment rate of 17.7 percent in developed economies also marks the highest we have ever seen , " elder told deutsche welle . eu governments looking to fend off hopelessness the report finds young women are hardest hit by unemployment in most regions .
the only exceptions are in the developed economies and the european union , where nearly twice as many males as females are unemployed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's apprentice system keeps most youths busy in the european union , germany displayed the lowest rate of youth unemployment .
around 8 percent of all germans between 16 and 24 looking for a job are out of work .
this is based most of all on the country 's apprentice system , in which companies offer three-year training positions to young germans regardless of education level .
this is a great contrast to the situation in other eu states such as estonia , latvia and lithuania , which according to the ilo report had the highest rates of youth unemployment in the 27-nation bloc .
in other developed eu countries , such as spain and the united kingdom , elder said many unemployed youth have become so discouraged that they are no longer even looking for work .
" governments everywhere are struggling to prevent a situation in which young people detach themselves completely from the labor market , having lost all hope of being able to provide themselves with a decent living .
unemployment is more a concern for developed economies than developing economies , " she said .
drastic unemployment in developing countries while only 10 percent of the global youth labor force lives in developed economies , youth unemployment there increased by 45 percent last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unofficial jobs are most common in developing nations the report added that roughly 90 percent of the world 's young people are living in developing countries - where under-employment and poverty are two of the most prevalent and serious problems .
steven kapsos , an ilo economist and also a co-author of the report , told deutsche welle that unemployed young people in developing countries do n't receive any benefits . thus , they are left with no choice : " they are forced by necessity to work in the informal economy , where they will most likely remain for the rest of their lives . "
" we estimate that 152 million youth were classified as working ' poor ' in 2008 and that is based on the standard international poverty line of $ 1.25 -lrb- 0.77 euro -rrb- per day .
this accounts for some 28 percent of all young workers around the world , " kapsos added .
the ilo , meanwhile , forecasts slight improvements in youth unemployment for almost all of the world 's regions next year .
the largest decrease in youth unemployment is expected in central and southeastern europe and the states formerly belonging to the soviet union .

plans for a military attack existed right up to the end of the regime . through the decades of berlin 's division , many west berliners had an inkling that east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- that surrounded their part of the city would at some stage be seeking to conquer it .
a tv documentary , " der fall x " -lrb- the case of x -rrb- , shown by germany 's public broadcaster rbb finally proved them right .
in the most comprehensive footage on east germany 's conquest plans so far , two filmmakers , supported by military experts , tell a fascinating story about how the defunct state planned to overrun west berlin in only three days .
" as far as we can tell , the planning was quite serious , " german military historian winfried heinemann told deutsche welle .
" but whether they would have managed to take the city within three days is another question . "
superior numbers heinemann pointed out that the western allies were quite serious about defending west berlin from a ground attack .
but he acknowledged that next to nothing was known about any defense strategies as the relevant documents are still classified .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahr knew that west berlin was never really a safe place egon bahr , a former west berlin radio commentator and later adviser to west german chancellor willy brandt , argued that the gdr 's national people 's army troops , and those of the soviet union deployed in the region , would have outnumbered the soldiers from the western allies by far .
" in the event of an attack , our defenses could have been maintained for no more than five to seven hours , " bahr concluded .
the plans found in the files of the east german secret police , the gdr army and the soviet military command reveal some details as to how the attackers would have gone about their job .
a detailed map available to the filmmakers showed the most important installations and infrastructure compounds in west berlin , which would have been targeted first .
among them were strategically important bridges that the french , british and us allies used to move around as well as airports and train stations .
a second phase of the operation would have included the imprisonment of leading west berlin politicians , policemen , public servants and journalists .
a corresponding list of names was updated by the gdr leadership several times until the collapse of the regime in 1989 .
a diehard obsession the research done by military historian winfried heinemann also revealed that plans to attack west berlin were , surprisingly , only developed fully in the early 1970s - a time when political relations between the two german states were in the process of improving considerably .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr soldiers trained for an attack as late as 1988 " whether it was just a question of the gdr military having grown up enough to feel fit for the job - we do n't really know , " said heinemann .
" but considering that the whole military posture of the gdr was kept up right until 1989 , it 's at least no surprise that the planning for an attack went on until the very end . "
in fact , east germany 's national people 's army -lrb- nva -rrb- carried out military maneuvers as late as 1988 to train for the takeover of west berlin .
exercises took place in the east german town of magdeburg some 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- west of berlin .
the training ground was designed to look as if the target territory were divided up between a french , british and us brigade , which reflected the fact the west berlin was seperated into sectors occupied by those three countries .
one year later , the berlin wall fell , and east german intelligence managed to destroy most of the documents regarding the gdr 's hostile intentions toward west berlin .

plans for a military attack existed right up to the end of the regime . through the decades of berlin 's division , many west berliners had an inkling that east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- that surrounded their part of the city would at some stage be seeking to conquer it .
a tv documentary , " der fall x " -lrb- the case of x -rrb- , shown by germany 's public broadcaster rbb finally proved them right .
in the most comprehensive footage on east germany 's conquest plans so far , two filmmakers , supported by military experts , tell a fascinating story about how the defunct state planned to overrun west berlin in only three days .
" as far as we can tell , the planning was quite serious , " german military historian winfried heinemann told deutsche welle .
" but whether they would have managed to take the city within three days is another question . "
superior numbers heinemann pointed out that the western allies were quite serious about defending west berlin from a ground attack .
but he acknowledged that next to nothing was known about any defense strategies as the relevant documents are still classified .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahr knew that west berlin was never really a safe place egon bahr , a former west berlin radio commentator and later adviser to west german chancellor willy brandt , argued that the gdr 's national people 's army troops , and those of the soviet union deployed in the region , would have outnumbered the soldiers from the western allies by far .
" in the event of an attack , our defenses could have been maintained for no more than five to seven hours , " bahr concluded .
the plans found in the files of the east german secret police , the gdr army and the soviet military command reveal some details as to how the attackers would have gone about their job .
a detailed map available to the filmmakers showed the most important installations and infrastructure compounds in west berlin , which would have been targeted first .
among them were strategically important bridges that the french , british and us allies used to move around as well as airports and train stations .
a second phase of the operation would have included the imprisonment of leading west berlin politicians , policemen , public servants and journalists .
a corresponding list of names was updated by the gdr leadership several times until the collapse of the regime in 1989 .
a diehard obsession the research done by military historian winfried heinemann also revealed that plans to attack west berlin were , surprisingly , only developed fully in the early 1970s - a time when political relations between the two german states were in the process of improving considerably .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr soldiers trained for an attack as late as 1988 " whether it was just a question of the gdr military having grown up enough to feel fit for the job - we do n't really know , " said heinemann .
" but considering that the whole military posture of the gdr was kept up right until 1989 , it 's at least no surprise that the planning for an attack went on until the very end . "

in the most comprehensive footage on east germany 's conquest plans so far , two filmmakers , supported by military experts , tell a fascinating story about how the defunct state planned to overrun west berlin in only three days .
" as far as we can tell , the planning was quite serious , " german military historian winfried heinemann told deutsche welle .
" but whether they would have managed to take the city within three days is another question . "
superior numbers heinemann pointed out that the western allies were quite serious about defending west berlin from a ground attack .
but he acknowledged that next to nothing was known about any defense strategies as the relevant documents are still classified .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bahr knew that west berlin was never really a safe place egon bahr , a former west berlin radio commentator and later adviser to west german chancellor willy brandt , argued that the gdr 's national people 's army troops , and those of the soviet union deployed in the region , would have outnumbered the soldiers from the western allies by far .
" in the event of an attack , our defenses could have been maintained for no more than five to seven hours , " bahr concluded .
the plans found in the files of the east german secret police , the gdr army and the soviet military command reveal some details as to how the attackers would have gone about their job .
a detailed map available to the filmmakers showed the most important installations and infrastructure compounds in west berlin , which would have been targeted first .
among them were strategically important bridges that the french , british and us allies used to move around as well as airports and train stations .
a second phase of the operation would have included the imprisonment of leading west berlin politicians , policemen , public servants and journalists .
a corresponding list of names was updated by the gdr leadership several times until the collapse of the regime in 1989 .
a diehard obsession the research done by military historian winfried heinemann also revealed that plans to attack west berlin were , surprisingly , only developed fully in the early 1970s - a time when political relations between the two german states were in the process of improving considerably .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr soldiers trained for an attack as late as 1988 " whether it was just a question of the gdr military having grown up enough to feel fit for the job - we do n't really know , " said heinemann .
" but considering that the whole military posture of the gdr was kept up right until 1989 , it 's at least no surprise that the planning for an attack went on until the very end . "
in fact , east germany 's national people 's army -lrb- nva -rrb- carried out military maneuvers as late as 1988 to train for the takeover of west berlin .
exercises took place in the east german town of magdeburg some 200 kilometers -lrb- 124 miles -rrb- west of berlin .
the training ground was designed to look as if the target territory were divided up between a french , british and us brigade , which reflected the fact the west berlin was seperated into sectors occupied by those three countries .
one year later , the berlin wall fell , and east german intelligence managed to destroy most of the documents regarding the gdr 's hostile intentions toward west berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear -pipe- 12.08.2010 nuclear experts play down health threat from russian fires großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radioactive contamination stored in trees would be re-released when they burn fears have surfaced about the spread of radioactive material as russian wildfires burn in areas contaminated by the 1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster .
but experts say there is no significant nuclear health danger . revelations that wildfires have hit hundreds of hectares of land in russia 's western bryansk region contaminated in the chernobyl nuclear disaster have raised fears that radioactive material could be released and reach moscow or even europe .
but radiation experts have said while concern is warranted , any re-release of nuclear contamination would likely pose little risk to human health .
" every instance of increased radioactivity is a cause for concern , but even for the local population , the levels are going to be relatively low , " said ulrich abram , a professor in the chemistry department and radiation expert at the free university of berlin , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" there wo n't be a resulting cloud of radioactive material that could pose a danger to europe , " he said .
fears about russia possibly covering up a new radiation threat were raised when the environmental organization greenpeace warned that fires in forests contaminated in the 1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster could trigger radiation pollution .
the group accused the russian government of playing down the threat .
" fires on these territories will without a doubt lead to an increase in radiation , " said vladimir chuprov , head of the energy program at greenpeace russia , in an interview with the new york times .
" the smoke will spread , and the radioactive traces will spread . "
but radiation experts from russia and other european countries have sought to calm fears , saying that while radioactive isotopes could indeed be released into the air as contaminated material burns , there is no chance that radioactive fallout from the fires could reach anywhere near the magnitude of the chernobyl disaster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radioactive isotopes from the chernobyl disaster are still present in the soil and vegetation fo the area the concerns come from the fact that large areas of ukraine , belarus and russia are still coated with radioactive residue released when reactor no. 4 at the chernobyl nuclear power plan exploded on april 26 , 1986 .
two isotopes are of concern most of the radioactive isotopes released by the chernobyl meltdown were caesium-137 and strontium-90 , both produced by nuclear fission .
because both are isotopes of metallic elements , they fell to the ground rather quickly , according to abram , working their way into the soil over the decades since their release and being taken up by plants and trees .
when the vegetation burns , the atoms are released .
" then people could breathe them in , of course , " said abram .
" they could be exposed to a higher radiation intensity , which can lead to illness . "
abram remarks that people in the affected areas have been living with chernobyl 's aftermath for decades , although ingesting atoms released by the current fires would expose them at higher levels , and more direct contact .
internal exposure to caesium-137 and strontium-90 , through ingestion or inhalation , allows for the radioactive material to be distributed in the body 's soft tissues , especially muscle tissue and bone matter .
these tissues are then exposed to the beta particles and gamma radiation of the isotopes , increasing the risk of developing cancer .
low risk of inhaling nuclear material still , abram says the risk of inhalation is low , because the relative weights of both strontium and caesium send them falling to the ground quickly .
therefore , the risk of breathing the isotopes is low , unless residents are in the immediate vicinity of burning material .
" i do n't want to play down the issue , but the overall radiation dosage will not increase significantly for the people who live there , " he said .
what he does think a likely outcome will be is that as these isotopes are released , they could travel before falling to the ground again in the presence of high winds .
the result would be a larger area of land with low levels of radiation contamination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fires will likely spread contaminants over a larger area other experts agree with his risk assessment , including philipp renaud , head of the environmental radiation laboratory at france 's irsn nuclear safety institute .
he said the previous major forest fires in russia , in 2002 , showed that the risk of exposure was minor .
radioactivity in neighboring countries jumped by a thousandth of a becquerel unit and in france , a millionth .
" this is n't dangerous at all , " he told the agence france presse .
irsn said that if the contaminated forests burn , local residents would be exposed to about two times the normal radiation levels , which while not ideal , is not a cause for panic .
more dangerous for local residents ' health are the non-radioactive toxic fumes caused by the fire , the organization said .
other nuclear dangers ?
some have been concerned that the fires could reach other nuclear sites in russia , such as power plants or atomic weapon depots .
but according to edmund lengfelder , a director at the german society for radiation protection , the danger of flames engulfing a nuclear reactor and leading to disaster is small .
his group has been active in the chernobyl region for 20 years and has observed that these days , the russians are relatively well prepared when it comes to keeping their nuclear facilities out of harm 's way .
" russia is pretty competent when it comes to disaster response and we do n't see a particular threat to its nuclear facilities , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but regarding the material already deposited from chernobyl , we need to keep an eye on that . "

two isotopes are of concern most of the radioactive isotopes released by the chernobyl meltdown were caesium-137 and strontium-90 , both produced by nuclear fission .
because both are isotopes of metallic elements , they fell to the ground rather quickly , according to abram , working their way into the soil over the decades since their release and being taken up by plants and trees .
when the vegetation burns , the atoms are released .
" then people could breathe them in , of course , " said abram .
" they could be exposed to a higher radiation intensity , which can lead to illness . "
abram remarks that people in the affected areas have been living with chernobyl 's aftermath for decades , although ingesting atoms released by the current fires would expose them at higher levels , and more direct contact .
internal exposure to caesium-137 and strontium-90 , through ingestion or inhalation , allows for the radioactive material to be distributed in the body 's soft tissues , especially muscle tissue and bone matter .
these tissues are then exposed to the beta particles and gamma radiation of the isotopes , increasing the risk of developing cancer .
low risk of inhaling nuclear material still , abram says the risk of inhalation is low , because the relative weights of both strontium and caesium send them falling to the ground quickly .
therefore , the risk of breathing the isotopes is low , unless residents are in the immediate vicinity of burning material .
" i do n't want to play down the issue , but the overall radiation dosage will not increase significantly for the people who live there , " he said .
what he does think a likely outcome will be is that as these isotopes are released , they could travel before falling to the ground again in the presence of high winds .
the result would be a larger area of land with low levels of radiation contamination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fires will likely spread contaminants over a larger area other experts agree with his risk assessment , including philipp renaud , head of the environmental radiation laboratory at france 's irsn nuclear safety institute .
he said the previous major forest fires in russia , in 2002 , showed that the risk of exposure was minor .
radioactivity in neighboring countries jumped by a thousandth of a becquerel unit and in france , a millionth .
" this is n't dangerous at all , " he told the agence france presse .
irsn said that if the contaminated forests burn , local residents would be exposed to about two times the normal radiation levels , which while not ideal , is not a cause for panic .
more dangerous for local residents ' health are the non-radioactive toxic fumes caused by the fire , the organization said .
other nuclear dangers ?
some have been concerned that the fires could reach other nuclear sites in russia , such as power plants or atomic weapon depots .
but according to edmund lengfelder , a director at the german society for radiation protection , the danger of flames engulfing a nuclear reactor and leading to disaster is small .
his group has been active in the chernobyl region for 20 years and has observed that these days , the russians are relatively well prepared when it comes to keeping their nuclear facilities out of harm 's way .
" russia is pretty competent when it comes to disaster response and we do n't see a particular threat to its nuclear facilities , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but regarding the material already deposited from chernobyl , we need to keep an eye on that . "

fears about russia possibly covering up a new radiation threat were raised when the environmental organization greenpeace warned that fires in forests contaminated in the 1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster could trigger radiation pollution .
the group accused the russian government of playing down the threat .
" fires on these territories will without a doubt lead to an increase in radiation , " said vladimir chuprov , head of the energy program at greenpeace russia , in an interview with the new york times .
" the smoke will spread , and the radioactive traces will spread . "
but radiation experts from russia and other european countries have sought to calm fears , saying that while radioactive isotopes could indeed be released into the air as contaminated material burns , there is no chance that radioactive fallout from the fires could reach anywhere near the magnitude of the chernobyl disaster .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radioactive isotopes from the chernobyl disaster are still present in the soil and vegetation fo the area the concerns come from the fact that large areas of ukraine , belarus and russia are still coated with radioactive residue released when reactor no. 4 at the chernobyl nuclear power plan exploded on april 26 , 1986 .
two isotopes are of concern most of the radioactive isotopes released by the chernobyl meltdown were caesium-137 and strontium-90 , both produced by nuclear fission .
because both are isotopes of metallic elements , they fell to the ground rather quickly , according to abram , working their way into the soil over the decades since their release and being taken up by plants and trees .
when the vegetation burns , the atoms are released .
" then people could breathe them in , of course , " said abram .
" they could be exposed to a higher radiation intensity , which can lead to illness . "
abram remarks that people in the affected areas have been living with chernobyl 's aftermath for decades , although ingesting atoms released by the current fires would expose them at higher levels , and more direct contact .
internal exposure to caesium-137 and strontium-90 , through ingestion or inhalation , allows for the radioactive material to be distributed in the body 's soft tissues , especially muscle tissue and bone matter .
these tissues are then exposed to the beta particles and gamma radiation of the isotopes , increasing the risk of developing cancer .
low risk of inhaling nuclear material still , abram says the risk of inhalation is low , because the relative weights of both strontium and caesium send them falling to the ground quickly .
therefore , the risk of breathing the isotopes is low , unless residents are in the immediate vicinity of burning material .
" i do n't want to play down the issue , but the overall radiation dosage will not increase significantly for the people who live there , " he said .
what he does think a likely outcome will be is that as these isotopes are released , they could travel before falling to the ground again in the presence of high winds .
the result would be a larger area of land with low levels of radiation contamination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fires will likely spread contaminants over a larger area other experts agree with his risk assessment , including philipp renaud , head of the environmental radiation laboratory at france 's irsn nuclear safety institute .
he said the previous major forest fires in russia , in 2002 , showed that the risk of exposure was minor .
radioactivity in neighboring countries jumped by a thousandth of a becquerel unit and in france , a millionth .
" this is n't dangerous at all , " he told the agence france presse .
irsn said that if the contaminated forests burn , local residents would be exposed to about two times the normal radiation levels , which while not ideal , is not a cause for panic .
more dangerous for local residents ' health are the non-radioactive toxic fumes caused by the fire , the organization said .
other nuclear dangers ?
some have been concerned that the fires could reach other nuclear sites in russia , such as power plants or atomic weapon depots .
but according to edmund lengfelder , a director at the german society for radiation protection , the danger of flames engulfing a nuclear reactor and leading to disaster is small .
his group has been active in the chernobyl region for 20 years and has observed that these days , the russians are relatively well prepared when it comes to keeping their nuclear facilities out of harm 's way .
" russia is pretty competent when it comes to disaster response and we do n't see a particular threat to its nuclear facilities , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" but regarding the material already deposited from chernobyl , we need to keep an eye on that . "

the un has appealed for $ 460 million -lrb- 360 million euros -rrb- in aid . two weeks after the floods struck , the extent of the catastrophe remains unclear .
hundreds of roads and bridges have been destroyed , making it difficult to reach the flooded areas by anything but air .
the us military has tripled the number of its helicopters in pakistan to help with the relief efforts . on wednesday , john holmes , the un emergency relief coordinator , appealed for help from the member states of the united nations in new york . " ladies and gentlemen , assessment of losses or damages are still underway as you can imagine but it 's already very clear that these floods – the worst in pakistan for over 80 years have caused and are continuing to cause immense destruction and immense suffering , " he said gravely . " scale of disaster is horrendous " pakistan 's un ambassador abdullah hussain haroon told the un it was hard to confirm the number of deaths .
" the scale of this disaster is horrendous , " he stated . "
so far we have lost , in the three northern provinces , 4772 villages completely - just gone - that 's why we do n't know what the death toll is because we have no way of calculating at the moment .

they need food , clothes , shelter and clean drinking water .
moreover , they urgently need medical assistance " as the incidence of acute diarrhea and other water-borne diseases is rising worryingly , " according to john holmes . " cholera is also breaking out , " abdullah hussain haroon explained .
" that is going to be very dangerous .
drinking water and sachets for purifying it are going to become very important over the next few days . " death toll could rapidly rise even if the death toll from this disaster is not as high yet as from the 2004 tsunami or january 's earthquake in haiti , the un has warned that disease and food shortages could fast become deadly if the urgent needs of the people are not attended to . in pakistan itself , despite president zardari 's visit to the flooded areas on thursday , victims continued to complain about the slow response to the disaster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whole villages have been evacuated because of heavy flooding this man in khyber pakhtunkhwa spoke for thousands when he spoke to reporters : " we have been on the roadside for the past 12 days , we need food and tents but we have n't received food or tents . " on wednesday , john holmes ended his appeal with a warning that the destruction was far from over : " far from it .
having already affected the north of the country in late july and early august , the flood wave now continues to make its way through the southern province of sindh where millions more are expected to suffer from the combined impact of continuing torrential rains .

the un has appealed for $ 460 million -lrb- 360 million euros -rrb- in aid . two weeks after the floods struck , the extent of the catastrophe remains unclear .
hundreds of roads and bridges have been destroyed , making it difficult to reach the flooded areas by anything but air .
the us military has tripled the number of its helicopters in pakistan to help with the relief efforts . on wednesday , john holmes , the un emergency relief coordinator , appealed for help from the member states of the united nations in new york . " ladies and gentlemen , assessment of losses or damages are still underway as you can imagine but it 's already very clear that these floods – the worst in pakistan for over 80 years have caused and are continuing to cause immense destruction and immense suffering , " he said gravely . " scale of disaster is horrendous " pakistan 's un ambassador abdullah hussain haroon told the un it was hard to confirm the number of deaths .
" the scale of this disaster is horrendous , " he stated . "
so far we have lost , in the three northern provinces , 4772 villages completely - just gone - that 's why we do n't know what the death toll is because we have no way of calculating at the moment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 14 million pakistanis are thought to be affected by the floods so far , it is known that at least 1,600 people have died and an estimated 14 million people are affected – some 8 percent of the pakistani population . half of those affected need immediate emergency relief if they are to survive .
they need food , clothes , shelter and clean drinking water .
moreover , they urgently need medical assistance " as the incidence of acute diarrhea and other water-borne diseases is rising worryingly , " according to john holmes . " cholera is also breaking out , " abdullah hussain haroon explained .
" that is going to be very dangerous .
drinking water and sachets for purifying it are going to become very important over the next few days . " death toll could rapidly rise even if the death toll from this disaster is not as high yet as from the 2004 tsunami or january 's earthquake in haiti , the un has warned that disease and food shortages could fast become deadly if the urgent needs of the people are not attended to . in pakistan itself , despite president zardari 's visit to the flooded areas on thursday , victims continued to complain about the slow response to the disaster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whole villages have been evacuated because of heavy flooding this man in khyber pakhtunkhwa spoke for thousands when he spoke to reporters : " we have been on the roadside for the past 12 days , we need food and tents but we have n't received food or tents . " on wednesday , john holmes ended his appeal with a warning that the destruction was far from over : " far from it .
having already affected the north of the country in late july and early august , the flood wave now continues to make its way through the southern province of sindh where millions more are expected to suffer from the combined impact of continuing torrential rains . " aid agencies are complaining that so far the donor response to the crisis has been poor . author : anne thomas editor : disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 12.08.2010 second-stringers give loew food for thought ahead of euro qualifiers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew saw some things he liked but others he clearly did n't with the qualifying stage for the 2012 european championships beginning in september , a number of second-string stars were looking to impress germany coach joachim loew during wednesday 's friendly draw in denmark . for 74 minutes in copenhagen , it looked as though joachim loew had become one of those blessed coaches whose talent pool is such that he can throw a second string of players onto a pitch and get the same type of performance and result as he would have expected his a-listers to produce .
this was a germany team shorn of almost all of its world cup stars and filled with debutants , cameo performers and bit-part players charged with taking on a denmark team smarting from a hugely forgettable summer in south africa .
the danes , while introducing a few unknowns in the hope of kick-starting a new era , still had a number of experienced players on show and with a home crowd behind them , they may have been expected to give germany 's reserves a torrid time .
but despite never playing together as a full team before and in a formation rarely used by loew , the german players slowly started to look comfortable in each other 's company and for the majority of the game , they appeared in little danger of leaving copenhagen without a victory .
while loew is unlikely to ever field this team again or play his regular starters in this tactical shape , a number of players will have improved their chances of joining the first team for the upcoming euro 2012 qualifiers and perhaps the european championships themselves in poland and ukraine in two years time .
der hammer returns to form with added nuances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal one performance that will have given the germany coach food for though was that of thomas hitzlsperger .
given the captain 's armband in the absence of warring skippers philipp lahm and michael ballack , hitzlsperger 's inclusion as germany 's leader in the centre of midfield was just reward for der hammer after fighting back from a severe loss of form .
after losing confidence and his touch at vfb stuttgart – and his place in the germany team – hitzlsperger 's transfer to lazio in january could have been the moment he dropped off germany 's radar .
but despite being overlooked for the world cup , hitzlsperger – now with west ham in the english premiership – has shown the hunger to come back and has recaptured his form .
there was plenty of the marauding midfield work of old but a season in serie a 's less frenetic atmosphere appears to have refined parts of hitzlsperger 's game which contributed to some considering him a blunt instrument .
it was a delicately feigned shot followed by a deft , penetrating pass into the penalty area on 19 minutes that set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal and until he was replaced in the second half , hitzlsperger was a worthy stand-in for bastian schweinsteiger in the conductor 's role .
gentner 's craft catches the eye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former wolfsburg star gentner made a good impression playing off hitzlsperger was another player who should have done enough to convince jogi loew to continue his freshening-up of the germany team .
germany 's midfield showed no signs of suffering from the loss of ballack in south africa , and with toni kroos also showing in copenhagen why he could soon be a first team regular , one might think it overly optimistic to think that christian gentner may force his way into the national team 's starting line-up .
while hitzlsperger will certainly give loew a new option in defensive midfield , gentner put on a performance that could see him challenging for a role in the creative trio the germany coach normally deploys behind his lone striker .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder was a livewire throughout .
gentner was mobile , showed great vision and provided a number of killer passes .
drifting across the pitch behind mario gomez and patrick helmes , gentner was consistently probing the danish defensive line .
it was his perfectly timed pass which led to germany 's second goal .
receiving a great pass from jerome boateng on the edge of the area , gentner held the ball up long enough for helmes to time his run before threading a pass between the center-backs and onto helmes ' boot .
the bayer leverkusen striker did the rest .
stand-in strikers score but leave much to be desired bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmes needs the composure he shows with leverkusen helmes , who missed the world cup through injury after a good season with leverkusen , showed signs that he could be a worthy understudy to miroslav klose in the germany attack but the frequency and ease of the opportunities he wasted suggested that he needs more composure at this level and will certainly remain behind klose and thomas mueller in the attacking pecking order in the euro qualifiers .
but gomez , his well taken goal aside , played in a way that only reinforced the opinion that he must have some incriminating photos of his coach in a vault somewhere .
only someone with some nefarious hold over the man who picks the team can continue to get a game when he plays so abjectly .
even in a second-string team , gomez rarely justified his inclusion as an international striker .
elsewhere , there were encouraging signs that christian traesch could make good on his potential and challenge for a consistent role in midfield while toni kroos and marko marin – building on their cameo performances at the world cup – will certainly feature in the euro qualifiers and would be good bets to see increased action at the 2012 tournament .
despite his woeful pass which led to dennis rommedahl pulling a goal back just a minute after helmes put germany 2-0 up , defender serdar tasci had a competent game at left back until that mistake wrecked his confidence .
on the other side of defence , sascha reither was also solid until the final 15 minutes ; although it is unlikely he will ever unseat philipp lahm in the starting line-up .
the makeshift german defence as a whole battled well until the 74th minute when rommedahl 's goal gave denmark belief and shattered that of germany 's back four .
wiese 's strong showing in goal tarnished by late blunder with their two-goal lead slashed in half , germany looked rattled in defence and nervous in attack with gomez and helmes blowing gilt-edged chances to make the score 3-1 in the final ten minutes .
instead , denmark seized their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese kept denmark at bay until the final 15 minutes stand-in keeper tim wiese – who had an excellent game until his defense imploded in front of him – chose to rush out to deal with a dangerous through ball .
finding himself on the edge of his area , the werder bremen stopper was caught in two minds whether to use his hands , choosing instead to chest the ball to mads junker .
the danish striker knocked the ball round the stranded wiese before slotting it into an empty net to complete denmark 's comeback and the german collapse .
it was wiese 's first real mistake of the game but it was glaring one .
with rene adler returning from the injury that kept him from being the number one in south africa , and germany 's world cup keeper manuel neuer enhancing his reputation this summer , even without his 87th minute howler wiese faced an uphill struggle to make ground on his rivals .
it 's likely he 'll remain the third choice throughout the euro qualifiers and beyond .

germany 's midfield showed no signs of suffering from the loss of ballack in south africa , and with toni kroos also showing in copenhagen why he could soon be a first team regular , one might think it overly optimistic to think that christian gentner may force his way into the national team 's starting line-up .
while hitzlsperger will certainly give loew a new option in defensive midfield , gentner put on a performance that could see him challenging for a role in the creative trio the germany coach normally deploys behind his lone striker .
the vfb stuttgart midfielder was a livewire throughout .
gentner was mobile , showed great vision and provided a number of killer passes .
drifting across the pitch behind mario gomez and patrick helmes , gentner was consistently probing the danish defensive line .
it was his perfectly timed pass which led to germany 's second goal .
receiving a great pass from jerome boateng on the edge of the area , gentner held the ball up long enough for helmes to time his run before threading a pass between the center-backs and onto helmes ' boot .
the bayer leverkusen striker did the rest .

but gomez , his well taken goal aside , played in a way that only reinforced the opinion that he must have some incriminating photos of his coach in a vault somewhere .
only someone with some nefarious hold over the man who picks the team can continue to get a game when he plays so abjectly .
even in a second-string team , gomez rarely justified his inclusion as an international striker .
elsewhere , there were encouraging signs that christian traesch could make good on his potential and challenge for a consistent role in midfield while toni kroos and marko marin – building on their cameo performances at the world cup – will certainly feature in the euro qualifiers and would be good bets to see increased action at the 2012 tournament .
despite his woeful pass which led to dennis rommedahl pulling a goal back just a minute after helmes put germany 2-0 up , defender serdar tasci had a competent game at left back until that mistake wrecked his confidence .
on the other side of defence , sascha reither was also solid until the final 15 minutes ; although it is unlikely he will ever unseat philipp lahm in the starting line-up .
the makeshift german defence as a whole battled well until the 74th minute when rommedahl 's goal gave denmark belief and shattered that of germany 's back four .
wiese 's strong showing in goal tarnished by late blunder with their two-goal lead slashed in half , germany looked rattled in defence and nervous in attack with gomez and helmes blowing gilt-edged chances to make the score 3-1 in the final ten minutes .
instead , denmark seized their chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiese kept denmark at bay until the final 15 minutes stand-in keeper tim wiese – who had an excellent game until his defense imploded in front of him – chose to rush out to deal with a dangerous through ball .

the danish striker knocked the ball round the stranded wiese before slotting it into an empty net to complete denmark 's comeback and the german collapse .
it was wiese 's first real mistake of the game but it was glaring one .
with rene adler returning from the injury that kept him from being the number one in south africa , and germany 's world cup keeper manuel neuer enhancing his reputation this summer , even without his 87th minute howler wiese faced an uphill struggle to make ground on his rivals .
it 's likely he 'll remain the third choice throughout the euro qualifiers and beyond .

this was a germany team shorn of almost all of its world cup stars and filled with debutants , cameo performers and bit-part players charged with taking on a denmark team smarting from a hugely forgettable summer in south africa .
the danes , while introducing a few unknowns in the hope of kick-starting a new era , still had a number of experienced players on show and with a home crowd behind them , they may have been expected to give germany 's reserves a torrid time .
but despite never playing together as a full team before and in a formation rarely used by loew , the german players slowly started to look comfortable in each other 's company and for the majority of the game , they appeared in little danger of leaving copenhagen without a victory .
while loew is unlikely to ever field this team again or play his regular starters in this tactical shape , a number of players will have improved their chances of joining the first team for the upcoming euro 2012 qualifiers and perhaps the european championships themselves in poland and ukraine in two years time .
der hammer returns to form with added nuances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal one performance that will have given the germany coach food for though was that of thomas hitzlsperger .
given the captain 's armband in the absence of warring skippers philipp lahm and michael ballack , hitzlsperger 's inclusion as germany 's leader in the centre of midfield was just reward for der hammer after fighting back from a severe loss of form .
after losing confidence and his touch at vfb stuttgart – and his place in the germany team – hitzlsperger 's transfer to lazio in january could have been the moment he dropped off germany 's radar .
but despite being overlooked for the world cup , hitzlsperger – now with west ham in the english premiership – has shown the hunger to come back and has recaptured his form .
there was plenty of the marauding midfield work of old but a season in serie a 's less frenetic atmosphere appears to have refined parts of hitzlsperger 's game which contributed to some considering him a blunt instrument .
it was a delicately feigned shot followed by a deft , penetrating pass into the penalty area on 19 minutes that set up mario gomez for germany 's first goal and until he was replaced in the second half , hitzlsperger was a worthy stand-in for bastian schweinsteiger in the conductor 's role .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 12.08.2010 probe into german-greek arms deals reveals murky side of defense sales großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german submarine sales to greece are being investigated despite being heavily in debt , greece keeps spending on arms .
a probe into its accounts has led to an investigation into submarine deals with germany and alleged corruption in the grey areas of the eu 's defense sector . after months of haggling over its involvement in the unprecedented european union bailout to save greece from defaulting , germany finds itself at the center of another financial tangle with the debt-ridden mediterranean nation - this time involving defense contracts greece could ill afford and the shadowy deals behind them .
at the same time that german chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet was approving 22.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 29.7 billion -rrb- in aid to greece , prosecutors in germany began investigating whether defense contractors had paid millions of euros in bribes to greek officials in connection with the sale of two german submarines in a deal worth more than a billion euros .
the investigation , which began in may , is focussing on the deal - part of a larger , complicated decade-old contract to provide greece with a total of six submarines - struck between berlin and athens in march as greece lurched toward bankruptcy .
the investigation is also looking at similar defense deals struck between germany and portugal , another eu member state teetering on the brink of financial collapse .
german firm at the heart of bribery allegations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german company is suspected of being involved in bribery the probe is looking into allegations that ferrostaal ag , one of the german companies helping to build the submarines , was involved in bribery .
ferrostaal executives are suspected by munich prosecutors of authorizing payments worth millions of euros to politicians to win the initial deal in 2000 through a greek company called marine industrial enterprises .
according to records unearthed by the german investigation , ferrostaal allegedly used false consulting contracts to cover up the bribes before distributing payments to " officials and decision-makers " in greece .
the prosecutors also allege that ferrostaal accepted fees from other companies for bribes paid on their behalf , in effect operating a policy of subcontracted bribery .
while no charges have been brought in the on-going investigation into the submarine deal , several ferrostaal executives stepped down in may and three company representatives have been indicted , along with individuals in portugal linked to the portuguese deals .
the company itself could face fines in excess of 120 million euros if found guilty of bribing officials in greece and portugal .
greece 's economic crimes unit is also probing the transaction as part of its investigation into all weapons deals made by athens over the past decade , deals said to be in the region of 16 billion euros in total , to determine whether greece overpaid or agreed to deals for military equipment it did n't need .
greece is the largest importer of conventional weapons in europe and its military spending , the highest in the european union , is widely accepted as one of the main reasons for the parlous state of its finances .
eu urged to clamp down on defence sector corruption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government has denied exploiting greece the revelations and investigations in the deals between germany , greece and portugal have also prompted members of the european parliament to call for the eu to launch its own probe , with some officials accusing germany of making their military dealings with greece a condition for its involvement in the country 's bailout and profiting from athens ' profligacy .
german government officials have vehemently denied that germany took advantage of greece 's spending habits to land lucrative defense deals and have dismissed claims that its involvement in the rescue package , in which germany was the largest eu contributor of financial aid , was dependent on agreements being signed .
" this is a very difficult matter , " dr. christian moelling , a european defense expert from the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" if greece wants to spend the money , then of course it can but at the moment it is spending eu money ... or , in fact , mostly germany 's money . "
" the problem is that this submarine deal is an old deal .
it was signed in 2000 before greece had this level of financial problems .
as with any deal , it is very hard to get out of the contract and the private actors in this deal have every right to get their money . "
as well as the submarine deals themselves , it is thought that " offset contracts " were also signed to the tune of one billion euros .
offsets are arrangements made by purchasing governments with their suppliers , requiring the contractors to reinvest a percentage of the value of the deal in the importing country .
offset deals under scrutiny in addition to illegal payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buying military hardware sometimes comes with extras " the arms trade is already an incubator of corruption with such large sums of money flowing around , and all that secrecy , " nick whitney , a european defence expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it 's so easy to avoid clear accountability about what you 've bought , and why .
the best antidotes are transparency , and competition .
but if you add offsets to the deal , it only gets murkier . " " the temptation to look for offsets - compensation for a big export of state capital - is understandable for some countries especially if you do n't have an armaments industry of your own , and so ca n't expect to get compensated on a ' swings and roundabouts ' basis . "
dr. moelling describes offsets as side deals .
" direct offsets are deals which happen thus : the purchaser will say , for example , ' we want to buy your fighter aircraft but we also want you to provide us with the industrial capability to build the missiles which goes with it . '
the seller will perhaps build the factory , pass on the technical knowledge or include the license to build the missiles in the deal for the plane . " " indirect offsets work in much the same way but the additional deal will include something not attached to original product ; we buy the plane , you build a hospital , " he added .
" these offsets often go beyond just the supplying company and can include participation by the supplier 's government .
in the case of the submarines , this would be the german government . "
grey area of eu defense sector open to abuse under many trade agreements and in most industries , offsets are illegal but the eu allows them in defense procurement where member states can invoke a " national security " exemption .
opponents of offset agreements say they are negotiated among companies with government favoritism and violate the eu 's internal market competition rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense deals within the eu are sweetened by offsets " in the civilian field , offsets are illegal but in the defense sector , they are legal , " dr. moelling added .
" in the eu , article 346 of the current treaty says that any agreement can be overruled if it is claimed to be in the national security .
the problem is that there are many different opinions on offsets in the eu .
germany says they are not helpful as they blur the actual price of products .
greece meanwhile has a very active offset policy while other countries have no official policy .
offests are n't part of any typical market so they 're very hard to monitor and are highly politicized . "
" the european defense agency recently brokered an agreement amongst european member states to limit offset to 100 percent of the value of the arms contract , " nick witney said . " previously , many member states were looking for a lot more .
austria was the most striking case - they used to demand 300 percent offset .
in such circumstances , weapon-buying becomes the least important part of the transaction - the big money is in the offset .
so any pretence that you are buying the best weapon at the best price for your military needs goes out of the window - noone can really disentangle why you 've bought what you 've bought . " the eu has been called upon to tackle the " national security " exemption invoked by member states when dealing in offsets .
the eu is planning to introduce a new " defense procurement directive " which will restrict the areas in which governments can use the exemption and demand that the offsets they are involved in are necessary for the protection of security interests and do not break competition rules . " it 's not only on the weapons side of the deal that competition gets distorted , " witney added . " if the arms seller agrees to buy 1,000 trucks from you in compensation , what 's that done to all the rules of the single market about fair trade in trucks ?
the treaties make clear that , although ' national security ' gives member states latitude to ignore single market rules in their arms purchases , they must not in doing so distort competition in non-military goods .

german government officials have vehemently denied that germany took advantage of greece 's spending habits to land lucrative defense deals and have dismissed claims that its involvement in the rescue package , in which germany was the largest eu contributor of financial aid , was dependent on agreements being signed .
" this is a very difficult matter , " dr. christian moelling , a european defense expert from the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" if greece wants to spend the money , then of course it can but at the moment it is spending eu money ... or , in fact , mostly germany 's money . "
" the problem is that this submarine deal is an old deal .
it was signed in 2000 before greece had this level of financial problems .
as with any deal , it is very hard to get out of the contract and the private actors in this deal have every right to get their money . "
as well as the submarine deals themselves , it is thought that " offset contracts " were also signed to the tune of one billion euros .
offsets are arrangements made by purchasing governments with their suppliers , requiring the contractors to reinvest a percentage of the value of the deal in the importing country .
offset deals under scrutiny in addition to illegal payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buying military hardware sometimes comes with extras " the arms trade is already an incubator of corruption with such large sums of money flowing around , and all that secrecy , " nick whitney , a european defence expert at the european council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it 's so easy to avoid clear accountability about what you 've bought , and why .
the best antidotes are transparency , and competition .
but if you add offsets to the deal , it only gets murkier . " " the temptation to look for offsets - compensation for a big export of state capital - is understandable for some countries especially if you do n't have an armaments industry of your own , and so ca n't expect to get compensated on a ' swings and roundabouts ' basis . "
dr. moelling describes offsets as side deals .
" direct offsets are deals which happen thus : the purchaser will say , for example , ' we want to buy your fighter aircraft but we also want you to provide us with the industrial capability to build the missiles which goes with it . '
the seller will perhaps build the factory , pass on the technical knowledge or include the license to build the missiles in the deal for the plane . " " indirect offsets work in much the same way but the additional deal will include something not attached to original product ; we buy the plane , you build a hospital , " he added .
" these offsets often go beyond just the supplying company and can include participation by the supplier 's government .
in the case of the submarines , this would be the german government . "
grey area of eu defense sector open to abuse under many trade agreements and in most industries , offsets are illegal but the eu allows them in defense procurement where member states can invoke a " national security " exemption .
opponents of offset agreements say they are negotiated among companies with government favoritism and violate the eu 's internal market competition rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense deals within the eu are sweetened by offsets " in the civilian field , offsets are illegal but in the defense sector , they are legal , " dr. moelling added .
" in the eu , article 346 of the current treaty says that any agreement can be overruled if it is claimed to be in the national security .
the problem is that there are many different opinions on offsets in the eu .
germany says they are not helpful as they blur the actual price of products .
greece meanwhile has a very active offset policy while other countries have no official policy .
offests are n't part of any typical market so they 're very hard to monitor and are highly politicized . "
" the european defense agency recently brokered an agreement amongst european member states to limit offset to 100 percent of the value of the arms contract , " nick witney said . " previously , many member states were looking for a lot more .
austria was the most striking case - they used to demand 300 percent offset .
in such circumstances , weapon-buying becomes the least important part of the transaction - the big money is in the offset .
so any pretence that you are buying the best weapon at the best price for your military needs goes out of the window - noone can really disentangle why you 've bought what you 've bought . " the eu has been called upon to tackle the " national security " exemption invoked by member states when dealing in offsets .
the eu is planning to introduce a new " defense procurement directive " which will restrict the areas in which governments can use the exemption and demand that the offsets they are involved in are necessary for the protection of security interests and do not break competition rules . " it 's not only on the weapons side of the deal that competition gets distorted , " witney added . " if the arms seller agrees to buy 1,000 trucks from you in compensation , what 's that done to all the rules of the single market about fair trade in trucks ?
the treaties make clear that , although ' national security ' gives member states latitude to ignore single market rules in their arms purchases , they must not in doing so distort competition in non-military goods .

one in five medical tourists choose to visit clinics in bad godesberg , just south of bonn .
the town is especially popular with patients from the middle east . once upon a time when bonn was the capital of west germany , the nearby town of bad godesberg was home to many diplomats - almost all the ambassadors ' residences were located there .
today bad godesberg has become a magnet for arabs , not due to its diplomatic history , but for the healthcare services it offers .
the elisees clinic , in particular , has gained a shining reputation in the arab world .
recently , sheik abdulrahman al muftah from qatar set up an appointment at the clinic for 9 o 'clock .
but it was just before 10:30 that his car turned the corner - a simple blue vw family van .
not exactly the kind of vehicle the medical staff expects a middle eastern sheik to arrive in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sheik abdulrahman al mufti says german clinics have a good reputation a rather squat gentlemen gets out of the car , followed by his wife , dressed in a black burqa .
the sheik is n't wearing a caftan , since in germany he dresses to fit in .
today he 's sporting beige bermuda shorts and white socks with sandals .
he warmly shakes the hands of everyone present .
" i 'm sorry , i knew nothing about an appointment at 9 o 'clock , " he jokes while saying hello to the chief surgeon , natalia brenner .
different customs brenner waves the couple inside , smiling to herself - she knows the drill .
the clinic sees about 3,000 patients a year from the middle east , and during that time , she 's learned a lot about interacting with people from this part of the world .
" arab patients are a special clientele .
they are nice and kind , but they have their ways , " she says .
" for example , they always come late for appointments and then they usually take over our entire clinic . "
brenner has also learned that women from the arab world are not introduced by their own names , and that the price for an operation is often considered negotiable .
while she 's gotten used to most customs , there 's one she still has a hard time with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief surgeon natalia brenner has gotten used to most arab customs " the role of women , that 's something i still do n't understand , " she says .
" it is still strange for me to see that men make the decisions for arab women . "
sheik abdulrahman is no exception .
while his wife , sitting in an examination chair , might be the one about to undergo an operation , he 's the one who will have the final say .
brenner points to an ultrasound image and explains the details of the operation that will treat his wife 's varicose veins .
during the discussion , which takes place through an interpreter because the sheik does n't speak or understand german , his wife carefully watches her husband 's reactions .
despite the language barrier , comprehension is not a problem today in the elisee clinic .
nadhmi nefzi , a young man who follows the sheikh around like a shadow , is responsible for the interpreting at the clinic - he 's the clinic 's personal assistant .
he is dressed in a neat shirt , has carefully parted hair and is the model of discretion .
the young man translates the discussion into arabic , taking special care with the many medical terms .
sheik abdulrahman nods and looks at dr brenner - she can operate on his wife now .
he 's going to take a stroll through the city with nefzi .
known for its health care these kinds of health trips , the sheik says , cost a lot of money .
but as a professor of marine biology and a bank owner , he can afford it .
he 's been coming to germany for over 20 years ; recently , always to bad godesberg .
the sheik explains that the town 's clinics have acquired glowing reputations in the arab world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the whole family comes on these health trips " in the meantime , i 've gotten to know many doctors here , " he laughs .
" i 've become friends with a lot of them and even get special treatment . "
the doctors in bad godesberg are even recommended by the health section of the qatari embassy .
that 's common in arab countries , he says , strolling along the storefront windows of the city .
tailored to a new clientele a little while ago , munich was considered the place to go for medical care , but bad godesberg has knocked the bavarians off their perch , especially since many clinics here have tailored their services to a middle eastern clientele .
" and it 's quiet and safe and my family feels at home because there are so many other arabs here , " referring to those with diplomatic ties who did not move to berlin when the german government shifted capitals .
the sheik points to signs on local shops - the pharmacy , a jewelry store , a café and a souvenir shop - written in arabic .
personal assistant nefzi nods .
in addition to his translation duties he is also charged with making appointments to see high-end apartments .
arabs can be very discerning , he says .
" it 's very important that the environment is clean and that the apartment is representative of germany , " nefzi says .
" they want to have something to talk about back home . "
most health-related visitors from the middle east choose not to stay in hotels .
they consider the rooms impersonal and prefer to be able to prepare their own food .
once the stroll around town is done , the sheik returns to the clinic and waits for his wife to be released from the operating room .
the doctors report the procedure went well .
now it 's time to go shopping , but not in bad godesberg .
the family will have to head over to the bigger cities of cologne or dusseldorf , where they can visit shops with a selection of middle eastern foods wide enough to fit their discerning tastes .

one in five medical tourists choose to visit clinics in bad godesberg , just south of bonn .
the town is especially popular with patients from the middle east . once upon a time when bonn was the capital of west germany , the nearby town of bad godesberg was home to many diplomats - almost all the ambassadors ' residences were located there .
today bad godesberg has become a magnet for arabs , not due to its diplomatic history , but for the healthcare services it offers .
the elisees clinic , in particular , has gained a shining reputation in the arab world .
recently , sheik abdulrahman al muftah from qatar set up an appointment at the clinic for 9 o 'clock .
but it was just before 10:30 that his car turned the corner - a simple blue vw family van .
not exactly the kind of vehicle the medical staff expects a middle eastern sheik to arrive in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sheik abdulrahman al mufti says german clinics have a good reputation a rather squat gentlemen gets out of the car , followed by his wife , dressed in a black burqa .
the sheik is n't wearing a caftan , since in germany he dresses to fit in .
today he 's sporting beige bermuda shorts and white socks with sandals .
he warmly shakes the hands of everyone present .
" i 'm sorry , i knew nothing about an appointment at 9 o 'clock , " he jokes while saying hello to the chief surgeon , natalia brenner .
different customs brenner waves the couple inside , smiling to herself - she knows the drill .
the clinic sees about 3,000 patients a year from the middle east , and during that time , she 's learned a lot about interacting with people from this part of the world .
" arab patients are a special clientele .
they are nice and kind , but they have their ways , " she says .
" for example , they always come late for appointments and then they usually take over our entire clinic . "
brenner has also learned that women from the arab world are not introduced by their own names , and that the price for an operation is often considered negotiable .
while she 's gotten used to most customs , there 's one she still has a hard time with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief surgeon natalia brenner has gotten used to most arab customs " the role of women , that 's something i still do n't understand , " she says .
" it is still strange for me to see that men make the decisions for arab women . "
sheik abdulrahman is no exception .
while his wife , sitting in an examination chair , might be the one about to undergo an operation , he 's the one who will have the final say .
brenner points to an ultrasound image and explains the details of the operation that will treat his wife 's varicose veins .
during the discussion , which takes place through an interpreter because the sheik does n't speak or understand german , his wife carefully watches her husband 's reactions .
despite the language barrier , comprehension is not a problem today in the elisee clinic .
nadhmi nefzi , a young man who follows the sheikh around like a shadow , is responsible for the interpreting at the clinic - he 's the clinic 's personal assistant .
he is dressed in a neat shirt , has carefully parted hair and is the model of discretion .
the young man translates the discussion into arabic , taking special care with the many medical terms .
sheik abdulrahman nods and looks at dr brenner - she can operate on his wife now .
he 's going to take a stroll through the city with nefzi .
known for its health care these kinds of health trips , the sheik says , cost a lot of money .
but as a professor of marine biology and a bank owner , he can afford it .
he 's been coming to germany for over 20 years ; recently , always to bad godesberg .
the sheik explains that the town 's clinics have acquired glowing reputations in the arab world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the whole family comes on these health trips " in the meantime , i 've gotten to know many doctors here , " he laughs .
" i 've become friends with a lot of them and even get special treatment . "
the doctors in bad godesberg are even recommended by the health section of the qatari embassy .
that 's common in arab countries , he says , strolling along the storefront windows of the city .
tailored to a new clientele a little while ago , munich was considered the place to go for medical care , but bad godesberg has knocked the bavarians off their perch , especially since many clinics here have tailored their services to a middle eastern clientele .
" and it 's quiet and safe and my family feels at home because there are so many other arabs here , " referring to those with diplomatic ties who did not move to berlin when the german government shifted capitals .
the sheik points to signs on local shops - the pharmacy , a jewelry store , a café and a souvenir shop - written in arabic .
personal assistant nefzi nods .
in addition to his translation duties he is also charged with making appointments to see high-end apartments .
arabs can be very discerning , he says .
" it 's very important that the environment is clean and that the apartment is representative of germany , " nefzi says .
" they want to have something to talk about back home . "
most health-related visitors from the middle east choose not to stay in hotels .
they consider the rooms impersonal and prefer to be able to prepare their own food .
once the stroll around town is done , the sheik returns to the clinic and waits for his wife to be released from the operating room .
the doctors report the procedure went well .
now it 's time to go shopping , but not in bad godesberg .
the family will have to head over to the bigger cities of cologne or dusseldorf , where they can visit shops with a selection of middle eastern foods wide enough to fit their discerning tastes .

" it is still strange for me to see that men make the decisions for arab women . "
sheik abdulrahman is no exception .
while his wife , sitting in an examination chair , might be the one about to undergo an operation , he 's the one who will have the final say .
brenner points to an ultrasound image and explains the details of the operation that will treat his wife 's varicose veins .
during the discussion , which takes place through an interpreter because the sheik does n't speak or understand german , his wife carefully watches her husband 's reactions .
despite the language barrier , comprehension is not a problem today in the elisee clinic .
nadhmi nefzi , a young man who follows the sheikh around like a shadow , is responsible for the interpreting at the clinic - he 's the clinic 's personal assistant .
he is dressed in a neat shirt , has carefully parted hair and is the model of discretion .
the young man translates the discussion into arabic , taking special care with the many medical terms .
sheik abdulrahman nods and looks at dr brenner - she can operate on his wife now .
he 's going to take a stroll through the city with nefzi .
known for its health care these kinds of health trips , the sheik says , cost a lot of money .
but as a professor of marine biology and a bank owner , he can afford it .
he 's been coming to germany for over 20 years ; recently , always to bad godesberg .
the sheik explains that the town 's clinics have acquired glowing reputations in the arab world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the whole family comes on these health trips " in the meantime , i 've gotten to know many doctors here , " he laughs .
" i 've become friends with a lot of them and even get special treatment . "
the doctors in bad godesberg are even recommended by the health section of the qatari embassy .
that 's common in arab countries , he says , strolling along the storefront windows of the city .
tailored to a new clientele a little while ago , munich was considered the place to go for medical care , but bad godesberg has knocked the bavarians off their perch , especially since many clinics here have tailored their services to a middle eastern clientele .
" and it 's quiet and safe and my family feels at home because there are so many other arabs here , " referring to those with diplomatic ties who did not move to berlin when the german government shifted capitals .
the sheik points to signs on local shops - the pharmacy , a jewelry store , a café and a souvenir shop - written in arabic .
personal assistant nefzi nods .
in addition to his translation duties he is also charged with making appointments to see high-end apartments .
arabs can be very discerning , he says .
" it 's very important that the environment is clean and that the apartment is representative of germany , " nefzi says .
" they want to have something to talk about back home . "
most health-related visitors from the middle east choose not to stay in hotels .
they consider the rooms impersonal and prefer to be able to prepare their own food .
once the stroll around town is done , the sheik returns to the clinic and waits for his wife to be released from the operating room .
the doctors report the procedure went well .
now it 's time to go shopping , but not in bad godesberg .
the family will have to head over to the bigger cities of cologne or dusseldorf , where they can visit shops with a selection of middle eastern foods wide enough to fit their discerning tastes .

one in five medical tourists choose to visit clinics in bad godesberg , just south of bonn .
the town is especially popular with patients from the middle east . once upon a time when bonn was the capital of west germany , the nearby town of bad godesberg was home to many diplomats - almost all the ambassadors ' residences were located there .
today bad godesberg has become a magnet for arabs , not due to its diplomatic history , but for the healthcare services it offers .
the elisees clinic , in particular , has gained a shining reputation in the arab world .
recently , sheik abdulrahman al muftah from qatar set up an appointment at the clinic for 9 o 'clock .
but it was just before 10:30 that his car turned the corner - a simple blue vw family van .

the clinic sees about 3,000 patients a year from the middle east , and during that time , she 's learned a lot about interacting with people from this part of the world .
" arab patients are a special clientele .
they are nice and kind , but they have their ways , " she says .
" for example , they always come late for appointments and then they usually take over our entire clinic . "

one in five medical tourists choose to visit clinics in bad godesberg , just south of bonn .
the town is especially popular with patients from the middle east . once upon a time when bonn was the capital of west germany , the nearby town of bad godesberg was home to many diplomats - almost all the ambassadors ' residences were located there .
today bad godesberg has become a magnet for arabs , not due to its diplomatic history , but for the healthcare services it offers .
the elisees clinic , in particular , has gained a shining reputation in the arab world .
recently , sheik abdulrahman al muftah from qatar set up an appointment at the clinic for 9 o 'clock .
but it was just before 10:30 that his car turned the corner - a simple blue vw family van .
not exactly the kind of vehicle the medical staff expects a middle eastern sheik to arrive in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sheik abdulrahman al mufti says german clinics have a good reputation a rather squat gentlemen gets out of the car , followed by his wife , dressed in a black burqa .
the sheik is n't wearing a caftan , since in germany he dresses to fit in .
today he 's sporting beige bermuda shorts and white socks with sandals .
he warmly shakes the hands of everyone present .
" i 'm sorry , i knew nothing about an appointment at 9 o 'clock , " he jokes while saying hello to the chief surgeon , natalia brenner .
different customs brenner waves the couple inside , smiling to herself - she knows the drill .
the clinic sees about 3,000 patients a year from the middle east , and during that time , she 's learned a lot about interacting with people from this part of the world .
" arab patients are a special clientele .
they are nice and kind , but they have their ways , " she says .
" for example , they always come late for appointments and then they usually take over our entire clinic . "
brenner has also learned that women from the arab world are not introduced by their own names , and that the price for an operation is often considered negotiable .
while she 's gotten used to most customs , there 's one she still has a hard time with .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief surgeon natalia brenner has gotten used to most arab customs " the role of women , that 's something i still do n't understand , " she says .
" it is still strange for me to see that men make the decisions for arab women . "
sheik abdulrahman is no exception .
while his wife , sitting in an examination chair , might be the one about to undergo an operation , he 's the one who will have the final say .
brenner points to an ultrasound image and explains the details of the operation that will treat his wife 's varicose veins .
during the discussion , which takes place through an interpreter because the sheik does n't speak or understand german , his wife carefully watches her husband 's reactions .
despite the language barrier , comprehension is not a problem today in the elisee clinic .
nadhmi nefzi , a young man who follows the sheikh around like a shadow , is responsible for the interpreting at the clinic - he 's the clinic 's personal assistant .
he is dressed in a neat shirt , has carefully parted hair and is the model of discretion .
the young man translates the discussion into arabic , taking special care with the many medical terms .
sheik abdulrahman nods and looks at dr brenner - she can operate on his wife now .
he 's going to take a stroll through the city with nefzi .
known for its health care these kinds of health trips , the sheik says , cost a lot of money .
but as a professor of marine biology and a bank owner , he can afford it .
he 's been coming to germany for over 20 years ; recently , always to bad godesberg .
the sheik explains that the town 's clinics have acquired glowing reputations in the arab world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the whole family comes on these health trips " in the meantime , i 've gotten to know many doctors here , " he laughs .
" i 've become friends with a lot of them and even get special treatment . "
the doctors in bad godesberg are even recommended by the health section of the qatari embassy .
that 's common in arab countries , he says , strolling along the storefront windows of the city .
tailored to a new clientele a little while ago , munich was considered the place to go for medical care , but bad godesberg has knocked the bavarians off their perch , especially since many clinics here have tailored their services to a middle eastern clientele .
" and it 's quiet and safe and my family feels at home because there are so many other arabs here , " referring to those with diplomatic ties who did not move to berlin when the german government shifted capitals .
the sheik points to signs on local shops - the pharmacy , a jewelry store , a café and a souvenir shop - written in arabic .
personal assistant nefzi nods .
in addition to his translation duties he is also charged with making appointments to see high-end apartments .
arabs can be very discerning , he says .
" it 's very important that the environment is clean and that the apartment is representative of germany , " nefzi says .
" they want to have something to talk about back home . "
most health-related visitors from the middle east choose not to stay in hotels .
they consider the rooms impersonal and prefer to be able to prepare their own food .
once the stroll around town is done , the sheik returns to the clinic and waits for his wife to be released from the operating room .
the doctors report the procedure went well .
now it 's time to go shopping , but not in bad godesberg .
the family will have to head over to the bigger cities of cologne or dusseldorf , where they can visit shops with a selection of middle eastern foods wide enough to fit their discerning tastes .

in his work , renowned mexican author guillermo fadanelli portrays the dark side of his home - marked by drugs , prostitution and corruption . guillermo fadanelli , a tall man well over six feet , says he feels naked without his baseball cap on .
baseball is a favorite pastime in the city where he is at home - the largest city in all of latin america . " you ca n't reflect on a city like mexico city or turn it into fiction , " said fadanelli .
the city weighs on him ; it plays a central role in his books - the city with 108,000 taxis and 28,000 busses , and where the telephone books have 5,000 pages .
in mexico city , there 's no city planning worth speaking of , and city limits have long ceased to exist . it 's practically a euphemism to call this mass of concrete and people a city , says fadanelli .
rather than being a place that caters to the residents , it 's much more of an " urban territory , an ensemble of colonies , districts , suburbs - some hospitable , some hostile , " he adds . for fadanelli , mexico city is a " metastasis " that grows at random .
" here , there are people in power who want to make us think that they run this city , " he says , " but it 's a city that ca n't be governed . " bildunterschrift : nearly nine million people live in mexico city - many of them in poverty revolution in mexican storytelling in his novels , guillermo fadanelli conveys the pain of living here - and of being trapped here .
still , he 's not judgemental .
he simply shows reality : the good and the bad , without any moral conclusions . for silvia ruiz , director of the literature department at the universidad iberoamericana , one of the most renowned universities in latin america , fadanelli 's work - particularly his informal style and absence of moral judgement - represents a revolution in the mexican art of storytelling . " he can bring stories to an end wonderfully , " said ruiz , " he 's a writer who 's already secured a place in mexico 's literary history . " fadanelli knows his city so well because he is constantly walking through it .
" the romantic in me likes to walk from north to south in the early morning , " he said .
" i used to take the subway , i used to use all kinds of public transportation , but now i walk . " it takes him more than one and a half hours to walk from his house to the center of town . bildunterschrift : the sprawling city never seems to end the dark side of the city according to the author , corruption has practically become a national sport in mexico .
laws often go unheeded - and ensuring that they do n't is a daily struggle , whether it 's haggling with the taxi driver who demands too much money or with the police officer who is actually supposed to be upholding the laws . corruption and mexico 's crumbling justice system are touched on in fadanelli 's books .
he has experienced the problem first-hand . the author was framed and arrested just as he was about to introduce his novel " rock hudson 's other face " at the book fair in guadalajara . " they put a gram of cocaine in my pocket , accused me and brought me straight to a jail cell and did n't let me call anyone , " said fadanelli .
he spent two days in jail , without being able to place a single call .
after he was finally released , he returned to the book fair and presented his novel . however , no one believed what had happened to him , he said .
everyone thought he was just telling stories to make himself more interesting or to seem tough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guillermo fadanelli was born in mexico city in 1963 " i was really lucky , because it 's a really dangerous city , " said fadanelli .

in his work , renowned mexican author guillermo fadanelli portrays the dark side of his home - marked by drugs , prostitution and corruption . guillermo fadanelli , a tall man well over six feet , says he feels naked without his baseball cap on .
baseball is a favorite pastime in the city where he is at home - the largest city in all of latin america . " you ca n't reflect on a city like mexico city or turn it into fiction , " said fadanelli .
the city weighs on him ; it plays a central role in his books - the city with 108,000 taxis and 28,000 busses , and where the telephone books have 5,000 pages .
in mexico city , there 's no city planning worth speaking of , and city limits have long ceased to exist . it 's practically a euphemism to call this mass of concrete and people a city , says fadanelli .
rather than being a place that caters to the residents , it 's much more of an " urban territory , an ensemble of colonies , districts , suburbs - some hospitable , some hostile , " he adds . for fadanelli , mexico city is a " metastasis " that grows at random .
" here , there are people in power who want to make us think that they run this city , " he says , " but it 's a city that ca n't be governed . " bildunterschrift : nearly nine million people live in mexico city - many of them in poverty revolution in mexican storytelling in his novels , guillermo fadanelli conveys the pain of living here - and of being trapped here .
still , he 's not judgemental .

" he can bring stories to an end wonderfully , " said ruiz , " he 's a writer who 's already secured a place in mexico 's literary history . " fadanelli knows his city so well because he is constantly walking through it .
" the romantic in me likes to walk from north to south in the early morning , " he said .
" i used to take the subway , i used to use all kinds of public transportation , but now i walk . " it takes him more than one and a half hours to walk from his house to the center of town . bildunterschrift : the sprawling city never seems to end the dark side of the city according to the author , corruption has practically become a national sport in mexico .
laws often go unheeded - and ensuring that they do n't is a daily struggle , whether it 's haggling with the taxi driver who demands too much money or with the police officer who is actually supposed to be upholding the laws . corruption and mexico 's crumbling justice system are touched on in fadanelli 's books .
he has experienced the problem first-hand . the author was framed and arrested just as he was about to introduce his novel " rock hudson 's other face " at the book fair in guadalajara . " they put a gram of cocaine in my pocket , accused me and brought me straight to a jail cell and did n't let me call anyone , " said fadanelli .
he spent two days in jail , without being able to place a single call .
after he was finally released , he returned to the book fair and presented his novel . however , no one believed what had happened to him , he said .

baseball is a favorite pastime in the city where he is at home - the largest city in all of latin america . " you ca n't reflect on a city like mexico city or turn it into fiction , " said fadanelli .
the city weighs on him ; it plays a central role in his books - the city with 108,000 taxis and 28,000 busses , and where the telephone books have 5,000 pages .
in mexico city , there 's no city planning worth speaking of , and city limits have long ceased to exist . it 's practically a euphemism to call this mass of concrete and people a city , says fadanelli .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 12.08.2010 un labor report shows drastic increase in youth unemployment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more young people around the world are unemployed the international labor organization says global youth unemployment has reached record levels .
over 80 million 15 to 24-year-olds are without work , the report said , with increases in developed countries most extreme . according to a united nations report released on thursday , labor market trends for young people have taken a drastic turn for the worse since 2007 , when global youth unemployment remained fairly stagnant .
for the 10 years prior to the economic crisis , the report noted the number of unemployed youth around the world had increased by an average of 200,000 per year .
in 2009 , however , youth unemployment increased by a staggering 6.7 million .
sara elder , an economist with the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- and co-author of the report , says youth unemployment is most severe in the developed economies and non-eu , central and southeastern europe .
" in these two regions alone , we saw the highest annual increases that we have ever seen for any region since we began observing the trend in 1991 .
overall , the youth unemployment rate of 17.7 percent in developed economies also marks the highest we have ever seen , " elder told deutsche welle . eu governments looking to fend off hopelessness the report finds young women are hardest hit by unemployment in most regions .
the only exceptions are in the developed economies and the european union , where nearly twice as many males as females are unemployed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's apprentice system keeps most youths busy in the european union , germany displayed the lowest rate of youth unemployment .
around 8 percent of all germans between 16 and 24 looking for a job are out of work .
this is based most of all on the country 's apprentice system , in which companies offer three-year training positions to young germans regardless of education level .
this is a great contrast to the situation in other eu states such as estonia , latvia and lithuania , which according to the ilo report had the highest rates of youth unemployment in the 27-nation bloc .
in other developed eu countries , such as spain and the united kingdom , elder said many unemployed youth have become so discouraged that they are no longer even looking for work .
" governments everywhere are struggling to prevent a situation in which young people detach themselves completely from the labor market , having lost all hope of being able to provide themselves with a decent living .
unemployment is more a concern for developed economies than developing economies , " she said .
drastic unemployment in developing countries while only 10 percent of the global youth labor force lives in developed economies , youth unemployment there increased by 45 percent last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unofficial jobs are most common in developing nations the report added that roughly 90 percent of the world 's young people are living in developing countries - where under-employment and poverty are two of the most prevalent and serious problems .
steven kapsos , an ilo economist and also a co-author of the report , told deutsche welle that unemployed young people in developing countries do n't receive any benefits . thus , they are left with no choice : " they are forced by necessity to work in the informal economy , where they will most likely remain for the rest of their lives . "
" we estimate that 152 million youth were classified as working ' poor ' in 2008 and that is based on the standard international poverty line of $ 1.25 -lrb- 0.77 euro -rrb- per day .
this accounts for some 28 percent of all young workers around the world , " kapsos added .
the ilo , meanwhile , forecasts slight improvements in youth unemployment for almost all of the world 's regions next year .
the largest decrease in youth unemployment is expected in central and southeastern europe and the states formerly belonging to the soviet union .

as berlin remembers the event , new figures suggest more people than previously thought were killed on the inner german border from 1961-1989 . berlin commemorated on friday the 49th anniversary of the day the east german government began building the berlin wall . a memorial service was held at the chapel of reconciliation in the former death strip .
mayor klaus wowereit laid a wreath at the bernauer strasse memorial , in remembrance of those who were killed by gdr border guards . " it teaches us a lesson , " wowereit said .
" time and again , it is important to stand decisively against authoritarian regimes and dictatorships . " he urged that the memory of the berlin wall must sharpen appreciation of contemporary freedom and democracy . among a number of services held in berlin on friday , a street is to be renamed in memory of chris gueffroy , recognized as the last person killed trying to cross the border . greater number killed according to the official site that commemorates the berlin wall in the district of mitte , at least 136 people were killed by the east german border patrol while trying to escape from east to west berlin between 1961 and 1989 . but that 's not the whole story .
new figures from the privately-run wall museum , located at the former checkpoint charlie border crossing in berlin , say the total number of people who died trying to escape from east to west germany during those 28 years is 1,393 . " the number has risen by 46 compared with our research last year , " alexandra hildebrandt , chairwoman of the wall museum told deutsche welle . " the list includes those who died at the berlin wall , the baltic sea , the inner german border and neighboring countries like poland , bulgaria , czechoslovakia and hungary .
it also includes east german soldiers , for example those who committed suicide because they could n't deal with the regime , " she said . bildunterschrift : the wall became the symbol of the cold war tragic deaths one of those soldiers , whose suicide has only just come to light , took his own life just hours after construction on the wall had started .
" i cried all night when i read this , " hildebrandt said .
" he shot himself and left his wife a note saying : ' i ca n't do this anymore , i 'm too weak , forgive me , it 's better that way ' . "
in the early hours of august 13 , 1961 , the east german government took the west by surprise and ordered its army and police to stop all travel between east and west berlin and start work on the wall that would divide berlin until 1989 .
even the us secret service did not know of the project .
two months earlier , the east german leader walter ulbricht , head of the east german communist party -lrb- sed -rrb- , openly denied rumors that such a project was underway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germany had denied it was planning to build a wall on august 24 that year , just 11 days after the work on the wall had started , the first person was shot dead trying to escape .
guenter liftin 's murder shocked the world , but erich honecker , who was head of security then and would later become east germany 's leader and head of the sed , remained defiant .
" the building of the anti-fascist protective barrier stabilized the situation in europe and secured peace , " he said a desperate act in reality , the east german regime was in crisis .
by 1961 , 2.7 million people had decided to leave the country and live in the west .
communist ideology was starting to lose its luster , damaging the economy in the process .
in his famous ' ich bin ein berliner ' speech in 1963 in west berlin , then us president john f. kennedy described the berlin wall as " the most vivid and obvious demonstration of the failures of the communist system . "
today , 21 years after the wall came down , many are still afraid to talk about their own or their relatives ' experiences .
" they are still afraid , they are dominated by fear , possibly their whole lives , because the gdr was a dictatorship .
it was like a big prison , where people were afraid to talk , afraid to live , essentially , " hildebrandt told deutsche welle .
honecker firmly believed the wall would stand for 50 or even 100 years .
but the east german regime was powerless against the will of its people and a reform-oriented soviet union , which eventually , led to the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 .

the un has appealed for $ 460 million -lrb- 360 million euros -rrb- in aid . two weeks after the floods struck , the extent of the catastrophe remains unclear .
hundreds of roads and bridges have been destroyed , making it difficult to reach the flooded areas by anything but air .
the us military has tripled the number of its helicopters in pakistan to help with the relief efforts . on wednesday , john holmes , the un emergency relief coordinator , appealed for help from the member states of the united nations in new york . " ladies and gentlemen , assessment of losses or damages are still underway as you can imagine but it 's already very clear that these floods – the worst in pakistan for over 80 years have caused and are continuing to cause immense destruction and immense suffering , " he said gravely . " scale of disaster is horrendous " pakistan 's un ambassador abdullah hussain haroon told the un it was hard to confirm the number of deaths .
" the scale of this disaster is horrendous , " he stated . "
so far we have lost , in the three northern provinces , 4772 villages completely - just gone - that 's why we do n't know what the death toll is because we have no way of calculating at the moment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 14 million pakistanis are thought to be affected by the floods so far , it is known that at least 1,600 people have died and an estimated 14 million people are affected – some 8 percent of the pakistani population . half of those affected need immediate emergency relief if they are to survive .
they need food , clothes , shelter and clean drinking water .
moreover , they urgently need medical assistance " as the incidence of acute diarrhea and other water-borne diseases is rising worryingly , " according to john holmes . " cholera is also breaking out , " abdullah hussain haroon explained .
" that is going to be very dangerous .
drinking water and sachets for purifying it are going to become very important over the next few days . " death toll could rapidly rise even if the death toll from this disaster is not as high yet as from the 2004 tsunami or january 's earthquake in haiti , the un has warned that disease and food shortages could fast become deadly if the urgent needs of the people are not attended to . in pakistan itself , despite president zardari 's visit to the flooded areas on thursday , victims continued to complain about the slow response to the disaster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whole villages have been evacuated because of heavy flooding this man in khyber pakhtunkhwa spoke for thousands when he spoke to reporters : " we have been on the roadside for the past 12 days , we need food and tents but we have n't received food or tents . " on wednesday , john holmes ended his appeal with a warning that the destruction was far from over : " far from it .
having already affected the north of the country in late july and early august , the flood wave now continues to make its way through the southern province of sindh where millions more are expected to suffer from the combined impact of continuing torrential rains .

as berlin remembers the event , new figures suggest more people than previously thought were killed on the inner german border from 1961-1989 . berlin commemorated on friday the 49th anniversary of the day the east german government began building the berlin wall . a memorial service was held at the chapel of reconciliation in the former death strip .
mayor klaus wowereit laid a wreath at the bernauer strasse memorial , in remembrance of those who were killed by gdr border guards . " it teaches us a lesson , " wowereit said .
" time and again , it is important to stand decisively against authoritarian regimes and dictatorships . " he urged that the memory of the berlin wall must sharpen appreciation of contemporary freedom and democracy . among a number of services held in berlin on friday , a street is to be renamed in memory of chris gueffroy , recognized as the last person killed trying to cross the border . greater number killed according to the official site that commemorates the berlin wall in the district of mitte , at least 136 people were killed by the east german border patrol while trying to escape from east to west berlin between 1961 and 1989 . but that 's not the whole story .
new figures from the privately-run wall museum , located at the former checkpoint charlie border crossing in berlin , say the total number of people who died trying to escape from east to west germany during those 28 years is 1,393 . " the number has risen by 46 compared with our research last year , " alexandra hildebrandt , chairwoman of the wall museum told deutsche welle . " the list includes those who died at the berlin wall , the baltic sea , the inner german border and neighboring countries like poland , bulgaria , czechoslovakia and hungary .
it also includes east german soldiers , for example those who committed suicide because they could n't deal with the regime , " she said . bildunterschrift : the wall became the symbol of the cold war tragic deaths one of those soldiers , whose suicide has only just come to light , took his own life just hours after construction on the wall had started .
" i cried all night when i read this , " hildebrandt said .
" he shot himself and left his wife a note saying : ' i ca n't do this anymore , i 'm too weak , forgive me , it 's better that way ' . "
in the early hours of august 13 , 1961 , the east german government took the west by surprise and ordered its army and police to stop all travel between east and west berlin and start work on the wall that would divide berlin until 1989 .
even the us secret service did not know of the project .
two months earlier , the east german leader walter ulbricht , head of the east german communist party -lrb- sed -rrb- , openly denied rumors that such a project was underway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germany had denied it was planning to build a wall on august 24 that year , just 11 days after the work on the wall had started , the first person was shot dead trying to escape .
guenter liftin 's murder shocked the world , but erich honecker , who was head of security then and would later become east germany 's leader and head of the sed , remained defiant .
" the building of the anti-fascist protective barrier stabilized the situation in europe and secured peace , " he said a desperate act in reality , the east german regime was in crisis .
by 1961 , 2.7 million people had decided to leave the country and live in the west .
communist ideology was starting to lose its luster , damaging the economy in the process .
in his famous ' ich bin ein berliner ' speech in 1963 in west berlin , then us president john f. kennedy described the berlin wall as " the most vivid and obvious demonstration of the failures of the communist system . "
today , 21 years after the wall came down , many are still afraid to talk about their own or their relatives ' experiences .
" they are still afraid , they are dominated by fear , possibly their whole lives , because the gdr was a dictatorship .
it was like a big prison , where people were afraid to talk , afraid to live , essentially , " hildebrandt told deutsche welle .
honecker firmly believed the wall would stand for 50 or even 100 years .
but the east german regime was powerless against the will of its people and a reform-oriented soviet union , which eventually , led to the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 .

as berlin remembers the event , new figures suggest more people than previously thought were killed on the inner german border from 1961-1989 . berlin commemorated on friday the 49th anniversary of the day the east german government began building the berlin wall . a memorial service was held at the chapel of reconciliation in the former death strip .
mayor klaus wowereit laid a wreath at the bernauer strasse memorial , in remembrance of those who were killed by gdr border guards . " it teaches us a lesson , " wowereit said .
" time and again , it is important to stand decisively against authoritarian regimes and dictatorships . " he urged that the memory of the berlin wall must sharpen appreciation of contemporary freedom and democracy . among a number of services held in berlin on friday , a street is to be renamed in memory of chris gueffroy , recognized as the last person killed trying to cross the border . greater number killed according to the official site that commemorates the berlin wall in the district of mitte , at least 136 people were killed by the east german border patrol while trying to escape from east to west berlin between 1961 and 1989 . but that 's not the whole story .
new figures from the privately-run wall museum , located at the former checkpoint charlie border crossing in berlin , say the total number of people who died trying to escape from east to west germany during those 28 years is 1,393 . " the number has risen by 46 compared with our research last year , " alexandra hildebrandt , chairwoman of the wall museum told deutsche welle . " the list includes those who died at the berlin wall , the baltic sea , the inner german border and neighboring countries like poland , bulgaria , czechoslovakia and hungary .
it also includes east german soldiers , for example those who committed suicide because they could n't deal with the regime , " she said . bildunterschrift : the wall became the symbol of the cold war tragic deaths one of those soldiers , whose suicide has only just come to light , took his own life just hours after construction on the wall had started .
" i cried all night when i read this , " hildebrandt said .
" he shot himself and left his wife a note saying : ' i ca n't do this anymore , i 'm too weak , forgive me , it 's better that way ' . "
in the early hours of august 13 , 1961 , the east german government took the west by surprise and ordered its army and police to stop all travel between east and west berlin and start work on the wall that would divide berlin until 1989 .
even the us secret service did not know of the project .

secularists demand it be taken away from the presidential palace . supporters of late polish president lech kaczynski 's law and justice party have remained defiant in their vigil at the site of a cross erected in memory of their late hero - despite calls from church leaders to allow its removal .
those loyal to the former president see him as defender of polish roman catholic values and say that the cross should remain outside the presidential palace in a warsaw square until a more permanent structure is found for the site .
church officials have said that it is time for supporters to give up the fight - warning that they are being manipulated for political , not religious , reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secularists say the palace is not the place for a cross " to all those who pray at the cross we must say that - despite their good intentions - they are being exploited for political purposes .
we urge everyone to make the transfer of the cross possible , " press secretary for the polish episcopate , bishop stanislaw budzik , told reporters in warsaw on thursday .
the palace , now occupied by president bronislaw komorowski , unveiled a plaque on thursday commemorating the tragedy on the facade of a side-wing to the building .
a first attempt to move the cross - initially to a church in the old part of the city and later to a shrine in the south of the country - met with fierce opposition on august 3 .
both the church and the scout group that first erected the four-meter -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- wooden cross had agreed to the plan .
facebook campaign and rally but opposition is mounting to the cross staying in place .
secularists - many of them younger , and opposed to the policies of the former president - rallied on monday in response to a facebook campaign to have the cross removed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some think jaroslaw kaczynski is using the dispute for political capital by midnight , several thousand had gathered in front of the presidential palace chanting the slogan , " to a church ! "
the cross was spontaneously erected after the april 10 crash of the presidential plane in western russia , killing the president , his wife and 94 others .
as well as highlighting religious divisions , the row is indicative of the political tensions currently simmering in the country .
some critics of former president kaczynski were unhappy with his right-wing politics and traditional approach to family values .
opponents also say his nationalist and euroskeptic policies placed poland on an isolationist course within the european union .
current president komorowski is expected to take the country in a more pro-european direction .
commentators say kaczynski 's twin brother jaroslaw , who has called for the cross to stay in place , is possibly using the issue as a political weapon to gain support before the country 's parliamentary elections in 2011 .

secularists demand it be taken away from the presidential palace . supporters of late polish president lech kaczynski 's law and justice party have remained defiant in their vigil at the site of a cross erected in memory of their late hero - despite calls from church leaders to allow its removal .
those loyal to the former president see him as defender of polish roman catholic values and say that the cross should remain outside the presidential palace in a warsaw square until a more permanent structure is found for the site .
church officials have said that it is time for supporters to give up the fight - warning that they are being manipulated for political , not religious , reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secularists say the palace is not the place for a cross " to all those who pray at the cross we must say that - despite their good intentions - they are being exploited for political purposes .
we urge everyone to make the transfer of the cross possible , " press secretary for the polish episcopate , bishop stanislaw budzik , told reporters in warsaw on thursday .
the palace , now occupied by president bronislaw komorowski , unveiled a plaque on thursday commemorating the tragedy on the facade of a side-wing to the building .
a first attempt to move the cross - initially to a church in the old part of the city and later to a shrine in the south of the country - met with fierce opposition on august 3 .
both the church and the scout group that first erected the four-meter -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- wooden cross had agreed to the plan .
facebook campaign and rally but opposition is mounting to the cross staying in place .
secularists - many of them younger , and opposed to the policies of the former president - rallied on monday in response to a facebook campaign to have the cross removed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some think jaroslaw kaczynski is using the dispute for political capital by midnight , several thousand had gathered in front of the presidential palace chanting the slogan , " to a church ! "
the cross was spontaneously erected after the april 10 crash of the presidential plane in western russia , killing the president , his wife and 94 others .
as well as highlighting religious divisions , the row is indicative of the political tensions currently simmering in the country .
some critics of former president kaczynski were unhappy with his right-wing politics and traditional approach to family values .
opponents also say his nationalist and euroskeptic policies placed poland on an isolationist course within the european union .
current president komorowski is expected to take the country in a more pro-european direction .
commentators say kaczynski 's twin brother jaroslaw , who has called for the cross to stay in place , is possibly using the issue as a political weapon to gain support before the country 's parliamentary elections in 2011 .

as berlin remembers the event , new figures suggest more people than previously thought were killed on the inner german border from 1961-1989 . berlin commemorated on friday the 49th anniversary of the day the east german government began building the berlin wall . a memorial service was held at the chapel of reconciliation in the former death strip .
mayor klaus wowereit laid a wreath at the bernauer strasse memorial , in remembrance of those who were killed by gdr border guards . " it teaches us a lesson , " wowereit said .
" time and again , it is important to stand decisively against authoritarian regimes and dictatorships . " he urged that the memory of the berlin wall must sharpen appreciation of contemporary freedom and democracy . among a number of services held in berlin on friday , a street is to be renamed in memory of chris gueffroy , recognized as the last person killed trying to cross the border . greater number killed according to the official site that commemorates the berlin wall in the district of mitte , at least 136 people were killed by the east german border patrol while trying to escape from east to west berlin between 1961 and 1989 . but that 's not the whole story .
new figures from the privately-run wall museum , located at the former checkpoint charlie border crossing in berlin , say the total number of people who died trying to escape from east to west germany during those 28 years is 1,393 . " the number has risen by 46 compared with our research last year , " alexandra hildebrandt , chairwoman of the wall museum told deutsche welle . " the list includes those who died at the berlin wall , the baltic sea , the inner german border and neighboring countries like poland , bulgaria , czechoslovakia and hungary .
it also includes east german soldiers , for example those who committed suicide because they could n't deal with the regime , " she said . bildunterschrift : the wall became the symbol of the cold war tragic deaths one of those soldiers , whose suicide has only just come to light , took his own life just hours after construction on the wall had started .
" i cried all night when i read this , " hildebrandt said .
" he shot himself and left his wife a note saying : ' i ca n't do this anymore , i 'm too weak , forgive me , it 's better that way ' . "
in the early hours of august 13 , 1961 , the east german government took the west by surprise and ordered its army and police to stop all travel between east and west berlin and start work on the wall that would divide berlin until 1989 .
even the us secret service did not know of the project .
two months earlier , the east german leader walter ulbricht , head of the east german communist party -lrb- sed -rrb- , openly denied rumors that such a project was underway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germany had denied it was planning to build a wall on august 24 that year , just 11 days after the work on the wall had started , the first person was shot dead trying to escape .
guenter liftin 's murder shocked the world , but erich honecker , who was head of security then and would later become east germany 's leader and head of the sed , remained defiant .
" the building of the anti-fascist protective barrier stabilized the situation in europe and secured peace , " he said a desperate act in reality , the east german regime was in crisis .
by 1961 , 2.7 million people had decided to leave the country and live in the west .
communist ideology was starting to lose its luster , damaging the economy in the process .
in his famous ' ich bin ein berliner ' speech in 1963 in west berlin , then us president john f. kennedy described the berlin wall as " the most vivid and obvious demonstration of the failures of the communist system . "
today , 21 years after the wall came down , many are still afraid to talk about their own or their relatives ' experiences .
" they are still afraid , they are dominated by fear , possibly their whole lives , because the gdr was a dictatorship .
it was like a big prison , where people were afraid to talk , afraid to live , essentially , " hildebrandt told deutsche welle .
honecker firmly believed the wall would stand for 50 or even 100 years .
but the east german regime was powerless against the will of its people and a reform-oriented soviet union , which eventually , led to the fall of the berlin wall on november 9 , 1989 .

in his work , renowned mexican author guillermo fadanelli portrays the dark side of his home - marked by drugs , prostitution and corruption . guillermo fadanelli , a tall man well over six feet , says he feels naked without his baseball cap on .
baseball is a favorite pastime in the city where he is at home - the largest city in all of latin america . " you ca n't reflect on a city like mexico city or turn it into fiction , " said fadanelli .
the city weighs on him ; it plays a central role in his books - the city with 108,000 taxis and 28,000 busses , and where the telephone books have 5,000 pages .
in mexico city , there 's no city planning worth speaking of , and city limits have long ceased to exist . it 's practically a euphemism to call this mass of concrete and people a city , says fadanelli .
rather than being a place that caters to the residents , it 's much more of an " urban territory , an ensemble of colonies , districts , suburbs - some hospitable , some hostile , " he adds . for fadanelli , mexico city is a " metastasis " that grows at random .
" here , there are people in power who want to make us think that they run this city , " he says , " but it 's a city that ca n't be governed . " bildunterschrift : nearly nine million people live in mexico city - many of them in poverty revolution in mexican storytelling in his novels , guillermo fadanelli conveys the pain of living here - and of being trapped here .
still , he 's not judgemental .
he simply shows reality : the good and the bad , without any moral conclusions . for silvia ruiz , director of the literature department at the universidad iberoamericana , one of the most renowned universities in latin america , fadanelli 's work - particularly his informal style and absence of moral judgement - represents a revolution in the mexican art of storytelling . " he can bring stories to an end wonderfully , " said ruiz , " he 's a writer who 's already secured a place in mexico 's literary history . " fadanelli knows his city so well because he is constantly walking through it .
" the romantic in me likes to walk from north to south in the early morning , " he said .
" i used to take the subway , i used to use all kinds of public transportation , but now i walk . " it takes him more than one and a half hours to walk from his house to the center of town . bildunterschrift : the sprawling city never seems to end the dark side of the city according to the author , corruption has practically become a national sport in mexico .
laws often go unheeded - and ensuring that they do n't is a daily struggle , whether it 's haggling with the taxi driver who demands too much money or with the police officer who is actually supposed to be upholding the laws . corruption and mexico 's crumbling justice system are touched on in fadanelli 's books .
he has experienced the problem first-hand . the author was framed and arrested just as he was about to introduce his novel " rock hudson 's other face " at the book fair in guadalajara . " they put a gram of cocaine in my pocket , accused me and brought me straight to a jail cell and did n't let me call anyone , " said fadanelli .
he spent two days in jail , without being able to place a single call .
after he was finally released , he returned to the book fair and presented his novel . however , no one believed what had happened to him , he said .
everyone thought he was just telling stories to make himself more interesting or to seem tough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guillermo fadanelli was born in mexico city in 1963 " i was really lucky , because it 's a really dangerous city , " said fadanelli .
" its dark side is really dark .
its bright side is beyond compare , but its dark side is horrible - practically hellish . " a love-hate relationship for everyone 's health , it would be better if mexico city did n't exist , fadanelli once wrote .
he would rather not grow old here and would prefer buenos aires or havanna , or even madrid , where he has many friends , or berlin , where he lived for a year . still , after his time in berlin , he was drawn back to mexico city , " as if pulled by a magnet . " some of guillermo fadanelli 's major works in english translation include " see you at breakfast ? " -lrb- 2009 -rrb- , " rock hudson 's other face " -lrb- 2006 -rrb- , and " compare un rifle " -lrb- 2004 -rrb- . author : claudia herrera-pahl -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in his work , renowned mexican author guillermo fadanelli portrays the dark side of his home - marked by drugs , prostitution and corruption . guillermo fadanelli , a tall man well over six feet , says he feels naked without his baseball cap on .
baseball is a favorite pastime in the city where he is at home - the largest city in all of latin america . " you ca n't reflect on a city like mexico city or turn it into fiction , " said fadanelli .
the city weighs on him ; it plays a central role in his books - the city with 108,000 taxis and 28,000 busses , and where the telephone books have 5,000 pages .
in mexico city , there 's no city planning worth speaking of , and city limits have long ceased to exist . it 's practically a euphemism to call this mass of concrete and people a city , says fadanelli .
rather than being a place that caters to the residents , it 's much more of an " urban territory , an ensemble of colonies , districts , suburbs - some hospitable , some hostile , " he adds . for fadanelli , mexico city is a " metastasis " that grows at random .
" here , there are people in power who want to make us think that they run this city , " he says , " but it 's a city that ca n't be governed . " bildunterschrift : nearly nine million people live in mexico city - many of them in poverty revolution in mexican storytelling in his novels , guillermo fadanelli conveys the pain of living here - and of being trapped here .
still , he 's not judgemental .
he simply shows reality : the good and the bad , without any moral conclusions . for silvia ruiz , director of the literature department at the universidad iberoamericana , one of the most renowned universities in latin america , fadanelli 's work - particularly his informal style and absence of moral judgement - represents a revolution in the mexican art of storytelling . " he can bring stories to an end wonderfully , " said ruiz , " he 's a writer who 's already secured a place in mexico 's literary history . " fadanelli knows his city so well because he is constantly walking through it .
" the romantic in me likes to walk from north to south in the early morning , " he said .
" i used to take the subway , i used to use all kinds of public transportation , but now i walk . " it takes him more than one and a half hours to walk from his house to the center of town . bildunterschrift : the sprawling city never seems to end the dark side of the city according to the author , corruption has practically become a national sport in mexico .
laws often go unheeded - and ensuring that they do n't is a daily struggle , whether it 's haggling with the taxi driver who demands too much money or with the police officer who is actually supposed to be upholding the laws . corruption and mexico 's crumbling justice system are touched on in fadanelli 's books .
he has experienced the problem first-hand . the author was framed and arrested just as he was about to introduce his novel " rock hudson 's other face " at the book fair in guadalajara . " they put a gram of cocaine in my pocket , accused me and brought me straight to a jail cell and did n't let me call anyone , " said fadanelli .
he spent two days in jail , without being able to place a single call .
after he was finally released , he returned to the book fair and presented his novel . however , no one believed what had happened to him , he said .
everyone thought he was just telling stories to make himself more interesting or to seem tough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guillermo fadanelli was born in mexico city in 1963 " i was really lucky , because it 's a really dangerous city , " said fadanelli .
" its dark side is really dark .
its bright side is beyond compare , but its dark side is horrible - practically hellish . " a love-hate relationship for everyone 's health , it would be better if mexico city did n't exist , fadanelli once wrote .
he would rather not grow old here and would prefer buenos aires or havanna , or even madrid , where he has many friends , or berlin , where he lived for a year . still , after his time in berlin , he was drawn back to mexico city , " as if pulled by a magnet . " some of guillermo fadanelli 's major works in english translation include " see you at breakfast ? " -lrb- 2009 -rrb- , " rock hudson 's other face " -lrb- 2006 -rrb- , and " compare un rifle " -lrb- 2004 -rrb- . author : claudia herrera-pahl -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
