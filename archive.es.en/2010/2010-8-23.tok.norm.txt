the total number of soldiers will be cut to around 165,000 , with compulsory service practically abolished . defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg presented his draft plans for the future of the german army to government ministers on monday .
the model guttenberg unveiled will see the present 252,000 soldiers cut to 163,500 over the next few years , a reduction of around a third .
conscription will be suspended in the short term , with young men no longer called up to do compulsory service .
but guttenberg stressed that it was important conscription retains its place in the constitution , in case it becomes viable again in the future .
" by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better , " guttenberg said after discussing his proposals with coalition partners .
knock-on effects the chosen model would mean a reduction in the professional standing army from around 195,000 soldiers to 156,000 .
the cuts mean that the army would be left with three tank battalions , two artillery battalions and one paratrooper regiment .
the civilian service alternative to military conscription , an important provider of labor to germany 's care homes , will also be suspended .
family minister kristina schroeder proposed on monday to introduce a national voluntary community service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has conscripted young men into its armed forces since 1957 " i 'm not giving myself hope that we can completely replace what we have now , " schroeder told reporters in berlin .
but she celebrated the fact that women would be able to perform community service for the first time .
the proposal to suspend rather than scrap conscription altogether postpones a contentious debate that has been bedevilling chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition in recent weeks .
merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- sees itself as a staunch defender of compulsory military service , though its military impracticality and high cost have long threatened the ideal of a ' citizen 's army . '
' voluntary conscription ' guttenberg , of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , hopes to mollify his party colleagues with the new " voluntary military service " model , which he says represents " a modern variation for the citizen to take on responsibility . "
the government is hoping to attract volunteers to sign on to this new scheme for up to 23 months by promising driver 's licenses , university places and other fringe benefits .
women would be included amongst an estimated 7,500 army volunteers .
" not enough to safeguard the regeneration of the troops with up-and-coming soldiers , " criticized ulrich kirsch , head of the armed forces association .
the defense ministry is aiming to cut some 8.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- off its budget over the next four years , though guttenberg warned that savings in new armament projects would also be needed .

merkel said that a change was needed in the way members of her government behaved . chancellor angela merkel said that apparent disunity within her ruling center-right coalition was to blame for a dip in voter approval ratings for member parties .
in an interview with the public television station zdf , merkel said that her government needed to make tough decisions .
however , she said the nature of discussion within the coalition - which has been accused of excessive bickering - was partly responsible for alienating the electorate .
" i think we have n't managed to reach people partly because the confusion of voices and the way we have treated each other have not been what is to be expected of us , " merkel said , adding that the situation needed to be improved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coalition parties have lost ground since the election last year in the interview on sunday , merkel said that her government could be particularly satisfied with its record on the economy .
the chancellor said she was confident about regaining opinion poll approval as soon as important decisions facing the country had been made , by the end of the year .
questions to be answered merkel said financial stability , health , education for the children of welfare recipients , energy policy and reforms to the military were her government 's top priorities .
the chancellor said that she believed that after these decisions were taken , voters would understand that germany was " better equipped for the future . "
in the interview following her vacation in italy , merkel reaffirmed her commitment to introducing a tax on nuclear power providers , despite objections from the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is open to a suspension of compulsory military service the chancellor also said she was open to a suspension of germany 's compulsory military service .
both issues have been the subject of heated debate within the coalition .
in an opinion poll released last week , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- moved ahead of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who along with bavarian sister party the csu share power with the liberal free democrats fdp .
the spd had 32 percent support compared to 31 percent for the cdu and csu in the poll conducted by germany 's allensbach institute .
the fdp had just six percent .
the result contrasts with the general election in september 2009 when the cdu and csu won almost 34 percent of the popular vote , and the fdp almost 15 percent , compared with 23 percent for the spd .

the on-board air conditioning also failed , causing minor health scares . an express train from berlin to munich ground to a halt close to stuttgart on sunday , after suffering engine failure .
the 420 passengers on board were stranded in a tunnel near vaihingen an der enz in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg for over three hours without air conditioning .
one was later hospitalized and three more required minor medical treatment because of the rising temperatures on board .
the inter city express -lrb- ice -rrb- train stopped because of a problem with the engine , which also powers the climate control systems .
however , batteries continued to power the lights , toilets and door switches during the lengthy delay .
plan b german rail operator deutsche bahn first tried to solve the problem by sending a locomotive to tow the stranded train to its next stop in stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german rail service has endured a trying summer however , when this attempt failed , a replacement was sent instead , and passengers eventually switched trains inside the tunnel .
a deutsche bahn spokesman said the train stopped at around 1 p.m. , with the replacement eventually arriving at 4:30 p.m.
critics said the prolonged wait showed that the german railway service lacks the capacity to deal with unexpected problems .
" if it 's too much to ask of deutsche bahn to tow away one stranded ice in a case like this , " regional head of the train passengers association pro-bahn , stefan buhl said , " then it 's difficult to imagine what might happen in a genuine catastrophe . "
the breakdown forced deutsche bahn to close the line in both directions for the entire time period – diverting other services onto an older , slower line , delaying them by roughly quarter of an hour .
deutsche bahn is legally obliged to pay back half the cost of the ticket to any passengers whose trains are delayed by two hours or more .
it 's been a difficult summer for the german railway operator , which made the headlines during a july heat-wave when the air conditioning systems failed on three ice trains and 44 passengers collapsed in the heat .

the total number of soldiers will be cut to around 165,000 , with compulsory service practically abolished . defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg presented his draft plans for the future of the german army to government ministers on monday .
the model guttenberg unveiled will see the present 252,000 soldiers cut to 163,500 over the next few years , a reduction of around a third .
conscription will be suspended in the short term , with young men no longer called up to do compulsory service .
but guttenberg stressed that it was important conscription retains its place in the constitution , in case it becomes viable again in the future .
" by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better , " guttenberg said after discussing his proposals with coalition partners .
knock-on effects the chosen model would mean a reduction in the professional standing army from around 195,000 soldiers to 156,000 .
the cuts mean that the army would be left with three tank battalions , two artillery battalions and one paratrooper regiment .
the civilian service alternative to military conscription , an important provider of labor to germany 's care homes , will also be suspended .
family minister kristina schroeder proposed on monday to introduce a national voluntary community service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has conscripted young men into its armed forces since 1957 " i 'm not giving myself hope that we can completely replace what we have now , " schroeder told reporters in berlin .
but she celebrated the fact that women would be able to perform community service for the first time .
the proposal to suspend rather than scrap conscription altogether postpones a contentious debate that has been bedevilling chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition in recent weeks .
merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- sees itself as a staunch defender of compulsory military service , though its military impracticality and high cost have long threatened the ideal of a ' citizen 's army . '
' voluntary conscription ' guttenberg , of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , hopes to mollify his party colleagues with the new " voluntary military service " model , which he says represents " a modern variation for the citizen to take on responsibility . "
the government is hoping to attract volunteers to sign on to this new scheme for up to 23 months by promising driver 's licenses , university places and other fringe benefits .
women would be included amongst an estimated 7,500 army volunteers .
" not enough to safeguard the regeneration of the troops with up-and-coming soldiers , " criticized ulrich kirsch , head of the armed forces association .
the defense ministry is aiming to cut some 8.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- off its budget over the next four years , though guttenberg warned that savings in new armament projects would also be needed .

the total number of soldiers will be cut to around 165,000 , with compulsory service practically abolished . defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg presented his draft plans for the future of the german army to government ministers on monday .
the model guttenberg unveiled will see the present 252,000 soldiers cut to 163,500 over the next few years , a reduction of around a third .
conscription will be suspended in the short term , with young men no longer called up to do compulsory service .
but guttenberg stressed that it was important conscription retains its place in the constitution , in case it becomes viable again in the future .
" by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better , " guttenberg said after discussing his proposals with coalition partners .
knock-on effects the chosen model would mean a reduction in the professional standing army from around 195,000 soldiers to 156,000 .
the cuts mean that the army would be left with three tank battalions , two artillery battalions and one paratrooper regiment .
the civilian service alternative to military conscription , an important provider of labor to germany 's care homes , will also be suspended .
family minister kristina schroeder proposed on monday to introduce a national voluntary community service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has conscripted young men into its armed forces since 1957 " i 'm not giving myself hope that we can completely replace what we have now , " schroeder told reporters in berlin .
but she celebrated the fact that women would be able to perform community service for the first time .
the proposal to suspend rather than scrap conscription altogether postpones a contentious debate that has been bedevilling chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition in recent weeks .
merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- sees itself as a staunch defender of compulsory military service , though its military impracticality and high cost have long threatened the ideal of a ' citizen 's army . '
' voluntary conscription ' guttenberg , of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , hopes to mollify his party colleagues with the new " voluntary military service " model , which he says represents " a modern variation for the citizen to take on responsibility . "
the government is hoping to attract volunteers to sign on to this new scheme for up to 23 months by promising driver 's licenses , university places and other fringe benefits .
women would be included amongst an estimated 7,500 army volunteers .
" not enough to safeguard the regeneration of the troops with up-and-coming soldiers , " criticized ulrich kirsch , head of the armed forces association .
the defense ministry is aiming to cut some 8.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- off its budget over the next four years , though guttenberg warned that savings in new armament projects would also be needed .

" the problem is that the law is unfair .
there 's a trend in germany and elsewhere for people to have more than one nationality , " said marei pelzer , legal consultant for pro asyl , an organization that focuses on the rights of refugees and immigrants .
" we already have 4.5 million people in germany with more than one nationality , around 53 percent of those being granted german citizenship have dual nationality , " she told deutsche welle .

being born in germany gives them the right to german citizenship , but only if they give up their parents ' nationality by the time they turn 21 .
this so-called ' duty to choose ' , which is unique to germany , is controversial , not least because there are countries , like iran , morocco , afghanistan and some latin american countries , which do not allow citizens to give up their nationality , so in those cases , dual nationality is already being granted , which creates what the ngos call a two-class system .

in the autumn , the german parliament will debate a bill introduced by the opposition parties , the social democrats and the greens , which calls for the restrictions on dual citizenship to be abolished .
but many members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party argue that citizenship is a question of loyalty .
" he or she has to accept german citizenship , that is all we 're asking in terms of integration , " reinhard grindel , home affairs expert of the christian democrats in parliament , told german public radio deutschlandradio kultur .

" the government needs to recognize the signs of the times , it should not just preach the need for integration , but instead focus on creating the legal basis for a modern immigration state , " pelzer told deutsche welle .
" there are 82 million people in germany , 6.7 million of those are not german nationals and 1.3 million were born here , but still do n't have german citizenship .

22 1990 is one of the most historic in german post-war history .
after four decades of division , the decision was made by the east german parliament to united with west germany on oct .
3 , 1990 . after a night-long discussion , that ended in the early hours of aug .
23 , 1990 , the decision was made for the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- to be absorbed into the federal republic of germany -lrb- frg -rrb- .
at a special session of the east german parliament , the volkskammer , the representatives voted to merge with the west .
instead of a brand new constitution to cover the new unified state , it was decided to just incorporate the gdr under the existing constitution .
the former east was incorporated into the west under article 23 of the federal republic 's basic law .
heavy debates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly elected parliament effectively voted to disband itself in 1990 on 18 mar . , the people of the gdr had held the first democratic elections for the volkskammer .
the main aim of this new parliament was to prepare for accession to the federal republic .
by the summer of 1990 , the gdr and frg had created a single economic zone , with the deutschmark being used as the sole currency .
the gdr had also adopted large aspects of the economic and legal systems of the west .
by august , not a single meeting of the volkskammer passed without the subject of ' immediate accession ' being discussed .
for the then-prime minister of the gdr , lothar de maiziere , the time had come to seize the initiative .
" after a regular session in the afternoon of aug .
22 , " he recalled , " -lsb- we decided -rsb- to carry on with a special session with the sole agenda item of setting a timeline for german reunification . "
although it had been thought best to implement a speedy accession , not all parliamentarians were in agreement with the prime minister .
wolfgang ullman , a representative from the alliance 90 party urged de maiziere to stop proceedings .
ullman said he would report him to the prosecutor general of the gdr for high treason .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ullman -lrb- r . -rrb- did not agree with de maiziere 's approach however , a little later , the premier of the east german state of saxony-anhalt , reinhard hoeppner , opened the special session .
searching for the right date full discussions began immediately , with lothar de maiziere making the formal request to join with the federal republic but giving no specific date .
he proposed some time before october , as it would be the 41st anniversary of the gdr on oct .
14 , and he felt this date was symbolic .
" i thought that we could have the first free unified national elections on the oct .
14 , " de maiziere said .
" taking power back from the sovereign body and giving it to the new parliament . "
however it soon became clear that de maiziere 's date would not find a majority .
except for the successor party to the east german ruling sed , the pds -lrb- party for democratic socialism -rrb- , no one wanted to experience the 41st anniversary of the gdr a week early .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse was a member of the gdr parliament in 1990 after a long debate , another solution was offered by wolfgang thierse , a representative of the spd in the chamber .
he suggested a ' two-plus-four ' approach .
terms and conditions since may , the ' two-plus-four ' talks had been held between the two german foreign ministers and their four counterparts from the victorious allied nations .
the discussions centred on the allies withdrawing their troops and rights from germany .
the talks were due to come to a close on sept .
12 , in moscow .
wolfgang thierse suggested a date following this meeting on sept .
13 to be the official accession day .
however it was thought that this timeline too would not reach approval .
" it was clear that by sept .
12 , the ' two plus four ' contract would not be ratified , " lothar de maiziere said .
the final reunification date of oct .
3 , 1990 , came to be decided because it coincided with an international foreign ministers ' conference in new york on oct .
1 , .
the foreign ministers from the allied countries said they wished to withdraw their troops from the parts of germany they were occupying on oct .
3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two german foreign ministers : gdr 's markus meckel -lrb- l . -rrb- and frg 's hans-dietrich genscher " this is how the date of oct .
3 came about , " recalled de maiziere .
a special day for lothar de maiziere , the date of oct .
3 is a truly special one .
by then , the 50-year-old had spent half his life in the gdr and was touched by the socialist state .
" regardless of whether rejects or disowns the system , there is still a sense of loyalty to it , " he said .
therefore for de maiziere and for many others from the gdr , " this new beginning is not easy . "
however he added that for all politicians elected to the chamber of the people , it was clear that " our main purpose was to abolish ourselves . "

after four decades of division , the decision was made by the east german parliament to united with west germany on oct .
3 , 1990 . after a night-long discussion , that ended in the early hours of aug .
23 , 1990 , the decision was made for the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- to be absorbed into the federal republic of germany -lrb- frg -rrb- .
at a special session of the east german parliament , the volkskammer , the representatives voted to merge with the west .
instead of a brand new constitution to cover the new unified state , it was decided to just incorporate the gdr under the existing constitution .
the former east was incorporated into the west under article 23 of the federal republic 's basic law .
heavy debates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly elected parliament effectively voted to disband itself in 1990 on 18 mar . , the people of the gdr had held the first democratic elections for the volkskammer .
the main aim of this new parliament was to prepare for accession to the federal republic .
by the summer of 1990 , the gdr and frg had created a single economic zone , with the deutschmark being used as the sole currency .
the gdr had also adopted large aspects of the economic and legal systems of the west .
by august , not a single meeting of the volkskammer passed without the subject of ' immediate accession ' being discussed .

" i thought that we could have the first free unified national elections on the oct .

" taking power back from the sovereign body and giving it to the new parliament . "
however it soon became clear that de maiziere 's date would not find a majority .

merkel said that a change was needed in the way members of her government behaved . chancellor angela merkel said that apparent disunity within her ruling center-right coalition was to blame for a dip in voter approval ratings for member parties .
in an interview with the public television station zdf , merkel said that her government needed to make tough decisions .
however , she said the nature of discussion within the coalition - which has been accused of excessive bickering - was partly responsible for alienating the electorate .
" i think we have n't managed to reach people partly because the confusion of voices and the way we have treated each other have not been what is to be expected of us , " merkel said , adding that the situation needed to be improved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coalition parties have lost ground since the election last year in the interview on sunday , merkel said that her government could be particularly satisfied with its record on the economy .
the chancellor said she was confident about regaining opinion poll approval as soon as important decisions facing the country had been made , by the end of the year .
questions to be answered merkel said financial stability , health , education for the children of welfare recipients , energy policy and reforms to the military were her government 's top priorities .
the chancellor said that she believed that after these decisions were taken , voters would understand that germany was " better equipped for the future . "
in the interview following her vacation in italy , merkel reaffirmed her commitment to introducing a tax on nuclear power providers , despite objections from the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is open to a suspension of compulsory military service the chancellor also said she was open to a suspension of germany 's compulsory military service .
both issues have been the subject of heated debate within the coalition .
in an opinion poll released last week , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- moved ahead of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who along with bavarian sister party the csu share power with the liberal free democrats fdp .
the spd had 32 percent support compared to 31 percent for the cdu and csu in the poll conducted by germany 's allensbach institute .
the fdp had just six percent .
the result contrasts with the general election in september 2009 when the cdu and csu won almost 34 percent of the popular vote , and the fdp almost 15 percent , compared with 23 percent for the spd .

most of the 350,000 inhabitants have already been evacuated but the floods threaten to wreak havoc . as more towns are under imminent threat of flooding and the authorities battle with heavy monsoon rains , there are millions of people in emergency camps who are in desperate need of relief . the german commissioner for humanitarian aid markus loening recently visited the flooded areas of pakistan and got a first-hand insight into the goings on at two camps . " it 's worst for the children , " he told deutsche welle .
" there are very many women with young children .
the estimates are that 90,000 babies are going to be born in the coming weeks and that a third of them are at acute risk of not surviving the first days .
these women are in very rudimentary tents .
they can see down onto their flooded villages .
it 's all very shocking .

loening said that medical aid was crucial but that many people still needed just the basics . " some six million people need emergency help , they need food to survive .
the children get biscuits .
poland has donated biscuits .
we could also donate them .
children can survive on them because they are high-energy biscuits .
they are being distributed there .
baby food is also being distributed .
if they get that , they can survive one , two or three days .
food and clean water are what ’ s most important at the moment , " loening said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is not enough food for everyone at the relief camps he added that the cost of such products is low but that the sheer numbers of people needing supplies is making deliveries logistically difficult . the world food program has reached over a million people .
it has called for more helicopters to get food to people who remain isolated by the high flood waters . loening dispelled doubts that donations were not going to the right places .
he said that all the donations to german organizations were going " one-to-one " to the people who needed it . donor fatigue in pakistan and abroad if the west has been criticized for its sluggish response to the floods and a form of donor fatigue , the pakistani population 's distrust of the weak civilian government has reportedly also had a negative impact on donations from pakistanis themselves . " this trust deficit has created a situation where the people are not coming forward , " said tayyab siddique , a pakistani political expert . the army on the other hand has received much praise for its relief operations , although political expert ayesha siddika explained there was some marketing going on : " it ' not the way they 're doing work .
it 's how their work is being presented . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tents in the emergency camps are very rudimentary observers do not predict , however , that the political situation will change much as a result of this image-boosting , as it is widely thought that the military already holds the power behind the scenes . nor do they think the taliban will benefit unduly as their emergency relief operations are reportedly as chaotic as those of the authorities . positive for pakistani-west relations however , ayesha siddika believes that the way the floods are handled by the west could have a positive impact : " the more the west helps , it will be , i mean one of the spin offs will be of course improvement of relations , doing away with misunderstandings .

however , police say the damage was not motivated by any anti-german feeling . a world war i cemetery for german soldiers in northeastern france has been desecrated by vandals , local police said on sunday .
drunken youths broke and uprooted 72 grave crosses and damaged one jewish stele at the cemetery in laon , in the picardy region .
two young men , aged 18 and 19 and already known to police , were arrested .
eyewitnesses reported that there were four culprits in total , who had damaged graves by hurtling around the graveyard on motorbikes .
" there is no xenophobic aspect to these deeds , only acts of alcoholism , " the regional police authority said .
" these desecrations do not appear to be anti-german in nature . "
around 3,500 people are buried at the champ-de-manoeuvre cemetery , many of whom are german soldiers who fell in battle between 1914 and 1918 , or were patients at the nearby german military hospitals which remained in operation until 1920 .

most of the 350,000 inhabitants have already been evacuated but the floods threaten to wreak havoc . as more towns are under imminent threat of flooding and the authorities battle with heavy monsoon rains , there are millions of people in emergency camps who are in desperate need of relief . the german commissioner for humanitarian aid markus loening recently visited the flooded areas of pakistan and got a first-hand insight into the goings on at two camps . " it 's worst for the children , " he told deutsche welle .
" there are very many women with young children .
the estimates are that 90,000 babies are going to be born in the coming weeks and that a third of them are at acute risk of not surviving the first days .
these women are in very rudimentary tents .
they can see down onto their flooded villages .
it 's all very shocking . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 350,000 people have been evacuated from shadadkot in sindh millions are in need of basic supplies concern that there could be an outbreak of disease , including typhoid , hepatitis and cholera continues to grow .
loening said that medical aid was crucial but that many people still needed just the basics . " some six million people need emergency help , they need food to survive .
the children get biscuits .
poland has donated biscuits .
we could also donate them .
children can survive on them because they are high-energy biscuits .
they are being distributed there .
baby food is also being distributed .
if they get that , they can survive one , two or three days .
food and clean water are what ’ s most important at the moment , " loening said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is not enough food for everyone at the relief camps he added that the cost of such products is low but that the sheer numbers of people needing supplies is making deliveries logistically difficult . the world food program has reached over a million people .
it has called for more helicopters to get food to people who remain isolated by the high flood waters . loening dispelled doubts that donations were not going to the right places .
he said that all the donations to german organizations were going " one-to-one " to the people who needed it . donor fatigue in pakistan and abroad if the west has been criticized for its sluggish response to the floods and a form of donor fatigue , the pakistani population 's distrust of the weak civilian government has reportedly also had a negative impact on donations from pakistanis themselves . " this trust deficit has created a situation where the people are not coming forward , " said tayyab siddique , a pakistani political expert . the army on the other hand has received much praise for its relief operations , although political expert ayesha siddika explained there was some marketing going on : " it ' not the way they 're doing work .
it 's how their work is being presented . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tents in the emergency camps are very rudimentary observers do not predict , however , that the political situation will change much as a result of this image-boosting , as it is widely thought that the military already holds the power behind the scenes . nor do they think the taliban will benefit unduly as their emergency relief operations are reportedly as chaotic as those of the authorities . positive for pakistani-west relations however , ayesha siddika believes that the way the floods are handled by the west could have a positive impact : " the more the west helps , it will be , i mean one of the spin offs will be of course improvement of relations , doing away with misunderstandings . " donations from the international community have neared 500 million dollars already but the un has warned that pakistan will be needing help for years . the international monetary fund is currently looking at ways of restructuring a $ 10 billion loan for pakistan . author : anne thomas editor : disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's not perfectly clear the mechanism which causes this , " explained one of the researchers jarrod welch . " one hypothesis is that warmer temperatures increase respiration in the rice plant , which consumes energy .
if these warmer temperatures occur at night time , there is no offsetting of the synthesis .
so , warmer temperatures mean increased respiration , increased energy consumption in the rice plant .
but synthesis is not occurring to replace that energy . " rice feeds three billion people daily rice feeds about three billion people daily across the world and according to fao figures , over 60 percent of asia 's poor population is dependent on it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 60 percent of asia 's poor population depends on rice the losses in rice production will lead to food insecurity , experts fear . david dawe from the fao also worked on the study : " if temperatures continue to increase , our research seems to show that rice yields will go down or wo n't increase as fast as they otherwise would have . " he says this will have an " impact on food prices and make it much more difficult for poor people to afford food .
and it 's poor people who spend most of their money on rice .
so it 's they who 'll be most affected .

speaking after a meeting of the cdu presidium , groehe said there was popular consent within the party that the nuclear industry should make a stronger contribution to investment in renewable energy sources .

" you will surely understand , therefore , that i will not be active on the political scene for a few weeks , " steinmeier told reporters at an impromptu press conference in berlin .
steinmeier said his wife , elke buedenbender , had suffered from severe kidney problems for years , but added that her condition has deteriorated dramatically in recent weeks .
the pair married in 1995 and have had one daughter together .
steinmeier currently leads the parliamentary group of the opposition social democrats .
he was germany 's foreign minister in chancellor angela merkel 's 2005-2009 coalition government , and lost to merkel in a bid to become chancellor last year .
steinmeier 's deputy , joachim poss will temporarily take over his duties , in a move already approved by social democrat chairman , sigmar gabriel .
steinmeier also said he was confident he would resume his political career without any reduction in workload once the operation was complete , speculating that he might return in october .
the veteran politician also asked reporters to respect his privacy and that of his 48-year-old wife , pledging to make another public announcement at the next convenient juncture .

" you will surely understand , therefore , that i will not be active on the political scene for a few weeks , " steinmeier told reporters at an impromptu press conference in berlin .
steinmeier said his wife , elke buedenbender , had suffered from severe kidney problems for years , but added that her condition has deteriorated dramatically in recent weeks .
the pair married in 1995 and have had one daughter together .
steinmeier currently leads the parliamentary group of the opposition social democrats .
he was germany 's foreign minister in chancellor angela merkel 's 2005-2009 coalition government , and lost to merkel in a bid to become chancellor last year .
steinmeier 's deputy , joachim poss will temporarily take over his duties , in a move already approved by social democrat chairman , sigmar gabriel .
steinmeier also said he was confident he would resume his political career without any reduction in workload once the operation was complete , speculating that he might return in october .
the veteran politician also asked reporters to respect his privacy and that of his 48-year-old wife , pledging to make another public announcement at the next convenient juncture .

" it 's not perfectly clear the mechanism which causes this , " explained one of the researchers jarrod welch . " one hypothesis is that warmer temperatures increase respiration in the rice plant , which consumes energy .
if these warmer temperatures occur at night time , there is no offsetting of the synthesis .
so , warmer temperatures mean increased respiration , increased energy consumption in the rice plant .
but synthesis is not occurring to replace that energy . " rice feeds three billion people daily rice feeds about three billion people daily across the world and according to fao figures , over 60 percent of asia 's poor population is dependent on it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 60 percent of asia 's poor population depends on rice the losses in rice production will lead to food insecurity , experts fear . david dawe from the fao also worked on the study : " if temperatures continue to increase , our research seems to show that rice yields will go down or wo n't increase as fast as they otherwise would have . " he says this will have an " impact on food prices and make it much more difficult for poor people to afford food .
and it 's poor people who spend most of their money on rice .
so it 's they who 'll be most affected . " solutions must be implemented soon however , dawe says that there are ways of increasing the rice yields such as creating " better varieties that are more tolerant of higher temperatures , or slow down the increase in temperature , or shift the cropping season , try to plant rice at a different time of year when it 's a bit cooler . " experts have urged politicians to implement these solutions , warning that there could be a serious rice crisis otherwise . they point out that rising temperatures caused by global warming are one threat to rice yields , but another is rising sea levels which will affect the low-lying rice-growing areas of asia too . author : pin manika editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as deutsche welle found out , there are certain questions he hates answering . armin veh has one of the better resumes in the bundesliga .
he 's coached three different lower-league teams to promotion and is one of only five currently active coaches to have won the first division title .
but among the elite , he 's also an outsider who gets comparatively little respect .
whereas thomas schaaf , lousis van gaal , jupp heynckes and felix magath can all feel relatively secure in their jobs , veh is anything but a sure bet to survive this season at hamburg .
hamburg got off to fine start , beating magath 's schalke in round one .
but the team has also run through nine coaches in as many years , and veh knows that loyalty is a rare commodity these days .
" coaches get fired more quickly than used to be the case , " veh told deutsche welle .
" if you do n't reach your short-term goals , it 's pretty much impossible to do any medium- or long-term work . "
veh 's career has been a roller-coaster in recent years .
appointed on an interim basis at stuttgart in the midst of the 2005-6 campaign , he won the title with the team the following season - only to be unceremoniously axed the year after .
the title established veh 's credentials , but he used up almost all of that capital in his next assignment .

in retrospect , it was a very difficult task .
magath had won the title in 2008-9 , and veh had to try to sustain that success while putting his own stamp on the team .
he sought to change the wolves ' style of play and frantically rotated players as their defense revealed unexpected gaping holes .
he was fired last january after a nine-game winless streak and wolfsburg ended the season in eighth place .
that experience does n't seem to have affected veh as much as one might expect .
at hamburg , he 's continued to do things his way .
his controversial decisions include moving the team 's most productive striker , mladen petric , out to the wing , and nominating newly acquired defender heiko westermann as team captain .
" i wanted to give the team a different accent , a new accent , " veh said .
" that was the logic behind heiko westermann as captain . "
that initiative may be more suitable for hamburg than wolfsburg .
unlike wolfsburg , hamburg are not coming off the back of a triumph .
in fact , despite acquiring superstar ruud van nistelrooy and highly touted youngster eljero elia , the northern german side resolutely disappointed last season , coming in seventh .
one of veh 's first tasks is to win the support of those who were most disappointed - the fans .
overcoming skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening day win over schalke showed hamburg 's renewed team spirit the relationship between hamburg players and supporters totally deteriorated last season , with fans booing what they viewed as over-paid prima donnas and striker paolo guerrero retaliating by beaning one of them with a full water bottle .
it may be just diplomacy , but veh says he has n't encountered any major personality issues in the squad far .
" i have n't been able to see any signs that the team is difficult , " veh said .
" they have n't made that impression on me - although difficulties usually only arise when you do n't have success . "

" mediocre coach for a mediocre team , " wrote one blogger succinctly when the news broke .
" armin veh - is this a joke ? " opined another .
" but mostly likely no real coach wanted to come to hamburg , which is no wonder given how chaotic the club is . "
veh 's challenge will to be to earn the support of skeptics like these , and there 's a lot on the line .
having bombed in wolfsburg after succeeding in stuttgart , veh is unlikely ever to get another chance to coach a top bundesliga club , if he fails to attain his goals in hamburg .
veh is known as a players ' coach , and perhaps the initial win against schalke was a sign that he 's got the squad behind him .

the title established veh 's credentials , but he used up almost all of that capital in his next assignment .
do n't mention the magath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veh 's time at wolfsburg was characterized by frustration veh visibly bristles , evading questions , when asked to comment on his short-lived tenure as felix magath 's successor at wolfsburg last season .
in retrospect , it was a very difficult task .
magath had won the title in 2008-9 , and veh had to try to sustain that success while putting his own stamp on the team .
he sought to change the wolves ' style of play and frantically rotated players as their defense revealed unexpected gaping holes .
he was fired last january after a nine-game winless streak and wolfsburg ended the season in eighth place .
that experience does n't seem to have affected veh as much as one might expect .
at hamburg , he 's continued to do things his way .
his controversial decisions include moving the team 's most productive striker , mladen petric , out to the wing , and nominating newly acquired defender heiko westermann as team captain .
" i wanted to give the team a different accent , a new accent , " veh said .
" that was the logic behind heiko westermann as captain . "
that initiative may be more suitable for hamburg than wolfsburg .
unlike wolfsburg , hamburg are not coming off the back of a triumph .
in fact , despite acquiring superstar ruud van nistelrooy and highly touted youngster eljero elia , the northern german side resolutely disappointed last season , coming in seventh .
one of veh 's first tasks is to win the support of those who were most disappointed - the fans .
overcoming skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening day win over schalke showed hamburg 's renewed team spirit the relationship between hamburg players and supporters totally deteriorated last season , with fans booing what they viewed as over-paid prima donnas and striker paolo guerrero retaliating by beaning one of them with a full water bottle .
it may be just diplomacy , but veh says he has n't encountered any major personality issues in the squad far .
" i have n't been able to see any signs that the team is difficult , " veh said .
" they have n't made that impression on me - although difficulties usually only arise when you do n't have success . "
truer words were never spoken .
when veh 's appointment was announced last may , the overwhelming reaction among fans was dismay .
" mediocre coach for a mediocre team , " wrote one blogger succinctly when the news broke .
" armin veh - is this a joke ? " opined another .
" but mostly likely no real coach wanted to come to hamburg , which is no wonder given how chaotic the club is . "
veh 's challenge will to be to earn the support of skeptics like these , and there 's a lot on the line .
having bombed in wolfsburg after succeeding in stuttgart , veh is unlikely ever to get another chance to coach a top bundesliga club , if he fails to attain his goals in hamburg .
veh is known as a players ' coach , and perhaps the initial win against schalke was a sign that he 's got the squad behind him .
or in could be a blip on the radar screen , and as veh knows only too well , fans of the league 's biggest and richest clubs are never content with blips . even if they have a past bundesliga title to their credit .
armin veh was interviewed by jana schaefer for dw-tv 's bundesliga kick off .
the program airs every tuesday .

most of the 350,000 inhabitants have already been evacuated but the floods threaten to wreak havoc . as more towns are under imminent threat of flooding and the authorities battle with heavy monsoon rains , there are millions of people in emergency camps who are in desperate need of relief . the german commissioner for humanitarian aid markus loening recently visited the flooded areas of pakistan and got a first-hand insight into the goings on at two camps . " it 's worst for the children , " he told deutsche welle .
" there are very many women with young children .
the estimates are that 90,000 babies are going to be born in the coming weeks and that a third of them are at acute risk of not surviving the first days .
these women are in very rudimentary tents .
they can see down onto their flooded villages .
it 's all very shocking .

loening said that medical aid was crucial but that many people still needed just the basics . " some six million people need emergency help , they need food to survive .
the children get biscuits .
poland has donated biscuits .
we could also donate them .
children can survive on them because they are high-energy biscuits .
they are being distributed there .
baby food is also being distributed .
if they get that , they can survive one , two or three days .
food and clean water are what ’ s most important at the moment , " loening said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is not enough food for everyone at the relief camps he added that the cost of such products is low but that the sheer numbers of people needing supplies is making deliveries logistically difficult . the world food program has reached over a million people .
it has called for more helicopters to get food to people who remain isolated by the high flood waters . loening dispelled doubts that donations were not going to the right places .
he said that all the donations to german organizations were going " one-to-one " to the people who needed it . donor fatigue in pakistan and abroad if the west has been criticized for its sluggish response to the floods and a form of donor fatigue , the pakistani population 's distrust of the weak civilian government has reportedly also had a negative impact on donations from pakistanis themselves . " this trust deficit has created a situation where the people are not coming forward , " said tayyab siddique , a pakistani political expert . the army on the other hand has received much praise for its relief operations , although political expert ayesha siddika explained there was some marketing going on : " it ' not the way they 're doing work .
it 's how their work is being presented . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tents in the emergency camps are very rudimentary observers do not predict , however , that the political situation will change much as a result of this image-boosting , as it is widely thought that the military already holds the power behind the scenes . nor do they think the taliban will benefit unduly as their emergency relief operations are reportedly as chaotic as those of the authorities . positive for pakistani-west relations however , ayesha siddika believes that the way the floods are handled by the west could have a positive impact : " the more the west helps , it will be , i mean one of the spin offs will be of course improvement of relations , doing away with misunderstandings .

human trafficking is the fastest-growing source of profit for organized crime . the united nations declared august 23 an international day of remembrance for the abolition of slavery .
but the trade in human beings is an ongoing problem around the world .
compared to the drugs and arms trades , however , it is more difficult to track down perpetrators in the multibillion-dollar trafficking business .
victims of forced labor and sexual exploitation are not always identified as such and can even face unjust criminal prosecution themselves .
the international organization for migration estimates that between 700,000 to 4 million people are trafficked across national borders every year .
but iom spokesman jean philippe chauzy said the secret nature of the trade means no one knows exactly how many people are trafficked worldwide .
" human trafficking , either for sexual or labor exploitation , is truly a global phenomenon , " he said .
" there are no regions of the world that are not affected by trafficking . "
millions of men , women and children who leave home in search of better socio-economic prospects are vulnerable to exploitation – and chauzy said this migration " feeds trafficking . "
" because there are so few opportunities for people to migrate legally , they will tend to take risks and go through so-called intermediaries , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte awino was kidnapped by the lord 's resistance army in uganda " and in many cases , unfortunately , they find themselves in situations of exploitation . "
a voice for the voiceless charlotte awino was held as a sex slave for eight years .
when she recently talked to the un humans rights council in geneva , she said she came as a representive for those exploited and left voiceless by human trafficking .
awino called on the international community to help the victims .
" no one is there for them , " she said .
" and , nothing is being done , even if they escape back home . "
awino was 14 years old when the ugandan rebel lord 's resistance army abducted her from her boarding school in 1996 .
" we were taken away from the school campus heading nowhere , walking the whole time , " she said .
awino claimed she was taken to southern sudan , where victims were raped and beaten and forced to work in the gardens and carry luggage .
she said those caught trying to escape were killed .
awino was 22 years old and had two children by the time she managed to escape . a global problem sexual exploitation has been affecting women in countries around the world – including western europe and the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are sold into prostitution in many countries kikka cerpa was forced into a life of prostitution after her boyfriend persuaded her to leave venezuela and go to new york in 1992 .
" i went to the united states thinking that i was going to be working as a nanny , and i ended up being a prostitute , not by choice , " she said .
cerpa said she was beaten and raped and spent three years working in the sex trade to pay off her boyfriend 's debts . a customer helped cerpa escape but then then forced her to become his personal slave . she lived with him for 10 years and had two daughters .
" i could never leave him because every time that i tried to leave , he said that he would use my criminal conviction and he would have me deported from the united states and i would never visit my daughters anymore , " she said .
with the help of an organization called sanctuary for families , cerpa managed to free herself from the pimps and madams who had controlled her life .
she sought a court order of protection after her escape , but her daughters were taken away from her and she was accused of being a criminal . exploited for labor though sex trafficking has generally attracted the most international media attention , labor exploitation is also prevalent on a global scale .
the international organization for migration reports that millions of women , men and children are forced to work in sweatshops , construction , agriculture , as street beggars and in other hazardous jobs for little or no pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imo says victims of labor trafficking may be forced to work as street beggars kumar ramjali was duped with the promise of a good job with good money .
he said a jordanian company recruited him in his native nepal in 2004 to work in the united states .
but instead , ramjali was sent to iraq , where he was forced to work at a us military base against his will . he said his passport was confiscated and he was not allowed to leave for four years .
jana , a 30-year-old bosnian national , also fell victim to an employment scam .
after moving to to slovenia to continue her studies , she attended a job interview with an accounting firm arranged by a newly made female friend .
" the first 10 minutes looked pretty normal , like a normal office and a woman was there interviewing me , " she said .
" and then suddenly , two men came in and the interview was finished . "
jana said the men dragged her out of the office and when she resisted , they became extremely violent .
" i was raped and beaten many times , " she said .
" afterwards , i was taken to some place , blindfolded and repeatedly raped and drugged with heroin for a few days . "
later , jana said she began to receive clients – between six and 10 each day for four months .

as the debate over the future of nuclear power in germany heats up , greenpeace is accusing the government of defying a law mandating the release of the next monitoring report on security of the country 's energy supply . greenpeace germany took legal action monday against the federal ministry of economics for failing to release a report detailing key information on the country 's future energy needs ahead of last month 's deadline .
the complaint was lodged in a berlin administrative court .
under germany 's energy industry law -lrb- enwg -rrb- , the economics ministry is required to publish a monitoring report on the future of the country 's energy supply every two years and present the information to the european commission .
the deadline for the 2010 report was july 31 .
" to our surprise and disappointment , this report was not presented , and it was not submitted to the european commission in brussels , " greenpeace energy expert tobias münchmeyer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace has long campaigned against atomic energy the future of nuclear the data contained in the report is expected to further clarify a subject of intense political debate in germany : whether the country can meet its future electricity needs without nuclear power .
germany 's ruling coalition under chancellor angela merkel supports extending the operating lives of nuclear reactors beyond the 2022 shut-down deadline passed by the previous social democrat-led government .
münchmeyer said greenpeace believed the ministry , led by minister rainer brüderle , delayed the report 's release " in order to manipulate the current debate on energy supply in germany . "
a statement from the german economics ministry blamed the hold-up on outside problems .
" publication of the federal ministry of economics monitoring report on the security of supply in the electrical industry is postponed until fall 2010 , due to external assessment delays involving the preparation of energy scenarios for the german government 's energy policy , " a ministry spokesman told deutsche welle .
ahead of government plans to craft a long-term energy strategy by the end of september , the economics ministry commissioned several institutions with developing different energy scenarios for the future .
energy shortage ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nuclear phase-out was set for 2022 by the last red-green government yet according to a recent report in german newspaper die zeit , the ministry itself established a general framework for scientific assessment - and münchmeyer said data was chosen in ways that would support the conclusion that nuclear extension plans would be " useful or positive for the german economy . "
german utilities companies have warned that the country could face an electricity shortage if plans for a nuclear phase-out go through - a claim that greenpeace , a long-term opponent of atomic power , disputes .
" the last report from 2008 has clearly shown that there is no risk of running a deficit in the electricity supply , " münchmeyer said , adding that the 2010 monitoring document would further support that point .

as the debate over the future of nuclear power in germany heats up , greenpeace is accusing the government of defying a law mandating the release of the next monitoring report on security of the country 's energy supply . greenpeace germany took legal action monday against the federal ministry of economics for failing to release a report detailing key information on the country 's future energy needs ahead of last month 's deadline .
the complaint was lodged in a berlin administrative court .
under germany 's energy industry law -lrb- enwg -rrb- , the economics ministry is required to publish a monitoring report on the future of the country 's energy supply every two years and present the information to the european commission .
the deadline for the 2010 report was july 31 .
" to our surprise and disappointment , this report was not presented , and it was not submitted to the european commission in brussels , " greenpeace energy expert tobias münchmeyer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace has long campaigned against atomic energy the future of nuclear the data contained in the report is expected to further clarify a subject of intense political debate in germany : whether the country can meet its future electricity needs without nuclear power .
germany 's ruling coalition under chancellor angela merkel supports extending the operating lives of nuclear reactors beyond the 2022 shut-down deadline passed by the previous social democrat-led government .
münchmeyer said greenpeace believed the ministry , led by minister rainer brüderle , delayed the report 's release " in order to manipulate the current debate on energy supply in germany . "
a statement from the german economics ministry blamed the hold-up on outside problems .
" publication of the federal ministry of economics monitoring report on the security of supply in the electrical industry is postponed until fall 2010 , due to external assessment delays involving the preparation of energy scenarios for the german government 's energy policy , " a ministry spokesman told deutsche welle .
ahead of government plans to craft a long-term energy strategy by the end of september , the economics ministry commissioned several institutions with developing different energy scenarios for the future .

"
german utilities companies have warned that the country could face an electricity shortage if plans for a nuclear phase-out go through - a claim that greenpeace , a long-term opponent of atomic power , disputes .

human trafficking is the fastest-growing source of profit for organized crime . the united nations declared august 23 an international day of remembrance for the abolition of slavery .
but the trade in human beings is an ongoing problem around the world .
compared to the drugs and arms trades , however , it is more difficult to track down perpetrators in the multibillion-dollar trafficking business .
victims of forced labor and sexual exploitation are not always identified as such and can even face unjust criminal prosecution themselves .
the international organization for migration estimates that between 700,000 to 4 million people are trafficked across national borders every year .
but iom spokesman jean philippe chauzy said the secret nature of the trade means no one knows exactly how many people are trafficked worldwide .
" human trafficking , either for sexual or labor exploitation , is truly a global phenomenon , " he said .
" there are no regions of the world that are not affected by trafficking . "
millions of men , women and children who leave home in search of better socio-economic prospects are vulnerable to exploitation – and chauzy said this migration " feeds trafficking . "
" because there are so few opportunities for people to migrate legally , they will tend to take risks and go through so-called intermediaries , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte awino was kidnapped by the lord 's resistance army in uganda " and in many cases , unfortunately , they find themselves in situations of exploitation . "
a voice for the voiceless charlotte awino was held as a sex slave for eight years .
when she recently talked to the un humans rights council in geneva , she said she came as a representive for those exploited and left voiceless by human trafficking .
awino called on the international community to help the victims .
" no one is there for them , " she said .
" and , nothing is being done , even if they escape back home . "
awino was 14 years old when the ugandan rebel lord 's resistance army abducted her from her boarding school in 1996 .
" we were taken away from the school campus heading nowhere , walking the whole time , " she said .
awino claimed she was taken to southern sudan , where victims were raped and beaten and forced to work in the gardens and carry luggage .
she said those caught trying to escape were killed .
awino was 22 years old and had two children by the time she managed to escape . a global problem sexual exploitation has been affecting women in countries around the world – including western europe and the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are sold into prostitution in many countries kikka cerpa was forced into a life of prostitution after her boyfriend persuaded her to leave venezuela and go to new york in 1992 .
" i went to the united states thinking that i was going to be working as a nanny , and i ended up being a prostitute , not by choice , " she said .
cerpa said she was beaten and raped and spent three years working in the sex trade to pay off her boyfriend 's debts . a customer helped cerpa escape but then then forced her to become his personal slave . she lived with him for 10 years and had two daughters .
" i could never leave him because every time that i tried to leave , he said that he would use my criminal conviction and he would have me deported from the united states and i would never visit my daughters anymore , " she said .
with the help of an organization called sanctuary for families , cerpa managed to free herself from the pimps and madams who had controlled her life .
she sought a court order of protection after her escape , but her daughters were taken away from her and she was accused of being a criminal . exploited for labor though sex trafficking has generally attracted the most international media attention , labor exploitation is also prevalent on a global scale .
the international organization for migration reports that millions of women , men and children are forced to work in sweatshops , construction , agriculture , as street beggars and in other hazardous jobs for little or no pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imo says victims of labor trafficking may be forced to work as street beggars kumar ramjali was duped with the promise of a good job with good money .
he said a jordanian company recruited him in his native nepal in 2004 to work in the united states .
but instead , ramjali was sent to iraq , where he was forced to work at a us military base against his will . he said his passport was confiscated and he was not allowed to leave for four years .
jana , a 30-year-old bosnian national , also fell victim to an employment scam .
after moving to to slovenia to continue her studies , she attended a job interview with an accounting firm arranged by a newly made female friend .
" the first 10 minutes looked pretty normal , like a normal office and a woman was there interviewing me , " she said .
" and then suddenly , two men came in and the interview was finished . "
jana said the men dragged her out of the office and when she resisted , they became extremely violent .
" i was raped and beaten many times , " she said .
" afterwards , i was taken to some place , blindfolded and repeatedly raped and drugged with heroin for a few days . "
later , jana said she began to receive clients – between six and 10 each day for four months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-trafficking poster from moldova prevention and punishment after her escape in 2005 , jana became an advocate against trafficking .
human rights organizations say a variety of approaches are needed to tackle the issue , including information campaigns to help prevent trafficking .
experts and survivors agree that more work must be done to provide legal assistance and protection for the victims – and to make sure that perpetrators are the ones who are prosecuted and punished for their crimes . author : lisa schlein -lrb- arp -rrb- editor : anke rasper send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nuclear phase-out was set for 2022 by the last red-green government yet according to a recent report in german newspaper die zeit , the ministry itself established a general framework for scientific assessment - and münchmeyer said data was chosen in ways that would support the conclusion that nuclear extension plans would be " useful or positive for the german economy . "
german utilities companies have warned that the country could face an electricity shortage if plans for a nuclear phase-out go through - a claim that greenpeace , a long-term opponent of atomic power , disputes .
" the last report from 2008 has clearly shown that there is no risk of running a deficit in the electricity supply , " münchmeyer said , adding that the 2010 monitoring document would further support that point .

human trafficking is the fastest-growing source of profit for organized crime . the united nations declared august 23 an international day of remembrance for the abolition of slavery .
but the trade in human beings is an ongoing problem around the world .
compared to the drugs and arms trades , however , it is more difficult to track down perpetrators in the multibillion-dollar trafficking business .
victims of forced labor and sexual exploitation are not always identified as such and can even face unjust criminal prosecution themselves .
the international organization for migration estimates that between 700,000 to 4 million people are trafficked across national borders every year .
but iom spokesman jean philippe chauzy said the secret nature of the trade means no one knows exactly how many people are trafficked worldwide .
" human trafficking , either for sexual or labor exploitation , is truly a global phenomenon , " he said .
" there are no regions of the world that are not affected by trafficking . "
millions of men , women and children who leave home in search of better socio-economic prospects are vulnerable to exploitation – and chauzy said this migration " feeds trafficking . "
" because there are so few opportunities for people to migrate legally , they will tend to take risks and go through so-called intermediaries , " he said .

" and , nothing is being done , even if they escape back home . "
awino was 14 years old when the ugandan rebel lord 's resistance army abducted her from her boarding school in 1996 .
" we were taken away from the school campus heading nowhere , walking the whole time , " she said .
awino claimed she was taken to southern sudan , where victims were raped and beaten and forced to work in the gardens and carry luggage .
she said those caught trying to escape were killed .

" i went to the united states thinking that i was going to be working as a nanny , and i ended up being a prostitute , not by choice , " she said .
cerpa said she was beaten and raped and spent three years working in the sex trade to pay off her boyfriend 's debts . a customer helped cerpa escape but then then forced her to become his personal slave . she lived with him for 10 years and had two daughters .
" i could never leave him because every time that i tried to leave , he said that he would use my criminal conviction and he would have me deported from the united states and i would never visit my daughters anymore , " she said .
with the help of an organization called sanctuary for families , cerpa managed to free herself from the pimps and madams who had controlled her life .
she sought a court order of protection after her escape , but her daughters were taken away from her and she was accused of being a criminal . exploited for labor though sex trafficking has generally attracted the most international media attention , labor exploitation is also prevalent on a global scale .

but instead , ramjali was sent to iraq , where he was forced to work at a us military base against his will . he said his passport was confiscated and he was not allowed to leave for four years .
jana , a 30-year-old bosnian national , also fell victim to an employment scam .
after moving to to slovenia to continue her studies , she attended a job interview with an accounting firm arranged by a newly made female friend .
" the first 10 minutes looked pretty normal , like a normal office and a woman was there interviewing me , " she said .
" and then suddenly , two men came in and the interview was finished . "
jana said the men dragged her out of the office and when she resisted , they became extremely violent .
" i was raped and beaten many times , " she said .

the total number of soldiers will be cut to around 165,000 , with compulsory service practically abolished . defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg presented his draft plans for the future of the german army to government ministers on monday .
the model guttenberg unveiled will see the present 252,000 soldiers cut to 163,500 over the next few years , a reduction of around a third .
conscription will be suspended in the short term , with young men no longer called up to do compulsory service .
but guttenberg stressed that it was important conscription retains its place in the constitution , in case it becomes viable again in the future .
" by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better , " guttenberg said after discussing his proposals with coalition partners .
knock-on effects the chosen model would mean a reduction in the professional standing army from around 195,000 soldiers to 156,000 .
the cuts mean that the army would be left with three tank battalions , two artillery battalions and one paratrooper regiment .
the civilian service alternative to military conscription , an important provider of labor to germany 's care homes , will also be suspended .
family minister kristina schroeder proposed on monday to introduce a national voluntary community service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has conscripted young men into its armed forces since 1957 " i 'm not giving myself hope that we can completely replace what we have now , " schroeder told reporters in berlin .
but she celebrated the fact that women would be able to perform community service for the first time .
the proposal to suspend rather than scrap conscription altogether postpones a contentious debate that has been bedevilling chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition in recent weeks .
merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- sees itself as a staunch defender of compulsory military service , though its military impracticality and high cost have long threatened the ideal of a ' citizen 's army . '
' voluntary conscription ' guttenberg , of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , hopes to mollify his party colleagues with the new " voluntary military service " model , which he says represents " a modern variation for the citizen to take on responsibility . "
the government is hoping to attract volunteers to sign on to this new scheme for up to 23 months by promising driver 's licenses , university places and other fringe benefits .
women would be included amongst an estimated 7,500 army volunteers .
" not enough to safeguard the regeneration of the troops with up-and-coming soldiers , " criticized ulrich kirsch , head of the armed forces association .
the defense ministry is aiming to cut some 8.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- off its budget over the next four years , though guttenberg warned that savings in new armament projects would also be needed .

the total number of soldiers will be cut to around 165,000 , with compulsory service practically abolished . defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg presented his draft plans for the future of the german army to government ministers on monday .
the model guttenberg unveiled will see the present 252,000 soldiers cut to 163,500 over the next few years , a reduction of around a third .
conscription will be suspended in the short term , with young men no longer called up to do compulsory service .
but guttenberg stressed that it was important conscription retains its place in the constitution , in case it becomes viable again in the future .
" by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better , " guttenberg said after discussing his proposals with coalition partners .
knock-on effects the chosen model would mean a reduction in the professional standing army from around 195,000 soldiers to 156,000 .
the cuts mean that the army would be left with three tank battalions , two artillery battalions and one paratrooper regiment .
the civilian service alternative to military conscription , an important provider of labor to germany 's care homes , will also be suspended .
family minister kristina schroeder proposed on monday to introduce a national voluntary community service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has conscripted young men into its armed forces since 1957 " i 'm not giving myself hope that we can completely replace what we have now , " schroeder told reporters in berlin .
but she celebrated the fact that women would be able to perform community service for the first time .
the proposal to suspend rather than scrap conscription altogether postpones a contentious debate that has been bedevilling chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition in recent weeks .
merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- sees itself as a staunch defender of compulsory military service , though its military impracticality and high cost have long threatened the ideal of a ' citizen 's army . '
' voluntary conscription ' guttenberg , of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , hopes to mollify his party colleagues with the new " voluntary military service " model , which he says represents " a modern variation for the citizen to take on responsibility . "
the government is hoping to attract volunteers to sign on to this new scheme for up to 23 months by promising driver 's licenses , university places and other fringe benefits .
women would be included amongst an estimated 7,500 army volunteers .
" not enough to safeguard the regeneration of the troops with up-and-coming soldiers , " criticized ulrich kirsch , head of the armed forces association .
the defense ministry is aiming to cut some 8.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- off its budget over the next four years , though guttenberg warned that savings in new armament projects would also be needed .

most of the 350,000 inhabitants have already been evacuated but the floods threaten to wreak havoc . as more towns are under imminent threat of flooding and the authorities battle with heavy monsoon rains , there are millions of people in emergency camps who are in desperate need of relief . the german commissioner for humanitarian aid markus loening recently visited the flooded areas of pakistan and got a first-hand insight into the goings on at two camps . " it 's worst for the children , " he told deutsche welle .
" there are very many women with young children .
the estimates are that 90,000 babies are going to be born in the coming weeks and that a third of them are at acute risk of not surviving the first days .
these women are in very rudimentary tents .
they can see down onto their flooded villages .

loening said that medical aid was crucial but that many people still needed just the basics . " some six million people need emergency help , they need food to survive .
the children get biscuits .
poland has donated biscuits .
we could also donate them .
children can survive on them because they are high-energy biscuits .
they are being distributed there .
baby food is also being distributed .
if they get that , they can survive one , two or three days .
food and clean water are what ’ s most important at the moment , " loening said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is not enough food for everyone at the relief camps he added that the cost of such products is low but that the sheer numbers of people needing supplies is making deliveries logistically difficult . the world food program has reached over a million people .
it has called for more helicopters to get food to people who remain isolated by the high flood waters . loening dispelled doubts that donations were not going to the right places .
he said that all the donations to german organizations were going " one-to-one " to the people who needed it . donor fatigue in pakistan and abroad if the west has been criticized for its sluggish response to the floods and a form of donor fatigue , the pakistani population 's distrust of the weak civilian government has reportedly also had a negative impact on donations from pakistanis themselves . " this trust deficit has created a situation where the people are not coming forward , " said tayyab siddique , a pakistani political expert . the army on the other hand has received much praise for its relief operations , although political expert ayesha siddika explained there was some marketing going on : " it ' not the way they 're doing work .
it 's how their work is being presented . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tents in the emergency camps are very rudimentary observers do not predict , however , that the political situation will change much as a result of this image-boosting , as it is widely thought that the military already holds the power behind the scenes . nor do they think the taliban will benefit unduly as their emergency relief operations are reportedly as chaotic as those of the authorities . positive for pakistani-west relations however , ayesha siddika believes that the way the floods are handled by the west could have a positive impact : " the more the west helps , it will be , i mean one of the spin offs will be of course improvement of relations , doing away with misunderstandings .

merkel said that a change was needed in the way members of her government behaved . chancellor angela merkel said that apparent disunity within her ruling center-right coalition was to blame for a dip in voter approval ratings for member parties .
in an interview with the public television station zdf , merkel said that her government needed to make tough decisions .
however , she said the nature of discussion within the coalition - which has been accused of excessive bickering - was partly responsible for alienating the electorate .
" i think we have n't managed to reach people partly because the confusion of voices and the way we have treated each other have not been what is to be expected of us , " merkel said , adding that the situation needed to be improved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coalition parties have lost ground since the election last year in the interview on sunday , merkel said that her government could be particularly satisfied with its record on the economy .
the chancellor said she was confident about regaining opinion poll approval as soon as important decisions facing the country had been made , by the end of the year .
questions to be answered merkel said financial stability , health , education for the children of welfare recipients , energy policy and reforms to the military were her government 's top priorities .
the chancellor said that she believed that after these decisions were taken , voters would understand that germany was " better equipped for the future . "
in the interview following her vacation in italy , merkel reaffirmed her commitment to introducing a tax on nuclear power providers , despite objections from the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is open to a suspension of compulsory military service the chancellor also said she was open to a suspension of germany 's compulsory military service .
both issues have been the subject of heated debate within the coalition .
in an opinion poll released last week , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- moved ahead of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who along with bavarian sister party the csu share power with the liberal free democrats fdp .
the spd had 32 percent support compared to 31 percent for the cdu and csu in the poll conducted by germany 's allensbach institute .
the fdp had just six percent .
the result contrasts with the general election in september 2009 when the cdu and csu won almost 34 percent of the popular vote , and the fdp almost 15 percent , compared with 23 percent for the spd .

the on-board air conditioning also failed , causing minor health scares . an express train from berlin to munich ground to a halt close to stuttgart on sunday , after suffering engine failure .
the 420 passengers on board were stranded in a tunnel near vaihingen an der enz in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg for over three hours without air conditioning .
one was later hospitalized and three more required minor medical treatment because of the rising temperatures on board .
the inter city express -lrb- ice -rrb- train stopped because of a problem with the engine , which also powers the climate control systems .
however , batteries continued to power the lights , toilets and door switches during the lengthy delay .
plan b german rail operator deutsche bahn first tried to solve the problem by sending a locomotive to tow the stranded train to its next stop in stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german rail service has endured a trying summer however , when this attempt failed , a replacement was sent instead , and passengers eventually switched trains inside the tunnel .
a deutsche bahn spokesman said the train stopped at around 1 p.m. , with the replacement eventually arriving at 4:30 p.m.
critics said the prolonged wait showed that the german railway service lacks the capacity to deal with unexpected problems .
" if it 's too much to ask of deutsche bahn to tow away one stranded ice in a case like this , " regional head of the train passengers association pro-bahn , stefan buhl said , " then it 's difficult to imagine what might happen in a genuine catastrophe . "
the breakdown forced deutsche bahn to close the line in both directions for the entire time period – diverting other services onto an older , slower line , delaying them by roughly quarter of an hour .
deutsche bahn is legally obliged to pay back half the cost of the ticket to any passengers whose trains are delayed by two hours or more .
it 's been a difficult summer for the german railway operator , which made the headlines during a july heat-wave when the air conditioning systems failed on three ice trains and 44 passengers collapsed in the heat .

most of the 350,000 inhabitants have already been evacuated but the floods threaten to wreak havoc . as more towns are under imminent threat of flooding and the authorities battle with heavy monsoon rains , there are millions of people in emergency camps who are in desperate need of relief . the german commissioner for humanitarian aid markus loening recently visited the flooded areas of pakistan and got a first-hand insight into the goings on at two camps . " it 's worst for the children , " he told deutsche welle .
" there are very many women with young children .
the estimates are that 90,000 babies are going to be born in the coming weeks and that a third of them are at acute risk of not surviving the first days .
these women are in very rudimentary tents .
they can see down onto their flooded villages .
it 's all very shocking . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 350,000 people have been evacuated from shadadkot in sindh millions are in need of basic supplies concern that there could be an outbreak of disease , including typhoid , hepatitis and cholera continues to grow .
loening said that medical aid was crucial but that many people still needed just the basics . " some six million people need emergency help , they need food to survive .
the children get biscuits .
poland has donated biscuits .
we could also donate them .
children can survive on them because they are high-energy biscuits .
they are being distributed there .
baby food is also being distributed .
if they get that , they can survive one , two or three days .
food and clean water are what ’ s most important at the moment , " loening said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is not enough food for everyone at the relief camps he added that the cost of such products is low but that the sheer numbers of people needing supplies is making deliveries logistically difficult . the world food program has reached over a million people .
it has called for more helicopters to get food to people who remain isolated by the high flood waters . loening dispelled doubts that donations were not going to the right places .
he said that all the donations to german organizations were going " one-to-one " to the people who needed it . donor fatigue in pakistan and abroad if the west has been criticized for its sluggish response to the floods and a form of donor fatigue , the pakistani population 's distrust of the weak civilian government has reportedly also had a negative impact on donations from pakistanis themselves . " this trust deficit has created a situation where the people are not coming forward , " said tayyab siddique , a pakistani political expert . the army on the other hand has received much praise for its relief operations , although political expert ayesha siddika explained there was some marketing going on : " it ' not the way they 're doing work .
it 's how their work is being presented . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tents in the emergency camps are very rudimentary observers do not predict , however , that the political situation will change much as a result of this image-boosting , as it is widely thought that the military already holds the power behind the scenes . nor do they think the taliban will benefit unduly as their emergency relief operations are reportedly as chaotic as those of the authorities . positive for pakistani-west relations however , ayesha siddika believes that the way the floods are handled by the west could have a positive impact : " the more the west helps , it will be , i mean one of the spin offs will be of course improvement of relations , doing away with misunderstandings .

the total number of soldiers will be cut to around 165,000 , with compulsory service practically abolished . defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg presented his draft plans for the future of the german army to government ministers on monday .
the model guttenberg unveiled will see the present 252,000 soldiers cut to 163,500 over the next few years , a reduction of around a third .
conscription will be suspended in the short term , with young men no longer called up to do compulsory service .
but guttenberg stressed that it was important conscription retains its place in the constitution , in case it becomes viable again in the future .
" by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better , " guttenberg said after discussing his proposals with coalition partners .
knock-on effects the chosen model would mean a reduction in the professional standing army from around 195,000 soldiers to 156,000 .
the cuts mean that the army would be left with three tank battalions , two artillery battalions and one paratrooper regiment .
the civilian service alternative to military conscription , an important provider of labor to germany 's care homes , will also be suspended .
family minister kristina schroeder proposed on monday to introduce a national voluntary community service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has conscripted young men into its armed forces since 1957 " i 'm not giving myself hope that we can completely replace what we have now , " schroeder told reporters in berlin .
but she celebrated the fact that women would be able to perform community service for the first time .
the proposal to suspend rather than scrap conscription altogether postpones a contentious debate that has been bedevilling chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition in recent weeks .
merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- sees itself as a staunch defender of compulsory military service , though its military impracticality and high cost have long threatened the ideal of a ' citizen 's army . '
' voluntary conscription ' guttenberg , of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , hopes to mollify his party colleagues with the new " voluntary military service " model , which he says represents " a modern variation for the citizen to take on responsibility . "
the government is hoping to attract volunteers to sign on to this new scheme for up to 23 months by promising driver 's licenses , university places and other fringe benefits .
women would be included amongst an estimated 7,500 army volunteers .
" not enough to safeguard the regeneration of the troops with up-and-coming soldiers , " criticized ulrich kirsch , head of the armed forces association .
the defense ministry is aiming to cut some 8.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- off its budget over the next four years , though guttenberg warned that savings in new armament projects would also be needed .

human trafficking is the fastest-growing source of profit for organized crime . the united nations declared august 23 an international day of remembrance for the abolition of slavery .
but the trade in human beings is an ongoing problem around the world .
compared to the drugs and arms trades , however , it is more difficult to track down perpetrators in the multibillion-dollar trafficking business .
victims of forced labor and sexual exploitation are not always identified as such and can even face unjust criminal prosecution themselves .
the international organization for migration estimates that between 700,000 to 4 million people are trafficked across national borders every year .
but iom spokesman jean philippe chauzy said the secret nature of the trade means no one knows exactly how many people are trafficked worldwide .
" human trafficking , either for sexual or labor exploitation , is truly a global phenomenon , " he said .
" there are no regions of the world that are not affected by trafficking . "
millions of men , women and children who leave home in search of better socio-economic prospects are vulnerable to exploitation – and chauzy said this migration " feeds trafficking . "
" because there are so few opportunities for people to migrate legally , they will tend to take risks and go through so-called intermediaries , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte awino was kidnapped by the lord 's resistance army in uganda " and in many cases , unfortunately , they find themselves in situations of exploitation . "
a voice for the voiceless charlotte awino was held as a sex slave for eight years .
when she recently talked to the un humans rights council in geneva , she said she came as a representive for those exploited and left voiceless by human trafficking .
awino called on the international community to help the victims .
" no one is there for them , " she said .
" and , nothing is being done , even if they escape back home . "
awino was 14 years old when the ugandan rebel lord 's resistance army abducted her from her boarding school in 1996 .
" we were taken away from the school campus heading nowhere , walking the whole time , " she said .
awino claimed she was taken to southern sudan , where victims were raped and beaten and forced to work in the gardens and carry luggage .
she said those caught trying to escape were killed .
awino was 22 years old and had two children by the time she managed to escape . a global problem sexual exploitation has been affecting women in countries around the world – including western europe and the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are sold into prostitution in many countries kikka cerpa was forced into a life of prostitution after her boyfriend persuaded her to leave venezuela and go to new york in 1992 .
" i went to the united states thinking that i was going to be working as a nanny , and i ended up being a prostitute , not by choice , " she said .
cerpa said she was beaten and raped and spent three years working in the sex trade to pay off her boyfriend 's debts . a customer helped cerpa escape but then then forced her to become his personal slave . she lived with him for 10 years and had two daughters .
" i could never leave him because every time that i tried to leave , he said that he would use my criminal conviction and he would have me deported from the united states and i would never visit my daughters anymore , " she said .
with the help of an organization called sanctuary for families , cerpa managed to free herself from the pimps and madams who had controlled her life .
she sought a court order of protection after her escape , but her daughters were taken away from her and she was accused of being a criminal . exploited for labor though sex trafficking has generally attracted the most international media attention , labor exploitation is also prevalent on a global scale .
the international organization for migration reports that millions of women , men and children are forced to work in sweatshops , construction , agriculture , as street beggars and in other hazardous jobs for little or no pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imo says victims of labor trafficking may be forced to work as street beggars kumar ramjali was duped with the promise of a good job with good money .
he said a jordanian company recruited him in his native nepal in 2004 to work in the united states .
but instead , ramjali was sent to iraq , where he was forced to work at a us military base against his will . he said his passport was confiscated and he was not allowed to leave for four years .
jana , a 30-year-old bosnian national , also fell victim to an employment scam .
after moving to to slovenia to continue her studies , she attended a job interview with an accounting firm arranged by a newly made female friend .
" the first 10 minutes looked pretty normal , like a normal office and a woman was there interviewing me , " she said .
" and then suddenly , two men came in and the interview was finished . "
jana said the men dragged her out of the office and when she resisted , they became extremely violent .
" i was raped and beaten many times , " she said .
" afterwards , i was taken to some place , blindfolded and repeatedly raped and drugged with heroin for a few days . "
later , jana said she began to receive clients – between six and 10 each day for four months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.08.2010 hamburg 's winning start gives under-fire coach breathing space großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veh won the bundesliga in 2007 hamburg 's armin veh still belongs to the small circle of elite bundesliga coaches with a job at a top team and is battling to stay there .
but as deutsche welle found out , there are certain questions he hates answering . armin veh has one of the better resumes in the bundesliga .
he 's coached three different lower-league teams to promotion and is one of only five currently active coaches to have won the first division title .
but among the elite , he 's also an outsider who gets comparatively little respect .
whereas thomas schaaf , lousis van gaal , jupp heynckes and felix magath can all feel relatively secure in their jobs , veh is anything but a sure bet to survive this season at hamburg .
hamburg got off to fine start , beating magath 's schalke in round one .
but the team has also run through nine coaches in as many years , and veh knows that loyalty is a rare commodity these days .
" coaches get fired more quickly than used to be the case , " veh told deutsche welle .
" if you do n't reach your short-term goals , it 's pretty much impossible to do any medium- or long-term work . "
veh 's career has been a roller-coaster in recent years .
appointed on an interim basis at stuttgart in the midst of the 2005-6 campaign , he won the title with the team the following season - only to be unceremoniously axed the year after .
the title established veh 's credentials , but he used up almost all of that capital in his next assignment .
do n't mention the magath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veh 's time at wolfsburg was characterized by frustration veh visibly bristles , evading questions , when asked to comment on his short-lived tenure as felix magath 's successor at wolfsburg last season .
in retrospect , it was a very difficult task .
magath had won the title in 2008-9 , and veh had to try to sustain that success while putting his own stamp on the team .
he sought to change the wolves ' style of play and frantically rotated players as their defense revealed unexpected gaping holes .
he was fired last january after a nine-game winless streak and wolfsburg ended the season in eighth place .
that experience does n't seem to have affected veh as much as one might expect .
at hamburg , he 's continued to do things his way .
his controversial decisions include moving the team 's most productive striker , mladen petric , out to the wing , and nominating newly acquired defender heiko westermann as team captain .
" i wanted to give the team a different accent , a new accent , " veh said .
" that was the logic behind heiko westermann as captain . "
that initiative may be more suitable for hamburg than wolfsburg .
unlike wolfsburg , hamburg are not coming off the back of a triumph .
in fact , despite acquiring superstar ruud van nistelrooy and highly touted youngster eljero elia , the northern german side resolutely disappointed last season , coming in seventh .
one of veh 's first tasks is to win the support of those who were most disappointed - the fans .
overcoming skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening day win over schalke showed hamburg 's renewed team spirit the relationship between hamburg players and supporters totally deteriorated last season , with fans booing what they viewed as over-paid prima donnas and striker paolo guerrero retaliating by beaning one of them with a full water bottle .
it may be just diplomacy , but veh says he has n't encountered any major personality issues in the squad far .
" i have n't been able to see any signs that the team is difficult , " veh said .
" they have n't made that impression on me - although difficulties usually only arise when you do n't have success . "
truer words were never spoken .
when veh 's appointment was announced last may , the overwhelming reaction among fans was dismay .
" mediocre coach for a mediocre team , " wrote one blogger succinctly when the news broke .
" armin veh - is this a joke ? " opined another .
" but mostly likely no real coach wanted to come to hamburg , which is no wonder given how chaotic the club is . "
veh 's challenge will to be to earn the support of skeptics like these , and there 's a lot on the line .
having bombed in wolfsburg after succeeding in stuttgart , veh is unlikely ever to get another chance to coach a top bundesliga club , if he fails to attain his goals in hamburg .
veh is known as a players ' coach , and perhaps the initial win against schalke was a sign that he 's got the squad behind him .
or in could be a blip on the radar screen , and as veh knows only too well , fans of the league 's biggest and richest clubs are never content with blips . even if they have a past bundesliga title to their credit .
armin veh was interviewed by jana schaefer for dw-tv 's bundesliga kick off .
the program airs every tuesday .

human trafficking is the fastest-growing source of profit for organized crime . the united nations declared august 23 an international day of remembrance for the abolition of slavery .
but the trade in human beings is an ongoing problem around the world .
compared to the drugs and arms trades , however , it is more difficult to track down perpetrators in the multibillion-dollar trafficking business .
victims of forced labor and sexual exploitation are not always identified as such and can even face unjust criminal prosecution themselves .
the international organization for migration estimates that between 700,000 to 4 million people are trafficked across national borders every year .
but iom spokesman jean philippe chauzy said the secret nature of the trade means no one knows exactly how many people are trafficked worldwide .
" human trafficking , either for sexual or labor exploitation , is truly a global phenomenon , " he said .
" there are no regions of the world that are not affected by trafficking . "
millions of men , women and children who leave home in search of better socio-economic prospects are vulnerable to exploitation – and chauzy said this migration " feeds trafficking . "
" because there are so few opportunities for people to migrate legally , they will tend to take risks and go through so-called intermediaries , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte awino was kidnapped by the lord 's resistance army in uganda " and in many cases , unfortunately , they find themselves in situations of exploitation . "
a voice for the voiceless charlotte awino was held as a sex slave for eight years .
when she recently talked to the un humans rights council in geneva , she said she came as a representive for those exploited and left voiceless by human trafficking .
awino called on the international community to help the victims .
" no one is there for them , " she said .
" and , nothing is being done , even if they escape back home . "
awino was 14 years old when the ugandan rebel lord 's resistance army abducted her from her boarding school in 1996 .
" we were taken away from the school campus heading nowhere , walking the whole time , " she said .
awino claimed she was taken to southern sudan , where victims were raped and beaten and forced to work in the gardens and carry luggage .
she said those caught trying to escape were killed .
awino was 22 years old and had two children by the time she managed to escape . a global problem sexual exploitation has been affecting women in countries around the world – including western europe and the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are sold into prostitution in many countries kikka cerpa was forced into a life of prostitution after her boyfriend persuaded her to leave venezuela and go to new york in 1992 .
" i went to the united states thinking that i was going to be working as a nanny , and i ended up being a prostitute , not by choice , " she said .
cerpa said she was beaten and raped and spent three years working in the sex trade to pay off her boyfriend 's debts . a customer helped cerpa escape but then then forced her to become his personal slave . she lived with him for 10 years and had two daughters .
" i could never leave him because every time that i tried to leave , he said that he would use my criminal conviction and he would have me deported from the united states and i would never visit my daughters anymore , " she said .
with the help of an organization called sanctuary for families , cerpa managed to free herself from the pimps and madams who had controlled her life .
she sought a court order of protection after her escape , but her daughters were taken away from her and she was accused of being a criminal . exploited for labor though sex trafficking has generally attracted the most international media attention , labor exploitation is also prevalent on a global scale .

he said a jordanian company recruited him in his native nepal in 2004 to work in the united states .
but instead , ramjali was sent to iraq , where he was forced to work at a us military base against his will . he said his passport was confiscated and he was not allowed to leave for four years .
jana , a 30-year-old bosnian national , also fell victim to an employment scam .
after moving to to slovenia to continue her studies , she attended a job interview with an accounting firm arranged by a newly made female friend .
" the first 10 minutes looked pretty normal , like a normal office and a woman was there interviewing me , " she said .
" and then suddenly , two men came in and the interview was finished . "
jana said the men dragged her out of the office and when she resisted , they became extremely violent .
" i was raped and beaten many times , " she said .
" afterwards , i was taken to some place , blindfolded and repeatedly raped and drugged with heroin for a few days . "
later , jana said she began to receive clients – between six and 10 each day for four months .

human rights organizations say a variety of approaches are needed to tackle the issue , including information campaigns to help prevent trafficking .

human trafficking is the fastest-growing source of profit for organized crime . the united nations declared august 23 an international day of remembrance for the abolition of slavery .
but the trade in human beings is an ongoing problem around the world .
compared to the drugs and arms trades , however , it is more difficult to track down perpetrators in the multibillion-dollar trafficking business .
victims of forced labor and sexual exploitation are not always identified as such and can even face unjust criminal prosecution themselves .
the international organization for migration estimates that between 700,000 to 4 million people are trafficked across national borders every year .
but iom spokesman jean philippe chauzy said the secret nature of the trade means no one knows exactly how many people are trafficked worldwide .
" human trafficking , either for sexual or labor exploitation , is truly a global phenomenon , " he said .
" there are no regions of the world that are not affected by trafficking . "
millions of men , women and children who leave home in search of better socio-economic prospects are vulnerable to exploitation – and chauzy said this migration " feeds trafficking . "
" because there are so few opportunities for people to migrate legally , they will tend to take risks and go through so-called intermediaries , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte awino was kidnapped by the lord 's resistance army in uganda " and in many cases , unfortunately , they find themselves in situations of exploitation . "
a voice for the voiceless charlotte awino was held as a sex slave for eight years .
when she recently talked to the un humans rights council in geneva , she said she came as a representive for those exploited and left voiceless by human trafficking .
awino called on the international community to help the victims .
" no one is there for them , " she said .
" and , nothing is being done , even if they escape back home . "
awino was 14 years old when the ugandan rebel lord 's resistance army abducted her from her boarding school in 1996 .
" we were taken away from the school campus heading nowhere , walking the whole time , " she said .
awino claimed she was taken to southern sudan , where victims were raped and beaten and forced to work in the gardens and carry luggage .
she said those caught trying to escape were killed .
awino was 22 years old and had two children by the time she managed to escape . a global problem sexual exploitation has been affecting women in countries around the world – including western europe and the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are sold into prostitution in many countries kikka cerpa was forced into a life of prostitution after her boyfriend persuaded her to leave venezuela and go to new york in 1992 .
" i went to the united states thinking that i was going to be working as a nanny , and i ended up being a prostitute , not by choice , " she said .
cerpa said she was beaten and raped and spent three years working in the sex trade to pay off her boyfriend 's debts . a customer helped cerpa escape but then then forced her to become his personal slave . she lived with him for 10 years and had two daughters .
" i could never leave him because every time that i tried to leave , he said that he would use my criminal conviction and he would have me deported from the united states and i would never visit my daughters anymore , " she said .
with the help of an organization called sanctuary for families , cerpa managed to free herself from the pimps and madams who had controlled her life .
she sought a court order of protection after her escape , but her daughters were taken away from her and she was accused of being a criminal . exploited for labor though sex trafficking has generally attracted the most international media attention , labor exploitation is also prevalent on a global scale .
the international organization for migration reports that millions of women , men and children are forced to work in sweatshops , construction , agriculture , as street beggars and in other hazardous jobs for little or no pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imo says victims of labor trafficking may be forced to work as street beggars kumar ramjali was duped with the promise of a good job with good money .
he said a jordanian company recruited him in his native nepal in 2004 to work in the united states .
but instead , ramjali was sent to iraq , where he was forced to work at a us military base against his will . he said his passport was confiscated and he was not allowed to leave for four years .
jana , a 30-year-old bosnian national , also fell victim to an employment scam .
after moving to to slovenia to continue her studies , she attended a job interview with an accounting firm arranged by a newly made female friend .
" the first 10 minutes looked pretty normal , like a normal office and a woman was there interviewing me , " she said .
" and then suddenly , two men came in and the interview was finished . "
jana said the men dragged her out of the office and when she resisted , they became extremely violent .
" i was raped and beaten many times , " she said .
" afterwards , i was taken to some place , blindfolded and repeatedly raped and drugged with heroin for a few days . "
later , jana said she began to receive clients – between six and 10 each day for four months .

groehe said that the method of levying funds would not yet be clear , but that the tax would be " substantial . "

several of germany 's energy giants had reacted with outrage after hearing of the proposals .

" the problem is that the law is unfair .
there 's a trend in germany and elsewhere for people to have more than one nationality , " said marei pelzer , legal consultant for pro asyl , an organization that focuses on the rights of refugees and immigrants .
" we already have 4.5 million people in germany with more than one nationality , around 53 percent of those being granted german citizenship have dual nationality , " she told deutsche welle .

being born in germany gives them the right to german citizenship , but only if they give up their parents ' nationality by the time they turn 21 .
this so-called ' duty to choose ' , which is unique to germany , is controversial , not least because there are countries , like iran , morocco , afghanistan and some latin american countries , which do not allow citizens to give up their nationality , so in those cases , dual nationality is already being granted , which creates what the ngos call a two-class system .

but many members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party argue that citizenship is a question of loyalty .
" he or she has to accept german citizenship , that is all we 're asking in terms of integration , " reinhard grindel , home affairs expert of the christian democrats in parliament , told german public radio deutschlandradio kultur .
" but that is non-negotiable .

" the government needs to recognize the signs of the times , it should not just preach the need for integration , but instead focus on creating the legal basis for a modern immigration state , " pelzer told deutsche welle .
" there are 82 million people in germany , 6.7 million of those are not german nationals and 1.3 million were born here , but still do n't have german citizenship .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.08.2010 hamburg 's winning start gives under-fire coach breathing space großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veh won the bundesliga in 2007 hamburg 's armin veh still belongs to the small circle of elite bundesliga coaches with a job at a top team and is battling to stay there .
but as deutsche welle found out , there are certain questions he hates answering . armin veh has one of the better resumes in the bundesliga .
he 's coached three different lower-league teams to promotion and is one of only five currently active coaches to have won the first division title .
but among the elite , he 's also an outsider who gets comparatively little respect .
whereas thomas schaaf , lousis van gaal , jupp heynckes and felix magath can all feel relatively secure in their jobs , veh is anything but a sure bet to survive this season at hamburg .
hamburg got off to fine start , beating magath 's schalke in round one .
but the team has also run through nine coaches in as many years , and veh knows that loyalty is a rare commodity these days .
" coaches get fired more quickly than used to be the case , " veh told deutsche welle .
" if you do n't reach your short-term goals , it 's pretty much impossible to do any medium- or long-term work . "
veh 's career has been a roller-coaster in recent years .
appointed on an interim basis at stuttgart in the midst of the 2005-6 campaign , he won the title with the team the following season - only to be unceremoniously axed the year after .
the title established veh 's credentials , but he used up almost all of that capital in his next assignment .
do n't mention the magath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veh 's time at wolfsburg was characterized by frustration veh visibly bristles , evading questions , when asked to comment on his short-lived tenure as felix magath 's successor at wolfsburg last season .
in retrospect , it was a very difficult task .
magath had won the title in 2008-9 , and veh had to try to sustain that success while putting his own stamp on the team .
he sought to change the wolves ' style of play and frantically rotated players as their defense revealed unexpected gaping holes .
he was fired last january after a nine-game winless streak and wolfsburg ended the season in eighth place .
that experience does n't seem to have affected veh as much as one might expect .
at hamburg , he 's continued to do things his way .
his controversial decisions include moving the team 's most productive striker , mladen petric , out to the wing , and nominating newly acquired defender heiko westermann as team captain .
" i wanted to give the team a different accent , a new accent , " veh said .
" that was the logic behind heiko westermann as captain . "
that initiative may be more suitable for hamburg than wolfsburg .
unlike wolfsburg , hamburg are not coming off the back of a triumph .
in fact , despite acquiring superstar ruud van nistelrooy and highly touted youngster eljero elia , the northern german side resolutely disappointed last season , coming in seventh .
one of veh 's first tasks is to win the support of those who were most disappointed - the fans .
overcoming skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening day win over schalke showed hamburg 's renewed team spirit the relationship between hamburg players and supporters totally deteriorated last season , with fans booing what they viewed as over-paid prima donnas and striker paolo guerrero retaliating by beaning one of them with a full water bottle .
it may be just diplomacy , but veh says he has n't encountered any major personality issues in the squad far .
" i have n't been able to see any signs that the team is difficult , " veh said .
" they have n't made that impression on me - although difficulties usually only arise when you do n't have success . "
truer words were never spoken .
when veh 's appointment was announced last may , the overwhelming reaction among fans was dismay .
" mediocre coach for a mediocre team , " wrote one blogger succinctly when the news broke .
" armin veh - is this a joke ? " opined another .
" but mostly likely no real coach wanted to come to hamburg , which is no wonder given how chaotic the club is . "
veh 's challenge will to be to earn the support of skeptics like these , and there 's a lot on the line .
having bombed in wolfsburg after succeeding in stuttgart , veh is unlikely ever to get another chance to coach a top bundesliga club , if he fails to attain his goals in hamburg .
veh is known as a players ' coach , and perhaps the initial win against schalke was a sign that he 's got the squad behind him .
or in could be a blip on the radar screen , and as veh knows only too well , fans of the league 's biggest and richest clubs are never content with blips . even if they have a past bundesliga title to their credit .
armin veh was interviewed by jana schaefer for dw-tv 's bundesliga kick off .
the program airs every tuesday .

as the debate over the future of nuclear power in germany heats up , greenpeace is accusing the government of defying a law mandating the release of the next monitoring report on security of the country 's energy supply . greenpeace germany took legal action monday against the federal ministry of economics for failing to release a report detailing key information on the country 's future energy needs ahead of last month 's deadline .
the complaint was lodged in a berlin administrative court .
under germany 's energy industry law -lrb- enwg -rrb- , the economics ministry is required to publish a monitoring report on the future of the country 's energy supply every two years and present the information to the european commission .
the deadline for the 2010 report was july 31 .
" to our surprise and disappointment , this report was not presented , and it was not submitted to the european commission in brussels , " greenpeace energy expert tobias münchmeyer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace has long campaigned against atomic energy the future of nuclear the data contained in the report is expected to further clarify a subject of intense political debate in germany : whether the country can meet its future electricity needs without nuclear power .
germany 's ruling coalition under chancellor angela merkel supports extending the operating lives of nuclear reactors beyond the 2022 shut-down deadline passed by the previous social democrat-led government .
münchmeyer said greenpeace believed the ministry , led by minister rainer brüderle , delayed the report 's release " in order to manipulate the current debate on energy supply in germany . "
a statement from the german economics ministry blamed the hold-up on outside problems .
" publication of the federal ministry of economics monitoring report on the security of supply in the electrical industry is postponed until fall 2010 , due to external assessment delays involving the preparation of energy scenarios for the german government 's energy policy , " a ministry spokesman told deutsche welle .
ahead of government plans to craft a long-term energy strategy by the end of september , the economics ministry commissioned several institutions with developing different energy scenarios for the future .
energy shortage ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nuclear phase-out was set for 2022 by the last red-green government yet according to a recent report in german newspaper die zeit , the ministry itself established a general framework for scientific assessment - and münchmeyer said data was chosen in ways that would support the conclusion that nuclear extension plans would be " useful or positive for the german economy . "
german utilities companies have warned that the country could face an electricity shortage if plans for a nuclear phase-out go through - a claim that greenpeace , a long-term opponent of atomic power , disputes .
" the last report from 2008 has clearly shown that there is no risk of running a deficit in the electricity supply , " münchmeyer said , adding that the 2010 monitoring document would further support that point .

the spanish government has refused to confirm it paid a multi-million euro ransom for them . two spanish aid workers kidnapped by al qaeda 's north african wing were released on monday , the spanish government has confirmed .
al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- seized albert vilalta and roque pascual in mauritania last november .
" they are safe and sound after 268 days in the hands of their kidnappers and of the spanish government 's concern and efforts to obtain their release , " spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero told reporters on monday .
zapatero declined to comment on whether spain had paid a ransom to aqim .
a spanish air force plane is carrying government officials and family members to meet the two men in the capital of burkina faso , ouagadougou .
they are due to arrive back in barcelona on monday evening .
vilalta and pascual were captured as their relief convoy was returning to the mauritanian capital nouakchott .
aqim also abducted a woman , alicia gamez , and took the three to northern mali .
gamez was released in march .
hostage swap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish pm zapatero described the kidnapping as " an act of terrorism " burkina faso is believed to have had an important mediating role in negotiations between spain and the kidnappers .
the spanish government paid a ransom of 3.8 million euros -lrb- $ 4.8 million dollars -rrb- to secure the hostages ' freedom , according to daily newspaper el mundo .
mauritanian officials refused to comment on reports their release was linked to mauritania 's repatriation to mali of an al qaeda collaborator earlier in august .
omar sid-ahmed ould hamma had been sentenced in mauritania , but was then extradited to mali , who freed him .
aqim is considered a more opportunistic than ideological group , raising funds by ransoming hostages and drug trafficking .
the al qaeda branch has named spain as a target because it is an ally of the united states and a member of nato .
in july , aqim killed french hostage michel germaneau , after french troops failed in their efforts to rescue the 78-year-old .

" it 's not perfectly clear the mechanism which causes this , " explained one of the researchers jarrod welch . " one hypothesis is that warmer temperatures increase respiration in the rice plant , which consumes energy .
if these warmer temperatures occur at night time , there is no offsetting of the synthesis .
so , warmer temperatures mean increased respiration , increased energy consumption in the rice plant .
but synthesis is not occurring to replace that energy . " rice feeds three billion people daily rice feeds about three billion people daily across the world and according to fao figures , over 60 percent of asia 's poor population is dependent on it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 60 percent of asia 's poor population depends on rice the losses in rice production will lead to food insecurity , experts fear . david dawe from the fao also worked on the study : " if temperatures continue to increase , our research seems to show that rice yields will go down or wo n't increase as fast as they otherwise would have . " he says this will have an " impact on food prices and make it much more difficult for poor people to afford food .
and it 's poor people who spend most of their money on rice .
so it 's they who 'll be most affected . " solutions must be implemented soon however , dawe says that there are ways of increasing the rice yields such as creating " better varieties that are more tolerant of higher temperatures , or slow down the increase in temperature , or shift the cropping season , try to plant rice at a different time of year when it 's a bit cooler . " experts have urged politicians to implement these solutions , warning that there could be a serious rice crisis otherwise . they point out that rising temperatures caused by global warming are one threat to rice yields , but another is rising sea levels which will affect the low-lying rice-growing areas of asia too . author : pin manika editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel said that a change was needed in the way members of her government behaved . chancellor angela merkel said that apparent disunity within her ruling center-right coalition was to blame for a dip in voter approval ratings for member parties .
in an interview with the public television station zdf , merkel said that her government needed to make tough decisions .
however , she said the nature of discussion within the coalition - which has been accused of excessive bickering - was partly responsible for alienating the electorate .
" i think we have n't managed to reach people partly because the confusion of voices and the way we have treated each other have not been what is to be expected of us , " merkel said , adding that the situation needed to be improved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coalition parties have lost ground since the election last year in the interview on sunday , merkel said that her government could be particularly satisfied with its record on the economy .
the chancellor said she was confident about regaining opinion poll approval as soon as important decisions facing the country had been made , by the end of the year .
questions to be answered merkel said financial stability , health , education for the children of welfare recipients , energy policy and reforms to the military were her government 's top priorities .
the chancellor said that she believed that after these decisions were taken , voters would understand that germany was " better equipped for the future . "
in the interview following her vacation in italy , merkel reaffirmed her commitment to introducing a tax on nuclear power providers , despite objections from the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is open to a suspension of compulsory military service the chancellor also said she was open to a suspension of germany 's compulsory military service .
both issues have been the subject of heated debate within the coalition .
in an opinion poll released last week , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- moved ahead of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who along with bavarian sister party the csu share power with the liberal free democrats fdp .
the spd had 32 percent support compared to 31 percent for the cdu and csu in the poll conducted by germany 's allensbach institute .
the fdp had just six percent .
the result contrasts with the general election in september 2009 when the cdu and csu won almost 34 percent of the popular vote , and the fdp almost 15 percent , compared with 23 percent for the spd .

merkel said that a change was needed in the way members of her government behaved . chancellor angela merkel said that apparent disunity within her ruling center-right coalition was to blame for a dip in voter approval ratings for member parties .
in an interview with the public television station zdf , merkel said that her government needed to make tough decisions .
however , she said the nature of discussion within the coalition - which has been accused of excessive bickering - was partly responsible for alienating the electorate .
" i think we have n't managed to reach people partly because the confusion of voices and the way we have treated each other have not been what is to be expected of us , " merkel said , adding that the situation needed to be improved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coalition parties have lost ground since the election last year in the interview on sunday , merkel said that her government could be particularly satisfied with its record on the economy .
the chancellor said she was confident about regaining opinion poll approval as soon as important decisions facing the country had been made , by the end of the year .
questions to be answered merkel said financial stability , health , education for the children of welfare recipients , energy policy and reforms to the military were her government 's top priorities .
the chancellor said that she believed that after these decisions were taken , voters would understand that germany was " better equipped for the future . "
in the interview following her vacation in italy , merkel reaffirmed her commitment to introducing a tax on nuclear power providers , despite objections from the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is open to a suspension of compulsory military service the chancellor also said she was open to a suspension of germany 's compulsory military service .
both issues have been the subject of heated debate within the coalition .
in an opinion poll released last week , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- moved ahead of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who along with bavarian sister party the csu share power with the liberal free democrats fdp .
the spd had 32 percent support compared to 31 percent for the cdu and csu in the poll conducted by germany 's allensbach institute .
the fdp had just six percent .
the result contrasts with the general election in september 2009 when the cdu and csu won almost 34 percent of the popular vote , and the fdp almost 15 percent , compared with 23 percent for the spd .

the on-board air conditioning also failed , causing minor health scares . an express train from berlin to munich ground to a halt close to stuttgart on sunday , after suffering engine failure .
the 420 passengers on board were stranded in a tunnel near vaihingen an der enz in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg for over three hours without air conditioning .
one was later hospitalized and three more required minor medical treatment because of the rising temperatures on board .
the inter city express -lrb- ice -rrb- train stopped because of a problem with the engine , which also powers the climate control systems .
however , batteries continued to power the lights , toilets and door switches during the lengthy delay .
plan b german rail operator deutsche bahn first tried to solve the problem by sending a locomotive to tow the stranded train to its next stop in stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german rail service has endured a trying summer however , when this attempt failed , a replacement was sent instead , and passengers eventually switched trains inside the tunnel .
a deutsche bahn spokesman said the train stopped at around 1 p.m. , with the replacement eventually arriving at 4:30 p.m.
critics said the prolonged wait showed that the german railway service lacks the capacity to deal with unexpected problems .
" if it 's too much to ask of deutsche bahn to tow away one stranded ice in a case like this , " regional head of the train passengers association pro-bahn , stefan buhl said , " then it 's difficult to imagine what might happen in a genuine catastrophe . "
the breakdown forced deutsche bahn to close the line in both directions for the entire time period – diverting other services onto an older , slower line , delaying them by roughly quarter of an hour .
deutsche bahn is legally obliged to pay back half the cost of the ticket to any passengers whose trains are delayed by two hours or more .
it 's been a difficult summer for the german railway operator , which made the headlines during a july heat-wave when the air conditioning systems failed on three ice trains and 44 passengers collapsed in the heat .

most of the 350,000 inhabitants have already been evacuated but the floods threaten to wreak havoc . as more towns are under imminent threat of flooding and the authorities battle with heavy monsoon rains , there are millions of people in emergency camps who are in desperate need of relief . the german commissioner for humanitarian aid markus loening recently visited the flooded areas of pakistan and got a first-hand insight into the goings on at two camps . " it 's worst for the children , " he told deutsche welle .
" there are very many women with young children .
the estimates are that 90,000 babies are going to be born in the coming weeks and that a third of them are at acute risk of not surviving the first days .
these women are in very rudimentary tents .
they can see down onto their flooded villages .

loening said that medical aid was crucial but that many people still needed just the basics . " some six million people need emergency help , they need food to survive .
the children get biscuits .
poland has donated biscuits .
we could also donate them .
children can survive on them because they are high-energy biscuits .
they are being distributed there .
baby food is also being distributed .
if they get that , they can survive one , two or three days .
food and clean water are what ’ s most important at the moment , " loening said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is not enough food for everyone at the relief camps he added that the cost of such products is low but that the sheer numbers of people needing supplies is making deliveries logistically difficult . the world food program has reached over a million people .
it has called for more helicopters to get food to people who remain isolated by the high flood waters . loening dispelled doubts that donations were not going to the right places .
he said that all the donations to german organizations were going " one-to-one " to the people who needed it . donor fatigue in pakistan and abroad if the west has been criticized for its sluggish response to the floods and a form of donor fatigue , the pakistani population 's distrust of the weak civilian government has reportedly also had a negative impact on donations from pakistanis themselves . " this trust deficit has created a situation where the people are not coming forward , " said tayyab siddique , a pakistani political expert . the army on the other hand has received much praise for its relief operations , although political expert ayesha siddika explained there was some marketing going on : " it ' not the way they 're doing work .
it 's how their work is being presented . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tents in the emergency camps are very rudimentary observers do not predict , however , that the political situation will change much as a result of this image-boosting , as it is widely thought that the military already holds the power behind the scenes . nor do they think the taliban will benefit unduly as their emergency relief operations are reportedly as chaotic as those of the authorities . positive for pakistani-west relations however , ayesha siddika believes that the way the floods are handled by the west could have a positive impact : " the more the west helps , it will be , i mean one of the spin offs will be of course improvement of relations , doing away with misunderstandings .

the total number of soldiers will be cut to around 165,000 , with compulsory service practically abolished . defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg presented his draft plans for the future of the german army to government ministers on monday .
the model guttenberg unveiled will see the present 252,000 soldiers cut to 163,500 over the next few years , a reduction of around a third .
conscription will be suspended in the short term , with young men no longer called up to do compulsory service .
but guttenberg stressed that it was important conscription retains its place in the constitution , in case it becomes viable again in the future .
" by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better , " guttenberg said after discussing his proposals with coalition partners .
knock-on effects the chosen model would mean a reduction in the professional standing army from around 195,000 soldiers to 156,000 .
the cuts mean that the army would be left with three tank battalions , two artillery battalions and one paratrooper regiment .
the civilian service alternative to military conscription , an important provider of labor to germany 's care homes , will also be suspended .
family minister kristina schroeder proposed on monday to introduce a national voluntary community service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has conscripted young men into its armed forces since 1957 " i 'm not giving myself hope that we can completely replace what we have now , " schroeder told reporters in berlin .
but she celebrated the fact that women would be able to perform community service for the first time .
the proposal to suspend rather than scrap conscription altogether postpones a contentious debate that has been bedevilling chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition in recent weeks .
merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- sees itself as a staunch defender of compulsory military service , though its military impracticality and high cost have long threatened the ideal of a ' citizen 's army . '
' voluntary conscription ' guttenberg , of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , hopes to mollify his party colleagues with the new " voluntary military service " model , which he says represents " a modern variation for the citizen to take on responsibility . "
the government is hoping to attract volunteers to sign on to this new scheme for up to 23 months by promising driver 's licenses , university places and other fringe benefits .
women would be included amongst an estimated 7,500 army volunteers .
" not enough to safeguard the regeneration of the troops with up-and-coming soldiers , " criticized ulrich kirsch , head of the armed forces association .
the defense ministry is aiming to cut some 8.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- off its budget over the next four years , though guttenberg warned that savings in new armament projects would also be needed .

the total number of soldiers will be cut to around 165,000 , with compulsory service practically abolished . defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg presented his draft plans for the future of the german army to government ministers on monday .
the model guttenberg unveiled will see the present 252,000 soldiers cut to 163,500 over the next few years , a reduction of around a third .
conscription will be suspended in the short term , with young men no longer called up to do compulsory service .
but guttenberg stressed that it was important conscription retains its place in the constitution , in case it becomes viable again in the future .
" by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better , " guttenberg said after discussing his proposals with coalition partners .
knock-on effects the chosen model would mean a reduction in the professional standing army from around 195,000 soldiers to 156,000 .
the cuts mean that the army would be left with three tank battalions , two artillery battalions and one paratrooper regiment .
the civilian service alternative to military conscription , an important provider of labor to germany 's care homes , will also be suspended .
family minister kristina schroeder proposed on monday to introduce a national voluntary community service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has conscripted young men into its armed forces since 1957 " i 'm not giving myself hope that we can completely replace what we have now , " schroeder told reporters in berlin .
but she celebrated the fact that women would be able to perform community service for the first time .
the proposal to suspend rather than scrap conscription altogether postpones a contentious debate that has been bedevilling chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition in recent weeks .
merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- sees itself as a staunch defender of compulsory military service , though its military impracticality and high cost have long threatened the ideal of a ' citizen 's army . '
' voluntary conscription ' guttenberg , of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , hopes to mollify his party colleagues with the new " voluntary military service " model , which he says represents " a modern variation for the citizen to take on responsibility . "
the government is hoping to attract volunteers to sign on to this new scheme for up to 23 months by promising driver 's licenses , university places and other fringe benefits .
women would be included amongst an estimated 7,500 army volunteers .

22 1990 is one of the most historic in german post-war history .
after four decades of division , the decision was made by the east german parliament to united with west germany on oct .
3 , 1990 . after a night-long discussion , that ended in the early hours of aug .
23 , 1990 , the decision was made for the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- to be absorbed into the federal republic of germany -lrb- frg -rrb- .
at a special session of the east german parliament , the volkskammer , the representatives voted to merge with the west .
instead of a brand new constitution to cover the new unified state , it was decided to just incorporate the gdr under the existing constitution .
the former east was incorporated into the west under article 23 of the federal republic 's basic law .
heavy debates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly elected parliament effectively voted to disband itself in 1990 on 18 mar . , the people of the gdr had held the first democratic elections for the volkskammer .
the main aim of this new parliament was to prepare for accession to the federal republic .
by the summer of 1990 , the gdr and frg had created a single economic zone , with the deutschmark being used as the sole currency .
the gdr had also adopted large aspects of the economic and legal systems of the west .
by august , not a single meeting of the volkskammer passed without the subject of ' immediate accession ' being discussed .
for the then-prime minister of the gdr , lothar de maiziere , the time had come to seize the initiative .
" after a regular session in the afternoon of aug .
22 , " he recalled , " -lsb- we decided -rsb- to carry on with a special session with the sole agenda item of setting a timeline for german reunification . "
although it had been thought best to implement a speedy accession , not all parliamentarians were in agreement with the prime minister .
wolfgang ullman , a representative from the alliance 90 party urged de maiziere to stop proceedings .
ullman said he would report him to the prosecutor general of the gdr for high treason .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ullman -lrb- r . -rrb- did not agree with de maiziere 's approach however , a little later , the premier of the east german state of saxony-anhalt , reinhard hoeppner , opened the special session .
searching for the right date full discussions began immediately , with lothar de maiziere making the formal request to join with the federal republic but giving no specific date .
he proposed some time before october , as it would be the 41st anniversary of the gdr on oct .
14 , and he felt this date was symbolic .
" i thought that we could have the first free unified national elections on the oct .
14 , " de maiziere said .
" taking power back from the sovereign body and giving it to the new parliament . "
however it soon became clear that de maiziere 's date would not find a majority .
except for the successor party to the east german ruling sed , the pds -lrb- party for democratic socialism -rrb- , no one wanted to experience the 41st anniversary of the gdr a week early .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse was a member of the gdr parliament in 1990 after a long debate , another solution was offered by wolfgang thierse , a representative of the spd in the chamber .
he suggested a ' two-plus-four ' approach .
terms and conditions since may , the ' two-plus-four ' talks had been held between the two german foreign ministers and their four counterparts from the victorious allied nations .
the discussions centred on the allies withdrawing their troops and rights from germany .
the talks were due to come to a close on sept .
12 , in moscow .
wolfgang thierse suggested a date following this meeting on sept .
13 to be the official accession day .
however it was thought that this timeline too would not reach approval .
" it was clear that by sept .
12 , the ' two plus four ' contract would not be ratified , " lothar de maiziere said .
the final reunification date of oct .
3 , 1990 , came to be decided because it coincided with an international foreign ministers ' conference in new york on oct .
1 , .
the foreign ministers from the allied countries said they wished to withdraw their troops from the parts of germany they were occupying on oct .
3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two german foreign ministers : gdr 's markus meckel -lrb- l . -rrb- and frg 's hans-dietrich genscher " this is how the date of oct .
3 came about , " recalled de maiziere .
a special day for lothar de maiziere , the date of oct .
3 is a truly special one .
by then , the 50-year-old had spent half his life in the gdr and was touched by the socialist state .
" regardless of whether rejects or disowns the system , there is still a sense of loyalty to it , " he said .
therefore for de maiziere and for many others from the gdr , " this new beginning is not easy . "
however he added that for all politicians elected to the chamber of the people , it was clear that " our main purpose was to abolish ourselves . "

a special day for lothar de maiziere , the date of oct .
3 is a truly special one .
by then , the 50-year-old had spent half his life in the gdr and was touched by the socialist state .
" regardless of whether rejects or disowns the system , there is still a sense of loyalty to it , " he said .
therefore for de maiziere and for many others from the gdr , " this new beginning is not easy . "
however he added that for all politicians elected to the chamber of the people , it was clear that " our main purpose was to abolish ourselves . "

but as deutsche welle found out , there are certain questions he hates answering . armin veh has one of the better resumes in the bundesliga .
he 's coached three different lower-league teams to promotion and is one of only five currently active coaches to have won the first division title .
but among the elite , he 's also an outsider who gets comparatively little respect .
whereas thomas schaaf , lousis van gaal , jupp heynckes and felix magath can all feel relatively secure in their jobs , veh is anything but a sure bet to survive this season at hamburg .
hamburg got off to fine start , beating magath 's schalke in round one .
but the team has also run through nine coaches in as many years , and veh knows that loyalty is a rare commodity these days .
" coaches get fired more quickly than used to be the case , " veh told deutsche welle .
" if you do n't reach your short-term goals , it 's pretty much impossible to do any medium- or long-term work . "
veh 's career has been a roller-coaster in recent years .
appointed on an interim basis at stuttgart in the midst of the 2005-6 campaign , he won the title with the team the following season - only to be unceremoniously axed the year after .
the title established veh 's credentials , but he used up almost all of that capital in his next assignment .
do n't mention the magath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veh 's time at wolfsburg was characterized by frustration veh visibly bristles , evading questions , when asked to comment on his short-lived tenure as felix magath 's successor at wolfsburg last season .
in retrospect , it was a very difficult task .
magath had won the title in 2008-9 , and veh had to try to sustain that success while putting his own stamp on the team .
he sought to change the wolves ' style of play and frantically rotated players as their defense revealed unexpected gaping holes .
he was fired last january after a nine-game winless streak and wolfsburg ended the season in eighth place .
that experience does n't seem to have affected veh as much as one might expect .
at hamburg , he 's continued to do things his way .
his controversial decisions include moving the team 's most productive striker , mladen petric , out to the wing , and nominating newly acquired defender heiko westermann as team captain .
" i wanted to give the team a different accent , a new accent , " veh said .
" that was the logic behind heiko westermann as captain . "
that initiative may be more suitable for hamburg than wolfsburg .
unlike wolfsburg , hamburg are not coming off the back of a triumph .
in fact , despite acquiring superstar ruud van nistelrooy and highly touted youngster eljero elia , the northern german side resolutely disappointed last season , coming in seventh .
one of veh 's first tasks is to win the support of those who were most disappointed - the fans .
overcoming skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening day win over schalke showed hamburg 's renewed team spirit the relationship between hamburg players and supporters totally deteriorated last season , with fans booing what they viewed as over-paid prima donnas and striker paolo guerrero retaliating by beaning one of them with a full water bottle .
it may be just diplomacy , but veh says he has n't encountered any major personality issues in the squad far .
" i have n't been able to see any signs that the team is difficult , " veh said .
" they have n't made that impression on me - although difficulties usually only arise when you do n't have success . "
truer words were never spoken .
when veh 's appointment was announced last may , the overwhelming reaction among fans was dismay .
" mediocre coach for a mediocre team , " wrote one blogger succinctly when the news broke .
" armin veh - is this a joke ? " opined another .
" but mostly likely no real coach wanted to come to hamburg , which is no wonder given how chaotic the club is . "
veh 's challenge will to be to earn the support of skeptics like these , and there 's a lot on the line .
having bombed in wolfsburg after succeeding in stuttgart , veh is unlikely ever to get another chance to coach a top bundesliga club , if he fails to attain his goals in hamburg .
veh is known as a players ' coach , and perhaps the initial win against schalke was a sign that he 's got the squad behind him .
or in could be a blip on the radar screen , and as veh knows only too well , fans of the league 's biggest and richest clubs are never content with blips . even if they have a past bundesliga title to their credit .

merkel said that a change was needed in the way members of her government behaved . chancellor angela merkel said that apparent disunity within her ruling center-right coalition was to blame for a dip in voter approval ratings for member parties .
in an interview with the public television station zdf , merkel said that her government needed to make tough decisions .
however , she said the nature of discussion within the coalition - which has been accused of excessive bickering - was partly responsible for alienating the electorate .

the on-board air conditioning also failed , causing minor health scares . an express train from berlin to munich ground to a halt close to stuttgart on sunday , after suffering engine failure .
the 420 passengers on board were stranded in a tunnel near vaihingen an der enz in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg for over three hours without air conditioning .
one was later hospitalized and three more required minor medical treatment because of the rising temperatures on board .
the inter city express -lrb- ice -rrb- train stopped because of a problem with the engine , which also powers the climate control systems .
however , batteries continued to power the lights , toilets and door switches during the lengthy delay .
plan b german rail operator deutsche bahn first tried to solve the problem by sending a locomotive to tow the stranded train to its next stop in stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german rail service has endured a trying summer however , when this attempt failed , a replacement was sent instead , and passengers eventually switched trains inside the tunnel .
a deutsche bahn spokesman said the train stopped at around 1 p.m. , with the replacement eventually arriving at 4:30 p.m.
critics said the prolonged wait showed that the german railway service lacks the capacity to deal with unexpected problems .
" if it 's too much to ask of deutsche bahn to tow away one stranded ice in a case like this , " regional head of the train passengers association pro-bahn , stefan buhl said , " then it 's difficult to imagine what might happen in a genuine catastrophe . "
the breakdown forced deutsche bahn to close the line in both directions for the entire time period – diverting other services onto an older , slower line , delaying them by roughly quarter of an hour .
deutsche bahn is legally obliged to pay back half the cost of the ticket to any passengers whose trains are delayed by two hours or more .
it 's been a difficult summer for the german railway operator , which made the headlines during a july heat-wave when the air conditioning systems failed on three ice trains and 44 passengers collapsed in the heat .

22 1990 is one of the most historic in german post-war history .
after four decades of division , the decision was made by the east german parliament to united with west germany on oct .
3 , 1990 . after a night-long discussion , that ended in the early hours of aug .
23 , 1990 , the decision was made for the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- to be absorbed into the federal republic of germany -lrb- frg -rrb- .
at a special session of the east german parliament , the volkskammer , the representatives voted to merge with the west .
instead of a brand new constitution to cover the new unified state , it was decided to just incorporate the gdr under the existing constitution .
the former east was incorporated into the west under article 23 of the federal republic 's basic law .
heavy debates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly elected parliament effectively voted to disband itself in 1990 on 18 mar . , the people of the gdr had held the first democratic elections for the volkskammer .
the main aim of this new parliament was to prepare for accession to the federal republic .
by the summer of 1990 , the gdr and frg had created a single economic zone , with the deutschmark being used as the sole currency .
the gdr had also adopted large aspects of the economic and legal systems of the west .
by august , not a single meeting of the volkskammer passed without the subject of ' immediate accession ' being discussed .
for the then-prime minister of the gdr , lothar de maiziere , the time had come to seize the initiative .
" after a regular session in the afternoon of aug .
22 , " he recalled , " -lsb- we decided -rsb- to carry on with a special session with the sole agenda item of setting a timeline for german reunification . "
although it had been thought best to implement a speedy accession , not all parliamentarians were in agreement with the prime minister .
wolfgang ullman , a representative from the alliance 90 party urged de maiziere to stop proceedings .
ullman said he would report him to the prosecutor general of the gdr for high treason .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ullman -lrb- r . -rrb- did not agree with de maiziere 's approach however , a little later , the premier of the east german state of saxony-anhalt , reinhard hoeppner , opened the special session .
searching for the right date full discussions began immediately , with lothar de maiziere making the formal request to join with the federal republic but giving no specific date .
he proposed some time before october , as it would be the 41st anniversary of the gdr on oct .
14 , and he felt this date was symbolic .
" i thought that we could have the first free unified national elections on the oct .
14 , " de maiziere said .
" taking power back from the sovereign body and giving it to the new parliament . "
however it soon became clear that de maiziere 's date would not find a majority .
except for the successor party to the east german ruling sed , the pds -lrb- party for democratic socialism -rrb- , no one wanted to experience the 41st anniversary of the gdr a week early .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse was a member of the gdr parliament in 1990 after a long debate , another solution was offered by wolfgang thierse , a representative of the spd in the chamber .
he suggested a ' two-plus-four ' approach .
terms and conditions since may , the ' two-plus-four ' talks had been held between the two german foreign ministers and their four counterparts from the victorious allied nations .
the discussions centred on the allies withdrawing their troops and rights from germany .
the talks were due to come to a close on sept .
12 , in moscow .
wolfgang thierse suggested a date following this meeting on sept .
13 to be the official accession day .
however it was thought that this timeline too would not reach approval .
" it was clear that by sept .
12 , the ' two plus four ' contract would not be ratified , " lothar de maiziere said .
the final reunification date of oct .
3 , 1990 , came to be decided because it coincided with an international foreign ministers ' conference in new york on oct .
1 , .
the foreign ministers from the allied countries said they wished to withdraw their troops from the parts of germany they were occupying on oct .
3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two german foreign ministers : gdr 's markus meckel -lrb- l . -rrb- and frg 's hans-dietrich genscher " this is how the date of oct .
3 came about , " recalled de maiziere .
a special day for lothar de maiziere , the date of oct .
3 is a truly special one .
by then , the 50-year-old had spent half his life in the gdr and was touched by the socialist state .
" regardless of whether rejects or disowns the system , there is still a sense of loyalty to it , " he said .
therefore for de maiziere and for many others from the gdr , " this new beginning is not easy . "
however he added that for all politicians elected to the chamber of the people , it was clear that " our main purpose was to abolish ourselves . "

except for the successor party to the east german ruling sed , the pds -lrb- party for democratic socialism -rrb- , no one wanted to experience the 41st anniversary of the gdr a week early .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse was a member of the gdr parliament in 1990 after a long debate , another solution was offered by wolfgang thierse , a representative of the spd in the chamber .
he suggested a ' two-plus-four ' approach .
terms and conditions since may , the ' two-plus-four ' talks had been held between the two german foreign ministers and their four counterparts from the victorious allied nations .
the discussions centred on the allies withdrawing their troops and rights from germany .
the talks were due to come to a close on sept .
12 , in moscow .
wolfgang thierse suggested a date following this meeting on sept .
13 to be the official accession day .
however it was thought that this timeline too would not reach approval .
" it was clear that by sept .
12 , the ' two plus four ' contract would not be ratified , " lothar de maiziere said .
the final reunification date of oct .
3 , 1990 , came to be decided because it coincided with an international foreign ministers ' conference in new york on oct .
1 , .
the foreign ministers from the allied countries said they wished to withdraw their troops from the parts of germany they were occupying on oct .
3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two german foreign ministers : gdr 's markus meckel -lrb- l . -rrb- and frg 's hans-dietrich genscher " this is how the date of oct .
3 came about , " recalled de maiziere .
a special day for lothar de maiziere , the date of oct .
3 is a truly special one .
by then , the 50-year-old had spent half his life in the gdr and was touched by the socialist state .
" regardless of whether rejects or disowns the system , there is still a sense of loyalty to it , " he said .
therefore for de maiziere and for many others from the gdr , " this new beginning is not easy . "
however he added that for all politicians elected to the chamber of the people , it was clear that " our main purpose was to abolish ourselves . "

the total number of soldiers will be cut to around 165,000 , with compulsory service practically abolished . defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg presented his draft plans for the future of the german army to government ministers on monday .
the model guttenberg unveiled will see the present 252,000 soldiers cut to 163,500 over the next few years , a reduction of around a third .
conscription will be suspended in the short term , with young men no longer called up to do compulsory service .
but guttenberg stressed that it was important conscription retains its place in the constitution , in case it becomes viable again in the future .
" by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better , " guttenberg said after discussing his proposals with coalition partners .
knock-on effects the chosen model would mean a reduction in the professional standing army from around 195,000 soldiers to 156,000 .
the cuts mean that the army would be left with three tank battalions , two artillery battalions and one paratrooper regiment .
the civilian service alternative to military conscription , an important provider of labor to germany 's care homes , will also be suspended .
family minister kristina schroeder proposed on monday to introduce a national voluntary community service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has conscripted young men into its armed forces since 1957 " i 'm not giving myself hope that we can completely replace what we have now , " schroeder told reporters in berlin .
but she celebrated the fact that women would be able to perform community service for the first time .
the proposal to suspend rather than scrap conscription altogether postpones a contentious debate that has been bedevilling chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition in recent weeks .
merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- sees itself as a staunch defender of compulsory military service , though its military impracticality and high cost have long threatened the ideal of a ' citizen 's army . '
' voluntary conscription ' guttenberg , of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , hopes to mollify his party colleagues with the new " voluntary military service " model , which he says represents " a modern variation for the citizen to take on responsibility . "
the government is hoping to attract volunteers to sign on to this new scheme for up to 23 months by promising driver 's licenses , university places and other fringe benefits .
women would be included amongst an estimated 7,500 army volunteers .
" not enough to safeguard the regeneration of the troops with up-and-coming soldiers , " criticized ulrich kirsch , head of the armed forces association .
the defense ministry is aiming to cut some 8.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- off its budget over the next four years , though guttenberg warned that savings in new armament projects would also be needed .

the civilian service alternative to military conscription , an important provider of labor to germany 's care homes , will also be suspended .
family minister kristina schroeder proposed on monday to introduce a national voluntary community service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has conscripted young men into its armed forces since 1957 " i 'm not giving myself hope that we can completely replace what we have now , " schroeder told reporters in berlin .
but she celebrated the fact that women would be able to perform community service for the first time .
the proposal to suspend rather than scrap conscription altogether postpones a contentious debate that has been bedevilling chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition in recent weeks .
merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- sees itself as a staunch defender of compulsory military service , though its military impracticality and high cost have long threatened the ideal of a ' citizen 's army . '
' voluntary conscription ' guttenberg , of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , hopes to mollify his party colleagues with the new " voluntary military service " model , which he says represents " a modern variation for the citizen to take on responsibility . "
the government is hoping to attract volunteers to sign on to this new scheme for up to 23 months by promising driver 's licenses , university places and other fringe benefits .
women would be included amongst an estimated 7,500 army volunteers .
" not enough to safeguard the regeneration of the troops with up-and-coming soldiers , " criticized ulrich kirsch , head of the armed forces association .
the defense ministry is aiming to cut some 8.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- off its budget over the next four years , though guttenberg warned that savings in new armament projects would also be needed .

as the debate over the future of nuclear power in germany heats up , greenpeace is accusing the government of defying a law mandating the release of the next monitoring report on security of the country 's energy supply . greenpeace germany took legal action monday against the federal ministry of economics for failing to release a report detailing key information on the country 's future energy needs ahead of last month 's deadline .
the complaint was lodged in a berlin administrative court .
under germany 's energy industry law -lrb- enwg -rrb- , the economics ministry is required to publish a monitoring report on the future of the country 's energy supply every two years and present the information to the european commission .
the deadline for the 2010 report was july 31 .
" to our surprise and disappointment , this report was not presented , and it was not submitted to the european commission in brussels , " greenpeace energy expert tobias münchmeyer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace has long campaigned against atomic energy the future of nuclear the data contained in the report is expected to further clarify a subject of intense political debate in germany : whether the country can meet its future electricity needs without nuclear power .
germany 's ruling coalition under chancellor angela merkel supports extending the operating lives of nuclear reactors beyond the 2022 shut-down deadline passed by the previous social democrat-led government .
münchmeyer said greenpeace believed the ministry , led by minister rainer brüderle , delayed the report 's release " in order to manipulate the current debate on energy supply in germany . "
a statement from the german economics ministry blamed the hold-up on outside problems .
" publication of the federal ministry of economics monitoring report on the security of supply in the electrical industry is postponed until fall 2010 , due to external assessment delays involving the preparation of energy scenarios for the german government 's energy policy , " a ministry spokesman told deutsche welle .
ahead of government plans to craft a long-term energy strategy by the end of september , the economics ministry commissioned several institutions with developing different energy scenarios for the future .
energy shortage ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nuclear phase-out was set for 2022 by the last red-green government yet according to a recent report in german newspaper die zeit , the ministry itself established a general framework for scientific assessment - and münchmeyer said data was chosen in ways that would support the conclusion that nuclear extension plans would be " useful or positive for the german economy . "
german utilities companies have warned that the country could face an electricity shortage if plans for a nuclear phase-out go through - a claim that greenpeace , a long-term opponent of atomic power , disputes .
" the last report from 2008 has clearly shown that there is no risk of running a deficit in the electricity supply , " münchmeyer said , adding that the 2010 monitoring document would further support that point .

as the debate over the future of nuclear power in germany heats up , greenpeace is accusing the government of defying a law mandating the release of the next monitoring report on security of the country 's energy supply . greenpeace germany took legal action monday against the federal ministry of economics for failing to release a report detailing key information on the country 's future energy needs ahead of last month 's deadline .
the complaint was lodged in a berlin administrative court .
under germany 's energy industry law -lrb- enwg -rrb- , the economics ministry is required to publish a monitoring report on the future of the country 's energy supply every two years and present the information to the european commission .
the deadline for the 2010 report was july 31 .
" to our surprise and disappointment , this report was not presented , and it was not submitted to the european commission in brussels , " greenpeace energy expert tobias münchmeyer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace has long campaigned against atomic energy the future of nuclear the data contained in the report is expected to further clarify a subject of intense political debate in germany : whether the country can meet its future electricity needs without nuclear power .
germany 's ruling coalition under chancellor angela merkel supports extending the operating lives of nuclear reactors beyond the 2022 shut-down deadline passed by the previous social democrat-led government .
münchmeyer said greenpeace believed the ministry , led by minister rainer brüderle , delayed the report 's release " in order to manipulate the current debate on energy supply in germany . "
a statement from the german economics ministry blamed the hold-up on outside problems .
" publication of the federal ministry of economics monitoring report on the security of supply in the electrical industry is postponed until fall 2010 , due to external assessment delays involving the preparation of energy scenarios for the german government 's energy policy , " a ministry spokesman told deutsche welle .
ahead of government plans to craft a long-term energy strategy by the end of september , the economics ministry commissioned several institutions with developing different energy scenarios for the future .
energy shortage ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nuclear phase-out was set for 2022 by the last red-green government yet according to a recent report in german newspaper die zeit , the ministry itself established a general framework for scientific assessment - and münchmeyer said data was chosen in ways that would support the conclusion that nuclear extension plans would be " useful or positive for the german economy . "
german utilities companies have warned that the country could face an electricity shortage if plans for a nuclear phase-out go through - a claim that greenpeace , a long-term opponent of atomic power , disputes .
" the last report from 2008 has clearly shown that there is no risk of running a deficit in the electricity supply , " münchmeyer said , adding that the 2010 monitoring document would further support that point .

he 's coached three different lower-league teams to promotion and is one of only five currently active coaches to have won the first division title .

whereas thomas schaaf , lousis van gaal , jupp heynckes and felix magath can all feel relatively secure in their jobs , veh is anything but a sure bet to survive this season at hamburg .
hamburg got off to fine start , beating magath 's schalke in round one .

" coaches get fired more quickly than used to be the case , " veh told deutsche welle .
" if you do n't reach your short-term goals , it 's pretty much impossible to do any medium- or long-term work . "
veh 's career has been a roller-coaster in recent years .
appointed on an interim basis at stuttgart in the midst of the 2005-6 campaign , he won the title with the team the following season - only to be unceremoniously axed the year after .
the title established veh 's credentials , but he used up almost all of that capital in his next assignment .

he sought to change the wolves ' style of play and frantically rotated players as their defense revealed unexpected gaping holes .
he was fired last january after a nine-game winless streak and wolfsburg ended the season in eighth place .
that experience does n't seem to have affected veh as much as one might expect .
at hamburg , he 's continued to do things his way .
his controversial decisions include moving the team 's most productive striker , mladen petric , out to the wing , and nominating newly acquired defender heiko westermann as team captain .
" i wanted to give the team a different accent , a new accent , " veh said .
" that was the logic behind heiko westermann as captain . "

whereas thomas schaaf , lousis van gaal , jupp heynckes and felix magath can all feel relatively secure in their jobs , veh is anything but a sure bet to survive this season at hamburg .
hamburg got off to fine start , beating magath 's schalke in round one .
but the team has also run through nine coaches in as many years , and veh knows that loyalty is a rare commodity these days .
" coaches get fired more quickly than used to be the case , " veh told deutsche welle .
" if you do n't reach your short-term goals , it 's pretty much impossible to do any medium- or long-term work . "
veh 's career has been a roller-coaster in recent years .
appointed on an interim basis at stuttgart in the midst of the 2005-6 campaign , he won the title with the team the following season - only to be unceremoniously axed the year after .
the title established veh 's credentials , but he used up almost all of that capital in his next assignment .
do n't mention the magath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veh 's time at wolfsburg was characterized by frustration veh visibly bristles , evading questions , when asked to comment on his short-lived tenure as felix magath 's successor at wolfsburg last season .
in retrospect , it was a very difficult task .
magath had won the title in 2008-9 , and veh had to try to sustain that success while putting his own stamp on the team .
he sought to change the wolves ' style of play and frantically rotated players as their defense revealed unexpected gaping holes .
he was fired last january after a nine-game winless streak and wolfsburg ended the season in eighth place .
that experience does n't seem to have affected veh as much as one might expect .
at hamburg , he 's continued to do things his way .
his controversial decisions include moving the team 's most productive striker , mladen petric , out to the wing , and nominating newly acquired defender heiko westermann as team captain .
" i wanted to give the team a different accent , a new accent , " veh said .
" that was the logic behind heiko westermann as captain . "
that initiative may be more suitable for hamburg than wolfsburg .
unlike wolfsburg , hamburg are not coming off the back of a triumph .
in fact , despite acquiring superstar ruud van nistelrooy and highly touted youngster eljero elia , the northern german side resolutely disappointed last season , coming in seventh .
one of veh 's first tasks is to win the support of those who were most disappointed - the fans .
overcoming skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening day win over schalke showed hamburg 's renewed team spirit the relationship between hamburg players and supporters totally deteriorated last season , with fans booing what they viewed as over-paid prima donnas and striker paolo guerrero retaliating by beaning one of them with a full water bottle .
it may be just diplomacy , but veh says he has n't encountered any major personality issues in the squad far .
" i have n't been able to see any signs that the team is difficult , " veh said .
" they have n't made that impression on me - although difficulties usually only arise when you do n't have success . "
truer words were never spoken .
when veh 's appointment was announced last may , the overwhelming reaction among fans was dismay .
" mediocre coach for a mediocre team , " wrote one blogger succinctly when the news broke .
" armin veh - is this a joke ? " opined another .
" but mostly likely no real coach wanted to come to hamburg , which is no wonder given how chaotic the club is . "
veh 's challenge will to be to earn the support of skeptics like these , and there 's a lot on the line .
having bombed in wolfsburg after succeeding in stuttgart , veh is unlikely ever to get another chance to coach a top bundesliga club , if he fails to attain his goals in hamburg .
veh is known as a players ' coach , and perhaps the initial win against schalke was a sign that he 's got the squad behind him .
or in could be a blip on the radar screen , and as veh knows only too well , fans of the league 's biggest and richest clubs are never content with blips . even if they have a past bundesliga title to their credit .
armin veh was interviewed by jana schaefer for dw-tv 's bundesliga kick off .
the program airs every tuesday .

human trafficking is the fastest-growing source of profit for organized crime . the united nations declared august 23 an international day of remembrance for the abolition of slavery .
but the trade in human beings is an ongoing problem around the world .
compared to the drugs and arms trades , however , it is more difficult to track down perpetrators in the multibillion-dollar trafficking business .
victims of forced labor and sexual exploitation are not always identified as such and can even face unjust criminal prosecution themselves .
the international organization for migration estimates that between 700,000 to 4 million people are trafficked across national borders every year .
but iom spokesman jean philippe chauzy said the secret nature of the trade means no one knows exactly how many people are trafficked worldwide .
" human trafficking , either for sexual or labor exploitation , is truly a global phenomenon , " he said .
" there are no regions of the world that are not affected by trafficking . "
millions of men , women and children who leave home in search of better socio-economic prospects are vulnerable to exploitation – and chauzy said this migration " feeds trafficking . "
" because there are so few opportunities for people to migrate legally , they will tend to take risks and go through so-called intermediaries , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte awino was kidnapped by the lord 's resistance army in uganda " and in many cases , unfortunately , they find themselves in situations of exploitation . "
a voice for the voiceless charlotte awino was held as a sex slave for eight years .
when she recently talked to the un humans rights council in geneva , she said she came as a representive for those exploited and left voiceless by human trafficking .
awino called on the international community to help the victims .
" no one is there for them , " she said .
" and , nothing is being done , even if they escape back home . "
awino was 14 years old when the ugandan rebel lord 's resistance army abducted her from her boarding school in 1996 .
" we were taken away from the school campus heading nowhere , walking the whole time , " she said .
awino claimed she was taken to southern sudan , where victims were raped and beaten and forced to work in the gardens and carry luggage .
she said those caught trying to escape were killed .
awino was 22 years old and had two children by the time she managed to escape . a global problem sexual exploitation has been affecting women in countries around the world – including western europe and the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are sold into prostitution in many countries kikka cerpa was forced into a life of prostitution after her boyfriend persuaded her to leave venezuela and go to new york in 1992 .
" i went to the united states thinking that i was going to be working as a nanny , and i ended up being a prostitute , not by choice , " she said .
cerpa said she was beaten and raped and spent three years working in the sex trade to pay off her boyfriend 's debts . a customer helped cerpa escape but then then forced her to become his personal slave . she lived with him for 10 years and had two daughters .
" i could never leave him because every time that i tried to leave , he said that he would use my criminal conviction and he would have me deported from the united states and i would never visit my daughters anymore , " she said .
with the help of an organization called sanctuary for families , cerpa managed to free herself from the pimps and madams who had controlled her life .
she sought a court order of protection after her escape , but her daughters were taken away from her and she was accused of being a criminal . exploited for labor though sex trafficking has generally attracted the most international media attention , labor exploitation is also prevalent on a global scale .
the international organization for migration reports that millions of women , men and children are forced to work in sweatshops , construction , agriculture , as street beggars and in other hazardous jobs for little or no pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imo says victims of labor trafficking may be forced to work as street beggars kumar ramjali was duped with the promise of a good job with good money .
he said a jordanian company recruited him in his native nepal in 2004 to work in the united states .
but instead , ramjali was sent to iraq , where he was forced to work at a us military base against his will . he said his passport was confiscated and he was not allowed to leave for four years .
jana , a 30-year-old bosnian national , also fell victim to an employment scam .
after moving to to slovenia to continue her studies , she attended a job interview with an accounting firm arranged by a newly made female friend .
" the first 10 minutes looked pretty normal , like a normal office and a woman was there interviewing me , " she said .
" and then suddenly , two men came in and the interview was finished . "
jana said the men dragged her out of the office and when she resisted , they became extremely violent .
" i was raped and beaten many times , " she said .
" afterwards , i was taken to some place , blindfolded and repeatedly raped and drugged with heroin for a few days . "
later , jana said she began to receive clients – between six and 10 each day for four months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-trafficking poster from moldova prevention and punishment after her escape in 2005 , jana became an advocate against trafficking .
human rights organizations say a variety of approaches are needed to tackle the issue , including information campaigns to help prevent trafficking .

" it 's not perfectly clear the mechanism which causes this , " explained one of the researchers jarrod welch . " one hypothesis is that warmer temperatures increase respiration in the rice plant , which consumes energy .
if these warmer temperatures occur at night time , there is no offsetting of the synthesis .
so , warmer temperatures mean increased respiration , increased energy consumption in the rice plant .
but synthesis is not occurring to replace that energy . " rice feeds three billion people daily rice feeds about three billion people daily across the world and according to fao figures , over 60 percent of asia 's poor population is dependent on it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 60 percent of asia 's poor population depends on rice the losses in rice production will lead to food insecurity , experts fear . david dawe from the fao also worked on the study : " if temperatures continue to increase , our research seems to show that rice yields will go down or wo n't increase as fast as they otherwise would have . " he says this will have an " impact on food prices and make it much more difficult for poor people to afford food .
and it 's poor people who spend most of their money on rice .
so it 's they who 'll be most affected . " solutions must be implemented soon however , dawe says that there are ways of increasing the rice yields such as creating " better varieties that are more tolerant of higher temperatures , or slow down the increase in temperature , or shift the cropping season , try to plant rice at a different time of year when it 's a bit cooler . " experts have urged politicians to implement these solutions , warning that there could be a serious rice crisis otherwise . they point out that rising temperatures caused by global warming are one threat to rice yields , but another is rising sea levels which will affect the low-lying rice-growing areas of asia too . author : pin manika editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the debate over the future of nuclear power in germany heats up , greenpeace is accusing the government of defying a law mandating the release of the next monitoring report on security of the country 's energy supply . greenpeace germany took legal action monday against the federal ministry of economics for failing to release a report detailing key information on the country 's future energy needs ahead of last month 's deadline .
the complaint was lodged in a berlin administrative court .
under germany 's energy industry law -lrb- enwg -rrb- , the economics ministry is required to publish a monitoring report on the future of the country 's energy supply every two years and present the information to the european commission .
the deadline for the 2010 report was july 31 .
" to our surprise and disappointment , this report was not presented , and it was not submitted to the european commission in brussels , " greenpeace energy expert tobias münchmeyer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace has long campaigned against atomic energy the future of nuclear the data contained in the report is expected to further clarify a subject of intense political debate in germany : whether the country can meet its future electricity needs without nuclear power .
germany 's ruling coalition under chancellor angela merkel supports extending the operating lives of nuclear reactors beyond the 2022 shut-down deadline passed by the previous social democrat-led government .
münchmeyer said greenpeace believed the ministry , led by minister rainer brüderle , delayed the report 's release " in order to manipulate the current debate on energy supply in germany . "
a statement from the german economics ministry blamed the hold-up on outside problems .
" publication of the federal ministry of economics monitoring report on the security of supply in the electrical industry is postponed until fall 2010 , due to external assessment delays involving the preparation of energy scenarios for the german government 's energy policy , " a ministry spokesman told deutsche welle .
ahead of government plans to craft a long-term energy strategy by the end of september , the economics ministry commissioned several institutions with developing different energy scenarios for the future .
energy shortage ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nuclear phase-out was set for 2022 by the last red-green government yet according to a recent report in german newspaper die zeit , the ministry itself established a general framework for scientific assessment - and münchmeyer said data was chosen in ways that would support the conclusion that nuclear extension plans would be " useful or positive for the german economy . "
german utilities companies have warned that the country could face an electricity shortage if plans for a nuclear phase-out go through - a claim that greenpeace , a long-term opponent of atomic power , disputes .
" the last report from 2008 has clearly shown that there is no risk of running a deficit in the electricity supply , " münchmeyer said , adding that the 2010 monitoring document would further support that point .

" to our surprise and disappointment , this report was not presented , and it was not submitted to the european commission in brussels , " greenpeace energy expert tobias münchmeyer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace has long campaigned against atomic energy the future of nuclear the data contained in the report is expected to further clarify a subject of intense political debate in germany : whether the country can meet its future electricity needs without nuclear power .
germany 's ruling coalition under chancellor angela merkel supports extending the operating lives of nuclear reactors beyond the 2022 shut-down deadline passed by the previous social democrat-led government .
münchmeyer said greenpeace believed the ministry , led by minister rainer brüderle , delayed the report 's release " in order to manipulate the current debate on energy supply in germany . "
a statement from the german economics ministry blamed the hold-up on outside problems .
" publication of the federal ministry of economics monitoring report on the security of supply in the electrical industry is postponed until fall 2010 , due to external assessment delays involving the preparation of energy scenarios for the german government 's energy policy , " a ministry spokesman told deutsche welle .
ahead of government plans to craft a long-term energy strategy by the end of september , the economics ministry commissioned several institutions with developing different energy scenarios for the future .
energy shortage ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nuclear phase-out was set for 2022 by the last red-green government yet according to a recent report in german newspaper die zeit , the ministry itself established a general framework for scientific assessment - and münchmeyer said data was chosen in ways that would support the conclusion that nuclear extension plans would be " useful or positive for the german economy . "
german utilities companies have warned that the country could face an electricity shortage if plans for a nuclear phase-out go through - a claim that greenpeace , a long-term opponent of atomic power , disputes .
" the last report from 2008 has clearly shown that there is no risk of running a deficit in the electricity supply , " münchmeyer said , adding that the 2010 monitoring document would further support that point .

human trafficking is the fastest-growing source of profit for organized crime . the united nations declared august 23 an international day of remembrance for the abolition of slavery .
but the trade in human beings is an ongoing problem around the world .
compared to the drugs and arms trades , however , it is more difficult to track down perpetrators in the multibillion-dollar trafficking business .
victims of forced labor and sexual exploitation are not always identified as such and can even face unjust criminal prosecution themselves .
the international organization for migration estimates that between 700,000 to 4 million people are trafficked across national borders every year .
but iom spokesman jean philippe chauzy said the secret nature of the trade means no one knows exactly how many people are trafficked worldwide .
" human trafficking , either for sexual or labor exploitation , is truly a global phenomenon , " he said .
" there are no regions of the world that are not affected by trafficking . "
millions of men , women and children who leave home in search of better socio-economic prospects are vulnerable to exploitation – and chauzy said this migration " feeds trafficking . "
" because there are so few opportunities for people to migrate legally , they will tend to take risks and go through so-called intermediaries , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte awino was kidnapped by the lord 's resistance army in uganda " and in many cases , unfortunately , they find themselves in situations of exploitation . "
a voice for the voiceless charlotte awino was held as a sex slave for eight years .
when she recently talked to the un humans rights council in geneva , she said she came as a representive for those exploited and left voiceless by human trafficking .
awino called on the international community to help the victims .
" no one is there for them , " she said .
" and , nothing is being done , even if they escape back home . "
awino was 14 years old when the ugandan rebel lord 's resistance army abducted her from her boarding school in 1996 .
" we were taken away from the school campus heading nowhere , walking the whole time , " she said .
awino claimed she was taken to southern sudan , where victims were raped and beaten and forced to work in the gardens and carry luggage .
she said those caught trying to escape were killed .
awino was 22 years old and had two children by the time she managed to escape . a global problem sexual exploitation has been affecting women in countries around the world – including western europe and the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are sold into prostitution in many countries kikka cerpa was forced into a life of prostitution after her boyfriend persuaded her to leave venezuela and go to new york in 1992 .
" i went to the united states thinking that i was going to be working as a nanny , and i ended up being a prostitute , not by choice , " she said .
cerpa said she was beaten and raped and spent three years working in the sex trade to pay off her boyfriend 's debts . a customer helped cerpa escape but then then forced her to become his personal slave . she lived with him for 10 years and had two daughters .
" i could never leave him because every time that i tried to leave , he said that he would use my criminal conviction and he would have me deported from the united states and i would never visit my daughters anymore , " she said .
with the help of an organization called sanctuary for families , cerpa managed to free herself from the pimps and madams who had controlled her life .
she sought a court order of protection after her escape , but her daughters were taken away from her and she was accused of being a criminal . exploited for labor though sex trafficking has generally attracted the most international media attention , labor exploitation is also prevalent on a global scale .
the international organization for migration reports that millions of women , men and children are forced to work in sweatshops , construction , agriculture , as street beggars and in other hazardous jobs for little or no pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imo says victims of labor trafficking may be forced to work as street beggars kumar ramjali was duped with the promise of a good job with good money .
he said a jordanian company recruited him in his native nepal in 2004 to work in the united states .
but instead , ramjali was sent to iraq , where he was forced to work at a us military base against his will . he said his passport was confiscated and he was not allowed to leave for four years .
jana , a 30-year-old bosnian national , also fell victim to an employment scam .
after moving to to slovenia to continue her studies , she attended a job interview with an accounting firm arranged by a newly made female friend .
" the first 10 minutes looked pretty normal , like a normal office and a woman was there interviewing me , " she said .
" and then suddenly , two men came in and the interview was finished . "
jana said the men dragged her out of the office and when she resisted , they became extremely violent .
" i was raped and beaten many times , " she said .
" afterwards , i was taken to some place , blindfolded and repeatedly raped and drugged with heroin for a few days . "
later , jana said she began to receive clients – between six and 10 each day for four months .

" the problem is that the law is unfair .
there 's a trend in germany and elsewhere for people to have more than one nationality , " said marei pelzer , legal consultant for pro asyl , an organization that focuses on the rights of refugees and immigrants .
" we already have 4.5 million people in germany with more than one nationality , around 53 percent of those being granted german citizenship have dual nationality , " she told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ngos : more than one nationality is becoming the norm duty to choose pro asyl as well as two fellow ngos , the intercultural council and the german bar association , have called for an overhaul of the current regulation , which dates back to the year 2000 .
it forces anyone born in germany after 1990 with non-german parents to either become german or take his or her parents ' citizenship when they turn 18 .
they have until the age of 21 to make a final decision , meaning the first batch of young people will have to make that decision next year .
being born in germany gives them the right to german citizenship , but only if they give up their parents ' nationality by the time they turn 21 .
this so-called ' duty to choose ' , which is unique to germany , is controversial , not least because there are countries , like iran , morocco , afghanistan and some latin american countries , which do not allow citizens to give up their nationality , so in those cases , dual nationality is already being granted , which creates what the ngos call a two-class system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some countries do n't allow citizens to give up their nationality parliament debate prior to 2000 , the rules were even stricter - there was no automatic right to german citizenship , simply because someone was born in the country .
in the autumn , the german parliament will debate a bill introduced by the opposition parties , the social democrats and the greens , which calls for the restrictions on dual citizenship to be abolished .
but many members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party argue that citizenship is a question of loyalty .
" he or she has to accept german citizenship , that is all we 're asking in terms of integration , " reinhard grindel , home affairs expert of the christian democrats in parliament , told german public radio deutschlandradio kultur .
" but that is non-negotiable .
we 're asking for a certain degree of commitment to our country and its laws and values , we do n't think that 's too much to ask , " he said .
" old-fashioned and undemocratic " pro asyl , however , believes the government needs to modernize its understanding of nationality , if it is to be respected internationally .
" the government needs to recognize the signs of the times , it should not just preach the need for integration , but instead focus on creating the legal basis for a modern immigration state , " pelzer told deutsche welle .
" there are 82 million people in germany , 6.7 million of those are not german nationals and 1.3 million were born here , but still do n't have german citizenship .
that 's a problem for democracy , if people live here , but do n't have the right to vote for example , " she added .

most of the 350,000 inhabitants have already been evacuated but the floods threaten to wreak havoc . as more towns are under imminent threat of flooding and the authorities battle with heavy monsoon rains , there are millions of people in emergency camps who are in desperate need of relief . the german commissioner for humanitarian aid markus loening recently visited the flooded areas of pakistan and got a first-hand insight into the goings on at two camps . " it 's worst for the children , " he told deutsche welle .
" there are very many women with young children .
the estimates are that 90,000 babies are going to be born in the coming weeks and that a third of them are at acute risk of not surviving the first days .
these women are in very rudimentary tents .
they can see down onto their flooded villages .
it 's all very shocking . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 350,000 people have been evacuated from shadadkot in sindh millions are in need of basic supplies concern that there could be an outbreak of disease , including typhoid , hepatitis and cholera continues to grow .
loening said that medical aid was crucial but that many people still needed just the basics . " some six million people need emergency help , they need food to survive .
the children get biscuits .
poland has donated biscuits .
we could also donate them .
children can survive on them because they are high-energy biscuits .
they are being distributed there .
baby food is also being distributed .
if they get that , they can survive one , two or three days .
food and clean water are what ’ s most important at the moment , " loening said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is not enough food for everyone at the relief camps he added that the cost of such products is low but that the sheer numbers of people needing supplies is making deliveries logistically difficult . the world food program has reached over a million people .
it has called for more helicopters to get food to people who remain isolated by the high flood waters . loening dispelled doubts that donations were not going to the right places .
he said that all the donations to german organizations were going " one-to-one " to the people who needed it . donor fatigue in pakistan and abroad if the west has been criticized for its sluggish response to the floods and a form of donor fatigue , the pakistani population 's distrust of the weak civilian government has reportedly also had a negative impact on donations from pakistanis themselves . " this trust deficit has created a situation where the people are not coming forward , " said tayyab siddique , a pakistani political expert . the army on the other hand has received much praise for its relief operations , although political expert ayesha siddika explained there was some marketing going on : " it ' not the way they 're doing work .
it 's how their work is being presented . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tents in the emergency camps are very rudimentary observers do not predict , however , that the political situation will change much as a result of this image-boosting , as it is widely thought that the military already holds the power behind the scenes . nor do they think the taliban will benefit unduly as their emergency relief operations are reportedly as chaotic as those of the authorities . positive for pakistani-west relations however , ayesha siddika believes that the way the floods are handled by the west could have a positive impact : " the more the west helps , it will be , i mean one of the spin offs will be of course improvement of relations , doing away with misunderstandings . " donations from the international community have neared 500 million dollars already but the un has warned that pakistan will be needing help for years . the international monetary fund is currently looking at ways of restructuring a $ 10 billion loan for pakistan . author : anne thomas editor : disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the problem is that the law is unfair .
there 's a trend in germany and elsewhere for people to have more than one nationality , " said marei pelzer , legal consultant for pro asyl , an organization that focuses on the rights of refugees and immigrants .
" we already have 4.5 million people in germany with more than one nationality , around 53 percent of those being granted german citizenship have dual nationality , " she told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ngos : more than one nationality is becoming the norm duty to choose pro asyl as well as two fellow ngos , the intercultural council and the german bar association , have called for an overhaul of the current regulation , which dates back to the year 2000 .
it forces anyone born in germany after 1990 with non-german parents to either become german or take his or her parents ' citizenship when they turn 18 .
they have until the age of 21 to make a final decision , meaning the first batch of young people will have to make that decision next year .
being born in germany gives them the right to german citizenship , but only if they give up their parents ' nationality by the time they turn 21 .
this so-called ' duty to choose ' , which is unique to germany , is controversial , not least because there are countries , like iran , morocco , afghanistan and some latin american countries , which do not allow citizens to give up their nationality , so in those cases , dual nationality is already being granted , which creates what the ngos call a two-class system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some countries do n't allow citizens to give up their nationality parliament debate prior to 2000 , the rules were even stricter - there was no automatic right to german citizenship , simply because someone was born in the country .
in the autumn , the german parliament will debate a bill introduced by the opposition parties , the social democrats and the greens , which calls for the restrictions on dual citizenship to be abolished .
but many members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party argue that citizenship is a question of loyalty .
" he or she has to accept german citizenship , that is all we 're asking in terms of integration , " reinhard grindel , home affairs expert of the christian democrats in parliament , told german public radio deutschlandradio kultur .
" but that is non-negotiable .
we 're asking for a certain degree of commitment to our country and its laws and values , we do n't think that 's too much to ask , " he said .
" old-fashioned and undemocratic " pro asyl , however , believes the government needs to modernize its understanding of nationality , if it is to be respected internationally .
" the government needs to recognize the signs of the times , it should not just preach the need for integration , but instead focus on creating the legal basis for a modern immigration state , " pelzer told deutsche welle .
" there are 82 million people in germany , 6.7 million of those are not german nationals and 1.3 million were born here , but still do n't have german citizenship .
that 's a problem for democracy , if people live here , but do n't have the right to vote for example , " she added .

" the government needs to recognize the signs of the times , it should not just preach the need for integration , but instead focus on creating the legal basis for a modern immigration state , " pelzer told deutsche welle .
" there are 82 million people in germany , 6.7 million of those are not german nationals and 1.3 million were born here , but still do n't have german citizenship .
that 's a problem for democracy , if people live here , but do n't have the right to vote for example , " she added .

after four decades of division , the decision was made by the east german parliament to united with west germany on oct .
3 , 1990 . after a night-long discussion , that ended in the early hours of aug .
23 , 1990 , the decision was made for the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- to be absorbed into the federal republic of germany -lrb- frg -rrb- .
at a special session of the east german parliament , the volkskammer , the representatives voted to merge with the west .
instead of a brand new constitution to cover the new unified state , it was decided to just incorporate the gdr under the existing constitution .
the former east was incorporated into the west under article 23 of the federal republic 's basic law .

the main aim of this new parliament was to prepare for accession to the federal republic .
by the summer of 1990 , the gdr and frg had created a single economic zone , with the deutschmark being used as the sole currency .
the gdr had also adopted large aspects of the economic and legal systems of the west .

" i thought that we could have the first free unified national elections on the oct .

by the summer of 1990 , the gdr and frg had created a single economic zone , with the deutschmark being used as the sole currency .
the gdr had also adopted large aspects of the economic and legal systems of the west .
by august , not a single meeting of the volkskammer passed without the subject of ' immediate accession ' being discussed .
for the then-prime minister of the gdr , lothar de maiziere , the time had come to seize the initiative .
" after a regular session in the afternoon of aug .
22 , " he recalled , " -lsb- we decided -rsb- to carry on with a special session with the sole agenda item of setting a timeline for german reunification . "
although it had been thought best to implement a speedy accession , not all parliamentarians were in agreement with the prime minister .
wolfgang ullman , a representative from the alliance 90 party urged de maiziere to stop proceedings .
ullman said he would report him to the prosecutor general of the gdr for high treason .

searching for the right date full discussions began immediately , with lothar de maiziere making the formal request to join with the federal republic but giving no specific date .
he proposed some time before october , as it would be the 41st anniversary of the gdr on oct .
14 , and he felt this date was symbolic .
" i thought that we could have the first free unified national elections on the oct .
14 , " de maiziere said .
" taking power back from the sovereign body and giving it to the new parliament . "
however it soon became clear that de maiziere 's date would not find a majority .
except for the successor party to the east german ruling sed , the pds -lrb- party for democratic socialism -rrb- , no one wanted to experience the 41st anniversary of the gdr a week early .

as the debate over the future of nuclear power in germany heats up , greenpeace is accusing the government of defying a law mandating the release of the next monitoring report on security of the country 's energy supply . greenpeace germany took legal action monday against the federal ministry of economics for failing to release a report detailing key information on the country 's future energy needs ahead of last month 's deadline .
the complaint was lodged in a berlin administrative court .
under germany 's energy industry law -lrb- enwg -rrb- , the economics ministry is required to publish a monitoring report on the future of the country 's energy supply every two years and present the information to the european commission .
the deadline for the 2010 report was july 31 .
" to our surprise and disappointment , this report was not presented , and it was not submitted to the european commission in brussels , " greenpeace energy expert tobias münchmeyer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace has long campaigned against atomic energy the future of nuclear the data contained in the report is expected to further clarify a subject of intense political debate in germany : whether the country can meet its future electricity needs without nuclear power .
germany 's ruling coalition under chancellor angela merkel supports extending the operating lives of nuclear reactors beyond the 2022 shut-down deadline passed by the previous social democrat-led government .
münchmeyer said greenpeace believed the ministry , led by minister rainer brüderle , delayed the report 's release " in order to manipulate the current debate on energy supply in germany . "
a statement from the german economics ministry blamed the hold-up on outside problems .
" publication of the federal ministry of economics monitoring report on the security of supply in the electrical industry is postponed until fall 2010 , due to external assessment delays involving the preparation of energy scenarios for the german government 's energy policy , " a ministry spokesman told deutsche welle .
ahead of government plans to craft a long-term energy strategy by the end of september , the economics ministry commissioned several institutions with developing different energy scenarios for the future .
energy shortage ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nuclear phase-out was set for 2022 by the last red-green government yet according to a recent report in german newspaper die zeit , the ministry itself established a general framework for scientific assessment - and münchmeyer said data was chosen in ways that would support the conclusion that nuclear extension plans would be " useful or positive for the german economy . "
german utilities companies have warned that the country could face an electricity shortage if plans for a nuclear phase-out go through - a claim that greenpeace , a long-term opponent of atomic power , disputes .
" the last report from 2008 has clearly shown that there is no risk of running a deficit in the electricity supply , " münchmeyer said , adding that the 2010 monitoring document would further support that point .

most of the 350,000 inhabitants have already been evacuated but the floods threaten to wreak havoc . as more towns are under imminent threat of flooding and the authorities battle with heavy monsoon rains , there are millions of people in emergency camps who are in desperate need of relief . the german commissioner for humanitarian aid markus loening recently visited the flooded areas of pakistan and got a first-hand insight into the goings on at two camps . " it 's worst for the children , " he told deutsche welle .
" there are very many women with young children .
the estimates are that 90,000 babies are going to be born in the coming weeks and that a third of them are at acute risk of not surviving the first days .
these women are in very rudimentary tents .
they can see down onto their flooded villages .
it 's all very shocking .

loening said that medical aid was crucial but that many people still needed just the basics . " some six million people need emergency help , they need food to survive .
the children get biscuits .
poland has donated biscuits .
we could also donate them .
children can survive on them because they are high-energy biscuits .
they are being distributed there .
baby food is also being distributed .
if they get that , they can survive one , two or three days .
food and clean water are what ’ s most important at the moment , " loening said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is not enough food for everyone at the relief camps he added that the cost of such products is low but that the sheer numbers of people needing supplies is making deliveries logistically difficult . the world food program has reached over a million people .
it has called for more helicopters to get food to people who remain isolated by the high flood waters . loening dispelled doubts that donations were not going to the right places .
he said that all the donations to german organizations were going " one-to-one " to the people who needed it . donor fatigue in pakistan and abroad if the west has been criticized for its sluggish response to the floods and a form of donor fatigue , the pakistani population 's distrust of the weak civilian government has reportedly also had a negative impact on donations from pakistanis themselves . " this trust deficit has created a situation where the people are not coming forward , " said tayyab siddique , a pakistani political expert . the army on the other hand has received much praise for its relief operations , although political expert ayesha siddika explained there was some marketing going on : " it ' not the way they 're doing work .
it 's how their work is being presented . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tents in the emergency camps are very rudimentary observers do not predict , however , that the political situation will change much as a result of this image-boosting , as it is widely thought that the military already holds the power behind the scenes . nor do they think the taliban will benefit unduly as their emergency relief operations are reportedly as chaotic as those of the authorities . positive for pakistani-west relations however , ayesha siddika believes that the way the floods are handled by the west could have a positive impact : " the more the west helps , it will be , i mean one of the spin offs will be of course improvement of relations , doing away with misunderstandings .

after four decades of division , the decision was made by the east german parliament to united with west germany on oct .
3 , 1990 . after a night-long discussion , that ended in the early hours of aug .
23 , 1990 , the decision was made for the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- to be absorbed into the federal republic of germany -lrb- frg -rrb- .
at a special session of the east german parliament , the volkskammer , the representatives voted to merge with the west .
instead of a brand new constitution to cover the new unified state , it was decided to just incorporate the gdr under the existing constitution .
the former east was incorporated into the west under article 23 of the federal republic 's basic law .

the main aim of this new parliament was to prepare for accession to the federal republic .
by the summer of 1990 , the gdr and frg had created a single economic zone , with the deutschmark being used as the sole currency .
the gdr had also adopted large aspects of the economic and legal systems of the west .
by august , not a single meeting of the volkskammer passed without the subject of ' immediate accession ' being discussed .
for the then-prime minister of the gdr , lothar de maiziere , the time had come to seize the initiative .
" after a regular session in the afternoon of aug .
22 , " he recalled , " -lsb- we decided -rsb- to carry on with a special session with the sole agenda item of setting a timeline for german reunification . "
although it had been thought best to implement a speedy accession , not all parliamentarians were in agreement with the prime minister .
wolfgang ullman , a representative from the alliance 90 party urged de maiziere to stop proceedings .

he proposed some time before october , as it would be the 41st anniversary of the gdr on oct .
14 , and he felt this date was symbolic .
" i thought that we could have the first free unified national elections on the oct .
14 , " de maiziere said .
" taking power back from the sovereign body and giving it to the new parliament . "
however it soon became clear that de maiziere 's date would not find a majority .
except for the successor party to the east german ruling sed , the pds -lrb- party for democratic socialism -rrb- , no one wanted to experience the 41st anniversary of the gdr a week early .

human trafficking is the fastest-growing source of profit for organized crime . the united nations declared august 23 an international day of remembrance for the abolition of slavery .
but the trade in human beings is an ongoing problem around the world .
compared to the drugs and arms trades , however , it is more difficult to track down perpetrators in the multibillion-dollar trafficking business .
victims of forced labor and sexual exploitation are not always identified as such and can even face unjust criminal prosecution themselves .
the international organization for migration estimates that between 700,000 to 4 million people are trafficked across national borders every year .
but iom spokesman jean philippe chauzy said the secret nature of the trade means no one knows exactly how many people are trafficked worldwide .
" human trafficking , either for sexual or labor exploitation , is truly a global phenomenon , " he said .
" there are no regions of the world that are not affected by trafficking . "
millions of men , women and children who leave home in search of better socio-economic prospects are vulnerable to exploitation – and chauzy said this migration " feeds trafficking . "
" because there are so few opportunities for people to migrate legally , they will tend to take risks and go through so-called intermediaries , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte awino was kidnapped by the lord 's resistance army in uganda " and in many cases , unfortunately , they find themselves in situations of exploitation . "
a voice for the voiceless charlotte awino was held as a sex slave for eight years .
when she recently talked to the un humans rights council in geneva , she said she came as a representive for those exploited and left voiceless by human trafficking .
awino called on the international community to help the victims .
" no one is there for them , " she said .
" and , nothing is being done , even if they escape back home . "
awino was 14 years old when the ugandan rebel lord 's resistance army abducted her from her boarding school in 1996 .
" we were taken away from the school campus heading nowhere , walking the whole time , " she said .
awino claimed she was taken to southern sudan , where victims were raped and beaten and forced to work in the gardens and carry luggage .
she said those caught trying to escape were killed .
awino was 22 years old and had two children by the time she managed to escape . a global problem sexual exploitation has been affecting women in countries around the world – including western europe and the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are sold into prostitution in many countries kikka cerpa was forced into a life of prostitution after her boyfriend persuaded her to leave venezuela and go to new york in 1992 .
" i went to the united states thinking that i was going to be working as a nanny , and i ended up being a prostitute , not by choice , " she said .
cerpa said she was beaten and raped and spent three years working in the sex trade to pay off her boyfriend 's debts . a customer helped cerpa escape but then then forced her to become his personal slave . she lived with him for 10 years and had two daughters .
" i could never leave him because every time that i tried to leave , he said that he would use my criminal conviction and he would have me deported from the united states and i would never visit my daughters anymore , " she said .
with the help of an organization called sanctuary for families , cerpa managed to free herself from the pimps and madams who had controlled her life .
she sought a court order of protection after her escape , but her daughters were taken away from her and she was accused of being a criminal . exploited for labor though sex trafficking has generally attracted the most international media attention , labor exploitation is also prevalent on a global scale .
the international organization for migration reports that millions of women , men and children are forced to work in sweatshops , construction , agriculture , as street beggars and in other hazardous jobs for little or no pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imo says victims of labor trafficking may be forced to work as street beggars kumar ramjali was duped with the promise of a good job with good money .
he said a jordanian company recruited him in his native nepal in 2004 to work in the united states .
but instead , ramjali was sent to iraq , where he was forced to work at a us military base against his will . he said his passport was confiscated and he was not allowed to leave for four years .
jana , a 30-year-old bosnian national , also fell victim to an employment scam .
after moving to to slovenia to continue her studies , she attended a job interview with an accounting firm arranged by a newly made female friend .
" the first 10 minutes looked pretty normal , like a normal office and a woman was there interviewing me , " she said .
" and then suddenly , two men came in and the interview was finished . "
jana said the men dragged her out of the office and when she resisted , they became extremely violent .
" i was raped and beaten many times , " she said .
" afterwards , i was taken to some place , blindfolded and repeatedly raped and drugged with heroin for a few days . "
later , jana said she began to receive clients – between six and 10 each day for four months .

merkel said that a change was needed in the way members of her government behaved . chancellor angela merkel said that apparent disunity within her ruling center-right coalition was to blame for a dip in voter approval ratings for member parties .
in an interview with the public television station zdf , merkel said that her government needed to make tough decisions .
however , she said the nature of discussion within the coalition - which has been accused of excessive bickering - was partly responsible for alienating the electorate .
" i think we have n't managed to reach people partly because the confusion of voices and the way we have treated each other have not been what is to be expected of us , " merkel said , adding that the situation needed to be improved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coalition parties have lost ground since the election last year in the interview on sunday , merkel said that her government could be particularly satisfied with its record on the economy .
the chancellor said she was confident about regaining opinion poll approval as soon as important decisions facing the country had been made , by the end of the year .
questions to be answered merkel said financial stability , health , education for the children of welfare recipients , energy policy and reforms to the military were her government 's top priorities .
the chancellor said that she believed that after these decisions were taken , voters would understand that germany was " better equipped for the future . "
in the interview following her vacation in italy , merkel reaffirmed her commitment to introducing a tax on nuclear power providers , despite objections from the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is open to a suspension of compulsory military service the chancellor also said she was open to a suspension of germany 's compulsory military service .
both issues have been the subject of heated debate within the coalition .
in an opinion poll released last week , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- moved ahead of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who along with bavarian sister party the csu share power with the liberal free democrats fdp .
the spd had 32 percent support compared to 31 percent for the cdu and csu in the poll conducted by germany 's allensbach institute .
the fdp had just six percent .
the result contrasts with the general election in september 2009 when the cdu and csu won almost 34 percent of the popular vote , and the fdp almost 15 percent , compared with 23 percent for the spd .

human trafficking is the fastest-growing source of profit for organized crime . the united nations declared august 23 an international day of remembrance for the abolition of slavery .
but the trade in human beings is an ongoing problem around the world .
compared to the drugs and arms trades , however , it is more difficult to track down perpetrators in the multibillion-dollar trafficking business .
victims of forced labor and sexual exploitation are not always identified as such and can even face unjust criminal prosecution themselves .
the international organization for migration estimates that between 700,000 to 4 million people are trafficked across national borders every year .
but iom spokesman jean philippe chauzy said the secret nature of the trade means no one knows exactly how many people are trafficked worldwide .
" human trafficking , either for sexual or labor exploitation , is truly a global phenomenon , " he said .
" there are no regions of the world that are not affected by trafficking . "
millions of men , women and children who leave home in search of better socio-economic prospects are vulnerable to exploitation – and chauzy said this migration " feeds trafficking . "
" because there are so few opportunities for people to migrate legally , they will tend to take risks and go through so-called intermediaries , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte awino was kidnapped by the lord 's resistance army in uganda " and in many cases , unfortunately , they find themselves in situations of exploitation . "
a voice for the voiceless charlotte awino was held as a sex slave for eight years .
when she recently talked to the un humans rights council in geneva , she said she came as a representive for those exploited and left voiceless by human trafficking .
awino called on the international community to help the victims .
" no one is there for them , " she said .
" and , nothing is being done , even if they escape back home . "
awino was 14 years old when the ugandan rebel lord 's resistance army abducted her from her boarding school in 1996 .
" we were taken away from the school campus heading nowhere , walking the whole time , " she said .
awino claimed she was taken to southern sudan , where victims were raped and beaten and forced to work in the gardens and carry luggage .
she said those caught trying to escape were killed .
awino was 22 years old and had two children by the time she managed to escape . a global problem sexual exploitation has been affecting women in countries around the world – including western europe and the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are sold into prostitution in many countries kikka cerpa was forced into a life of prostitution after her boyfriend persuaded her to leave venezuela and go to new york in 1992 .
" i went to the united states thinking that i was going to be working as a nanny , and i ended up being a prostitute , not by choice , " she said .
cerpa said she was beaten and raped and spent three years working in the sex trade to pay off her boyfriend 's debts . a customer helped cerpa escape but then then forced her to become his personal slave . she lived with him for 10 years and had two daughters .
" i could never leave him because every time that i tried to leave , he said that he would use my criminal conviction and he would have me deported from the united states and i would never visit my daughters anymore , " she said .
with the help of an organization called sanctuary for families , cerpa managed to free herself from the pimps and madams who had controlled her life .
she sought a court order of protection after her escape , but her daughters were taken away from her and she was accused of being a criminal . exploited for labor though sex trafficking has generally attracted the most international media attention , labor exploitation is also prevalent on a global scale .
the international organization for migration reports that millions of women , men and children are forced to work in sweatshops , construction , agriculture , as street beggars and in other hazardous jobs for little or no pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imo says victims of labor trafficking may be forced to work as street beggars kumar ramjali was duped with the promise of a good job with good money .
he said a jordanian company recruited him in his native nepal in 2004 to work in the united states .
but instead , ramjali was sent to iraq , where he was forced to work at a us military base against his will . he said his passport was confiscated and he was not allowed to leave for four years .
jana , a 30-year-old bosnian national , also fell victim to an employment scam .
after moving to to slovenia to continue her studies , she attended a job interview with an accounting firm arranged by a newly made female friend .
" the first 10 minutes looked pretty normal , like a normal office and a woman was there interviewing me , " she said .
" and then suddenly , two men came in and the interview was finished . "
jana said the men dragged her out of the office and when she resisted , they became extremely violent .
" i was raped and beaten many times , " she said .
" afterwards , i was taken to some place , blindfolded and repeatedly raped and drugged with heroin for a few days . "
later , jana said she began to receive clients – between six and 10 each day for four months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-trafficking poster from moldova prevention and punishment after her escape in 2005 , jana became an advocate against trafficking .
human rights organizations say a variety of approaches are needed to tackle the issue , including information campaigns to help prevent trafficking .

merkel said that a change was needed in the way members of her government behaved . chancellor angela merkel said that apparent disunity within her ruling center-right coalition was to blame for a dip in voter approval ratings for member parties .
in an interview with the public television station zdf , merkel said that her government needed to make tough decisions .
however , she said the nature of discussion within the coalition - which has been accused of excessive bickering - was partly responsible for alienating the electorate .
" i think we have n't managed to reach people partly because the confusion of voices and the way we have treated each other have not been what is to be expected of us , " merkel said , adding that the situation needed to be improved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coalition parties have lost ground since the election last year in the interview on sunday , merkel said that her government could be particularly satisfied with its record on the economy .
the chancellor said she was confident about regaining opinion poll approval as soon as important decisions facing the country had been made , by the end of the year .
questions to be answered merkel said financial stability , health , education for the children of welfare recipients , energy policy and reforms to the military were her government 's top priorities .
the chancellor said that she believed that after these decisions were taken , voters would understand that germany was " better equipped for the future . "
in the interview following her vacation in italy , merkel reaffirmed her commitment to introducing a tax on nuclear power providers , despite objections from the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is open to a suspension of compulsory military service the chancellor also said she was open to a suspension of germany 's compulsory military service .
both issues have been the subject of heated debate within the coalition .
in an opinion poll released last week , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- moved ahead of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who along with bavarian sister party the csu share power with the liberal free democrats fdp .
the spd had 32 percent support compared to 31 percent for the cdu and csu in the poll conducted by germany 's allensbach institute .
the fdp had just six percent .
the result contrasts with the general election in september 2009 when the cdu and csu won almost 34 percent of the popular vote , and the fdp almost 15 percent , compared with 23 percent for the spd .

" there are 82 million people in germany , 6.7 million of those are not german nationals and 1.3 million were born here , but still do n't have german citizenship .

human trafficking is the fastest-growing source of profit for organized crime . the united nations declared august 23 an international day of remembrance for the abolition of slavery .
but the trade in human beings is an ongoing problem around the world .
compared to the drugs and arms trades , however , it is more difficult to track down perpetrators in the multibillion-dollar trafficking business .
victims of forced labor and sexual exploitation are not always identified as such and can even face unjust criminal prosecution themselves .
the international organization for migration estimates that between 700,000 to 4 million people are trafficked across national borders every year .
but iom spokesman jean philippe chauzy said the secret nature of the trade means no one knows exactly how many people are trafficked worldwide .
" human trafficking , either for sexual or labor exploitation , is truly a global phenomenon , " he said .
" there are no regions of the world that are not affected by trafficking . "
millions of men , women and children who leave home in search of better socio-economic prospects are vulnerable to exploitation – and chauzy said this migration " feeds trafficking . "
" because there are so few opportunities for people to migrate legally , they will tend to take risks and go through so-called intermediaries , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte awino was kidnapped by the lord 's resistance army in uganda " and in many cases , unfortunately , they find themselves in situations of exploitation . "
a voice for the voiceless charlotte awino was held as a sex slave for eight years .
when she recently talked to the un humans rights council in geneva , she said she came as a representive for those exploited and left voiceless by human trafficking .
awino called on the international community to help the victims .
" no one is there for them , " she said .
" and , nothing is being done , even if they escape back home . "
awino was 14 years old when the ugandan rebel lord 's resistance army abducted her from her boarding school in 1996 .
" we were taken away from the school campus heading nowhere , walking the whole time , " she said .
awino claimed she was taken to southern sudan , where victims were raped and beaten and forced to work in the gardens and carry luggage .
she said those caught trying to escape were killed .
awino was 22 years old and had two children by the time she managed to escape . a global problem sexual exploitation has been affecting women in countries around the world – including western europe and the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are sold into prostitution in many countries kikka cerpa was forced into a life of prostitution after her boyfriend persuaded her to leave venezuela and go to new york in 1992 .
" i went to the united states thinking that i was going to be working as a nanny , and i ended up being a prostitute , not by choice , " she said .
cerpa said she was beaten and raped and spent three years working in the sex trade to pay off her boyfriend 's debts . a customer helped cerpa escape but then then forced her to become his personal slave . she lived with him for 10 years and had two daughters .
" i could never leave him because every time that i tried to leave , he said that he would use my criminal conviction and he would have me deported from the united states and i would never visit my daughters anymore , " she said .
with the help of an organization called sanctuary for families , cerpa managed to free herself from the pimps and madams who had controlled her life .
she sought a court order of protection after her escape , but her daughters were taken away from her and she was accused of being a criminal . exploited for labor though sex trafficking has generally attracted the most international media attention , labor exploitation is also prevalent on a global scale .
the international organization for migration reports that millions of women , men and children are forced to work in sweatshops , construction , agriculture , as street beggars and in other hazardous jobs for little or no pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imo says victims of labor trafficking may be forced to work as street beggars kumar ramjali was duped with the promise of a good job with good money .
he said a jordanian company recruited him in his native nepal in 2004 to work in the united states .
but instead , ramjali was sent to iraq , where he was forced to work at a us military base against his will . he said his passport was confiscated and he was not allowed to leave for four years .
jana , a 30-year-old bosnian national , also fell victim to an employment scam .
after moving to to slovenia to continue her studies , she attended a job interview with an accounting firm arranged by a newly made female friend .
" the first 10 minutes looked pretty normal , like a normal office and a woman was there interviewing me , " she said .
" and then suddenly , two men came in and the interview was finished . "
jana said the men dragged her out of the office and when she resisted , they became extremely violent .
" i was raped and beaten many times , " she said .
" afterwards , i was taken to some place , blindfolded and repeatedly raped and drugged with heroin for a few days . "
later , jana said she began to receive clients – between six and 10 each day for four months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-trafficking poster from moldova prevention and punishment after her escape in 2005 , jana became an advocate against trafficking .
human rights organizations say a variety of approaches are needed to tackle the issue , including information campaigns to help prevent trafficking .
experts and survivors agree that more work must be done to provide legal assistance and protection for the victims – and to make sure that perpetrators are the ones who are prosecuted and punished for their crimes . author : lisa schlein -lrb- arp -rrb- editor : anke rasper send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the total number of soldiers will be cut to around 165,000 , with compulsory service practically abolished . defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg presented his draft plans for the future of the german army to government ministers on monday .
the model guttenberg unveiled will see the present 252,000 soldiers cut to 163,500 over the next few years , a reduction of around a third .
conscription will be suspended in the short term , with young men no longer called up to do compulsory service .
but guttenberg stressed that it was important conscription retains its place in the constitution , in case it becomes viable again in the future .
" by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better , " guttenberg said after discussing his proposals with coalition partners .
knock-on effects the chosen model would mean a reduction in the professional standing army from around 195,000 soldiers to 156,000 .
the cuts mean that the army would be left with three tank battalions , two artillery battalions and one paratrooper regiment .
the civilian service alternative to military conscription , an important provider of labor to germany 's care homes , will also be suspended .
family minister kristina schroeder proposed on monday to introduce a national voluntary community service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has conscripted young men into its armed forces since 1957 " i 'm not giving myself hope that we can completely replace what we have now , " schroeder told reporters in berlin .
but she celebrated the fact that women would be able to perform community service for the first time .
the proposal to suspend rather than scrap conscription altogether postpones a contentious debate that has been bedevilling chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition in recent weeks .
merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- sees itself as a staunch defender of compulsory military service , though its military impracticality and high cost have long threatened the ideal of a ' citizen 's army . '
' voluntary conscription ' guttenberg , of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , hopes to mollify his party colleagues with the new " voluntary military service " model , which he says represents " a modern variation for the citizen to take on responsibility . "
the government is hoping to attract volunteers to sign on to this new scheme for up to 23 months by promising driver 's licenses , university places and other fringe benefits .
women would be included amongst an estimated 7,500 army volunteers .
" not enough to safeguard the regeneration of the troops with up-and-coming soldiers , " criticized ulrich kirsch , head of the armed forces association .
the defense ministry is aiming to cut some 8.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- off its budget over the next four years , though guttenberg warned that savings in new armament projects would also be needed .

as the debate over the future of nuclear power in germany heats up , greenpeace is accusing the government of defying a law mandating the release of the next monitoring report on security of the country 's energy supply . greenpeace germany took legal action monday against the federal ministry of economics for failing to release a report detailing key information on the country 's future energy needs ahead of last month 's deadline .
the complaint was lodged in a berlin administrative court .
under germany 's energy industry law -lrb- enwg -rrb- , the economics ministry is required to publish a monitoring report on the future of the country 's energy supply every two years and present the information to the european commission .
the deadline for the 2010 report was july 31 .
" to our surprise and disappointment , this report was not presented , and it was not submitted to the european commission in brussels , " greenpeace energy expert tobias münchmeyer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace has long campaigned against atomic energy the future of nuclear the data contained in the report is expected to further clarify a subject of intense political debate in germany : whether the country can meet its future electricity needs without nuclear power .
germany 's ruling coalition under chancellor angela merkel supports extending the operating lives of nuclear reactors beyond the 2022 shut-down deadline passed by the previous social democrat-led government .
münchmeyer said greenpeace believed the ministry , led by minister rainer brüderle , delayed the report 's release " in order to manipulate the current debate on energy supply in germany . "
a statement from the german economics ministry blamed the hold-up on outside problems .
" publication of the federal ministry of economics monitoring report on the security of supply in the electrical industry is postponed until fall 2010 , due to external assessment delays involving the preparation of energy scenarios for the german government 's energy policy , " a ministry spokesman told deutsche welle .
ahead of government plans to craft a long-term energy strategy by the end of september , the economics ministry commissioned several institutions with developing different energy scenarios for the future .
energy shortage ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nuclear phase-out was set for 2022 by the last red-green government yet according to a recent report in german newspaper die zeit , the ministry itself established a general framework for scientific assessment - and münchmeyer said data was chosen in ways that would support the conclusion that nuclear extension plans would be " useful or positive for the german economy . "
german utilities companies have warned that the country could face an electricity shortage if plans for a nuclear phase-out go through - a claim that greenpeace , a long-term opponent of atomic power , disputes .
" the last report from 2008 has clearly shown that there is no risk of running a deficit in the electricity supply , " münchmeyer said , adding that the 2010 monitoring document would further support that point .

as the debate over the future of nuclear power in germany heats up , greenpeace is accusing the government of defying a law mandating the release of the next monitoring report on security of the country 's energy supply . greenpeace germany took legal action monday against the federal ministry of economics for failing to release a report detailing key information on the country 's future energy needs ahead of last month 's deadline .
the complaint was lodged in a berlin administrative court .
under germany 's energy industry law -lrb- enwg -rrb- , the economics ministry is required to publish a monitoring report on the future of the country 's energy supply every two years and present the information to the european commission .
the deadline for the 2010 report was july 31 .
" to our surprise and disappointment , this report was not presented , and it was not submitted to the european commission in brussels , " greenpeace energy expert tobias münchmeyer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace has long campaigned against atomic energy the future of nuclear the data contained in the report is expected to further clarify a subject of intense political debate in germany : whether the country can meet its future electricity needs without nuclear power .
germany 's ruling coalition under chancellor angela merkel supports extending the operating lives of nuclear reactors beyond the 2022 shut-down deadline passed by the previous social democrat-led government .
münchmeyer said greenpeace believed the ministry , led by minister rainer brüderle , delayed the report 's release " in order to manipulate the current debate on energy supply in germany . "
a statement from the german economics ministry blamed the hold-up on outside problems .
" publication of the federal ministry of economics monitoring report on the security of supply in the electrical industry is postponed until fall 2010 , due to external assessment delays involving the preparation of energy scenarios for the german government 's energy policy , " a ministry spokesman told deutsche welle .
ahead of government plans to craft a long-term energy strategy by the end of september , the economics ministry commissioned several institutions with developing different energy scenarios for the future .
energy shortage ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nuclear phase-out was set for 2022 by the last red-green government yet according to a recent report in german newspaper die zeit , the ministry itself established a general framework for scientific assessment - and münchmeyer said data was chosen in ways that would support the conclusion that nuclear extension plans would be " useful or positive for the german economy . "
german utilities companies have warned that the country could face an electricity shortage if plans for a nuclear phase-out go through - a claim that greenpeace , a long-term opponent of atomic power , disputes .
" the last report from 2008 has clearly shown that there is no risk of running a deficit in the electricity supply , " münchmeyer said , adding that the 2010 monitoring document would further support that point .

the on-board air conditioning also failed , causing minor health scares . an express train from berlin to munich ground to a halt close to stuttgart on sunday , after suffering engine failure .
the 420 passengers on board were stranded in a tunnel near vaihingen an der enz in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg for over three hours without air conditioning .
one was later hospitalized and three more required minor medical treatment because of the rising temperatures on board .
the inter city express -lrb- ice -rrb- train stopped because of a problem with the engine , which also powers the climate control systems .
however , batteries continued to power the lights , toilets and door switches during the lengthy delay .
plan b german rail operator deutsche bahn first tried to solve the problem by sending a locomotive to tow the stranded train to its next stop in stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german rail service has endured a trying summer however , when this attempt failed , a replacement was sent instead , and passengers eventually switched trains inside the tunnel .
a deutsche bahn spokesman said the train stopped at around 1 p.m. , with the replacement eventually arriving at 4:30 p.m.
critics said the prolonged wait showed that the german railway service lacks the capacity to deal with unexpected problems .
" if it 's too much to ask of deutsche bahn to tow away one stranded ice in a case like this , " regional head of the train passengers association pro-bahn , stefan buhl said , " then it 's difficult to imagine what might happen in a genuine catastrophe . "
the breakdown forced deutsche bahn to close the line in both directions for the entire time period – diverting other services onto an older , slower line , delaying them by roughly quarter of an hour .
deutsche bahn is legally obliged to pay back half the cost of the ticket to any passengers whose trains are delayed by two hours or more .
it 's been a difficult summer for the german railway operator , which made the headlines during a july heat-wave when the air conditioning systems failed on three ice trains and 44 passengers collapsed in the heat .

22 1990 is one of the most historic in german post-war history .
after four decades of division , the decision was made by the east german parliament to united with west germany on oct .
3 , 1990 . after a night-long discussion , that ended in the early hours of aug .
23 , 1990 , the decision was made for the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- to be absorbed into the federal republic of germany -lrb- frg -rrb- .
at a special session of the east german parliament , the volkskammer , the representatives voted to merge with the west .
instead of a brand new constitution to cover the new unified state , it was decided to just incorporate the gdr under the existing constitution .
the former east was incorporated into the west under article 23 of the federal republic 's basic law .
heavy debates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly elected parliament effectively voted to disband itself in 1990 on 18 mar . , the people of the gdr had held the first democratic elections for the volkskammer .
the main aim of this new parliament was to prepare for accession to the federal republic .
by the summer of 1990 , the gdr and frg had created a single economic zone , with the deutschmark being used as the sole currency .
the gdr had also adopted large aspects of the economic and legal systems of the west .
by august , not a single meeting of the volkskammer passed without the subject of ' immediate accession ' being discussed .
for the then-prime minister of the gdr , lothar de maiziere , the time had come to seize the initiative .
" after a regular session in the afternoon of aug .
22 , " he recalled , " -lsb- we decided -rsb- to carry on with a special session with the sole agenda item of setting a timeline for german reunification . "
although it had been thought best to implement a speedy accession , not all parliamentarians were in agreement with the prime minister .
wolfgang ullman , a representative from the alliance 90 party urged de maiziere to stop proceedings .
ullman said he would report him to the prosecutor general of the gdr for high treason .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ullman -lrb- r . -rrb- did not agree with de maiziere 's approach however , a little later , the premier of the east german state of saxony-anhalt , reinhard hoeppner , opened the special session .
searching for the right date full discussions began immediately , with lothar de maiziere making the formal request to join with the federal republic but giving no specific date .
he proposed some time before october , as it would be the 41st anniversary of the gdr on oct .
14 , and he felt this date was symbolic .
" i thought that we could have the first free unified national elections on the oct .
14 , " de maiziere said .
" taking power back from the sovereign body and giving it to the new parliament . "
however it soon became clear that de maiziere 's date would not find a majority .
except for the successor party to the east german ruling sed , the pds -lrb- party for democratic socialism -rrb- , no one wanted to experience the 41st anniversary of the gdr a week early .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse was a member of the gdr parliament in 1990 after a long debate , another solution was offered by wolfgang thierse , a representative of the spd in the chamber .
he suggested a ' two-plus-four ' approach .
terms and conditions since may , the ' two-plus-four ' talks had been held between the two german foreign ministers and their four counterparts from the victorious allied nations .
the discussions centred on the allies withdrawing their troops and rights from germany .
the talks were due to come to a close on sept .
12 , in moscow .
wolfgang thierse suggested a date following this meeting on sept .
13 to be the official accession day .
however it was thought that this timeline too would not reach approval .
" it was clear that by sept .
12 , the ' two plus four ' contract would not be ratified , " lothar de maiziere said .
the final reunification date of oct .
3 , 1990 , came to be decided because it coincided with an international foreign ministers ' conference in new york on oct .
1 , .
the foreign ministers from the allied countries said they wished to withdraw their troops from the parts of germany they were occupying on oct .
3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two german foreign ministers : gdr 's markus meckel -lrb- l . -rrb- and frg 's hans-dietrich genscher " this is how the date of oct .
3 came about , " recalled de maiziere .
a special day for lothar de maiziere , the date of oct .
3 is a truly special one .
by then , the 50-year-old had spent half his life in the gdr and was touched by the socialist state .
" regardless of whether rejects or disowns the system , there is still a sense of loyalty to it , " he said .
therefore for de maiziere and for many others from the gdr , " this new beginning is not easy . "
however he added that for all politicians elected to the chamber of the people , it was clear that " our main purpose was to abolish ourselves . "

by the summer of 1990 , the gdr and frg had created a single economic zone , with the deutschmark being used as the sole currency .
the gdr had also adopted large aspects of the economic and legal systems of the west .
by august , not a single meeting of the volkskammer passed without the subject of ' immediate accession ' being discussed .
for the then-prime minister of the gdr , lothar de maiziere , the time had come to seize the initiative .
" after a regular session in the afternoon of aug .
22 , " he recalled , " -lsb- we decided -rsb- to carry on with a special session with the sole agenda item of setting a timeline for german reunification . "
although it had been thought best to implement a speedy accession , not all parliamentarians were in agreement with the prime minister .
wolfgang ullman , a representative from the alliance 90 party urged de maiziere to stop proceedings .
ullman said he would report him to the prosecutor general of the gdr for high treason .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ullman -lrb- r . -rrb- did not agree with de maiziere 's approach however , a little later , the premier of the east german state of saxony-anhalt , reinhard hoeppner , opened the special session .
searching for the right date full discussions began immediately , with lothar de maiziere making the formal request to join with the federal republic but giving no specific date .
he proposed some time before october , as it would be the 41st anniversary of the gdr on oct .
14 , and he felt this date was symbolic .
" i thought that we could have the first free unified national elections on the oct .
14 , " de maiziere said .
" taking power back from the sovereign body and giving it to the new parliament . "
however it soon became clear that de maiziere 's date would not find a majority .
except for the successor party to the east german ruling sed , the pds -lrb- party for democratic socialism -rrb- , no one wanted to experience the 41st anniversary of the gdr a week early .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse was a member of the gdr parliament in 1990 after a long debate , another solution was offered by wolfgang thierse , a representative of the spd in the chamber .
he suggested a ' two-plus-four ' approach .
terms and conditions since may , the ' two-plus-four ' talks had been held between the two german foreign ministers and their four counterparts from the victorious allied nations .
the discussions centred on the allies withdrawing their troops and rights from germany .
the talks were due to come to a close on sept .
12 , in moscow .
wolfgang thierse suggested a date following this meeting on sept .
13 to be the official accession day .
however it was thought that this timeline too would not reach approval .
" it was clear that by sept .

the final reunification date of oct .

after four decades of division , the decision was made by the east german parliament to united with west germany on oct .
3 , 1990 . after a night-long discussion , that ended in the early hours of aug .
23 , 1990 , the decision was made for the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- to be absorbed into the federal republic of germany -lrb- frg -rrb- .
at a special session of the east german parliament , the volkskammer , the representatives voted to merge with the west .
instead of a brand new constitution to cover the new unified state , it was decided to just incorporate the gdr under the existing constitution .
the former east was incorporated into the west under article 23 of the federal republic 's basic law .

but as deutsche welle found out , there are certain questions he hates answering . armin veh has one of the better resumes in the bundesliga .
he 's coached three different lower-league teams to promotion and is one of only five currently active coaches to have won the first division title .
but among the elite , he 's also an outsider who gets comparatively little respect .
whereas thomas schaaf , lousis van gaal , jupp heynckes and felix magath can all feel relatively secure in their jobs , veh is anything but a sure bet to survive this season at hamburg .
hamburg got off to fine start , beating magath 's schalke in round one .
but the team has also run through nine coaches in as many years , and veh knows that loyalty is a rare commodity these days .
" coaches get fired more quickly than used to be the case , " veh told deutsche welle .
" if you do n't reach your short-term goals , it 's pretty much impossible to do any medium- or long-term work . "
veh 's career has been a roller-coaster in recent years .
appointed on an interim basis at stuttgart in the midst of the 2005-6 campaign , he won the title with the team the following season - only to be unceremoniously axed the year after .
the title established veh 's credentials , but he used up almost all of that capital in his next assignment .

in retrospect , it was a very difficult task .
magath had won the title in 2008-9 , and veh had to try to sustain that success while putting his own stamp on the team .
he sought to change the wolves ' style of play and frantically rotated players as their defense revealed unexpected gaping holes .
he was fired last january after a nine-game winless streak and wolfsburg ended the season in eighth place .
that experience does n't seem to have affected veh as much as one might expect .
at hamburg , he 's continued to do things his way .
his controversial decisions include moving the team 's most productive striker , mladen petric , out to the wing , and nominating newly acquired defender heiko westermann as team captain .
" i wanted to give the team a different accent , a new accent , " veh said .
" that was the logic behind heiko westermann as captain . "
that initiative may be more suitable for hamburg than wolfsburg .
unlike wolfsburg , hamburg are not coming off the back of a triumph .
in fact , despite acquiring superstar ruud van nistelrooy and highly touted youngster eljero elia , the northern german side resolutely disappointed last season , coming in seventh .
one of veh 's first tasks is to win the support of those who were most disappointed - the fans .
overcoming skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening day win over schalke showed hamburg 's renewed team spirit the relationship between hamburg players and supporters totally deteriorated last season , with fans booing what they viewed as over-paid prima donnas and striker paolo guerrero retaliating by beaning one of them with a full water bottle .
it may be just diplomacy , but veh says he has n't encountered any major personality issues in the squad far .
" i have n't been able to see any signs that the team is difficult , " veh said .
" they have n't made that impression on me - although difficulties usually only arise when you do n't have success . "
truer words were never spoken .
when veh 's appointment was announced last may , the overwhelming reaction among fans was dismay .
" mediocre coach for a mediocre team , " wrote one blogger succinctly when the news broke .
" armin veh - is this a joke ? " opined another .
" but mostly likely no real coach wanted to come to hamburg , which is no wonder given how chaotic the club is . "
veh 's challenge will to be to earn the support of skeptics like these , and there 's a lot on the line .
having bombed in wolfsburg after succeeding in stuttgart , veh is unlikely ever to get another chance to coach a top bundesliga club , if he fails to attain his goals in hamburg .
veh is known as a players ' coach , and perhaps the initial win against schalke was a sign that he 's got the squad behind him .

22 1990 is one of the most historic in german post-war history .
after four decades of division , the decision was made by the east german parliament to united with west germany on oct .
3 , 1990 . after a night-long discussion , that ended in the early hours of aug .
23 , 1990 , the decision was made for the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- to be absorbed into the federal republic of germany -lrb- frg -rrb- .
at a special session of the east german parliament , the volkskammer , the representatives voted to merge with the west .
instead of a brand new constitution to cover the new unified state , it was decided to just incorporate the gdr under the existing constitution .
the former east was incorporated into the west under article 23 of the federal republic 's basic law .
heavy debates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly elected parliament effectively voted to disband itself in 1990 on 18 mar . , the people of the gdr had held the first democratic elections for the volkskammer .
the main aim of this new parliament was to prepare for accession to the federal republic .
by the summer of 1990 , the gdr and frg had created a single economic zone , with the deutschmark being used as the sole currency .
the gdr had also adopted large aspects of the economic and legal systems of the west .
by august , not a single meeting of the volkskammer passed without the subject of ' immediate accession ' being discussed .
for the then-prime minister of the gdr , lothar de maiziere , the time had come to seize the initiative .
" after a regular session in the afternoon of aug .
22 , " he recalled , " -lsb- we decided -rsb- to carry on with a special session with the sole agenda item of setting a timeline for german reunification . "
although it had been thought best to implement a speedy accession , not all parliamentarians were in agreement with the prime minister .
wolfgang ullman , a representative from the alliance 90 party urged de maiziere to stop proceedings .
ullman said he would report him to the prosecutor general of the gdr for high treason .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ullman -lrb- r . -rrb- did not agree with de maiziere 's approach however , a little later , the premier of the east german state of saxony-anhalt , reinhard hoeppner , opened the special session .
searching for the right date full discussions began immediately , with lothar de maiziere making the formal request to join with the federal republic but giving no specific date .
he proposed some time before october , as it would be the 41st anniversary of the gdr on oct .
14 , and he felt this date was symbolic .
" i thought that we could have the first free unified national elections on the oct .
14 , " de maiziere said .
" taking power back from the sovereign body and giving it to the new parliament . "
however it soon became clear that de maiziere 's date would not find a majority .
except for the successor party to the east german ruling sed , the pds -lrb- party for democratic socialism -rrb- , no one wanted to experience the 41st anniversary of the gdr a week early .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse was a member of the gdr parliament in 1990 after a long debate , another solution was offered by wolfgang thierse , a representative of the spd in the chamber .
he suggested a ' two-plus-four ' approach .
terms and conditions since may , the ' two-plus-four ' talks had been held between the two german foreign ministers and their four counterparts from the victorious allied nations .
the discussions centred on the allies withdrawing their troops and rights from germany .
the talks were due to come to a close on sept .
12 , in moscow .
wolfgang thierse suggested a date following this meeting on sept .
13 to be the official accession day .
however it was thought that this timeline too would not reach approval .
" it was clear that by sept .
12 , the ' two plus four ' contract would not be ratified , " lothar de maiziere said .
the final reunification date of oct .
3 , 1990 , came to be decided because it coincided with an international foreign ministers ' conference in new york on oct .
1 , .
the foreign ministers from the allied countries said they wished to withdraw their troops from the parts of germany they were occupying on oct .
3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two german foreign ministers : gdr 's markus meckel -lrb- l . -rrb- and frg 's hans-dietrich genscher " this is how the date of oct .
3 came about , " recalled de maiziere .
a special day for lothar de maiziere , the date of oct .
3 is a truly special one .
by then , the 50-year-old had spent half his life in the gdr and was touched by the socialist state .
" regardless of whether rejects or disowns the system , there is still a sense of loyalty to it , " he said .
therefore for de maiziere and for many others from the gdr , " this new beginning is not easy . "
however he added that for all politicians elected to the chamber of the people , it was clear that " our main purpose was to abolish ourselves . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.08.2010 hamburg 's winning start gives under-fire coach breathing space großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veh won the bundesliga in 2007 hamburg 's armin veh still belongs to the small circle of elite bundesliga coaches with a job at a top team and is battling to stay there .
but as deutsche welle found out , there are certain questions he hates answering . armin veh has one of the better resumes in the bundesliga .
he 's coached three different lower-league teams to promotion and is one of only five currently active coaches to have won the first division title .
but among the elite , he 's also an outsider who gets comparatively little respect .
whereas thomas schaaf , lousis van gaal , jupp heynckes and felix magath can all feel relatively secure in their jobs , veh is anything but a sure bet to survive this season at hamburg .
hamburg got off to fine start , beating magath 's schalke in round one .
but the team has also run through nine coaches in as many years , and veh knows that loyalty is a rare commodity these days .
" coaches get fired more quickly than used to be the case , " veh told deutsche welle .
" if you do n't reach your short-term goals , it 's pretty much impossible to do any medium- or long-term work . "
veh 's career has been a roller-coaster in recent years .
appointed on an interim basis at stuttgart in the midst of the 2005-6 campaign , he won the title with the team the following season - only to be unceremoniously axed the year after .
the title established veh 's credentials , but he used up almost all of that capital in his next assignment .
do n't mention the magath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veh 's time at wolfsburg was characterized by frustration veh visibly bristles , evading questions , when asked to comment on his short-lived tenure as felix magath 's successor at wolfsburg last season .
in retrospect , it was a very difficult task .
magath had won the title in 2008-9 , and veh had to try to sustain that success while putting his own stamp on the team .
he sought to change the wolves ' style of play and frantically rotated players as their defense revealed unexpected gaping holes .
he was fired last january after a nine-game winless streak and wolfsburg ended the season in eighth place .
that experience does n't seem to have affected veh as much as one might expect .
at hamburg , he 's continued to do things his way .
his controversial decisions include moving the team 's most productive striker , mladen petric , out to the wing , and nominating newly acquired defender heiko westermann as team captain .
" i wanted to give the team a different accent , a new accent , " veh said .
" that was the logic behind heiko westermann as captain . "
that initiative may be more suitable for hamburg than wolfsburg .
unlike wolfsburg , hamburg are not coming off the back of a triumph .
in fact , despite acquiring superstar ruud van nistelrooy and highly touted youngster eljero elia , the northern german side resolutely disappointed last season , coming in seventh .
one of veh 's first tasks is to win the support of those who were most disappointed - the fans .
overcoming skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening day win over schalke showed hamburg 's renewed team spirit the relationship between hamburg players and supporters totally deteriorated last season , with fans booing what they viewed as over-paid prima donnas and striker paolo guerrero retaliating by beaning one of them with a full water bottle .
it may be just diplomacy , but veh says he has n't encountered any major personality issues in the squad far .
" i have n't been able to see any signs that the team is difficult , " veh said .
" they have n't made that impression on me - although difficulties usually only arise when you do n't have success . "
truer words were never spoken .
when veh 's appointment was announced last may , the overwhelming reaction among fans was dismay .
" mediocre coach for a mediocre team , " wrote one blogger succinctly when the news broke .
" armin veh - is this a joke ? " opined another .
" but mostly likely no real coach wanted to come to hamburg , which is no wonder given how chaotic the club is . "
veh 's challenge will to be to earn the support of skeptics like these , and there 's a lot on the line .
having bombed in wolfsburg after succeeding in stuttgart , veh is unlikely ever to get another chance to coach a top bundesliga club , if he fails to attain his goals in hamburg .
veh is known as a players ' coach , and perhaps the initial win against schalke was a sign that he 's got the squad behind him .
or in could be a blip on the radar screen , and as veh knows only too well , fans of the league 's biggest and richest clubs are never content with blips . even if they have a past bundesliga title to their credit .
armin veh was interviewed by jana schaefer for dw-tv 's bundesliga kick off .
the program airs every tuesday .

drunken youths broke and uprooted 72 grave crosses and damaged one jewish stele at the cemetery in laon , in the picardy region .
two young men , aged 18 and 19 and already known to police , were arrested .
eyewitnesses reported that there were four culprits in total , who had damaged graves by hurtling around the graveyard on motorbikes .

as the debate over the future of nuclear power in germany heats up , greenpeace is accusing the government of defying a law mandating the release of the next monitoring report on security of the country 's energy supply . greenpeace germany took legal action monday against the federal ministry of economics for failing to release a report detailing key information on the country 's future energy needs ahead of last month 's deadline .
the complaint was lodged in a berlin administrative court .
under germany 's energy industry law -lrb- enwg -rrb- , the economics ministry is required to publish a monitoring report on the future of the country 's energy supply every two years and present the information to the european commission .
the deadline for the 2010 report was july 31 .
" to our surprise and disappointment , this report was not presented , and it was not submitted to the european commission in brussels , " greenpeace energy expert tobias münchmeyer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace has long campaigned against atomic energy the future of nuclear the data contained in the report is expected to further clarify a subject of intense political debate in germany : whether the country can meet its future electricity needs without nuclear power .
germany 's ruling coalition under chancellor angela merkel supports extending the operating lives of nuclear reactors beyond the 2022 shut-down deadline passed by the previous social democrat-led government .
münchmeyer said greenpeace believed the ministry , led by minister rainer brüderle , delayed the report 's release " in order to manipulate the current debate on energy supply in germany . "
a statement from the german economics ministry blamed the hold-up on outside problems .
" publication of the federal ministry of economics monitoring report on the security of supply in the electrical industry is postponed until fall 2010 , due to external assessment delays involving the preparation of energy scenarios for the german government 's energy policy , " a ministry spokesman told deutsche welle .
ahead of government plans to craft a long-term energy strategy by the end of september , the economics ministry commissioned several institutions with developing different energy scenarios for the future .
energy shortage ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nuclear phase-out was set for 2022 by the last red-green government yet according to a recent report in german newspaper die zeit , the ministry itself established a general framework for scientific assessment - and münchmeyer said data was chosen in ways that would support the conclusion that nuclear extension plans would be " useful or positive for the german economy . "
german utilities companies have warned that the country could face an electricity shortage if plans for a nuclear phase-out go through - a claim that greenpeace , a long-term opponent of atomic power , disputes .
" the last report from 2008 has clearly shown that there is no risk of running a deficit in the electricity supply , " münchmeyer said , adding that the 2010 monitoring document would further support that point .

human trafficking is the fastest-growing source of profit for organized crime . the united nations declared august 23 an international day of remembrance for the abolition of slavery .
but the trade in human beings is an ongoing problem around the world .
compared to the drugs and arms trades , however , it is more difficult to track down perpetrators in the multibillion-dollar trafficking business .
victims of forced labor and sexual exploitation are not always identified as such and can even face unjust criminal prosecution themselves .
the international organization for migration estimates that between 700,000 to 4 million people are trafficked across national borders every year .
but iom spokesman jean philippe chauzy said the secret nature of the trade means no one knows exactly how many people are trafficked worldwide .
" human trafficking , either for sexual or labor exploitation , is truly a global phenomenon , " he said .
" there are no regions of the world that are not affected by trafficking . "
millions of men , women and children who leave home in search of better socio-economic prospects are vulnerable to exploitation – and chauzy said this migration " feeds trafficking . "
" because there are so few opportunities for people to migrate legally , they will tend to take risks and go through so-called intermediaries , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte awino was kidnapped by the lord 's resistance army in uganda " and in many cases , unfortunately , they find themselves in situations of exploitation . "
a voice for the voiceless charlotte awino was held as a sex slave for eight years .
when she recently talked to the un humans rights council in geneva , she said she came as a representive for those exploited and left voiceless by human trafficking .
awino called on the international community to help the victims .
" no one is there for them , " she said .
" and , nothing is being done , even if they escape back home . "
awino was 14 years old when the ugandan rebel lord 's resistance army abducted her from her boarding school in 1996 .
" we were taken away from the school campus heading nowhere , walking the whole time , " she said .
awino claimed she was taken to southern sudan , where victims were raped and beaten and forced to work in the gardens and carry luggage .
she said those caught trying to escape were killed .
awino was 22 years old and had two children by the time she managed to escape . a global problem sexual exploitation has been affecting women in countries around the world – including western europe and the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are sold into prostitution in many countries kikka cerpa was forced into a life of prostitution after her boyfriend persuaded her to leave venezuela and go to new york in 1992 .
" i went to the united states thinking that i was going to be working as a nanny , and i ended up being a prostitute , not by choice , " she said .
cerpa said she was beaten and raped and spent three years working in the sex trade to pay off her boyfriend 's debts . a customer helped cerpa escape but then then forced her to become his personal slave . she lived with him for 10 years and had two daughters .
" i could never leave him because every time that i tried to leave , he said that he would use my criminal conviction and he would have me deported from the united states and i would never visit my daughters anymore , " she said .
with the help of an organization called sanctuary for families , cerpa managed to free herself from the pimps and madams who had controlled her life .
she sought a court order of protection after her escape , but her daughters were taken away from her and she was accused of being a criminal . exploited for labor though sex trafficking has generally attracted the most international media attention , labor exploitation is also prevalent on a global scale .
the international organization for migration reports that millions of women , men and children are forced to work in sweatshops , construction , agriculture , as street beggars and in other hazardous jobs for little or no pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imo says victims of labor trafficking may be forced to work as street beggars kumar ramjali was duped with the promise of a good job with good money .
he said a jordanian company recruited him in his native nepal in 2004 to work in the united states .
but instead , ramjali was sent to iraq , where he was forced to work at a us military base against his will . he said his passport was confiscated and he was not allowed to leave for four years .
jana , a 30-year-old bosnian national , also fell victim to an employment scam .
after moving to to slovenia to continue her studies , she attended a job interview with an accounting firm arranged by a newly made female friend .
" the first 10 minutes looked pretty normal , like a normal office and a woman was there interviewing me , " she said .
" and then suddenly , two men came in and the interview was finished . "
jana said the men dragged her out of the office and when she resisted , they became extremely violent .
" i was raped and beaten many times , " she said .
" afterwards , i was taken to some place , blindfolded and repeatedly raped and drugged with heroin for a few days . "
later , jana said she began to receive clients – between six and 10 each day for four months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-trafficking poster from moldova prevention and punishment after her escape in 2005 , jana became an advocate against trafficking .
human rights organizations say a variety of approaches are needed to tackle the issue , including information campaigns to help prevent trafficking .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 23.08.2010 twenty years ago the gdr parliament voted to join the federal republic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last prime minister of the gdr , lothar de maiziere the night of aug .
22 1990 is one of the most historic in german post-war history .
after four decades of division , the decision was made by the east german parliament to united with west germany on oct .
3 , 1990 . after a night-long discussion , that ended in the early hours of aug .
23 , 1990 , the decision was made for the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- to be absorbed into the federal republic of germany -lrb- frg -rrb- .
at a special session of the east german parliament , the volkskammer , the representatives voted to merge with the west .
instead of a brand new constitution to cover the new unified state , it was decided to just incorporate the gdr under the existing constitution .
the former east was incorporated into the west under article 23 of the federal republic 's basic law .
heavy debates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly elected parliament effectively voted to disband itself in 1990 on 18 mar . , the people of the gdr had held the first democratic elections for the volkskammer .
the main aim of this new parliament was to prepare for accession to the federal republic .
by the summer of 1990 , the gdr and frg had created a single economic zone , with the deutschmark being used as the sole currency .
the gdr had also adopted large aspects of the economic and legal systems of the west .
by august , not a single meeting of the volkskammer passed without the subject of ' immediate accession ' being discussed .
for the then-prime minister of the gdr , lothar de maiziere , the time had come to seize the initiative .
" after a regular session in the afternoon of aug .
22 , " he recalled , " -lsb- we decided -rsb- to carry on with a special session with the sole agenda item of setting a timeline for german reunification . "
although it had been thought best to implement a speedy accession , not all parliamentarians were in agreement with the prime minister .
wolfgang ullman , a representative from the alliance 90 party urged de maiziere to stop proceedings .
ullman said he would report him to the prosecutor general of the gdr for high treason .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ullman -lrb- r . -rrb- did not agree with de maiziere 's approach however , a little later , the premier of the east german state of saxony-anhalt , reinhard hoeppner , opened the special session .
searching for the right date full discussions began immediately , with lothar de maiziere making the formal request to join with the federal republic but giving no specific date .
he proposed some time before october , as it would be the 41st anniversary of the gdr on oct .
14 , and he felt this date was symbolic .
" i thought that we could have the first free unified national elections on the oct .
14 , " de maiziere said .
" taking power back from the sovereign body and giving it to the new parliament . "
however it soon became clear that de maiziere 's date would not find a majority .
except for the successor party to the east german ruling sed , the pds -lrb- party for democratic socialism -rrb- , no one wanted to experience the 41st anniversary of the gdr a week early .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse was a member of the gdr parliament in 1990 after a long debate , another solution was offered by wolfgang thierse , a representative of the spd in the chamber .
he suggested a ' two-plus-four ' approach .
terms and conditions since may , the ' two-plus-four ' talks had been held between the two german foreign ministers and their four counterparts from the victorious allied nations .
the discussions centred on the allies withdrawing their troops and rights from germany .
the talks were due to come to a close on sept .
12 , in moscow .
wolfgang thierse suggested a date following this meeting on sept .
13 to be the official accession day .
however it was thought that this timeline too would not reach approval .
" it was clear that by sept .
12 , the ' two plus four ' contract would not be ratified , " lothar de maiziere said .
the final reunification date of oct .
3 , 1990 , came to be decided because it coincided with an international foreign ministers ' conference in new york on oct .
1 , .
the foreign ministers from the allied countries said they wished to withdraw their troops from the parts of germany they were occupying on oct .
3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two german foreign ministers : gdr 's markus meckel -lrb- l . -rrb- and frg 's hans-dietrich genscher " this is how the date of oct .
3 came about , " recalled de maiziere .
a special day for lothar de maiziere , the date of oct .
3 is a truly special one .
by then , the 50-year-old had spent half his life in the gdr and was touched by the socialist state .
" regardless of whether rejects or disowns the system , there is still a sense of loyalty to it , " he said .
therefore for de maiziere and for many others from the gdr , " this new beginning is not easy . "

as the debate over the future of nuclear power in germany heats up , greenpeace is accusing the government of defying a law mandating the release of the next monitoring report on security of the country 's energy supply . greenpeace germany took legal action monday against the federal ministry of economics for failing to release a report detailing key information on the country 's future energy needs ahead of last month 's deadline .
the complaint was lodged in a berlin administrative court .
under germany 's energy industry law -lrb- enwg -rrb- , the economics ministry is required to publish a monitoring report on the future of the country 's energy supply every two years and present the information to the european commission .
the deadline for the 2010 report was july 31 .
" to our surprise and disappointment , this report was not presented , and it was not submitted to the european commission in brussels , " greenpeace energy expert tobias münchmeyer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace has long campaigned against atomic energy the future of nuclear the data contained in the report is expected to further clarify a subject of intense political debate in germany : whether the country can meet its future electricity needs without nuclear power .
germany 's ruling coalition under chancellor angela merkel supports extending the operating lives of nuclear reactors beyond the 2022 shut-down deadline passed by the previous social democrat-led government .
münchmeyer said greenpeace believed the ministry , led by minister rainer brüderle , delayed the report 's release " in order to manipulate the current debate on energy supply in germany . "
a statement from the german economics ministry blamed the hold-up on outside problems .
" publication of the federal ministry of economics monitoring report on the security of supply in the electrical industry is postponed until fall 2010 , due to external assessment delays involving the preparation of energy scenarios for the german government 's energy policy , " a ministry spokesman told deutsche welle .
ahead of government plans to craft a long-term energy strategy by the end of september , the economics ministry commissioned several institutions with developing different energy scenarios for the future .
energy shortage ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nuclear phase-out was set for 2022 by the last red-green government yet according to a recent report in german newspaper die zeit , the ministry itself established a general framework for scientific assessment - and münchmeyer said data was chosen in ways that would support the conclusion that nuclear extension plans would be " useful or positive for the german economy . "
german utilities companies have warned that the country could face an electricity shortage if plans for a nuclear phase-out go through - a claim that greenpeace , a long-term opponent of atomic power , disputes .
" the last report from 2008 has clearly shown that there is no risk of running a deficit in the electricity supply , " münchmeyer said , adding that the 2010 monitoring document would further support that point .

the total number of soldiers will be cut to around 165,000 , with compulsory service practically abolished . defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg presented his draft plans for the future of the german army to government ministers on monday .
the model guttenberg unveiled will see the present 252,000 soldiers cut to 163,500 over the next few years , a reduction of around a third .
conscription will be suspended in the short term , with young men no longer called up to do compulsory service .
but guttenberg stressed that it was important conscription retains its place in the constitution , in case it becomes viable again in the future .
" by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better , " guttenberg said after discussing his proposals with coalition partners .
knock-on effects the chosen model would mean a reduction in the professional standing army from around 195,000 soldiers to 156,000 .
the cuts mean that the army would be left with three tank battalions , two artillery battalions and one paratrooper regiment .
the civilian service alternative to military conscription , an important provider of labor to germany 's care homes , will also be suspended .
family minister kristina schroeder proposed on monday to introduce a national voluntary community service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has conscripted young men into its armed forces since 1957 " i 'm not giving myself hope that we can completely replace what we have now , " schroeder told reporters in berlin .
but she celebrated the fact that women would be able to perform community service for the first time .
the proposal to suspend rather than scrap conscription altogether postpones a contentious debate that has been bedevilling chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition in recent weeks .
merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- sees itself as a staunch defender of compulsory military service , though its military impracticality and high cost have long threatened the ideal of a ' citizen 's army . '
' voluntary conscription ' guttenberg , of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , hopes to mollify his party colleagues with the new " voluntary military service " model , which he says represents " a modern variation for the citizen to take on responsibility . "
the government is hoping to attract volunteers to sign on to this new scheme for up to 23 months by promising driver 's licenses , university places and other fringe benefits .
women would be included amongst an estimated 7,500 army volunteers .
" not enough to safeguard the regeneration of the troops with up-and-coming soldiers , " criticized ulrich kirsch , head of the armed forces association .
the defense ministry is aiming to cut some 8.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- off its budget over the next four years , though guttenberg warned that savings in new armament projects would also be needed .

" the problem is that the law is unfair .
there 's a trend in germany and elsewhere for people to have more than one nationality , " said marei pelzer , legal consultant for pro asyl , an organization that focuses on the rights of refugees and immigrants .
" we already have 4.5 million people in germany with more than one nationality , around 53 percent of those being granted german citizenship have dual nationality , " she told deutsche welle .

this so-called ' duty to choose ' , which is unique to germany , is controversial , not least because there are countries , like iran , morocco , afghanistan and some latin american countries , which do not allow citizens to give up their nationality , so in those cases , dual nationality is already being granted , which creates what the ngos call a two-class system .

" these desecrations do not appear to be anti-german in nature . "
around 3,500 people are buried at the champ-de-manoeuvre cemetery , many of whom are german soldiers who fell in battle between 1914 and 1918 , or were patients at the nearby german military hospitals which remained in operation until 1920 .

human trafficking is the fastest-growing source of profit for organized crime . the united nations declared august 23 an international day of remembrance for the abolition of slavery .
but the trade in human beings is an ongoing problem around the world .
compared to the drugs and arms trades , however , it is more difficult to track down perpetrators in the multibillion-dollar trafficking business .
victims of forced labor and sexual exploitation are not always identified as such and can even face unjust criminal prosecution themselves .
the international organization for migration estimates that between 700,000 to 4 million people are trafficked across national borders every year .
but iom spokesman jean philippe chauzy said the secret nature of the trade means no one knows exactly how many people are trafficked worldwide .
" human trafficking , either for sexual or labor exploitation , is truly a global phenomenon , " he said .
" there are no regions of the world that are not affected by trafficking . "
millions of men , women and children who leave home in search of better socio-economic prospects are vulnerable to exploitation – and chauzy said this migration " feeds trafficking . "
" because there are so few opportunities for people to migrate legally , they will tend to take risks and go through so-called intermediaries , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte awino was kidnapped by the lord 's resistance army in uganda " and in many cases , unfortunately , they find themselves in situations of exploitation . "
a voice for the voiceless charlotte awino was held as a sex slave for eight years .
when she recently talked to the un humans rights council in geneva , she said she came as a representive for those exploited and left voiceless by human trafficking .
awino called on the international community to help the victims .
" no one is there for them , " she said .
" and , nothing is being done , even if they escape back home . "
awino was 14 years old when the ugandan rebel lord 's resistance army abducted her from her boarding school in 1996 .
" we were taken away from the school campus heading nowhere , walking the whole time , " she said .
awino claimed she was taken to southern sudan , where victims were raped and beaten and forced to work in the gardens and carry luggage .
she said those caught trying to escape were killed .
awino was 22 years old and had two children by the time she managed to escape . a global problem sexual exploitation has been affecting women in countries around the world – including western europe and the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are sold into prostitution in many countries kikka cerpa was forced into a life of prostitution after her boyfriend persuaded her to leave venezuela and go to new york in 1992 .
" i went to the united states thinking that i was going to be working as a nanny , and i ended up being a prostitute , not by choice , " she said .
cerpa said she was beaten and raped and spent three years working in the sex trade to pay off her boyfriend 's debts . a customer helped cerpa escape but then then forced her to become his personal slave . she lived with him for 10 years and had two daughters .
" i could never leave him because every time that i tried to leave , he said that he would use my criminal conviction and he would have me deported from the united states and i would never visit my daughters anymore , " she said .
with the help of an organization called sanctuary for families , cerpa managed to free herself from the pimps and madams who had controlled her life .
she sought a court order of protection after her escape , but her daughters were taken away from her and she was accused of being a criminal . exploited for labor though sex trafficking has generally attracted the most international media attention , labor exploitation is also prevalent on a global scale .
the international organization for migration reports that millions of women , men and children are forced to work in sweatshops , construction , agriculture , as street beggars and in other hazardous jobs for little or no pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imo says victims of labor trafficking may be forced to work as street beggars kumar ramjali was duped with the promise of a good job with good money .
he said a jordanian company recruited him in his native nepal in 2004 to work in the united states .
but instead , ramjali was sent to iraq , where he was forced to work at a us military base against his will . he said his passport was confiscated and he was not allowed to leave for four years .
jana , a 30-year-old bosnian national , also fell victim to an employment scam .
after moving to to slovenia to continue her studies , she attended a job interview with an accounting firm arranged by a newly made female friend .
" the first 10 minutes looked pretty normal , like a normal office and a woman was there interviewing me , " she said .
" and then suddenly , two men came in and the interview was finished . "
jana said the men dragged her out of the office and when she resisted , they became extremely violent .
" i was raped and beaten many times , " she said .
" afterwards , i was taken to some place , blindfolded and repeatedly raped and drugged with heroin for a few days . "
later , jana said she began to receive clients – between six and 10 each day for four months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-trafficking poster from moldova prevention and punishment after her escape in 2005 , jana became an advocate against trafficking .
human rights organizations say a variety of approaches are needed to tackle the issue , including information campaigns to help prevent trafficking .
experts and survivors agree that more work must be done to provide legal assistance and protection for the victims – and to make sure that perpetrators are the ones who are prosecuted and punished for their crimes . author : lisa schlein -lrb- arp -rrb- editor : anke rasper send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 23.08.2010 twenty years ago the gdr parliament voted to join the federal republic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last prime minister of the gdr , lothar de maiziere the night of aug .
22 1990 is one of the most historic in german post-war history .
after four decades of division , the decision was made by the east german parliament to united with west germany on oct .
3 , 1990 . after a night-long discussion , that ended in the early hours of aug .
23 , 1990 , the decision was made for the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- to be absorbed into the federal republic of germany -lrb- frg -rrb- .
at a special session of the east german parliament , the volkskammer , the representatives voted to merge with the west .
instead of a brand new constitution to cover the new unified state , it was decided to just incorporate the gdr under the existing constitution .
the former east was incorporated into the west under article 23 of the federal republic 's basic law .
heavy debates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly elected parliament effectively voted to disband itself in 1990 on 18 mar . , the people of the gdr had held the first democratic elections for the volkskammer .
the main aim of this new parliament was to prepare for accession to the federal republic .
by the summer of 1990 , the gdr and frg had created a single economic zone , with the deutschmark being used as the sole currency .
the gdr had also adopted large aspects of the economic and legal systems of the west .
by august , not a single meeting of the volkskammer passed without the subject of ' immediate accession ' being discussed .
for the then-prime minister of the gdr , lothar de maiziere , the time had come to seize the initiative .
" after a regular session in the afternoon of aug .
22 , " he recalled , " -lsb- we decided -rsb- to carry on with a special session with the sole agenda item of setting a timeline for german reunification . "
although it had been thought best to implement a speedy accession , not all parliamentarians were in agreement with the prime minister .
wolfgang ullman , a representative from the alliance 90 party urged de maiziere to stop proceedings .
ullman said he would report him to the prosecutor general of the gdr for high treason .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ullman -lrb- r . -rrb- did not agree with de maiziere 's approach however , a little later , the premier of the east german state of saxony-anhalt , reinhard hoeppner , opened the special session .
searching for the right date full discussions began immediately , with lothar de maiziere making the formal request to join with the federal republic but giving no specific date .
he proposed some time before october , as it would be the 41st anniversary of the gdr on oct .
14 , and he felt this date was symbolic .
" i thought that we could have the first free unified national elections on the oct .
14 , " de maiziere said .
" taking power back from the sovereign body and giving it to the new parliament . "
however it soon became clear that de maiziere 's date would not find a majority .
except for the successor party to the east german ruling sed , the pds -lrb- party for democratic socialism -rrb- , no one wanted to experience the 41st anniversary of the gdr a week early .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse was a member of the gdr parliament in 1990 after a long debate , another solution was offered by wolfgang thierse , a representative of the spd in the chamber .
he suggested a ' two-plus-four ' approach .
terms and conditions since may , the ' two-plus-four ' talks had been held between the two german foreign ministers and their four counterparts from the victorious allied nations .
the discussions centred on the allies withdrawing their troops and rights from germany .
the talks were due to come to a close on sept .
12 , in moscow .
wolfgang thierse suggested a date following this meeting on sept .
13 to be the official accession day .
however it was thought that this timeline too would not reach approval .
" it was clear that by sept .
12 , the ' two plus four ' contract would not be ratified , " lothar de maiziere said .
the final reunification date of oct .
3 , 1990 , came to be decided because it coincided with an international foreign ministers ' conference in new york on oct .
1 , .
the foreign ministers from the allied countries said they wished to withdraw their troops from the parts of germany they were occupying on oct .
3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two german foreign ministers : gdr 's markus meckel -lrb- l . -rrb- and frg 's hans-dietrich genscher " this is how the date of oct .
3 came about , " recalled de maiziere .
a special day for lothar de maiziere , the date of oct .
3 is a truly special one .
by then , the 50-year-old had spent half his life in the gdr and was touched by the socialist state .
" regardless of whether rejects or disowns the system , there is still a sense of loyalty to it , " he said .
therefore for de maiziere and for many others from the gdr , " this new beginning is not easy . "
however he added that for all politicians elected to the chamber of the people , it was clear that " our main purpose was to abolish ourselves . "

the nuclear industry is already contesting planned taxes against it . the german government is preparing to impose a further charge on the nation 's nuclear industry , in addition to the planned fuel rod tax .
" there will be a charge - yes , even on top of the fuel rod tax , " hermann groehe , general secretary of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat party , said on monday .
speaking after a meeting of the cdu presidium , groehe said there was popular consent within the party that the nuclear industry should make a stronger contribution to investment in renewable energy sources .
groehe said that the method of levying funds would not yet be clear , but that the tax would be " substantial . "
germany 's nuclear power providers stand to benefit from coalition plans to extend the lifetime of nuclear plants past the 2020 deadline set by gerhard schroeder 's government .
chancellor merkel defended the planned fuel rod tax , worth 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.9 billion -rrb- per year from 2011 , in an interview with the bild am sonntag weekly newspaper .
several of germany 's energy giants had reacted with outrage after hearing of the proposals .
government spokesman stefen seibert confirmed on monday that final details of the energy plan will be worked out by the end of september .

however , police say the damage was not motivated by any anti-german feeling . a world war i cemetery for german soldiers in northeastern france has been desecrated by vandals , local police said on sunday .
drunken youths broke and uprooted 72 grave crosses and damaged one jewish stele at the cemetery in laon , in the picardy region .
two young men , aged 18 and 19 and already known to police , were arrested .
eyewitnesses reported that there were four culprits in total , who had damaged graves by hurtling around the graveyard on motorbikes .
" there is no xenophobic aspect to these deeds , only acts of alcoholism , " the regional police authority said .
" these desecrations do not appear to be anti-german in nature . "
around 3,500 people are buried at the champ-de-manoeuvre cemetery , many of whom are german soldiers who fell in battle between 1914 and 1918 , or were patients at the nearby german military hospitals which remained in operation until 1920 .

22 1990 is one of the most historic in german post-war history .
after four decades of division , the decision was made by the east german parliament to united with west germany on oct .
3 , 1990 . after a night-long discussion , that ended in the early hours of aug .
23 , 1990 , the decision was made for the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- to be absorbed into the federal republic of germany -lrb- frg -rrb- .
at a special session of the east german parliament , the volkskammer , the representatives voted to merge with the west .
instead of a brand new constitution to cover the new unified state , it was decided to just incorporate the gdr under the existing constitution .
the former east was incorporated into the west under article 23 of the federal republic 's basic law .
heavy debates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly elected parliament effectively voted to disband itself in 1990 on 18 mar . , the people of the gdr had held the first democratic elections for the volkskammer .
the main aim of this new parliament was to prepare for accession to the federal republic .
by the summer of 1990 , the gdr and frg had created a single economic zone , with the deutschmark being used as the sole currency .
the gdr had also adopted large aspects of the economic and legal systems of the west .
by august , not a single meeting of the volkskammer passed without the subject of ' immediate accession ' being discussed .
for the then-prime minister of the gdr , lothar de maiziere , the time had come to seize the initiative .
" after a regular session in the afternoon of aug .
22 , " he recalled , " -lsb- we decided -rsb- to carry on with a special session with the sole agenda item of setting a timeline for german reunification . "
although it had been thought best to implement a speedy accession , not all parliamentarians were in agreement with the prime minister .
wolfgang ullman , a representative from the alliance 90 party urged de maiziere to stop proceedings .
ullman said he would report him to the prosecutor general of the gdr for high treason .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ullman -lrb- r . -rrb- did not agree with de maiziere 's approach however , a little later , the premier of the east german state of saxony-anhalt , reinhard hoeppner , opened the special session .
searching for the right date full discussions began immediately , with lothar de maiziere making the formal request to join with the federal republic but giving no specific date .
he proposed some time before october , as it would be the 41st anniversary of the gdr on oct .
14 , and he felt this date was symbolic .
" i thought that we could have the first free unified national elections on the oct .
14 , " de maiziere said .
" taking power back from the sovereign body and giving it to the new parliament . "
however it soon became clear that de maiziere 's date would not find a majority .
except for the successor party to the east german ruling sed , the pds -lrb- party for democratic socialism -rrb- , no one wanted to experience the 41st anniversary of the gdr a week early .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse was a member of the gdr parliament in 1990 after a long debate , another solution was offered by wolfgang thierse , a representative of the spd in the chamber .
he suggested a ' two-plus-four ' approach .
terms and conditions since may , the ' two-plus-four ' talks had been held between the two german foreign ministers and their four counterparts from the victorious allied nations .
the discussions centred on the allies withdrawing their troops and rights from germany .
the talks were due to come to a close on sept .
12 , in moscow .
wolfgang thierse suggested a date following this meeting on sept .
13 to be the official accession day .
however it was thought that this timeline too would not reach approval .
" it was clear that by sept .
12 , the ' two plus four ' contract would not be ratified , " lothar de maiziere said .
the final reunification date of oct .
3 , 1990 , came to be decided because it coincided with an international foreign ministers ' conference in new york on oct .
1 , .
the foreign ministers from the allied countries said they wished to withdraw their troops from the parts of germany they were occupying on oct .
3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two german foreign ministers : gdr 's markus meckel -lrb- l . -rrb- and frg 's hans-dietrich genscher " this is how the date of oct .
3 came about , " recalled de maiziere .
a special day for lothar de maiziere , the date of oct .
3 is a truly special one .
by then , the 50-year-old had spent half his life in the gdr and was touched by the socialist state .
" regardless of whether rejects or disowns the system , there is still a sense of loyalty to it , " he said .
therefore for de maiziere and for many others from the gdr , " this new beginning is not easy . "
however he added that for all politicians elected to the chamber of the people , it was clear that " our main purpose was to abolish ourselves . "

most of the 350,000 inhabitants have already been evacuated but the floods threaten to wreak havoc . as more towns are under imminent threat of flooding and the authorities battle with heavy monsoon rains , there are millions of people in emergency camps who are in desperate need of relief . the german commissioner for humanitarian aid markus loening recently visited the flooded areas of pakistan and got a first-hand insight into the goings on at two camps . " it 's worst for the children , " he told deutsche welle .
" there are very many women with young children .
the estimates are that 90,000 babies are going to be born in the coming weeks and that a third of them are at acute risk of not surviving the first days .
these women are in very rudimentary tents .
they can see down onto their flooded villages .
it 's all very shocking . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 350,000 people have been evacuated from shadadkot in sindh millions are in need of basic supplies concern that there could be an outbreak of disease , including typhoid , hepatitis and cholera continues to grow .
loening said that medical aid was crucial but that many people still needed just the basics . " some six million people need emergency help , they need food to survive .
the children get biscuits .
poland has donated biscuits .
we could also donate them .
children can survive on them because they are high-energy biscuits .
they are being distributed there .
baby food is also being distributed .
if they get that , they can survive one , two or three days .
food and clean water are what ’ s most important at the moment , " loening said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is not enough food for everyone at the relief camps he added that the cost of such products is low but that the sheer numbers of people needing supplies is making deliveries logistically difficult . the world food program has reached over a million people .
it has called for more helicopters to get food to people who remain isolated by the high flood waters . loening dispelled doubts that donations were not going to the right places .
he said that all the donations to german organizations were going " one-to-one " to the people who needed it . donor fatigue in pakistan and abroad if the west has been criticized for its sluggish response to the floods and a form of donor fatigue , the pakistani population 's distrust of the weak civilian government has reportedly also had a negative impact on donations from pakistanis themselves . " this trust deficit has created a situation where the people are not coming forward , " said tayyab siddique , a pakistani political expert . the army on the other hand has received much praise for its relief operations , although political expert ayesha siddika explained there was some marketing going on : " it ' not the way they 're doing work .
it 's how their work is being presented . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tents in the emergency camps are very rudimentary observers do not predict , however , that the political situation will change much as a result of this image-boosting , as it is widely thought that the military already holds the power behind the scenes . nor do they think the taliban will benefit unduly as their emergency relief operations are reportedly as chaotic as those of the authorities . positive for pakistani-west relations however , ayesha siddika believes that the way the floods are handled by the west could have a positive impact : " the more the west helps , it will be , i mean one of the spin offs will be of course improvement of relations , doing away with misunderstandings .

22 1990 is one of the most historic in german post-war history .
after four decades of division , the decision was made by the east german parliament to united with west germany on oct .
3 , 1990 . after a night-long discussion , that ended in the early hours of aug .
23 , 1990 , the decision was made for the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- to be absorbed into the federal republic of germany -lrb- frg -rrb- .
at a special session of the east german parliament , the volkskammer , the representatives voted to merge with the west .
instead of a brand new constitution to cover the new unified state , it was decided to just incorporate the gdr under the existing constitution .
the former east was incorporated into the west under article 23 of the federal republic 's basic law .
heavy debates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly elected parliament effectively voted to disband itself in 1990 on 18 mar . , the people of the gdr had held the first democratic elections for the volkskammer .
the main aim of this new parliament was to prepare for accession to the federal republic .
by the summer of 1990 , the gdr and frg had created a single economic zone , with the deutschmark being used as the sole currency .
the gdr had also adopted large aspects of the economic and legal systems of the west .
by august , not a single meeting of the volkskammer passed without the subject of ' immediate accession ' being discussed .
for the then-prime minister of the gdr , lothar de maiziere , the time had come to seize the initiative .
" after a regular session in the afternoon of aug .
22 , " he recalled , " -lsb- we decided -rsb- to carry on with a special session with the sole agenda item of setting a timeline for german reunification . "
although it had been thought best to implement a speedy accession , not all parliamentarians were in agreement with the prime minister .
wolfgang ullman , a representative from the alliance 90 party urged de maiziere to stop proceedings .
ullman said he would report him to the prosecutor general of the gdr for high treason .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ullman -lrb- r . -rrb- did not agree with de maiziere 's approach however , a little later , the premier of the east german state of saxony-anhalt , reinhard hoeppner , opened the special session .
searching for the right date full discussions began immediately , with lothar de maiziere making the formal request to join with the federal republic but giving no specific date .
he proposed some time before october , as it would be the 41st anniversary of the gdr on oct .
14 , and he felt this date was symbolic .
" i thought that we could have the first free unified national elections on the oct .
14 , " de maiziere said .
" taking power back from the sovereign body and giving it to the new parliament . "
however it soon became clear that de maiziere 's date would not find a majority .
except for the successor party to the east german ruling sed , the pds -lrb- party for democratic socialism -rrb- , no one wanted to experience the 41st anniversary of the gdr a week early .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse was a member of the gdr parliament in 1990 after a long debate , another solution was offered by wolfgang thierse , a representative of the spd in the chamber .
he suggested a ' two-plus-four ' approach .
terms and conditions since may , the ' two-plus-four ' talks had been held between the two german foreign ministers and their four counterparts from the victorious allied nations .
the discussions centred on the allies withdrawing their troops and rights from germany .
the talks were due to come to a close on sept .
12 , in moscow .
wolfgang thierse suggested a date following this meeting on sept .
13 to be the official accession day .
however it was thought that this timeline too would not reach approval .
" it was clear that by sept .
12 , the ' two plus four ' contract would not be ratified , " lothar de maiziere said .
the final reunification date of oct .
3 , 1990 , came to be decided because it coincided with an international foreign ministers ' conference in new york on oct .
1 , .
the foreign ministers from the allied countries said they wished to withdraw their troops from the parts of germany they were occupying on oct .
3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two german foreign ministers : gdr 's markus meckel -lrb- l . -rrb- and frg 's hans-dietrich genscher " this is how the date of oct .
3 came about , " recalled de maiziere .
a special day for lothar de maiziere , the date of oct .
3 is a truly special one .
by then , the 50-year-old had spent half his life in the gdr and was touched by the socialist state .
" regardless of whether rejects or disowns the system , there is still a sense of loyalty to it , " he said .
therefore for de maiziere and for many others from the gdr , " this new beginning is not easy . "
however he added that for all politicians elected to the chamber of the people , it was clear that " our main purpose was to abolish ourselves . "

22 1990 is one of the most historic in german post-war history .
after four decades of division , the decision was made by the east german parliament to united with west germany on oct .
3 , 1990 . after a night-long discussion , that ended in the early hours of aug .
23 , 1990 , the decision was made for the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- to be absorbed into the federal republic of germany -lrb- frg -rrb- .
at a special session of the east german parliament , the volkskammer , the representatives voted to merge with the west .
instead of a brand new constitution to cover the new unified state , it was decided to just incorporate the gdr under the existing constitution .
the former east was incorporated into the west under article 23 of the federal republic 's basic law .
heavy debates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly elected parliament effectively voted to disband itself in 1990 on 18 mar . , the people of the gdr had held the first democratic elections for the volkskammer .
the main aim of this new parliament was to prepare for accession to the federal republic .
by the summer of 1990 , the gdr and frg had created a single economic zone , with the deutschmark being used as the sole currency .
the gdr had also adopted large aspects of the economic and legal systems of the west .
by august , not a single meeting of the volkskammer passed without the subject of ' immediate accession ' being discussed .
for the then-prime minister of the gdr , lothar de maiziere , the time had come to seize the initiative .
" after a regular session in the afternoon of aug .
22 , " he recalled , " -lsb- we decided -rsb- to carry on with a special session with the sole agenda item of setting a timeline for german reunification . "
although it had been thought best to implement a speedy accession , not all parliamentarians were in agreement with the prime minister .
wolfgang ullman , a representative from the alliance 90 party urged de maiziere to stop proceedings .
ullman said he would report him to the prosecutor general of the gdr for high treason .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ullman -lrb- r . -rrb- did not agree with de maiziere 's approach however , a little later , the premier of the east german state of saxony-anhalt , reinhard hoeppner , opened the special session .
searching for the right date full discussions began immediately , with lothar de maiziere making the formal request to join with the federal republic but giving no specific date .
he proposed some time before october , as it would be the 41st anniversary of the gdr on oct .
14 , and he felt this date was symbolic .
" i thought that we could have the first free unified national elections on the oct .
14 , " de maiziere said .
" taking power back from the sovereign body and giving it to the new parliament . "
however it soon became clear that de maiziere 's date would not find a majority .
except for the successor party to the east german ruling sed , the pds -lrb- party for democratic socialism -rrb- , no one wanted to experience the 41st anniversary of the gdr a week early .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse was a member of the gdr parliament in 1990 after a long debate , another solution was offered by wolfgang thierse , a representative of the spd in the chamber .
he suggested a ' two-plus-four ' approach .
terms and conditions since may , the ' two-plus-four ' talks had been held between the two german foreign ministers and their four counterparts from the victorious allied nations .
the discussions centred on the allies withdrawing their troops and rights from germany .
the talks were due to come to a close on sept .
12 , in moscow .
wolfgang thierse suggested a date following this meeting on sept .
13 to be the official accession day .
however it was thought that this timeline too would not reach approval .
" it was clear that by sept .
12 , the ' two plus four ' contract would not be ratified , " lothar de maiziere said .
the final reunification date of oct .
3 , 1990 , came to be decided because it coincided with an international foreign ministers ' conference in new york on oct .
1 , .
the foreign ministers from the allied countries said they wished to withdraw their troops from the parts of germany they were occupying on oct .
3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two german foreign ministers : gdr 's markus meckel -lrb- l . -rrb- and frg 's hans-dietrich genscher " this is how the date of oct .
3 came about , " recalled de maiziere .
a special day for lothar de maiziere , the date of oct .
3 is a truly special one .
by then , the 50-year-old had spent half his life in the gdr and was touched by the socialist state .
" regardless of whether rejects or disowns the system , there is still a sense of loyalty to it , " he said .
therefore for de maiziere and for many others from the gdr , " this new beginning is not easy . "
however he added that for all politicians elected to the chamber of the people , it was clear that " our main purpose was to abolish ourselves . "

" the problem is that the law is unfair .
there 's a trend in germany and elsewhere for people to have more than one nationality , " said marei pelzer , legal consultant for pro asyl , an organization that focuses on the rights of refugees and immigrants .
" we already have 4.5 million people in germany with more than one nationality , around 53 percent of those being granted german citizenship have dual nationality , " she told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ngos : more than one nationality is becoming the norm duty to choose pro asyl as well as two fellow ngos , the intercultural council and the german bar association , have called for an overhaul of the current regulation , which dates back to the year 2000 .
it forces anyone born in germany after 1990 with non-german parents to either become german or take his or her parents ' citizenship when they turn 18 .
they have until the age of 21 to make a final decision , meaning the first batch of young people will have to make that decision next year .
being born in germany gives them the right to german citizenship , but only if they give up their parents ' nationality by the time they turn 21 .
this so-called ' duty to choose ' , which is unique to germany , is controversial , not least because there are countries , like iran , morocco , afghanistan and some latin american countries , which do not allow citizens to give up their nationality , so in those cases , dual nationality is already being granted , which creates what the ngos call a two-class system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some countries do n't allow citizens to give up their nationality parliament debate prior to 2000 , the rules were even stricter - there was no automatic right to german citizenship , simply because someone was born in the country .
in the autumn , the german parliament will debate a bill introduced by the opposition parties , the social democrats and the greens , which calls for the restrictions on dual citizenship to be abolished .
but many members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party argue that citizenship is a question of loyalty .
" he or she has to accept german citizenship , that is all we 're asking in terms of integration , " reinhard grindel , home affairs expert of the christian democrats in parliament , told german public radio deutschlandradio kultur .
" but that is non-negotiable .
we 're asking for a certain degree of commitment to our country and its laws and values , we do n't think that 's too much to ask , " he said .
" old-fashioned and undemocratic " pro asyl , however , believes the government needs to modernize its understanding of nationality , if it is to be respected internationally .
" the government needs to recognize the signs of the times , it should not just preach the need for integration , but instead focus on creating the legal basis for a modern immigration state , " pelzer told deutsche welle .
" there are 82 million people in germany , 6.7 million of those are not german nationals and 1.3 million were born here , but still do n't have german citizenship .
that 's a problem for democracy , if people live here , but do n't have the right to vote for example , " she added .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse was a member of the gdr parliament in 1990 after a long debate , another solution was offered by wolfgang thierse , a representative of the spd in the chamber .
he suggested a ' two-plus-four ' approach .
terms and conditions since may , the ' two-plus-four ' talks had been held between the two german foreign ministers and their four counterparts from the victorious allied nations .
the discussions centred on the allies withdrawing their troops and rights from germany .
the talks were due to come to a close on sept .
12 , in moscow .
wolfgang thierse suggested a date following this meeting on sept .
13 to be the official accession day .
however it was thought that this timeline too would not reach approval .
" it was clear that by sept .
12 , the ' two plus four ' contract would not be ratified , " lothar de maiziere said .
the final reunification date of oct .
3 , 1990 , came to be decided because it coincided with an international foreign ministers ' conference in new york on oct .
1 , .
the foreign ministers from the allied countries said they wished to withdraw their troops from the parts of germany they were occupying on oct .
3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two german foreign ministers : gdr 's markus meckel -lrb- l . -rrb- and frg 's hans-dietrich genscher " this is how the date of oct .
3 came about , " recalled de maiziere .
a special day for lothar de maiziere , the date of oct .
3 is a truly special one .
by then , the 50-year-old had spent half his life in the gdr and was touched by the socialist state .
" regardless of whether rejects or disowns the system , there is still a sense of loyalty to it , " he said .
therefore for de maiziere and for many others from the gdr , " this new beginning is not easy . "
however he added that for all politicians elected to the chamber of the people , it was clear that " our main purpose was to abolish ourselves . "

human trafficking is the fastest-growing source of profit for organized crime . the united nations declared august 23 an international day of remembrance for the abolition of slavery .
but the trade in human beings is an ongoing problem around the world .
compared to the drugs and arms trades , however , it is more difficult to track down perpetrators in the multibillion-dollar trafficking business .
victims of forced labor and sexual exploitation are not always identified as such and can even face unjust criminal prosecution themselves .
the international organization for migration estimates that between 700,000 to 4 million people are trafficked across national borders every year .
but iom spokesman jean philippe chauzy said the secret nature of the trade means no one knows exactly how many people are trafficked worldwide .
" human trafficking , either for sexual or labor exploitation , is truly a global phenomenon , " he said .
" there are no regions of the world that are not affected by trafficking . "
millions of men , women and children who leave home in search of better socio-economic prospects are vulnerable to exploitation – and chauzy said this migration " feeds trafficking . "
" because there are so few opportunities for people to migrate legally , they will tend to take risks and go through so-called intermediaries , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte awino was kidnapped by the lord 's resistance army in uganda " and in many cases , unfortunately , they find themselves in situations of exploitation . "
a voice for the voiceless charlotte awino was held as a sex slave for eight years .
when she recently talked to the un humans rights council in geneva , she said she came as a representive for those exploited and left voiceless by human trafficking .
awino called on the international community to help the victims .
" no one is there for them , " she said .
" and , nothing is being done , even if they escape back home . "
awino was 14 years old when the ugandan rebel lord 's resistance army abducted her from her boarding school in 1996 .
" we were taken away from the school campus heading nowhere , walking the whole time , " she said .
awino claimed she was taken to southern sudan , where victims were raped and beaten and forced to work in the gardens and carry luggage .
she said those caught trying to escape were killed .
awino was 22 years old and had two children by the time she managed to escape . a global problem sexual exploitation has been affecting women in countries around the world – including western europe and the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are sold into prostitution in many countries kikka cerpa was forced into a life of prostitution after her boyfriend persuaded her to leave venezuela and go to new york in 1992 .
" i went to the united states thinking that i was going to be working as a nanny , and i ended up being a prostitute , not by choice , " she said .
cerpa said she was beaten and raped and spent three years working in the sex trade to pay off her boyfriend 's debts . a customer helped cerpa escape but then then forced her to become his personal slave . she lived with him for 10 years and had two daughters .
" i could never leave him because every time that i tried to leave , he said that he would use my criminal conviction and he would have me deported from the united states and i would never visit my daughters anymore , " she said .
with the help of an organization called sanctuary for families , cerpa managed to free herself from the pimps and madams who had controlled her life .
she sought a court order of protection after her escape , but her daughters were taken away from her and she was accused of being a criminal . exploited for labor though sex trafficking has generally attracted the most international media attention , labor exploitation is also prevalent on a global scale .
the international organization for migration reports that millions of women , men and children are forced to work in sweatshops , construction , agriculture , as street beggars and in other hazardous jobs for little or no pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imo says victims of labor trafficking may be forced to work as street beggars kumar ramjali was duped with the promise of a good job with good money .
he said a jordanian company recruited him in his native nepal in 2004 to work in the united states .
but instead , ramjali was sent to iraq , where he was forced to work at a us military base against his will . he said his passport was confiscated and he was not allowed to leave for four years .
jana , a 30-year-old bosnian national , also fell victim to an employment scam .
after moving to to slovenia to continue her studies , she attended a job interview with an accounting firm arranged by a newly made female friend .
" the first 10 minutes looked pretty normal , like a normal office and a woman was there interviewing me , " she said .
" and then suddenly , two men came in and the interview was finished . "
jana said the men dragged her out of the office and when she resisted , they became extremely violent .
" i was raped and beaten many times , " she said .
" afterwards , i was taken to some place , blindfolded and repeatedly raped and drugged with heroin for a few days . "
later , jana said she began to receive clients – between six and 10 each day for four months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-trafficking poster from moldova prevention and punishment after her escape in 2005 , jana became an advocate against trafficking .
human rights organizations say a variety of approaches are needed to tackle the issue , including information campaigns to help prevent trafficking .

as the debate over the future of nuclear power in germany heats up , greenpeace is accusing the government of defying a law mandating the release of the next monitoring report on security of the country 's energy supply . greenpeace germany took legal action monday against the federal ministry of economics for failing to release a report detailing key information on the country 's future energy needs ahead of last month 's deadline .
the complaint was lodged in a berlin administrative court .
under germany 's energy industry law -lrb- enwg -rrb- , the economics ministry is required to publish a monitoring report on the future of the country 's energy supply every two years and present the information to the european commission .
the deadline for the 2010 report was july 31 .
" to our surprise and disappointment , this report was not presented , and it was not submitted to the european commission in brussels , " greenpeace energy expert tobias münchmeyer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace has long campaigned against atomic energy the future of nuclear the data contained in the report is expected to further clarify a subject of intense political debate in germany : whether the country can meet its future electricity needs without nuclear power .
germany 's ruling coalition under chancellor angela merkel supports extending the operating lives of nuclear reactors beyond the 2022 shut-down deadline passed by the previous social democrat-led government .
münchmeyer said greenpeace believed the ministry , led by minister rainer brüderle , delayed the report 's release " in order to manipulate the current debate on energy supply in germany . "
a statement from the german economics ministry blamed the hold-up on outside problems .
" publication of the federal ministry of economics monitoring report on the security of supply in the electrical industry is postponed until fall 2010 , due to external assessment delays involving the preparation of energy scenarios for the german government 's energy policy , " a ministry spokesman told deutsche welle .
ahead of government plans to craft a long-term energy strategy by the end of september , the economics ministry commissioned several institutions with developing different energy scenarios for the future .

"
german utilities companies have warned that the country could face an electricity shortage if plans for a nuclear phase-out go through - a claim that greenpeace , a long-term opponent of atomic power , disputes .
" the last report from 2008 has clearly shown that there is no risk of running a deficit in the electricity supply , " münchmeyer said , adding that the 2010 monitoring document would further support that point .

the total number of soldiers will be cut to around 165,000 , with compulsory service practically abolished . defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg presented his draft plans for the future of the german army to government ministers on monday .
the model guttenberg unveiled will see the present 252,000 soldiers cut to 163,500 over the next few years , a reduction of around a third .
conscription will be suspended in the short term , with young men no longer called up to do compulsory service .
but guttenberg stressed that it was important conscription retains its place in the constitution , in case it becomes viable again in the future .
" by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better , " guttenberg said after discussing his proposals with coalition partners .
knock-on effects the chosen model would mean a reduction in the professional standing army from around 195,000 soldiers to 156,000 .
the cuts mean that the army would be left with three tank battalions , two artillery battalions and one paratrooper regiment .
the civilian service alternative to military conscription , an important provider of labor to germany 's care homes , will also be suspended .
family minister kristina schroeder proposed on monday to introduce a national voluntary community service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has conscripted young men into its armed forces since 1957 " i 'm not giving myself hope that we can completely replace what we have now , " schroeder told reporters in berlin .
but she celebrated the fact that women would be able to perform community service for the first time .
the proposal to suspend rather than scrap conscription altogether postpones a contentious debate that has been bedevilling chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition in recent weeks .
merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- sees itself as a staunch defender of compulsory military service , though its military impracticality and high cost have long threatened the ideal of a ' citizen 's army . '
' voluntary conscription ' guttenberg , of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , hopes to mollify his party colleagues with the new " voluntary military service " model , which he says represents " a modern variation for the citizen to take on responsibility . "
the government is hoping to attract volunteers to sign on to this new scheme for up to 23 months by promising driver 's licenses , university places and other fringe benefits .
women would be included amongst an estimated 7,500 army volunteers .
" not enough to safeguard the regeneration of the troops with up-and-coming soldiers , " criticized ulrich kirsch , head of the armed forces association .
the defense ministry is aiming to cut some 8.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- off its budget over the next four years , though guttenberg warned that savings in new armament projects would also be needed .

as the debate over the future of nuclear power in germany heats up , greenpeace is accusing the government of defying a law mandating the release of the next monitoring report on security of the country 's energy supply . greenpeace germany took legal action monday against the federal ministry of economics for failing to release a report detailing key information on the country 's future energy needs ahead of last month 's deadline .
the complaint was lodged in a berlin administrative court .
under germany 's energy industry law -lrb- enwg -rrb- , the economics ministry is required to publish a monitoring report on the future of the country 's energy supply every two years and present the information to the european commission .
the deadline for the 2010 report was july 31 .
" to our surprise and disappointment , this report was not presented , and it was not submitted to the european commission in brussels , " greenpeace energy expert tobias münchmeyer told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace has long campaigned against atomic energy the future of nuclear the data contained in the report is expected to further clarify a subject of intense political debate in germany : whether the country can meet its future electricity needs without nuclear power .
germany 's ruling coalition under chancellor angela merkel supports extending the operating lives of nuclear reactors beyond the 2022 shut-down deadline passed by the previous social democrat-led government .
münchmeyer said greenpeace believed the ministry , led by minister rainer brüderle , delayed the report 's release " in order to manipulate the current debate on energy supply in germany . "
a statement from the german economics ministry blamed the hold-up on outside problems .
" publication of the federal ministry of economics monitoring report on the security of supply in the electrical industry is postponed until fall 2010 , due to external assessment delays involving the preparation of energy scenarios for the german government 's energy policy , " a ministry spokesman told deutsche welle .

as the debate over the future of nuclear power in germany heats up , greenpeace is accusing the government of defying a law mandating the release of the next monitoring report on security of the country 's energy supply . greenpeace germany took legal action monday against the federal ministry of economics for failing to release a report detailing key information on the country 's future energy needs ahead of last month 's deadline .
the complaint was lodged in a berlin administrative court .
under germany 's energy industry law -lrb- enwg -rrb- , the economics ministry is required to publish a monitoring report on the future of the country 's energy supply every two years and present the information to the european commission .
the deadline for the 2010 report was july 31 .
" to our surprise and disappointment , this report was not presented , and it was not submitted to the european commission in brussels , " greenpeace energy expert tobias münchmeyer told deutsche welle .

münchmeyer said greenpeace believed the ministry , led by minister rainer brüderle , delayed the report 's release " in order to manipulate the current debate on energy supply in germany . "
a statement from the german economics ministry blamed the hold-up on outside problems .

the total number of soldiers will be cut to around 165,000 , with compulsory service practically abolished . defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg presented his draft plans for the future of the german army to government ministers on monday .
the model guttenberg unveiled will see the present 252,000 soldiers cut to 163,500 over the next few years , a reduction of around a third .
conscription will be suspended in the short term , with young men no longer called up to do compulsory service .
but guttenberg stressed that it was important conscription retains its place in the constitution , in case it becomes viable again in the future .
" by the end of the year it ought to become clear that the bundeswehr will become smaller , but better , " guttenberg said after discussing his proposals with coalition partners .
knock-on effects the chosen model would mean a reduction in the professional standing army from around 195,000 soldiers to 156,000 .
the cuts mean that the army would be left with three tank battalions , two artillery battalions and one paratrooper regiment .
the civilian service alternative to military conscription , an important provider of labor to germany 's care homes , will also be suspended .
family minister kristina schroeder proposed on monday to introduce a national voluntary community service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has conscripted young men into its armed forces since 1957 " i 'm not giving myself hope that we can completely replace what we have now , " schroeder told reporters in berlin .
but she celebrated the fact that women would be able to perform community service for the first time .
the proposal to suspend rather than scrap conscription altogether postpones a contentious debate that has been bedevilling chancellor angela merkel 's ruling coalition in recent weeks .
merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- sees itself as a staunch defender of compulsory military service , though its military impracticality and high cost have long threatened the ideal of a ' citizen 's army . '
' voluntary conscription ' guttenberg , of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , hopes to mollify his party colleagues with the new " voluntary military service " model , which he says represents " a modern variation for the citizen to take on responsibility . "
the government is hoping to attract volunteers to sign on to this new scheme for up to 23 months by promising driver 's licenses , university places and other fringe benefits .
women would be included amongst an estimated 7,500 army volunteers .
" not enough to safeguard the regeneration of the troops with up-and-coming soldiers , " criticized ulrich kirsch , head of the armed forces association .
the defense ministry is aiming to cut some 8.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.6 billion -rrb- off its budget over the next four years , though guttenberg warned that savings in new armament projects would also be needed .

merkel said that a change was needed in the way members of her government behaved . chancellor angela merkel said that apparent disunity within her ruling center-right coalition was to blame for a dip in voter approval ratings for member parties .
in an interview with the public television station zdf , merkel said that her government needed to make tough decisions .
however , she said the nature of discussion within the coalition - which has been accused of excessive bickering - was partly responsible for alienating the electorate .
" i think we have n't managed to reach people partly because the confusion of voices and the way we have treated each other have not been what is to be expected of us , " merkel said , adding that the situation needed to be improved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coalition parties have lost ground since the election last year in the interview on sunday , merkel said that her government could be particularly satisfied with its record on the economy .
the chancellor said she was confident about regaining opinion poll approval as soon as important decisions facing the country had been made , by the end of the year .
questions to be answered merkel said financial stability , health , education for the children of welfare recipients , energy policy and reforms to the military were her government 's top priorities .
the chancellor said that she believed that after these decisions were taken , voters would understand that germany was " better equipped for the future . "
in the interview following her vacation in italy , merkel reaffirmed her commitment to introducing a tax on nuclear power providers , despite objections from the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is open to a suspension of compulsory military service the chancellor also said she was open to a suspension of germany 's compulsory military service .
both issues have been the subject of heated debate within the coalition .
in an opinion poll released last week , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- moved ahead of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who along with bavarian sister party the csu share power with the liberal free democrats fdp .
the spd had 32 percent support compared to 31 percent for the cdu and csu in the poll conducted by germany 's allensbach institute .
the fdp had just six percent .
the result contrasts with the general election in september 2009 when the cdu and csu won almost 34 percent of the popular vote , and the fdp almost 15 percent , compared with 23 percent for the spd .

but as deutsche welle found out , there are certain questions he hates answering . armin veh has one of the better resumes in the bundesliga .
he 's coached three different lower-league teams to promotion and is one of only five currently active coaches to have won the first division title .
but among the elite , he 's also an outsider who gets comparatively little respect .
whereas thomas schaaf , lousis van gaal , jupp heynckes and felix magath can all feel relatively secure in their jobs , veh is anything but a sure bet to survive this season at hamburg .
hamburg got off to fine start , beating magath 's schalke in round one .
but the team has also run through nine coaches in as many years , and veh knows that loyalty is a rare commodity these days .
" coaches get fired more quickly than used to be the case , " veh told deutsche welle .
" if you do n't reach your short-term goals , it 's pretty much impossible to do any medium- or long-term work . "
veh 's career has been a roller-coaster in recent years .
appointed on an interim basis at stuttgart in the midst of the 2005-6 campaign , he won the title with the team the following season - only to be unceremoniously axed the year after .
the title established veh 's credentials , but he used up almost all of that capital in his next assignment .
do n't mention the magath bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veh 's time at wolfsburg was characterized by frustration veh visibly bristles , evading questions , when asked to comment on his short-lived tenure as felix magath 's successor at wolfsburg last season .
in retrospect , it was a very difficult task .
magath had won the title in 2008-9 , and veh had to try to sustain that success while putting his own stamp on the team .
he sought to change the wolves ' style of play and frantically rotated players as their defense revealed unexpected gaping holes .
he was fired last january after a nine-game winless streak and wolfsburg ended the season in eighth place .
that experience does n't seem to have affected veh as much as one might expect .
at hamburg , he 's continued to do things his way .
his controversial decisions include moving the team 's most productive striker , mladen petric , out to the wing , and nominating newly acquired defender heiko westermann as team captain .
" i wanted to give the team a different accent , a new accent , " veh said .
" that was the logic behind heiko westermann as captain . "
that initiative may be more suitable for hamburg than wolfsburg .
unlike wolfsburg , hamburg are not coming off the back of a triumph .
in fact , despite acquiring superstar ruud van nistelrooy and highly touted youngster eljero elia , the northern german side resolutely disappointed last season , coming in seventh .
one of veh 's first tasks is to win the support of those who were most disappointed - the fans .
overcoming skepticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening day win over schalke showed hamburg 's renewed team spirit the relationship between hamburg players and supporters totally deteriorated last season , with fans booing what they viewed as over-paid prima donnas and striker paolo guerrero retaliating by beaning one of them with a full water bottle .
it may be just diplomacy , but veh says he has n't encountered any major personality issues in the squad far .
" i have n't been able to see any signs that the team is difficult , " veh said .
" they have n't made that impression on me - although difficulties usually only arise when you do n't have success . "
truer words were never spoken .
when veh 's appointment was announced last may , the overwhelming reaction among fans was dismay .
" mediocre coach for a mediocre team , " wrote one blogger succinctly when the news broke .
" armin veh - is this a joke ? " opined another .
" but mostly likely no real coach wanted to come to hamburg , which is no wonder given how chaotic the club is . "
veh 's challenge will to be to earn the support of skeptics like these , and there 's a lot on the line .
having bombed in wolfsburg after succeeding in stuttgart , veh is unlikely ever to get another chance to coach a top bundesliga club , if he fails to attain his goals in hamburg .
veh is known as a players ' coach , and perhaps the initial win against schalke was a sign that he 's got the squad behind him .
or in could be a blip on the radar screen , and as veh knows only too well , fans of the league 's biggest and richest clubs are never content with blips . even if they have a past bundesliga title to their credit .
armin veh was interviewed by jana schaefer for dw-tv 's bundesliga kick off .
the program airs every tuesday .

22 1990 is one of the most historic in german post-war history .
after four decades of division , the decision was made by the east german parliament to united with west germany on oct .
3 , 1990 . after a night-long discussion , that ended in the early hours of aug .
23 , 1990 , the decision was made for the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- to be absorbed into the federal republic of germany -lrb- frg -rrb- .
at a special session of the east german parliament , the volkskammer , the representatives voted to merge with the west .
instead of a brand new constitution to cover the new unified state , it was decided to just incorporate the gdr under the existing constitution .
the former east was incorporated into the west under article 23 of the federal republic 's basic law .
heavy debates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly elected parliament effectively voted to disband itself in 1990 on 18 mar . , the people of the gdr had held the first democratic elections for the volkskammer .
the main aim of this new parliament was to prepare for accession to the federal republic .
by the summer of 1990 , the gdr and frg had created a single economic zone , with the deutschmark being used as the sole currency .
the gdr had also adopted large aspects of the economic and legal systems of the west .
by august , not a single meeting of the volkskammer passed without the subject of ' immediate accession ' being discussed .
for the then-prime minister of the gdr , lothar de maiziere , the time had come to seize the initiative .
" after a regular session in the afternoon of aug .
22 , " he recalled , " -lsb- we decided -rsb- to carry on with a special session with the sole agenda item of setting a timeline for german reunification . "
although it had been thought best to implement a speedy accession , not all parliamentarians were in agreement with the prime minister .
wolfgang ullman , a representative from the alliance 90 party urged de maiziere to stop proceedings .
ullman said he would report him to the prosecutor general of the gdr for high treason .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ullman -lrb- r . -rrb- did not agree with de maiziere 's approach however , a little later , the premier of the east german state of saxony-anhalt , reinhard hoeppner , opened the special session .
searching for the right date full discussions began immediately , with lothar de maiziere making the formal request to join with the federal republic but giving no specific date .
he proposed some time before october , as it would be the 41st anniversary of the gdr on oct .
14 , and he felt this date was symbolic .
" i thought that we could have the first free unified national elections on the oct .
14 , " de maiziere said .
" taking power back from the sovereign body and giving it to the new parliament . "
however it soon became clear that de maiziere 's date would not find a majority .
except for the successor party to the east german ruling sed , the pds -lrb- party for democratic socialism -rrb- , no one wanted to experience the 41st anniversary of the gdr a week early .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse was a member of the gdr parliament in 1990 after a long debate , another solution was offered by wolfgang thierse , a representative of the spd in the chamber .
he suggested a ' two-plus-four ' approach .
terms and conditions since may , the ' two-plus-four ' talks had been held between the two german foreign ministers and their four counterparts from the victorious allied nations .
the discussions centred on the allies withdrawing their troops and rights from germany .
the talks were due to come to a close on sept .
12 , in moscow .
wolfgang thierse suggested a date following this meeting on sept .
13 to be the official accession day .
however it was thought that this timeline too would not reach approval .
" it was clear that by sept .
12 , the ' two plus four ' contract would not be ratified , " lothar de maiziere said .
the final reunification date of oct .
3 , 1990 , came to be decided because it coincided with an international foreign ministers ' conference in new york on oct .
1 , .
the foreign ministers from the allied countries said they wished to withdraw their troops from the parts of germany they were occupying on oct .
3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two german foreign ministers : gdr 's markus meckel -lrb- l . -rrb- and frg 's hans-dietrich genscher " this is how the date of oct .
3 came about , " recalled de maiziere .
a special day for lothar de maiziere , the date of oct .
3 is a truly special one .
by then , the 50-year-old had spent half his life in the gdr and was touched by the socialist state .
" regardless of whether rejects or disowns the system , there is still a sense of loyalty to it , " he said .
therefore for de maiziere and for many others from the gdr , " this new beginning is not easy . "
however he added that for all politicians elected to the chamber of the people , it was clear that " our main purpose was to abolish ourselves . "

victims of forced labor and sexual exploitation are not always identified as such and can even face unjust criminal prosecution themselves .
the international organization for migration estimates that between 700,000 to 4 million people are trafficked across national borders every year .
but iom spokesman jean philippe chauzy said the secret nature of the trade means no one knows exactly how many people are trafficked worldwide .
" human trafficking , either for sexual or labor exploitation , is truly a global phenomenon , " he said .
" there are no regions of the world that are not affected by trafficking . "
millions of men , women and children who leave home in search of better socio-economic prospects are vulnerable to exploitation – and chauzy said this migration " feeds trafficking . "
" because there are so few opportunities for people to migrate legally , they will tend to take risks and go through so-called intermediaries , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte awino was kidnapped by the lord 's resistance army in uganda " and in many cases , unfortunately , they find themselves in situations of exploitation . "
a voice for the voiceless charlotte awino was held as a sex slave for eight years .
when she recently talked to the un humans rights council in geneva , she said she came as a representive for those exploited and left voiceless by human trafficking .
awino called on the international community to help the victims .
" no one is there for them , " she said .
" and , nothing is being done , even if they escape back home . "
awino was 14 years old when the ugandan rebel lord 's resistance army abducted her from her boarding school in 1996 .
" we were taken away from the school campus heading nowhere , walking the whole time , " she said .
awino claimed she was taken to southern sudan , where victims were raped and beaten and forced to work in the gardens and carry luggage .
she said those caught trying to escape were killed .
awino was 22 years old and had two children by the time she managed to escape . a global problem sexual exploitation has been affecting women in countries around the world – including western europe and the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are sold into prostitution in many countries kikka cerpa was forced into a life of prostitution after her boyfriend persuaded her to leave venezuela and go to new york in 1992 .
" i went to the united states thinking that i was going to be working as a nanny , and i ended up being a prostitute , not by choice , " she said .
cerpa said she was beaten and raped and spent three years working in the sex trade to pay off her boyfriend 's debts . a customer helped cerpa escape but then then forced her to become his personal slave . she lived with him for 10 years and had two daughters .
" i could never leave him because every time that i tried to leave , he said that he would use my criminal conviction and he would have me deported from the united states and i would never visit my daughters anymore , " she said .
with the help of an organization called sanctuary for families , cerpa managed to free herself from the pimps and madams who had controlled her life .
she sought a court order of protection after her escape , but her daughters were taken away from her and she was accused of being a criminal . exploited for labor though sex trafficking has generally attracted the most international media attention , labor exploitation is also prevalent on a global scale .
the international organization for migration reports that millions of women , men and children are forced to work in sweatshops , construction , agriculture , as street beggars and in other hazardous jobs for little or no pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imo says victims of labor trafficking may be forced to work as street beggars kumar ramjali was duped with the promise of a good job with good money .
he said a jordanian company recruited him in his native nepal in 2004 to work in the united states .
but instead , ramjali was sent to iraq , where he was forced to work at a us military base against his will . he said his passport was confiscated and he was not allowed to leave for four years .
jana , a 30-year-old bosnian national , also fell victim to an employment scam .
after moving to to slovenia to continue her studies , she attended a job interview with an accounting firm arranged by a newly made female friend .
" the first 10 minutes looked pretty normal , like a normal office and a woman was there interviewing me , " she said .
" and then suddenly , two men came in and the interview was finished . "
jana said the men dragged her out of the office and when she resisted , they became extremely violent .
" i was raped and beaten many times , " she said .
" afterwards , i was taken to some place , blindfolded and repeatedly raped and drugged with heroin for a few days . "
later , jana said she began to receive clients – between six and 10 each day for four months .

human rights organizations say a variety of approaches are needed to tackle the issue , including information campaigns to help prevent trafficking .

22 1990 is one of the most historic in german post-war history .
after four decades of division , the decision was made by the east german parliament to united with west germany on oct .
3 , 1990 . after a night-long discussion , that ended in the early hours of aug .
23 , 1990 , the decision was made for the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- to be absorbed into the federal republic of germany -lrb- frg -rrb- .
at a special session of the east german parliament , the volkskammer , the representatives voted to merge with the west .
instead of a brand new constitution to cover the new unified state , it was decided to just incorporate the gdr under the existing constitution .
the former east was incorporated into the west under article 23 of the federal republic 's basic law .
heavy debates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly elected parliament effectively voted to disband itself in 1990 on 18 mar . , the people of the gdr had held the first democratic elections for the volkskammer .
the main aim of this new parliament was to prepare for accession to the federal republic .
by the summer of 1990 , the gdr and frg had created a single economic zone , with the deutschmark being used as the sole currency .
the gdr had also adopted large aspects of the economic and legal systems of the west .
by august , not a single meeting of the volkskammer passed without the subject of ' immediate accession ' being discussed .
for the then-prime minister of the gdr , lothar de maiziere , the time had come to seize the initiative .
" after a regular session in the afternoon of aug .
22 , " he recalled , " -lsb- we decided -rsb- to carry on with a special session with the sole agenda item of setting a timeline for german reunification . "
although it had been thought best to implement a speedy accession , not all parliamentarians were in agreement with the prime minister .
wolfgang ullman , a representative from the alliance 90 party urged de maiziere to stop proceedings .
ullman said he would report him to the prosecutor general of the gdr for high treason .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ullman -lrb- r . -rrb- did not agree with de maiziere 's approach however , a little later , the premier of the east german state of saxony-anhalt , reinhard hoeppner , opened the special session .
searching for the right date full discussions began immediately , with lothar de maiziere making the formal request to join with the federal republic but giving no specific date .
he proposed some time before october , as it would be the 41st anniversary of the gdr on oct .
14 , and he felt this date was symbolic .
" i thought that we could have the first free unified national elections on the oct .
14 , " de maiziere said .
" taking power back from the sovereign body and giving it to the new parliament . "
however it soon became clear that de maiziere 's date would not find a majority .
except for the successor party to the east german ruling sed , the pds -lrb- party for democratic socialism -rrb- , no one wanted to experience the 41st anniversary of the gdr a week early .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse was a member of the gdr parliament in 1990 after a long debate , another solution was offered by wolfgang thierse , a representative of the spd in the chamber .
he suggested a ' two-plus-four ' approach .
terms and conditions since may , the ' two-plus-four ' talks had been held between the two german foreign ministers and their four counterparts from the victorious allied nations .
the discussions centred on the allies withdrawing their troops and rights from germany .
the talks were due to come to a close on sept .
12 , in moscow .
wolfgang thierse suggested a date following this meeting on sept .
13 to be the official accession day .
however it was thought that this timeline too would not reach approval .
" it was clear that by sept .
12 , the ' two plus four ' contract would not be ratified , " lothar de maiziere said .
the final reunification date of oct .
3 , 1990 , came to be decided because it coincided with an international foreign ministers ' conference in new york on oct .
1 , .
the foreign ministers from the allied countries said they wished to withdraw their troops from the parts of germany they were occupying on oct .
3 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two german foreign ministers : gdr 's markus meckel -lrb- l . -rrb- and frg 's hans-dietrich genscher " this is how the date of oct .

a special day for lothar de maiziere , the date of oct .
3 is a truly special one .
by then , the 50-year-old had spent half his life in the gdr and was touched by the socialist state .
" regardless of whether rejects or disowns the system , there is still a sense of loyalty to it , " he said .
therefore for de maiziere and for many others from the gdr , " this new beginning is not easy . "
however he added that for all politicians elected to the chamber of the people , it was clear that " our main purpose was to abolish ourselves . "

" the problem is that the law is unfair .
there 's a trend in germany and elsewhere for people to have more than one nationality , " said marei pelzer , legal consultant for pro asyl , an organization that focuses on the rights of refugees and immigrants .
" we already have 4.5 million people in germany with more than one nationality , around 53 percent of those being granted german citizenship have dual nationality , " she told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ngos : more than one nationality is becoming the norm duty to choose pro asyl as well as two fellow ngos , the intercultural council and the german bar association , have called for an overhaul of the current regulation , which dates back to the year 2000 .
it forces anyone born in germany after 1990 with non-german parents to either become german or take his or her parents ' citizenship when they turn 18 .
they have until the age of 21 to make a final decision , meaning the first batch of young people will have to make that decision next year .
being born in germany gives them the right to german citizenship , but only if they give up their parents ' nationality by the time they turn 21 .
this so-called ' duty to choose ' , which is unique to germany , is controversial , not least because there are countries , like iran , morocco , afghanistan and some latin american countries , which do not allow citizens to give up their nationality , so in those cases , dual nationality is already being granted , which creates what the ngos call a two-class system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some countries do n't allow citizens to give up their nationality parliament debate prior to 2000 , the rules were even stricter - there was no automatic right to german citizenship , simply because someone was born in the country .
in the autumn , the german parliament will debate a bill introduced by the opposition parties , the social democrats and the greens , which calls for the restrictions on dual citizenship to be abolished .
but many members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party argue that citizenship is a question of loyalty .
" he or she has to accept german citizenship , that is all we 're asking in terms of integration , " reinhard grindel , home affairs expert of the christian democrats in parliament , told german public radio deutschlandradio kultur .
" but that is non-negotiable .
we 're asking for a certain degree of commitment to our country and its laws and values , we do n't think that 's too much to ask , " he said .
" old-fashioned and undemocratic " pro asyl , however , believes the government needs to modernize its understanding of nationality , if it is to be respected internationally .
" the government needs to recognize the signs of the times , it should not just preach the need for integration , but instead focus on creating the legal basis for a modern immigration state , " pelzer told deutsche welle .
" there are 82 million people in germany , 6.7 million of those are not german nationals and 1.3 million were born here , but still do n't have german citizenship .
that 's a problem for democracy , if people live here , but do n't have the right to vote for example , " she added .

most of the 350,000 inhabitants have already been evacuated but the floods threaten to wreak havoc . as more towns are under imminent threat of flooding and the authorities battle with heavy monsoon rains , there are millions of people in emergency camps who are in desperate need of relief . the german commissioner for humanitarian aid markus loening recently visited the flooded areas of pakistan and got a first-hand insight into the goings on at two camps . " it 's worst for the children , " he told deutsche welle .
" there are very many women with young children .
the estimates are that 90,000 babies are going to be born in the coming weeks and that a third of them are at acute risk of not surviving the first days .
these women are in very rudimentary tents .
they can see down onto their flooded villages .
it 's all very shocking . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 350,000 people have been evacuated from shadadkot in sindh millions are in need of basic supplies concern that there could be an outbreak of disease , including typhoid , hepatitis and cholera continues to grow .
loening said that medical aid was crucial but that many people still needed just the basics . " some six million people need emergency help , they need food to survive .
the children get biscuits .
poland has donated biscuits .
we could also donate them .
children can survive on them because they are high-energy biscuits .
they are being distributed there .
baby food is also being distributed .
if they get that , they can survive one , two or three days .
food and clean water are what ’ s most important at the moment , " loening said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is not enough food for everyone at the relief camps he added that the cost of such products is low but that the sheer numbers of people needing supplies is making deliveries logistically difficult . the world food program has reached over a million people .
it has called for more helicopters to get food to people who remain isolated by the high flood waters . loening dispelled doubts that donations were not going to the right places .
he said that all the donations to german organizations were going " one-to-one " to the people who needed it . donor fatigue in pakistan and abroad if the west has been criticized for its sluggish response to the floods and a form of donor fatigue , the pakistani population 's distrust of the weak civilian government has reportedly also had a negative impact on donations from pakistanis themselves . " this trust deficit has created a situation where the people are not coming forward , " said tayyab siddique , a pakistani political expert . the army on the other hand has received much praise for its relief operations , although political expert ayesha siddika explained there was some marketing going on : " it ' not the way they 're doing work .
it 's how their work is being presented . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tents in the emergency camps are very rudimentary observers do not predict , however , that the political situation will change much as a result of this image-boosting , as it is widely thought that the military already holds the power behind the scenes . nor do they think the taliban will benefit unduly as their emergency relief operations are reportedly as chaotic as those of the authorities . positive for pakistani-west relations however , ayesha siddika believes that the way the floods are handled by the west could have a positive impact : " the more the west helps , it will be , i mean one of the spin offs will be of course improvement of relations , doing away with misunderstandings . " donations from the international community have neared 500 million dollars already but the un has warned that pakistan will be needing help for years . the international monetary fund is currently looking at ways of restructuring a $ 10 billion loan for pakistan . author : anne thomas editor : disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

most of the 350,000 inhabitants have already been evacuated but the floods threaten to wreak havoc . as more towns are under imminent threat of flooding and the authorities battle with heavy monsoon rains , there are millions of people in emergency camps who are in desperate need of relief . the german commissioner for humanitarian aid markus loening recently visited the flooded areas of pakistan and got a first-hand insight into the goings on at two camps . " it 's worst for the children , " he told deutsche welle .
" there are very many women with young children .
the estimates are that 90,000 babies are going to be born in the coming weeks and that a third of them are at acute risk of not surviving the first days .
these women are in very rudimentary tents .
they can see down onto their flooded villages .
it 's all very shocking . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 350,000 people have been evacuated from shadadkot in sindh millions are in need of basic supplies concern that there could be an outbreak of disease , including typhoid , hepatitis and cholera continues to grow .
loening said that medical aid was crucial but that many people still needed just the basics . " some six million people need emergency help , they need food to survive .
the children get biscuits .
poland has donated biscuits .
we could also donate them .
children can survive on them because they are high-energy biscuits .
they are being distributed there .
baby food is also being distributed .
if they get that , they can survive one , two or three days .
food and clean water are what ’ s most important at the moment , " loening said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is not enough food for everyone at the relief camps he added that the cost of such products is low but that the sheer numbers of people needing supplies is making deliveries logistically difficult . the world food program has reached over a million people .
it has called for more helicopters to get food to people who remain isolated by the high flood waters . loening dispelled doubts that donations were not going to the right places .
he said that all the donations to german organizations were going " one-to-one " to the people who needed it . donor fatigue in pakistan and abroad if the west has been criticized for its sluggish response to the floods and a form of donor fatigue , the pakistani population 's distrust of the weak civilian government has reportedly also had a negative impact on donations from pakistanis themselves . " this trust deficit has created a situation where the people are not coming forward , " said tayyab siddique , a pakistani political expert . the army on the other hand has received much praise for its relief operations , although political expert ayesha siddika explained there was some marketing going on : " it ' not the way they 're doing work .
it 's how their work is being presented . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tents in the emergency camps are very rudimentary observers do not predict , however , that the political situation will change much as a result of this image-boosting , as it is widely thought that the military already holds the power behind the scenes . nor do they think the taliban will benefit unduly as their emergency relief operations are reportedly as chaotic as those of the authorities . positive for pakistani-west relations however , ayesha siddika believes that the way the floods are handled by the west could have a positive impact : " the more the west helps , it will be , i mean one of the spin offs will be of course improvement of relations , doing away with misunderstandings . " donations from the international community have neared 500 million dollars already but the un has warned that pakistan will be needing help for years . the international monetary fund is currently looking at ways of restructuring a $ 10 billion loan for pakistan . author : anne thomas editor : disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nuclear industry is already contesting planned taxes against it . the german government is preparing to impose a further charge on the nation 's nuclear industry , in addition to the planned fuel rod tax .
" there will be a charge - yes , even on top of the fuel rod tax , " hermann groehe , general secretary of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat party , said on monday .
speaking after a meeting of the cdu presidium , groehe said there was popular consent within the party that the nuclear industry should make a stronger contribution to investment in renewable energy sources .
groehe said that the method of levying funds would not yet be clear , but that the tax would be " substantial . "

several of germany 's energy giants had reacted with outrage after hearing of the proposals .

drunken youths broke and uprooted 72 grave crosses and damaged one jewish stele at the cemetery in laon , in the picardy region .
two young men , aged 18 and 19 and already known to police , were arrested .
eyewitnesses reported that there were four culprits in total , who had damaged graves by hurtling around the graveyard on motorbikes .
" there is no xenophobic aspect to these deeds , only acts of alcoholism , " the regional police authority said .
" these desecrations do not appear to be anti-german in nature . "
around 3,500 people are buried at the champ-de-manoeuvre cemetery , many of whom are german soldiers who fell in battle between 1914 and 1918 , or were patients at the nearby german military hospitals which remained in operation until 1920 .
