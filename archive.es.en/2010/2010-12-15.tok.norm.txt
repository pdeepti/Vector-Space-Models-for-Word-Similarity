one of the focal points of the meeting is to be how to handle possible future debt crises in eurozone countries , such as the ones currently facing greece and ireland .
merkel insisted that no european country would be left behind should it face similar dire financial straits .
" no one in europe will be left alone , no one in europe will be abandoned , " merkel said .
" europe succeeds when it acts together and , i would add , europe succeeds only when it acts together . "
merkel accused of mishandling the situation the debate about the eu summit revealed a split in the german parliament over the issue of how to handle europe .
following merkel ’ s speech , the opposition social democratic party , the greens and the left party distanced themselves from merkel ’ s strategy . the head of the social democratic party bloc , frank-walter steinmeier said the government was sending out unclear signals , and that merkel ’ s hesitance had put germany ’ s commitment to european solidarity in doubt . merkel also came under attack from the head of the left party , gesine loetzsch .
she said the chancellor was rushing from one disaster to the next , whilst trying to give the impression that the situation was under control . " what we need now is investment in the future of europe , " loetzsch said .
crisis-proof euro after being forced to help bail out greece earlier this year , the european union created a financial rescue fund to be triggered in case of any future debt crisis .
ireland became the first country to access the fund last month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she believed in the strength of the euro some believe that the 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 997 billion -rrb- in the bailout fund wo n't be enough - particularly if financially troubled countries like spain or portugal are also forced to dip into it in the near future . according to some analysts , this could , in turn , threaten the eurozone itself , but chancellor merkel played down concerns about the eurozone 's common currency .
" it is undeniable that some eurozone countries face difficult challenges but it is also undeniable that the euro has shown itself to be crisis-proof , " she said .
spain causes market wobbles as if to illustrate the concerns about the potential for further bailouts , ratings agency moody ’ s warned spain on wednesday that its debt could be downgraded .
the euro slid in reaction to the news , while the borrowing costs of spain and portugal rose slightly .
the ratings agency standard and poor ’ s made a similar warning to belgium on tuesday . analysts have questioned whether the current fund would be sufficient to bailout spain , the eurozone 's fourth largest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's unemployment rate has topped 20 percent moody 's said it was concerned about spain 's high debt funding needs , its heavily indebted banks and its regional finances , but it did not expect madrid would have to follow greece and ireland in seeking an eu bailout . the portuguese government announced moves to cut red tape and boost growth , and said it would soon adopt quarterly fiscal targets , part of a broad effort to convince eu officials and financial markets it does not need a bailout . european commission president jose manuel barroso urged leaders to act fast to reach a consensus at the summit . germany pledges support for ecb meanwhile , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- is expected to ask euro zone member states for more capital , a move to lower its leverage as it helps tackle the debt crisis . that issue may be discussed among eu leaders on thursday , when they will be joined for dinner by ecb president jean-claude trichet .
the ecb has come under pressure to step up its bond-buying program to help the likes of ireland , greece and portugal . germany said it would support giving the ecb more capital , with an official saying the move would show financial markets that the central bank had the firepower to buy new government bonds if needed .
no support for european bonds jean-claude juncker , prime minister of luxembourg and the chairman of the group of eurozone finance ministers recently floated the idea of a common european bond to help relieve pressure on weaker members of the eurozone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker likes the idea of a single european bond merkel has been staunchly opposed to this proposal and reiterated her resistance again on wednesday .
she said that what she described as a " collectivization of risk " among eurozone nations would be a mistake .
germany fears that if adopted , eurobonds would significantly raise its borrowing costs , which are currently among the lowest in europe .
a report published in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday estimated the cost for germany of a common eurozone bond to be at least 17 billion euros annually .

dw-world.de eurobond proposals wo n't go away chancellor merkel has dismissed calls for the eurozone to pool sovereign debt due to the high costs it would impose on germany .

some 300 serbian journalists , broadcast technicians , and media managers have participated in workshops since then . ten years of media development in serbia – a good reason for dw-akademie and former participants to take stock of the work achieved so far and to look ahead .
at the end of november the europe and central asia division invited alumni to a conference in belgrade .
the goal was to combine an informal get-together with a one-day workshop involving groups and discussions on dw-akademie ’ s performance .
“ what are we doing well and what can we do better ? ” were the central questions posed to twenty serbian journalists from all regions in the country .
the alumni gave top praise to dw-akademie ’ s advanced training in areas such as interview training , environmental reporting and online journalism .
additional plus points were given for discussions with german experts and networking with other participants .
starting in 2011 , a new , regional dw-akademie blog will support this exchange online .
the alumni also had suggestions for future projects .
one participant proposed the joint construction of an exchange platform for radio and television reports .
others hoped for more involvement of upper management in the projects to help overcome management ’ s reluctance to work with new ideas .
participants mentioned other barriers making it difficult to implement what they had learned including a lack of finances and time , as well as political pressure .
“ we really appreciate the feedback and now have new ideas which we ’ ll include in our upcoming projects , ” says filip slavkovic who coordinates dw-akademie projects in southeastern europe .
further workshops together with the osce media department are planned for serbia starting at the beginning of 2011 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

italy 's interior minister defended the conduct of the police after the riots in rome 's historic center shocked italy .
scores of cars were set alight , shop windows were smashed and around 100 people were injured in clashes between demonstrators and police . authorities said 26 people were arrested and charged .
the violence erupted close to parliament buildings where a key confidence vote on prime minister silvio berlusconi was being held .
the government eventually won by just 3 votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has faced days of protests " what happened yesterday was not an expression of freedom .
it was an attack by organized groups of hooligans , " berlusconi said on wednesday .
for interior minister roberto maroni , police in rome showed restraint in dealing with the violence .
" i can say that in the end things went well , " maroni told the corriere della sera newspaper .
" someone could have been killed . "
maroni blamed the riots on leftist extremists who had infiltrated a student march .
critics said that by keeping the demonstrators away from the parliament buildings , police had allowed the demonstrators to rampage in other parts of the city .
damage to rome 's historic center the riots were concentrated around the main via del corso and the central piazza del popolo and piazza venezia that are normally filled with tourists .
the streets were left scattered with debris , including burnt-out cars , melted bicycles and broken shop glass .
more than 90 people were hurt , and 60 taken to hospital after the clashes .
a number of police officers were among those who were injured .
the demonstration had begun as a peaceful march by students angry that prime minister silvio berlusconi had narrowly survived the confidence vote earlier in the day .
opposition members accused the leader of having bought votes and blackmailed potential dissenters in order to stay in power .
however , the peaceful march was hijacked by a small core of violent protesters .
members of a violent group known as the black bloc took over , throwing cobblestones , bottles and metal poles at police .
they also set fire to a number of vehicles .
costly repairs # b # shopkeepers have begun assessing the damage .
instead of welcoming christmas shoppers , luca spieza spent wednesday sifting through a pile of mangled glasses that were on display in the window of his optician 's shop .
he described what happened when the black bloc arrived : " my car was burning in front of my shop , " speiza told deutsche welle .
" on the right side , police , on the left , young people and in front there was a fire . "
speiza 's own car was set on fire and he and his elderly father were trapped in his smoke-filled shop for almost half an hour .
he estimated the damage to his merchandise , car and shop to total around 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 27,000 -rrb- .
rome 's mayor gianni alemanno said the clashes were " shocking " and likened them to the " gratuitous violence that was on the streets of rome in the 1970s and that i hoped never to see again . "
alemanno estimated the damage at 20 million euros .
parliament blocked off one place where protesters did not make their mark was the area around italy 's parliament .
dozens of police vans and hundreds of officers blocked off the zone to anyone except politicians and reporters .
center-left politician niki vendola sees cordoned-off area as a metaphor for how out-of-touch the current government is .
" barricading the parliamentary palace brings to mind medieval times , when the sovereigns were separate and untouchable , " vendola told deutsche welle .
" this shows how italy is living a modern version of medieval times . "
two influential italian newspapers , la repubblica and corriere della sera said that early elections were the likely outcome of the current political unrest in italy .
the current berlusconi government took power in 2008 with a mandate set to run until 2013 .

dw-akademie director gerda meuer was invited to speak at a two-day conference held in the bhutan capital , thimphu . “ the challenges of public service broadcasting ” was the title of the media conference organized in november by the bhutan centre for media and democracy and the bhutan broadcasting service -lrb- bbs -rrb- , the country ’ s sole television broadcaster .
politicians , media representatives and academics – the majority from bhutan itself – came to thimphu to discuss the challenges .
also invited were experts from thailand , the philippines and ireland , and gerda meuer , director of dw-akademie , from germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meuer looked back at 60 years of german public broadcasting .
“ following world war ii the allies wanted to create a media system in germany that was decentralized , politically and economically independent , and that represented all layers of society .
they wanted an open dialogue for everyone , ” she said .
she explained the structure of the german public broadcasting system and described the functions of the various broadcasting boards .
but , she warned , “ one can not simply copy the models of other countries and transfer them to one ’ s own .
the goal is to find a system that best suits one ’ s own country . ”
with its strategic importance , bhutan is the size of switzerland and lies between china and india .
800,000 inhabitants live in the kingdom which the monarch is aiming to restructure into a democracy – in harmony with a unique political philosophy .
traditionally , the country ’ s leader is committed to the “ gross national happiness ” , where each political decision has to be in line with the individual ’ s and society ’ s well-being .
this is quite different to the western idea of growth .
accordingly , the media workshop in thimphu developed recommendations which would make it possible to transform the bhutanese state broadcaster into a public broadcaster .
“ now our primary objective is to create our own understanding of public service broadcasting , ” said pema choden , bbs director .
“ at the same time we need to find our own role within the new political context . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de medicine -pipe- 15.12.2010 berlin man still cured of hiv after three years , researchers say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. gero huetter is one of the co-authors of the paper three years after receiving a stem cell transplant , one man no longer has hiv .
however , scientists caution that this procedure can only be replicated in certain circumstances and merits further study . in a new study , german researchers have confirmed that an american man living in berlin was successfully cured of his hiv infection after having received a blood stem cell transplant in 2007 .
" in conclusion , our results strongly suggest that cure of hiv has been achieved in this patient , " the researchers write in the abstract to their paper , which was published last week in blood , a medical journal .
the new paper is a follow-up study by the same german team to one they had published in the new england journal of medicine in february 2009 .
that study found " the patient remained without viral rebound 20 months after transplantation and discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy . "
" we were n't able to find hiv in his cells , " said dr. gero huetter , a hematologist and professor at the university of heidelberg , and a co-author of the new paper , in an interview with deutsche welle . " the new cells have a natural resistance against hiv . "
three years ago , timothy ray brown had been an hiv-positive leukemia patient .
prior to receiving the stem cell transplant , he underwent intense chemotherapy to completely replace his immune system .
however , the new stem cells that he received had a rare genetic mutation - found naturally in just one percent of caucasians in northern and western europe - that causes certain cells to lack a particular receptor , known as the ccr5 receptor , which hiv binds to .
at the time huetter specifically was looking for bone marrow stem cell donors that contained the rare ccr5 deletion .
since his treatment , the so-called " berlin patient " has been effectively cured of aids and its disease-causing virus , hiv , but also leukemia .
this likely makes him the first , and so far , only person ever to have been cured of hiv , out of more than 30 million currently infected people worldwide .
scientists have previously seen a very small number of cases where the virus does not replicate inside the host and therefore does not cause aids .
however , these so-called " non-progressives , " represent an extremely small percentage of known hiv patients around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 30 million people worldwide are infected with hiv an " intriguing " step , aids researchers say in the wake of the new german paper , aids and hiv researchers around the world are starting to take stock of this important finding .
" it 's intriguing that this patient does not have a rebound of the hiv replication , " said jens lundgren , an aids researcher and professor at the university of copenhagen , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they have certainly proven the case that there is no apparent residual infection in this person , and the hiv had multiple opportunities to replicate . "
another german aids researcher , dr. jan van lunzen , of the university hospital eppendorf in hamburg , agreed with this assessment .
" it seems that so far , this patient is one that we could call cured from hiv , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle . " this is the only known case , so far . "
but lundgren cautioned that researchers can not claim that they have cured aids or hiv as this was only one , very particular case .
" we can not really make statements on cure rates based on a single patient , " the researcher , who was not part of the study , added .
" this has to be looked at much more comprehensively , and this raises the issue of who wants to undergo a stem cell transplantation ?
this is not a procedure that you want to do on a whim , if you 're otherwise healthy . "
huetter and his colleagues , however , say that the ccr5 technique has a good chance of becoming a new method for treating , or perhaps even curing hiv in the future .
" probably in five , 10 or 20 years there will be techniques and procedures which can knock down ccr5 in a more complete way and will substitute this current medication of antiretroviral therapy , " he said .

as a result , the last draft will be on january 3 , 2011 . the german government on wednesday approved the plans of its defense minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , to reduce the size of the german military , the bundeswehr , by 65,000 soldiers to 185,000 . included in the reform are plans to suspend conscription from july 1 next year .
this means that the last young men will receive their draft notices on january 3 , ending a practice which goes back to 1957 and the start of german rearmament after world war ii .
the government has decided only to suspend the draft and not to abolish it .
abolition would require a change to the constitution , and the provision will remain in case a general call-up becomes necessary in a time of crisis .
the new armed forces will include 170,000 professional soldiers and 15,000 volunteers , who will serve for up to 23 months . guttenberg argues that a smaller bundeswehr will be more effective in dealing with modern military challenges .
a smaller military is still too expensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense minister has pushed for an end to conscription the plans are being made at a time when the military is under financial pressure . finance minister wolfgang schaeuble wants the defense ministry to save 8.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.2 billion -rrb- by 2014 .
the defense minister says he ca n't meet that target without reducing size of the military to 160,000 .
the suspension of conscription is expected to lead to an increase in the number of young people wanting to go to university .
the german states , which are responsible for financing education , say they are not prepared to pay the additional cost .
the chairman of the conference of state premiers , wolfgang boehmer , said that , if the central government created the financial burden , it should be prepared to discuss paying for it .
the suspension is also expected to lead to extra costs for social service providers , who have so far benefitted from the civilian service alternative to the draft . the cabinet also agreed on a new program of voluntary civil service , but the minister for families , kristina schroeder , has already said that it will not fill the gap completely .

one of the focal points of the meeting is to be how to handle possible future debt crises in eurozone countries , such as the ones currently facing greece and ireland .
merkel insisted that no european country would be left behind should it face similar dire financial straits .
" no one in europe will be left alone , no one in europe will be abandoned , " merkel said .
" europe succeeds when it acts together and , i would add , europe succeeds only when it acts together . "
merkel accused of mishandling the situation the debate about the eu summit revealed a split in the german parliament over the issue of how to handle europe .
following merkel ’ s speech , the opposition social democratic party , the greens and the left party distanced themselves from merkel ’ s strategy . the head of the social democratic party bloc , frank-walter steinmeier said the government was sending out unclear signals , and that merkel ’ s hesitance had put germany ’ s commitment to european solidarity in doubt . merkel also came under attack from the head of the left party , gesine loetzsch .
she said the chancellor was rushing from one disaster to the next , whilst trying to give the impression that the situation was under control . " what we need now is investment in the future of europe , " loetzsch said .
crisis-proof euro after being forced to help bail out greece earlier this year , the european union created a financial rescue fund to be triggered in case of any future debt crisis .
ireland became the first country to access the fund last month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she believed in the strength of the euro some believe that the 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 997 billion -rrb- in the bailout fund wo n't be enough - particularly if financially troubled countries like spain or portugal are also forced to dip into it in the near future . according to some analysts , this could , in turn , threaten the eurozone itself , but chancellor merkel played down concerns about the eurozone 's common currency .
" it is undeniable that some eurozone countries face difficult challenges but it is also undeniable that the euro has shown itself to be crisis-proof , " she said .
spain causes market wobbles as if to illustrate the concerns about the potential for further bailouts , ratings agency moody ’ s warned spain on wednesday that its debt could be downgraded .
the euro slid in reaction to the news , while the borrowing costs of spain and portugal rose slightly .
the ratings agency standard and poor ’ s made a similar warning to belgium on tuesday . analysts have questioned whether the current fund would be sufficient to bailout spain , the eurozone 's fourth largest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's unemployment rate has topped 20 percent moody 's said it was concerned about spain 's high debt funding needs , its heavily indebted banks and its regional finances , but it did not expect madrid would have to follow greece and ireland in seeking an eu bailout . the portuguese government announced moves to cut red tape and boost growth , and said it would soon adopt quarterly fiscal targets , part of a broad effort to convince eu officials and financial markets it does not need a bailout . european commission president jose manuel barroso urged leaders to act fast to reach a consensus at the summit . germany pledges support for ecb meanwhile , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- is expected to ask euro zone member states for more capital , a move to lower its leverage as it helps tackle the debt crisis . that issue may be discussed among eu leaders on thursday , when they will be joined for dinner by ecb president jean-claude trichet .
the ecb has come under pressure to step up its bond-buying program to help the likes of ireland , greece and portugal . germany said it would support giving the ecb more capital , with an official saying the move would show financial markets that the central bank had the firepower to buy new government bonds if needed .
no support for european bonds jean-claude juncker , prime minister of luxembourg and the chairman of the group of eurozone finance ministers recently floated the idea of a common european bond to help relieve pressure on weaker members of the eurozone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker likes the idea of a single european bond merkel has been staunchly opposed to this proposal and reiterated her resistance again on wednesday .
she said that what she described as a " collectivization of risk " among eurozone nations would be a mistake .
germany fears that if adopted , eurobonds would significantly raise its borrowing costs , which are currently among the lowest in europe .
a report published in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday estimated the cost for germany of a common eurozone bond to be at least 17 billion euros annually .

dw-world.de eurobond proposals wo n't go away chancellor merkel has dismissed calls for the eurozone to pool sovereign debt due to the high costs it would impose on germany .

mikhail khodorkovsky is standing trial on charges of embezzling oil worth billions of dollars . a russian court has unexpectedly delayed the delivery of a verdict for imprisoned oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky - formerly russia 's richest man - who faces charges of stealing over 200 tons of oil from his own wells .
a court spokesperson did not give a reason for the delay , but said the verdict would now be handed down on december 27 .
lawyers for khodorkovsky said they had not been informed of the decision to delay the verdict .
since his incarceration , khodorkovsky has been russia 's highest-profile inmate .
the 47-year-old khodorkovsky has been an outspoken critic of the kremlin , and particularly of prime minister vladimir putin .
the former oil billionaire , who was a major shareholder in failed petroleum company yukos , is already serving an eight-year sentence for tax evasion , which is set to expire in 2011 .
if found guilty of the fresh charges , he faces an additional six years in prison .
if found innocent , his release could come just months ahead of the next russian presidential election .
khodorkovsky 's year-and-a-half trial has been the subject of intense international scrutiny , particularly from the united states and germany , which accuse the kremlin of staging a political show trial with no legal basis .
russia analysts have kept a close eye on the khodorkovsky case , which they say could be a major indicator of president dmitry medvedev 's progress in reforming the country 's judicial system .

mikhail khodorkovsky is standing trial on charges of embezzling oil worth billions of dollars . a russian court has unexpectedly delayed the delivery of a verdict for imprisoned oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky - formerly russia 's richest man - who faces charges of stealing over 200 tons of oil from his own wells .
a court spokesperson did not give a reason for the delay , but said the verdict would now be handed down on december 27 .
lawyers for khodorkovsky said they had not been informed of the decision to delay the verdict .
since his incarceration , khodorkovsky has been russia 's highest-profile inmate .
the 47-year-old khodorkovsky has been an outspoken critic of the kremlin , and particularly of prime minister vladimir putin .
the former oil billionaire , who was a major shareholder in failed petroleum company yukos , is already serving an eight-year sentence for tax evasion , which is set to expire in 2011 .
if found guilty of the fresh charges , he faces an additional six years in prison .
if found innocent , his release could come just months ahead of the next russian presidential election .
khodorkovsky 's year-and-a-half trial has been the subject of intense international scrutiny , particularly from the united states and germany , which accuse the kremlin of staging a political show trial with no legal basis .
russia analysts have kept a close eye on the khodorkovsky case , which they say could be a major indicator of president dmitry medvedev 's progress in reforming the country 's judicial system .

in 1991 , the pro-democracy activist received the nobel peace prize .
the 65-year old has spent 15 of the last 21 years in detention .
deutsche welle : what is your daily routine these days ?
aung san suu kyi : my daily routine is very , very hectic .
if i look back at today , i had about two , three appointments this morning and two in the afternoon , and i still have n't finished my work yet .
so , it is extremely hectic .
what kind of appointments are these ?
i am meeting diplomats , i am meeting political parties , i am meeting individuals , we have our national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- office meetings .
then i am speaking to people on the phone .
and there are individual journalists and correspondents , who have managed to come to burma , and i have to meet them as well .
what was the biggest change you noticed in your city after your house arrest was lifted ?
i think the number of hand phones !
the moment i was released , i saw all those people with their hand phones which they were using to take photographs .
i think what it means is that there is an improvement in communications .
and what about the burmese society ?
did you find any other changes ?
prices have gone up sky-high , and people are very concerned about it .
everybody talks about the rise in prices .
also , the attitude of the young people has improved considerably .
they want to be involved in the political process , and they are much more outgoing and proactive than they were seven years ago .
when you were released , it was striking that many young people turned up to greet you .
what are your expectations from the youth of burma ?
it is for them to understand that it is up to them to bring change to our country , and that they should not depend on me or the nld or anybody else .
we will do our best , but in the end i want them to have this self-confidence to believe that they can do it for themselves .
how do you see the future of your party , the national league for democracy ?
we are going to stand as a political force because we have the full support of the people .
of course , the authorities are trying to deregister our party , and i am contesting that at court , but that is a legal matter .
the real political truth of the situation is that we have the confidence , the trust and the support of the people , and that will keep us going as the most important opposition force in burma today .
have you tried to get in touch with the government after your release ?
no , not yet .
i have , of course , been sending indirect messages through almost every speech i have made , every interview i have had , that i would like to have dialogue .
i think we should discuss our differences and come to an agreement that we should be prepared to compromise on both sides .
but why have n't you taken any concrete step to initiate this kind of a dialogue ?
we are waiting for the right time , which i hope is not too far off .
burma is a country with many ethnic minorities , whose relationship with the majority has been rather tense over the recent decades .
what do you plan to do to reach out to these groups ?
we have been reaching out to these groups for a number of years , and i can claim that we have had a certain amount of success .
not only do we have very strong allies among the parties which contested the 1990 elections , we also have the support of other ethnic groups , including the ceasefire groups along the frontiers , who have expressed an interest in what we are trying to do - to revive the spirit of true union .
last week , the nobel peace prize for the chinese democracy activist liu xiaobo turned into a major international controversy .
what is your reaction , being a nobel laureate yourself ?
i have a great respect for the norwegian nobel committee , and i believe they must have sound reasons for choosing to give him the award this year .
i personally do n't know much about liu xiabo because i have been under house arrest for about seven years , and all i know about him is that what i heard on the radio .
but i do believe that the nobel committee must have sound reasons for selecting him .
in europe , people are wondering what they can do to support burma .
what is your advice ?
first of all , it would be very helpful if all the countries of europe could speak with one voice .
even within the european union there are different attitudes and different voices , and i think that weakens the -lsb- burmese -rsb- opposition .
it would help us a great deal if all european countries called for certain steps to be taken in burma - the release of political prisoners , inclusiveness of the political process , specifically with the nld , and negotiations .
do you have any specific european countries in mind , which you want to see more active in this ?
as i am talking to you in germany - i would like germany to be more active .
you said in previous interviews that you will need time to form an opinion about international sanctions against the burmese regime .
what is your impression so far on this matter ?
so far , i have not got the impression that economic sanctions have really hurt the public , but of course there are other voices that are perhaps still waiting to be heard , so we have yet to find out .
i have been released just for over a month , and i have n't had time to go into this issue ; i am waiting to read the latest report of the imf , and perhaps the adb and other economic institutions .
how influential is the west in burma ?
compared with that , how do you see india 's and china 's role ?
i think the role of the west in burma and the role of india and china are quite different .
i would not like to think of them as competing for influence , or competing for ascendancy over burma .
it is not as though we were not able to shape our own destiny .
but certainly , because india and china are very close neighbors , they have a certain advantage over those countries that are situated very far away .
does this mean that what the west does with regard to burma is not so important ?
no , it has its importance , depending on how and what actions the west is taking , which is why i said earlier that it would be good if all the western nations could coordinate their efforts .
not just the western nations , it would be good if the whole international community , including the united nations , coordinated its efforts .
that would help us very greatly indeed , and if it called for the same basic steps , that would mean progress .
what are your expectations from india and china ?
we would like them to engage with us .
to begin with , we 'd very much like india and china to give us the opportunity to explain our point of view to them .
we have very little contact with china and india .
we have more contact with the indian government than with the chinese government , in fact i do n't think we have any contact with the chinese government at all .
we would like to have contact with them , we would like them to listen to our side of the story , and make them understand that we look upon them as neighbors , and that we would like to be friends with them .
we are not hostile to them even if we are working for democracy in burma .
what are your plans for the coming weeks ?
the man that i fear most in the world is the man who keeps my appointment book .
i have n't gone through next week 's appointments with him ...

police are being deployed to ensure that anti-nuclear protesters do not disrupt the route . the latest shipment of nuclear waste crossed the border into germany from france on wednesday afternoon .
the train had begun its journey on tuesday evening when it set out from the southern french research center of cadarache .
it is expected to arrive at its destination - a storage facililty in the northern german town of lubmin - on thursday .
in the containers are around 2,500 spent fuel rods , that are originally from a research facility in the southwestern german city of karlsruhe that went offline in 1991 and the research vessel otto hahn , which has n't been used since 1979 .
a number of anti-nuclear activists gathered in saarbruecken on the french-german border to protest against the transport .
several hundred policemen were deployed in saarbruecken , and other rail services were disrupted .

as a result , the last draft will be on january 3 , 2011 . the german government on wednesday approved the plans of its defense minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , to reduce the size of the german military , the bundeswehr , by 65,000 soldiers to 185,000 . included in the reform are plans to suspend conscription from july 1 next year .
this means that the last young men will receive their draft notices on january 3 , ending a practice which goes back to 1957 and the start of german rearmament after world war ii .
the government has decided only to suspend the draft and not to abolish it .
abolition would require a change to the constitution , and the provision will remain in case a general call-up becomes necessary in a time of crisis .
the new armed forces will include 170,000 professional soldiers and 15,000 volunteers , who will serve for up to 23 months . guttenberg argues that a smaller bundeswehr will be more effective in dealing with modern military challenges .
a smaller military is still too expensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense minister has pushed for an end to conscription the plans are being made at a time when the military is under financial pressure . finance minister wolfgang schaeuble wants the defense ministry to save 8.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.2 billion -rrb- by 2014 .
the defense minister says he ca n't meet that target without reducing size of the military to 160,000 .
the suspension of conscription is expected to lead to an increase in the number of young people wanting to go to university .
the german states , which are responsible for financing education , say they are not prepared to pay the additional cost .
the chairman of the conference of state premiers , wolfgang boehmer , said that , if the central government created the financial burden , it should be prepared to discuss paying for it .
the suspension is also expected to lead to extra costs for social service providers , who have so far benefitted from the civilian service alternative to the draft . the cabinet also agreed on a new program of voluntary civil service , but the minister for families , kristina schroeder , has already said that it will not fill the gap completely .

of course , the authorities are trying to deregister our party , and i am contesting that at court , but that is a legal matter .
the real political truth of the situation is that we have the confidence , the trust and the support of the people , and that will keep us going as the most important opposition force in burma today .
have you tried to get in touch with the government after your release ?
no , not yet .
i have , of course , been sending indirect messages through almost every speech i have made , every interview i have had , that i would like to have dialogue .
i think we should discuss our differences and come to an agreement that we should be prepared to compromise on both sides .
but why have n't you taken any concrete step to initiate this kind of a dialogue ?
we are waiting for the right time , which i hope is not too far off .
burma is a country with many ethnic minorities , whose relationship with the majority has been rather tense over the recent decades .
what do you plan to do to reach out to these groups ?
we have been reaching out to these groups for a number of years , and i can claim that we have had a certain amount of success .
not only do we have very strong allies among the parties which contested the 1990 elections , we also have the support of other ethnic groups , including the ceasefire groups along the frontiers , who have expressed an interest in what we are trying to do - to revive the spirit of true union .
last week , the nobel peace prize for the chinese democracy activist liu xiaobo turned into a major international controversy .
what is your reaction , being a nobel laureate yourself ?
i have a great respect for the norwegian nobel committee , and i believe they must have sound reasons for choosing to give him the award this year .
i personally do n't know much about liu xiabo because i have been under house arrest for about seven years , and all i know about him is that what i heard on the radio .
but i do believe that the nobel committee must have sound reasons for selecting him .
in europe , people are wondering what they can do to support burma .
what is your advice ?
first of all , it would be very helpful if all the countries of europe could speak with one voice .
even within the european union there are different attitudes and different voices , and i think that weakens the -lsb- burmese -rsb- opposition .
it would help us a great deal if all european countries called for certain steps to be taken in burma - the release of political prisoners , inclusiveness of the political process , specifically with the nld , and negotiations .
do you have any specific european countries in mind , which you want to see more active in this ?
as i am talking to you in germany - i would like germany to be more active .
you said in previous interviews that you will need time to form an opinion about international sanctions against the burmese regime .
what is your impression so far on this matter ?
so far , i have not got the impression that economic sanctions have really hurt the public , but of course there are other voices that are perhaps still waiting to be heard , so we have yet to find out .
i have been released just for over a month , and i have n't had time to go into this issue ; i am waiting to read the latest report of the imf , and perhaps the adb and other economic institutions .
how influential is the west in burma ?
compared with that , how do you see india 's and china 's role ?
i think the role of the west in burma and the role of india and china are quite different .
i would not like to think of them as competing for influence , or competing for ascendancy over burma .
it is not as though we were not able to shape our own destiny .
but certainly , because india and china are very close neighbors , they have a certain advantage over those countries that are situated very far away .
does this mean that what the west does with regard to burma is not so important ?
no , it has its importance , depending on how and what actions the west is taking , which is why i said earlier that it would be good if all the western nations could coordinate their efforts .
not just the western nations , it would be good if the whole international community , including the united nations , coordinated its efforts .
that would help us very greatly indeed , and if it called for the same basic steps , that would mean progress .
what are your expectations from india and china ?
we would like them to engage with us .
to begin with , we 'd very much like india and china to give us the opportunity to explain our point of view to them .
we have very little contact with china and india .
we have more contact with the indian government than with the chinese government , in fact i do n't think we have any contact with the chinese government at all .
we would like to have contact with them , we would like them to listen to our side of the story , and make them understand that we look upon them as neighbors , and that we would like to be friends with them .
we are not hostile to them even if we are working for democracy in burma .
what are your plans for the coming weeks ?
the man that i fear most in the world is the man who keeps my appointment book .
i have n't gone through next week 's appointments with him ...

but does doping make for better art ? from poetry to pop music , the question has been asked repeatedly over the years : can mind-altering substances enhance an artist 's performance ? an exhibition currently taking place at london 's wellcome institute examines the huge influence dope has had on the arts - and artists of all kinds - across the ages . " there is a huge range not only of substances , but also across different periods of time , " curator emily sergeant said , while pointing to bamboo opium pipe , a plastic ashtray from the 1970s and some fly agaric mushrooms , which she said are illegal in the uk . spiders on caffeine a particularly compelling part of the exhibition , however , is not directly related to artist - but to spiders . bildunterschrift : the webs may not be functional for catching flies , but they could be considered art -lrb- left to right : benzedrine , caffeine , marijuana -rrb- three graphics are taken from a series of experiments carried out by nasa on arachnids given doses of the amphetamine benzedrine , caffeine and marijuana .

but the caffeine-fuelled spider was noticeably less systematic and its web had large gaps and no circular center , making it essentially non-functional . the survival of the artist , however , is admittedly less dependent on the functionality of his product and more on its aesthetic appeal .
during the 19th century , a large number of writers , artists and scientists experimented with mind-altering substances - many of them legal at the time - to find out what kind of experience they could have . " we have an example from france and the club des hashischins , a group of artists and writers who met under the guidance of a scientist , jacques moreau , and were administered a quantity of hashish and these experiences are recorded , " explained sergeant .
" moreau was interested in the effects of this substance on the genius : what would happen to an already extraordinary mind if it were altered in some way ?

" this was really the beginning of the modern european drug culture in many ways .

" if you look at -lsb- french romantic composer hector -rsb- berlioz at the time , he was taking opium and writing about an opium dream , but actually he was in a very over-stimulated visionary state for about a year , hardly sleeping at all , " jay said .
" he was probably taking the opium to calm down .

vienna is the birthplace of modern diplomacy .

they 're privileged , that is , not subject to the same rules as you and i , and they are - or were - the keepers of state secrets .

what george w bush called the " axis of evil " was just another country or three for austrian companies and their bankers . what we have learnt is that the banks did do business with unsavory characters in eastern europe and that the americans called austrian politicians in for a few drinks and a bit of a chat - all according to vienna convention rules and the expectation of confidentiality .
they also hauled the bankers over the coals and as a result , the banks cut their ties to the appalling people they were doing business with . this brings us to the most revealing part of the wikileaks cables .
us diplomats see " austria 's engagement with the world slipping and narrowing . "
its chancellor werner faymann , a social democrat , is " not interested in foreign relations . "
austria , conclude the americans , is using its neutrality and pacifism as cover for business-led offensives .
washington laments that when it comes to sending its soldiers abroad , austria is " risk averse " in the extreme . the fact is : the americans are right about vienna .
it does do deals with dubious regimes and it does n't want to send its soldiers off to fight america 's or anyone else 's wars .

some 300 serbian journalists , broadcast technicians , and media managers have participated in workshops since then . ten years of media development in serbia – a good reason for dw-akademie and former participants to take stock of the work achieved so far and to look ahead .
at the end of november the europe and central asia division invited alumni to a conference in belgrade .
the goal was to combine an informal get-together with a one-day workshop involving groups and discussions on dw-akademie ’ s performance .
“ what are we doing well and what can we do better ? ” were the central questions posed to twenty serbian journalists from all regions in the country .
the alumni gave top praise to dw-akademie ’ s advanced training in areas such as interview training , environmental reporting and online journalism .
additional plus points were given for discussions with german experts and networking with other participants .
starting in 2011 , a new , regional dw-akademie blog will support this exchange online .
the alumni also had suggestions for future projects .
one participant proposed the joint construction of an exchange platform for radio and television reports .
others hoped for more involvement of upper management in the projects to help overcome management ’ s reluctance to work with new ideas .
participants mentioned other barriers making it difficult to implement what they had learned including a lack of finances and time , as well as political pressure .
“ we really appreciate the feedback and now have new ideas which we ’ ll include in our upcoming projects , ” says filip slavkovic who coordinates dw-akademie projects in southeastern europe .
further workshops together with the osce media department are planned for serbia starting at the beginning of 2011 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de medicine -pipe- 15.12.2010 berlin man still cured of hiv after three years , researchers say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. gero huetter is one of the co-authors of the paper three years after receiving a stem cell transplant , one man no longer has hiv .
however , scientists caution that this procedure can only be replicated in certain circumstances and merits further study . in a new study , german researchers have confirmed that an american man living in berlin was successfully cured of his hiv infection after having received a blood stem cell transplant in 2007 .
" in conclusion , our results strongly suggest that cure of hiv has been achieved in this patient , " the researchers write in the abstract to their paper , which was published last week in blood , a medical journal .
the new paper is a follow-up study by the same german team to one they had published in the new england journal of medicine in february 2009 .
that study found " the patient remained without viral rebound 20 months after transplantation and discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy . "
" we were n't able to find hiv in his cells , " said dr. gero huetter , a hematologist and professor at the university of heidelberg , and a co-author of the new paper , in an interview with deutsche welle . " the new cells have a natural resistance against hiv . "
three years ago , timothy ray brown had been an hiv-positive leukemia patient .
prior to receiving the stem cell transplant , he underwent intense chemotherapy to completely replace his immune system .
however , the new stem cells that he received had a rare genetic mutation - found naturally in just one percent of caucasians in northern and western europe - that causes certain cells to lack a particular receptor , known as the ccr5 receptor , which hiv binds to .
at the time huetter specifically was looking for bone marrow stem cell donors that contained the rare ccr5 deletion .
since his treatment , the so-called " berlin patient " has been effectively cured of aids and its disease-causing virus , hiv , but also leukemia .
this likely makes him the first , and so far , only person ever to have been cured of hiv , out of more than 30 million currently infected people worldwide .
scientists have previously seen a very small number of cases where the virus does not replicate inside the host and therefore does not cause aids .
however , these so-called " non-progressives , " represent an extremely small percentage of known hiv patients around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 30 million people worldwide are infected with hiv an " intriguing " step , aids researchers say in the wake of the new german paper , aids and hiv researchers around the world are starting to take stock of this important finding .
" it 's intriguing that this patient does not have a rebound of the hiv replication , " said jens lundgren , an aids researcher and professor at the university of copenhagen , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they have certainly proven the case that there is no apparent residual infection in this person , and the hiv had multiple opportunities to replicate . "
another german aids researcher , dr. jan van lunzen , of the university hospital eppendorf in hamburg , agreed with this assessment .
" it seems that so far , this patient is one that we could call cured from hiv , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle . " this is the only known case , so far . "
but lundgren cautioned that researchers can not claim that they have cured aids or hiv as this was only one , very particular case .
" we can not really make statements on cure rates based on a single patient , " the researcher , who was not part of the study , added .
" this has to be looked at much more comprehensively , and this raises the issue of who wants to undergo a stem cell transplantation ?
this is not a procedure that you want to do on a whim , if you 're otherwise healthy . "
huetter and his colleagues , however , say that the ccr5 technique has a good chance of becoming a new method for treating , or perhaps even curing hiv in the future .
" probably in five , 10 or 20 years there will be techniques and procedures which can knock down ccr5 in a more complete way and will substitute this current medication of antiretroviral therapy , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 15.12.2010 bulgaria plans to sack diplomats who were communist spies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half of bulgaria 's eu diplomats are former spies bulgarian prime minister boyko borisov has called for 45 top diplomats to be sacked after it was revealed they had worked as agents for the secret police under communist rule . the bulgarian government said on wednesday it would seek to recall 45 top diplomats after a commission revealed they had worked for the secret police under communist rule .
a historical commission , which was given the task of examining the archives of the former secret police , found that a number of diplomats , including the current bulgarian ambassadors in london , berlin , rome , geneva , madrid , tokyo and moscow had collaborated with the former darzhavna sigurnost security service before the collapse of the soviet bloc in 1990 .
" imagine these agents in western european countries .
they once worked against them as ideological enemies and now they are representing our government there , " prime minister boiko borisov told reporters . " my opinion is that we have to part with these people and i suppose my party will back me up . "
collaboration with secret intelligence services remains a sensitive issue throughout the former communist bloc .
but bulgaria has been among the last to confront its communist past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian prime minister wants to get rid of former spies half of eu diplomats are former agents the strongly anti-communist blue coalition bloc said it was " shameful " that half of bulgaria 's ambassadors to european union countries spied for the communists .
once an obedient ally of moscow , bulgaria had a notorious network of spies before the fall of the iron curtain .
the bulgarian secret police was implicated in plots ranging from a failed assassination attempt on pope john paul ii to the killing of an exiled dissident in london with a poison-tipped umbrella .
the bulgarian foreign minister nikolay mladenov said it was " absolutely unacceptable " that so many embassies were still led by former intelligence agents .
a drive for more transparency in 2006 , the bulgarian government passed legislation to open the archives of the former secret police , but the measure does not oblige former agents to quit their current posts .
those who collaborated with the police are free to apply for positions in the civil service , or for political office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of diplomats had received kgb training the government will appeal to president georgi parvanov , who appoints ambassadors , to recall the former agents , mladenov told reporters .
he said the government would also propose legal changes to prevent former agents from getting diplomatic appointments .
prominent suspects the commission says information it has come across also shows parvanov himself may have worked for the pre-1990 secret police .
parvanov has said he wrote a book review for a man who later turned out to be an agent , but has denied he was ever a collaborator himself .
the commission found that 45 percent of the 462 former and current diplomats who have served since the fall of communism in 1989 , had been agents .
analysts say former kgb-trained bulgarian officers and their informants have used skills learned working for the secret police to take top positions in government , business and bulgaria 's powerful underworld .
" if half of our ambassadors were agents , imagine what the situation is within the country , " prime minister borisov said .
" we have certainly underestimated the heavy damage which the former darzhavna sigurnost has dealt to the state . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 15.12.2010 artists have n't abandoned search for psychedelic nirvana of inspiration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artists have often tried to capture their hallucinations from victorian use of cocaine eye-drops to amy winehouse 's reliance on horse sedatives , creative minds have sought out psychedelic experiences for centuries .
but does doping make for better art ? from poetry to pop music , the question has been asked repeatedly over the years : can mind-altering substances enhance an artist 's performance ? an exhibition currently taking place at london 's wellcome institute examines the huge influence dope has had on the arts - and artists of all kinds - across the ages . " there is a huge range not only of substances , but also across different periods of time , " curator emily sergeant said , while pointing to bamboo opium pipe , a plastic ashtray from the 1970s and some fly agaric mushrooms , which she said are illegal in the uk . spiders on caffeine a particularly compelling part of the exhibition , however , is not directly related to artist - but to spiders . bildunterschrift : the webs may not be functional for catching flies , but they could be considered art -lrb- left to right : benzedrine , caffeine , marijuana -rrb- three graphics are taken from a series of experiments carried out by nasa on arachnids given doses of the amphetamine benzedrine , caffeine and marijuana .
their web-making ability was then assessed and the results are curious : the spider on caffeine created the most unconventional web . in the other two cases the usual web structure was visible at the beginning of the process .
but the caffeine-fuelled spider was noticeably less systematic and its web had large gaps and no circular center , making it essentially non-functional . the survival of the artist , however , is admittedly less dependent on the functionality of his product and more on its aesthetic appeal .
during the 19th century , a large number of writers , artists and scientists experimented with mind-altering substances - many of them legal at the time - to find out what kind of experience they could have . " we have an example from france and the club des hashischins , a group of artists and writers who met under the guidance of a scientist , jacques moreau , and were administered a quantity of hashish and these experiences are recorded , " explained sergeant .
" moreau was interested in the effects of this substance on the genius : what would happen to an already extraordinary mind if it were altered in some way ? " first opium confession thomas de quincy may have been a genius , but his autobiographical " confessions of an english opium eater " from 1821 certainly influenced many creative minds , including composer hector berlioz , whose " symphonie fantastique " was inspired by it . " this was really the beginning of the modern european drug culture in many ways .
this was the first time that someone had written about their life in terms of their drug-taking and talked about what it was like to be an opium addict , " said mike jay , the exhibition 's co-curator and author of the accompanying book . bildunterschrift : this 1823 painting , " doctor and mrs syntax , " satirizes the trend of hosting nitrous oxide parties . these days , it 's practically a rite of passage for musicians to get arrested for possession of illegal drugs , but two centuries ago , composers were using drugs for a different reason : to enhance their ability to dream up new sounds , combinations of chords and assembling huge orchestras . " if you look at -lsb- french romantic composer hector -rsb- berlioz at the time , he was taking opium and writing about an opium dream , but actually he was in a very over-stimulated visionary state for about a year , hardly sleeping at all , " jay said .
" he was probably taking the opium to calm down .
so sometimes when we see creative people writing about drugs and taking drugs , the relationship is n't as it appears . " ' no nirvana of inspiration ' the exhibition is careful to avoid taking a position on drug use .
according to sergeant , there is a connection between drugs and art , but it is unclear whether drugs improve on talent . " it does n't seem from the material that we 've looked at that it is the answer to anything , " she said .
" there is no nirvana of inspiration that any one drug has unlocked .
but they have played this very important role in the lives of artists , writers and scientists throughout history .

“ this workshop was part of gtz ’ s supranational project ‘ convomujer – combating violence against women in peru , ecuador , bolivia and paraguay ’ , ” says dw-akademie project manager , vera möller-holtkamp .
education , prevention and solidarity are the main project goals .
the radio reports resulting from this particular workshop are also aimed at encouraging afflicted women to seek help .
journalists from community radio stations belonging to the peruvian umbrella organization coordinadora nacional de radio -lrb- cnr -rrb- came from various regions to attend the workshop held in the capital , lima .

dw-akademie director gerda meuer was invited to speak at a two-day conference held in the bhutan capital , thimphu . “ the challenges of public service broadcasting ” was the title of the media conference organized in november by the bhutan centre for media and democracy and the bhutan broadcasting service -lrb- bbs -rrb- , the country ’ s sole television broadcaster .
politicians , media representatives and academics – the majority from bhutan itself – came to thimphu to discuss the challenges .
also invited were experts from thailand , the philippines and ireland , and gerda meuer , director of dw-akademie , from germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meuer looked back at 60 years of german public broadcasting .
“ following world war ii the allies wanted to create a media system in germany that was decentralized , politically and economically independent , and that represented all layers of society .
they wanted an open dialogue for everyone , ” she said .
she explained the structure of the german public broadcasting system and described the functions of the various broadcasting boards .
but , she warned , “ one can not simply copy the models of other countries and transfer them to one ’ s own .
the goal is to find a system that best suits one ’ s own country . ”
with its strategic importance , bhutan is the size of switzerland and lies between china and india .
800,000 inhabitants live in the kingdom which the monarch is aiming to restructure into a democracy – in harmony with a unique political philosophy .
traditionally , the country ’ s leader is committed to the “ gross national happiness ” , where each political decision has to be in line with the individual ’ s and society ’ s well-being .
this is quite different to the western idea of growth .
accordingly , the media workshop in thimphu developed recommendations which would make it possible to transform the bhutanese state broadcaster into a public broadcaster .
“ now our primary objective is to create our own understanding of public service broadcasting , ” said pema choden , bbs director .
“ at the same time we need to find our own role within the new political context . ”

one of the focal points of the meeting is to be how to handle possible future debt crises in eurozone countries , such as the ones currently facing greece and ireland .
merkel insisted that no european country would be left behind should it face similar dire financial straits .
" no one in europe will be left alone , no one in europe will be abandoned , " merkel said .
" europe succeeds when it acts together and , i would add , europe succeeds only when it acts together . "
merkel accused of mishandling the situation the debate about the eu summit revealed a split in the german parliament over the issue of how to handle europe .
following merkel ’ s speech , the opposition social democratic party , the greens and the left party distanced themselves from merkel ’ s strategy . the head of the social democratic party bloc , frank-walter steinmeier said the government was sending out unclear signals , and that merkel ’ s hesitance had put germany ’ s commitment to european solidarity in doubt . merkel also came under attack from the head of the left party , gesine loetzsch .
she said the chancellor was rushing from one disaster to the next , whilst trying to give the impression that the situation was under control . " what we need now is investment in the future of europe , " loetzsch said .
crisis-proof euro after being forced to help bail out greece earlier this year , the european union created a financial rescue fund to be triggered in case of any future debt crisis .
ireland became the first country to access the fund last month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she believed in the strength of the euro some believe that the 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 997 billion -rrb- in the bailout fund wo n't be enough - particularly if financially troubled countries like spain or portugal are also forced to dip into it in the near future . according to some analysts , this could , in turn , threaten the eurozone itself , but chancellor merkel played down concerns about the eurozone 's common currency .
" it is undeniable that some eurozone countries face difficult challenges but it is also undeniable that the euro has shown itself to be crisis-proof , " she said .
spain causes market wobbles as if to illustrate the concerns about the potential for further bailouts , ratings agency moody ’ s warned spain on wednesday that its debt could be downgraded .
the euro slid in reaction to the news , while the borrowing costs of spain and portugal rose slightly .
the ratings agency standard and poor ’ s made a similar warning to belgium on tuesday . analysts have questioned whether the current fund would be sufficient to bailout spain , the eurozone 's fourth largest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's unemployment rate has topped 20 percent moody 's said it was concerned about spain 's high debt funding needs , its heavily indebted banks and its regional finances , but it did not expect madrid would have to follow greece and ireland in seeking an eu bailout . the portuguese government announced moves to cut red tape and boost growth , and said it would soon adopt quarterly fiscal targets , part of a broad effort to convince eu officials and financial markets it does not need a bailout . european commission president jose manuel barroso urged leaders to act fast to reach a consensus at the summit . germany pledges support for ecb meanwhile , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- is expected to ask euro zone member states for more capital , a move to lower its leverage as it helps tackle the debt crisis . that issue may be discussed among eu leaders on thursday , when they will be joined for dinner by ecb president jean-claude trichet .
the ecb has come under pressure to step up its bond-buying program to help the likes of ireland , greece and portugal . germany said it would support giving the ecb more capital , with an official saying the move would show financial markets that the central bank had the firepower to buy new government bonds if needed .
no support for european bonds jean-claude juncker , prime minister of luxembourg and the chairman of the group of eurozone finance ministers recently floated the idea of a common european bond to help relieve pressure on weaker members of the eurozone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker likes the idea of a single european bond merkel has been staunchly opposed to this proposal and reiterated her resistance again on wednesday .
she said that what she described as a " collectivization of risk " among eurozone nations would be a mistake .
germany fears that if adopted , eurobonds would significantly raise its borrowing costs , which are currently among the lowest in europe .
a report published in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday estimated the cost for germany of a common eurozone bond to be at least 17 billion euros annually .

dw-world.de eurobond proposals wo n't go away chancellor merkel has dismissed calls for the eurozone to pool sovereign debt due to the high costs it would impose on germany .

some 300 serbian journalists , broadcast technicians , and media managers have participated in workshops since then . ten years of media development in serbia – a good reason for dw-akademie and former participants to take stock of the work achieved so far and to look ahead .
at the end of november the europe and central asia division invited alumni to a conference in belgrade .
the goal was to combine an informal get-together with a one-day workshop involving groups and discussions on dw-akademie ’ s performance .
“ what are we doing well and what can we do better ? ” were the central questions posed to twenty serbian journalists from all regions in the country .
the alumni gave top praise to dw-akademie ’ s advanced training in areas such as interview training , environmental reporting and online journalism .
additional plus points were given for discussions with german experts and networking with other participants .
starting in 2011 , a new , regional dw-akademie blog will support this exchange online .
the alumni also had suggestions for future projects .
one participant proposed the joint construction of an exchange platform for radio and television reports .
others hoped for more involvement of upper management in the projects to help overcome management ’ s reluctance to work with new ideas .
participants mentioned other barriers making it difficult to implement what they had learned including a lack of finances and time , as well as political pressure .
“ we really appreciate the feedback and now have new ideas which we ’ ll include in our upcoming projects , ” says filip slavkovic who coordinates dw-akademie projects in southeastern europe .
further workshops together with the osce media department are planned for serbia starting at the beginning of 2011 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some 300 serbian journalists , broadcast technicians , and media managers have participated in workshops since then . ten years of media development in serbia – a good reason for dw-akademie and former participants to take stock of the work achieved so far and to look ahead .
at the end of november the europe and central asia division invited alumni to a conference in belgrade .
the goal was to combine an informal get-together with a one-day workshop involving groups and discussions on dw-akademie ’ s performance .
“ what are we doing well and what can we do better ? ” were the central questions posed to twenty serbian journalists from all regions in the country .
the alumni gave top praise to dw-akademie ’ s advanced training in areas such as interview training , environmental reporting and online journalism .
additional plus points were given for discussions with german experts and networking with other participants .
starting in 2011 , a new , regional dw-akademie blog will support this exchange online .
the alumni also had suggestions for future projects .
one participant proposed the joint construction of an exchange platform for radio and television reports .
others hoped for more involvement of upper management in the projects to help overcome management ’ s reluctance to work with new ideas .
participants mentioned other barriers making it difficult to implement what they had learned including a lack of finances and time , as well as political pressure .
“ we really appreciate the feedback and now have new ideas which we ’ ll include in our upcoming projects , ” says filip slavkovic who coordinates dw-akademie projects in southeastern europe .
further workshops together with the osce media department are planned for serbia starting at the beginning of 2011 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they arrested around 1,000 young people at the kievsky railway station , where a big clash was reportedly being planned and organized over the internet .
many of the youths chanted far-right slogans and raised their right arms in nazi-style salutes .
police say they confiscated many weapons .
the police closed a major shopping mall and the subway station at the site , and passers-by were said to be fleeing the area .
the kievsky station is a popular location for traders from the caucasus to sell their wares .
the planned riot followed unrest last saturday , in which some 5,000 football fans and members of far-right groups rioted outside the kremlin . they were protesting police handling of the killing of the 28-year-old spartak moscow fan yegor sviridov the previous week .
widespread resentment of immigrants gangs of muslims were reported to be planning a counter-rally at the kievsky station , and russian nationalists were said to be preparing to clash with them .
according to reports , in spite of the police action , small groups fought with each other , using iron bars and baseball bats .
similar events were reported from other cities , such as saint petersburg and samara .
the unrest marks a new stage in the resentment of immigration to russia 's big cities from the southern republics and central asia .
every year dozens of immigrant workers , who are accused of taking jobs from local people at low rates of pay , are murdered .
the moscow city administration has been under pressure to limit the number of migrants and to give their jobs to ethnic russians .

mikhail khodorkovsky is standing trial on charges of embezzling oil worth billions of dollars . a russian court has unexpectedly delayed the delivery of a verdict for imprisoned oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky - formerly russia 's richest man - who faces charges of stealing over 200 tons of oil from his own wells .
a court spokesperson did not give a reason for the delay , but said the verdict would now be handed down on december 27 .
lawyers for khodorkovsky said they had not been informed of the decision to delay the verdict .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 15.12.2010 artists have n't abandoned search for psychedelic nirvana of inspiration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artists have often tried to capture their hallucinations from victorian use of cocaine eye-drops to amy winehouse 's reliance on horse sedatives , creative minds have sought out psychedelic experiences for centuries .
but does doping make for better art ? from poetry to pop music , the question has been asked repeatedly over the years : can mind-altering substances enhance an artist 's performance ? an exhibition currently taking place at london 's wellcome institute examines the huge influence dope has had on the arts - and artists of all kinds - across the ages . " there is a huge range not only of substances , but also across different periods of time , " curator emily sergeant said , while pointing to bamboo opium pipe , a plastic ashtray from the 1970s and some fly agaric mushrooms , which she said are illegal in the uk . spiders on caffeine a particularly compelling part of the exhibition , however , is not directly related to artist - but to spiders . bildunterschrift : the webs may not be functional for catching flies , but they could be considered art -lrb- left to right : benzedrine , caffeine , marijuana -rrb- three graphics are taken from a series of experiments carried out by nasa on arachnids given doses of the amphetamine benzedrine , caffeine and marijuana .
their web-making ability was then assessed and the results are curious : the spider on caffeine created the most unconventional web . in the other two cases the usual web structure was visible at the beginning of the process .
but the caffeine-fuelled spider was noticeably less systematic and its web had large gaps and no circular center , making it essentially non-functional . the survival of the artist , however , is admittedly less dependent on the functionality of his product and more on its aesthetic appeal .
during the 19th century , a large number of writers , artists and scientists experimented with mind-altering substances - many of them legal at the time - to find out what kind of experience they could have . " we have an example from france and the club des hashischins , a group of artists and writers who met under the guidance of a scientist , jacques moreau , and were administered a quantity of hashish and these experiences are recorded , " explained sergeant .
" moreau was interested in the effects of this substance on the genius : what would happen to an already extraordinary mind if it were altered in some way ? " first opium confession thomas de quincy may have been a genius , but his autobiographical " confessions of an english opium eater " from 1821 certainly influenced many creative minds , including composer hector berlioz , whose " symphonie fantastique " was inspired by it . " this was really the beginning of the modern european drug culture in many ways .
this was the first time that someone had written about their life in terms of their drug-taking and talked about what it was like to be an opium addict , " said mike jay , the exhibition 's co-curator and author of the accompanying book . bildunterschrift : this 1823 painting , " doctor and mrs syntax , " satirizes the trend of hosting nitrous oxide parties . these days , it 's practically a rite of passage for musicians to get arrested for possession of illegal drugs , but two centuries ago , composers were using drugs for a different reason : to enhance their ability to dream up new sounds , combinations of chords and assembling huge orchestras . " if you look at -lsb- french romantic composer hector -rsb- berlioz at the time , he was taking opium and writing about an opium dream , but actually he was in a very over-stimulated visionary state for about a year , hardly sleeping at all , " jay said .
" he was probably taking the opium to calm down .
so sometimes when we see creative people writing about drugs and taking drugs , the relationship is n't as it appears . " ' no nirvana of inspiration ' the exhibition is careful to avoid taking a position on drug use .
according to sergeant , there is a connection between drugs and art , but it is unclear whether drugs improve on talent . " it does n't seem from the material that we 've looked at that it is the answer to anything , " she said .
" there is no nirvana of inspiration that any one drug has unlocked .
but they have played this very important role in the lives of artists , writers and scientists throughout history .

but does doping make for better art ? from poetry to pop music , the question has been asked repeatedly over the years : can mind-altering substances enhance an artist 's performance ? an exhibition currently taking place at london 's wellcome institute examines the huge influence dope has had on the arts - and artists of all kinds - across the ages . " there is a huge range not only of substances , but also across different periods of time , " curator emily sergeant said , while pointing to bamboo opium pipe , a plastic ashtray from the 1970s and some fly agaric mushrooms , which she said are illegal in the uk . spiders on caffeine a particularly compelling part of the exhibition , however , is not directly related to artist - but to spiders . bildunterschrift : the webs may not be functional for catching flies , but they could be considered art -lrb- left to right : benzedrine , caffeine , marijuana -rrb- three graphics are taken from a series of experiments carried out by nasa on arachnids given doses of the amphetamine benzedrine , caffeine and marijuana .
their web-making ability was then assessed and the results are curious : the spider on caffeine created the most unconventional web . in the other two cases the usual web structure was visible at the beginning of the process .
but the caffeine-fuelled spider was noticeably less systematic and its web had large gaps and no circular center , making it essentially non-functional . the survival of the artist , however , is admittedly less dependent on the functionality of his product and more on its aesthetic appeal .
during the 19th century , a large number of writers , artists and scientists experimented with mind-altering substances - many of them legal at the time - to find out what kind of experience they could have . " we have an example from france and the club des hashischins , a group of artists and writers who met under the guidance of a scientist , jacques moreau , and were administered a quantity of hashish and these experiences are recorded , " explained sergeant .
" moreau was interested in the effects of this substance on the genius : what would happen to an already extraordinary mind if it were altered in some way ? " first opium confession thomas de quincy may have been a genius , but his autobiographical " confessions of an english opium eater " from 1821 certainly influenced many creative minds , including composer hector berlioz , whose " symphonie fantastique " was inspired by it . " this was really the beginning of the modern european drug culture in many ways .
this was the first time that someone had written about their life in terms of their drug-taking and talked about what it was like to be an opium addict , " said mike jay , the exhibition 's co-curator and author of the accompanying book . bildunterschrift : this 1823 painting , " doctor and mrs syntax , " satirizes the trend of hosting nitrous oxide parties . these days , it 's practically a rite of passage for musicians to get arrested for possession of illegal drugs , but two centuries ago , composers were using drugs for a different reason : to enhance their ability to dream up new sounds , combinations of chords and assembling huge orchestras . " if you look at -lsb- french romantic composer hector -rsb- berlioz at the time , he was taking opium and writing about an opium dream , but actually he was in a very over-stimulated visionary state for about a year , hardly sleeping at all , " jay said .
" he was probably taking the opium to calm down .
so sometimes when we see creative people writing about drugs and taking drugs , the relationship is n't as it appears . " ' no nirvana of inspiration ' the exhibition is careful to avoid taking a position on drug use .
according to sergeant , there is a connection between drugs and art , but it is unclear whether drugs improve on talent . " it does n't seem from the material that we 've looked at that it is the answer to anything , " she said .
" there is no nirvana of inspiration that any one drug has unlocked .
but they have played this very important role in the lives of artists , writers and scientists throughout history .

mikhail khodorkovsky is standing trial on charges of embezzling oil worth billions of dollars . a russian court has unexpectedly delayed the delivery of a verdict for imprisoned oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky - formerly russia 's richest man - who faces charges of stealing over 200 tons of oil from his own wells .
a court spokesperson did not give a reason for the delay , but said the verdict would now be handed down on december 27 .
lawyers for khodorkovsky said they had not been informed of the decision to delay the verdict .
since his incarceration , khodorkovsky has been russia 's highest-profile inmate .
the 47-year-old khodorkovsky has been an outspoken critic of the kremlin , and particularly of prime minister vladimir putin .
the former oil billionaire , who was a major shareholder in failed petroleum company yukos , is already serving an eight-year sentence for tax evasion , which is set to expire in 2011 .
if found guilty of the fresh charges , he faces an additional six years in prison .
if found innocent , his release could come just months ahead of the next russian presidential election .
khodorkovsky 's year-and-a-half trial has been the subject of intense international scrutiny , particularly from the united states and germany , which accuse the kremlin of staging a political show trial with no legal basis .
russia analysts have kept a close eye on the khodorkovsky case , which they say could be a major indicator of president dmitry medvedev 's progress in reforming the country 's judicial system .

ecologists still hope they will be able to overturn the decision . moscow has approved a plan to build a highway through a forest outside the capital , in defiance of protests that had become a rallying cause for the opposition . demonstrations against the construction of a highway between moscow and st. petersburg had prompted president dmitry medvedev to postpone the project , in what many observers saw as a nod by the state to popular pressure . but deputy prime minister sergei ivanov said the government commission tasked with investigating the project had given its green light to the plan .
transport minister igor levitin said the road would be built by the end of 2013 , according to russian news agencies . the commission approved building the highway after " taking into account all the factors - transport , economic , social and legal , " ivanov , who headed the panel , said in comments broadcast on state television . " we believe that from the judicial point of view the proposed route is completely legal , " he said . environmental compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposing the government can be dangerous in russia ivanov added that four billion rubles -lrb- $ 130 million , 98 million euros -rrb- would be paid as compensation for the ecological damage to the khimki forest and that some 500 hectares -lrb- 1,200 acres -rrb- of new forest would be planted to replace the 100 destroyed . but ecologists continue to decry the project for destroying the area of mixed woods and marshes that play an important part in a sensitive forest , which is a haven for wildlife in the heavily built-up moscow region . " this is a birds ' paradise , " yevgenia chirikova , who for months has organized protests against the highway 's construction , told deutsche welle .
" there is a protected marsh area where we can find moose and wild boar .
even though one can drive from here to the kremlin in 25 minutes , we do have really wild places here . " while chirikova admitted a new highway connecting russia two largest cities is necessary , she added that despite presidential promises , the public had been left out of discussions on how work should proceed in the woods where peter the great 's father once hunted . " medvedev promised us public discussions : there were none .
he promised to listen to public experts : let 's hear them ! " she said . risks of opposition protests against the highway grew in magnitude over summer , culminating in a rare thousands-strong rally in central moscow in august led by veteran russian rocker and kremlin critic yury shevchuk . environmental activism remains a risky undertaking in russia .
police have broken up protests against the highway and journalists accusing the government of corruption in connection with the road 's construction have come under attack . mikhail beketov , the editor-in-chief of the local newspaper khimkinskaya pravda , was beaten by unknown assailants in 2008 so severely that he is now partially paralyzed , suffers from brain damage , has difficulty speaking and lost four fingers and part of his leg .
the attack came shortly after beketov had published an article in which he accused local officials of corruption . oleg kashin , a journalist for the kommersant daily , covered the issue and was beaten in an attack in november that was condemned around the world .
activist konstantin fetisov was also badly injured in an attack with a baseball bat in the same month and remains in a coma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beketov is partially paralyzed after being beaten over two years ago bigger than a highway the government 's response to the protests shows that the highway issue has expanded beyond an environmental concern , chirikova said . " the khimki forest is no longer just an environmental problem , " she said .
" there is an environmental side to it .
but this is a problem of corruption . " chirikova , who has been arrested a number of times for her work , said she felt threatened and worried for her two children and husband , who had his ribs broken in an attack . however , she added that she remained convinced that cutting down the forest 's trees was illegal , bad for her town and her country .
according to an opinion poll , three quarters of russians agree with her . " if we do n't fight and stand up for our rights , and keep silent about such crimes against beketov and fetisov , then this will lead us straight back to stalin 's gulag , " she said .
" as citizens we must realize that we can not run anywhere .
we can not go to the police or the prosecutor 's office , nobody will defend us .

one of the focal points of the meeting is to be how to handle possible future debt crises in eurozone countries , such as the ones currently facing greece and ireland .
merkel insisted that no european country would be left behind should it face similar dire financial straits .
" no one in europe will be left alone , no one in europe will be abandoned , " merkel said .
" europe succeeds when it acts together and , i would add , europe succeeds only when it acts together . "
merkel accused of mishandling the situation the debate about the eu summit revealed a split in the german parliament over the issue of how to handle europe .
following merkel ’ s speech , the opposition social democratic party , the greens and the left party distanced themselves from merkel ’ s strategy . the head of the social democratic party bloc , frank-walter steinmeier said the government was sending out unclear signals , and that merkel ’ s hesitance had put germany ’ s commitment to european solidarity in doubt . merkel also came under attack from the head of the left party , gesine loetzsch .
she said the chancellor was rushing from one disaster to the next , whilst trying to give the impression that the situation was under control . " what we need now is investment in the future of europe , " loetzsch said .
crisis-proof euro after being forced to help bail out greece earlier this year , the european union created a financial rescue fund to be triggered in case of any future debt crisis .
ireland became the first country to access the fund last month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she believed in the strength of the euro some believe that the 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 997 billion -rrb- in the bailout fund wo n't be enough - particularly if financially troubled countries like spain or portugal are also forced to dip into it in the near future . according to some analysts , this could , in turn , threaten the eurozone itself , but chancellor merkel played down concerns about the eurozone 's common currency .
" it is undeniable that some eurozone countries face difficult challenges but it is also undeniable that the euro has shown itself to be crisis-proof , " she said .
spain causes market wobbles as if to illustrate the concerns about the potential for further bailouts , ratings agency moody ’ s warned spain on wednesday that its debt could be downgraded .
the euro slid in reaction to the news , while the borrowing costs of spain and portugal rose slightly .
the ratings agency standard and poor ’ s made a similar warning to belgium on tuesday . analysts have questioned whether the current fund would be sufficient to bailout spain , the eurozone 's fourth largest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's unemployment rate has topped 20 percent moody 's said it was concerned about spain 's high debt funding needs , its heavily indebted banks and its regional finances , but it did not expect madrid would have to follow greece and ireland in seeking an eu bailout . the portuguese government announced moves to cut red tape and boost growth , and said it would soon adopt quarterly fiscal targets , part of a broad effort to convince eu officials and financial markets it does not need a bailout . european commission president jose manuel barroso urged leaders to act fast to reach a consensus at the summit . germany pledges support for ecb meanwhile , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- is expected to ask euro zone member states for more capital , a move to lower its leverage as it helps tackle the debt crisis . that issue may be discussed among eu leaders on thursday , when they will be joined for dinner by ecb president jean-claude trichet .
the ecb has come under pressure to step up its bond-buying program to help the likes of ireland , greece and portugal . germany said it would support giving the ecb more capital , with an official saying the move would show financial markets that the central bank had the firepower to buy new government bonds if needed .
no support for european bonds jean-claude juncker , prime minister of luxembourg and the chairman of the group of eurozone finance ministers recently floated the idea of a common european bond to help relieve pressure on weaker members of the eurozone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker likes the idea of a single european bond merkel has been staunchly opposed to this proposal and reiterated her resistance again on wednesday .
she said that what she described as a " collectivization of risk " among eurozone nations would be a mistake .
germany fears that if adopted , eurobonds would significantly raise its borrowing costs , which are currently among the lowest in europe .
a report published in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday estimated the cost for germany of a common eurozone bond to be at least 17 billion euros annually .

greek public sector workers are on a 24-hour strike to protest against government austerity measures . a public sector strike in greece was marred by violence on wednesday with angry protesters throwing rocks , bottles and firebombs at riot police who retaliated with tear gas .
the clashes occurred near the country 's finance ministry , where demonstrators had hurled a fire bomb into the second floor of the building setting part of it on fire . the protests were part of a 24-hour public sector strike directed against a series of austerity measures .
the cuts are being implemented by the greek government to rein in the spending as part of a bailout for the debt-stricken country , financed by the european union and the international monetary fund . many public sector workers would see their salaries cut and pension benefits reduced if the full force of the budget measures is implemented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strikes caused traffic backups in athens the strike has severely impacted transportation networks .
flights in and out of the country have been grounded , ships remain anchored in greek harbors , and train lines are not running .

year of strikes wednesday 's strikes are n't the first to take place in greece against the government 's budget reduction plans .

the strikes and protests come ahead of a summit of eu leaders in brussels on thursday and friday to discuss expanding the eurozone 's financial rescue fund for possible future cases of extreme debt similar to that experienced by greece .
so far , ireland has been the only nation to access the fund , but speculation that spain and portugal will soon follow has raised the question whether the 750-billion-euro bailout fund will be sufficient .

some 300 serbian journalists , broadcast technicians , and media managers have participated in workshops since then . ten years of media development in serbia – a good reason for dw-akademie and former participants to take stock of the work achieved so far and to look ahead .
at the end of november the europe and central asia division invited alumni to a conference in belgrade .
the goal was to combine an informal get-together with a one-day workshop involving groups and discussions on dw-akademie ’ s performance .
“ what are we doing well and what can we do better ? ” were the central questions posed to twenty serbian journalists from all regions in the country .
the alumni gave top praise to dw-akademie ’ s advanced training in areas such as interview training , environmental reporting and online journalism .
additional plus points were given for discussions with german experts and networking with other participants .
starting in 2011 , a new , regional dw-akademie blog will support this exchange online .
the alumni also had suggestions for future projects .
one participant proposed the joint construction of an exchange platform for radio and television reports .
others hoped for more involvement of upper management in the projects to help overcome management ’ s reluctance to work with new ideas .
participants mentioned other barriers making it difficult to implement what they had learned including a lack of finances and time , as well as political pressure .
“ we really appreciate the feedback and now have new ideas which we ’ ll include in our upcoming projects , ” says filip slavkovic who coordinates dw-akademie projects in southeastern europe .
further workshops together with the osce media department are planned for serbia starting at the beginning of 2011 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as a result , the last draft will be on january 3 , 2011 . the german government on wednesday approved the plans of its defense minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , to reduce the size of the german military , the bundeswehr , by 65,000 soldiers to 185,000 . included in the reform are plans to suspend conscription from july 1 next year .
this means that the last young men will receive their draft notices on january 3 , ending a practice which goes back to 1957 and the start of german rearmament after world war ii .
the government has decided only to suspend the draft and not to abolish it .
abolition would require a change to the constitution , and the provision will remain in case a general call-up becomes necessary in a time of crisis .
the new armed forces will include 170,000 professional soldiers and 15,000 volunteers , who will serve for up to 23 months . guttenberg argues that a smaller bundeswehr will be more effective in dealing with modern military challenges .
a smaller military is still too expensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense minister has pushed for an end to conscription the plans are being made at a time when the military is under financial pressure . finance minister wolfgang schaeuble wants the defense ministry to save 8.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.2 billion -rrb- by 2014 .
the defense minister says he ca n't meet that target without reducing size of the military to 160,000 .
the suspension of conscription is expected to lead to an increase in the number of young people wanting to go to university .
the german states , which are responsible for financing education , say they are not prepared to pay the additional cost .
the chairman of the conference of state premiers , wolfgang boehmer , said that , if the central government created the financial burden , it should be prepared to discuss paying for it .
the suspension is also expected to lead to extra costs for social service providers , who have so far benefitted from the civilian service alternative to the draft . the cabinet also agreed on a new program of voluntary civil service , but the minister for families , kristina schroeder , has already said that it will not fill the gap completely .

however , scientists caution that this procedure can only be replicated in certain circumstances and merits further study . in a new study , german researchers have confirmed that an american man living in berlin was successfully cured of his hiv infection after having received a blood stem cell transplant in 2007 .
" in conclusion , our results strongly suggest that cure of hiv has been achieved in this patient , " the researchers write in the abstract to their paper , which was published last week in blood , a medical journal .
the new paper is a follow-up study by the same german team to one they had published in the new england journal of medicine in february 2009 .
that study found " the patient remained without viral rebound 20 months after transplantation and discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy . "

three years ago , timothy ray brown had been an hiv-positive leukemia patient .

at the time huetter specifically was looking for bone marrow stem cell donors that contained the rare ccr5 deletion .
since his treatment , the so-called " berlin patient " has been effectively cured of aids and its disease-causing virus , hiv , but also leukemia .
this likely makes him the first , and so far , only person ever to have been cured of hiv , out of more than 30 million currently infected people worldwide .
scientists have previously seen a very small number of cases where the virus does not replicate inside the host and therefore does not cause aids .

as a result , the last draft will be on january 3 , 2011 . the german government on wednesday approved the plans of its defense minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , to reduce the size of the german military , the bundeswehr , by 65,000 soldiers to 185,000 . included in the reform are plans to suspend conscription from july 1 next year .
this means that the last young men will receive their draft notices on january 3 , ending a practice which goes back to 1957 and the start of german rearmament after world war ii .
the government has decided only to suspend the draft and not to abolish it .
abolition would require a change to the constitution , and the provision will remain in case a general call-up becomes necessary in a time of crisis .
the new armed forces will include 170,000 professional soldiers and 15,000 volunteers , who will serve for up to 23 months . guttenberg argues that a smaller bundeswehr will be more effective in dealing with modern military challenges .
a smaller military is still too expensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense minister has pushed for an end to conscription the plans are being made at a time when the military is under financial pressure . finance minister wolfgang schaeuble wants the defense ministry to save 8.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.2 billion -rrb- by 2014 .
the defense minister says he ca n't meet that target without reducing size of the military to 160,000 .
the suspension of conscription is expected to lead to an increase in the number of young people wanting to go to university .
the german states , which are responsible for financing education , say they are not prepared to pay the additional cost .
the chairman of the conference of state premiers , wolfgang boehmer , said that , if the central government created the financial burden , it should be prepared to discuss paying for it .
the suspension is also expected to lead to extra costs for social service providers , who have so far benefitted from the civilian service alternative to the draft . the cabinet also agreed on a new program of voluntary civil service , but the minister for families , kristina schroeder , has already said that it will not fill the gap completely .

in 1991 , the pro-democracy activist received the nobel peace prize .
the 65-year old has spent 15 of the last 21 years in detention .
deutsche welle : what is your daily routine these days ?
aung san suu kyi : my daily routine is very , very hectic .
if i look back at today , i had about two , three appointments this morning and two in the afternoon , and i still have n't finished my work yet .
so , it is extremely hectic .
what kind of appointments are these ?
i am meeting diplomats , i am meeting political parties , i am meeting individuals , we have our national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- office meetings .
then i am speaking to people on the phone .
and there are individual journalists and correspondents , who have managed to come to burma , and i have to meet them as well .
what was the biggest change you noticed in your city after your house arrest was lifted ?
i think the number of hand phones !
the moment i was released , i saw all those people with their hand phones which they were using to take photographs .
i think what it means is that there is an improvement in communications .
and what about the burmese society ?
did you find any other changes ?
prices have gone up sky-high , and people are very concerned about it .
everybody talks about the rise in prices .
also , the attitude of the young people has improved considerably .
they want to be involved in the political process , and they are much more outgoing and proactive than they were seven years ago .
when you were released , it was striking that many young people turned up to greet you .
what are your expectations from the youth of burma ?
it is for them to understand that it is up to them to bring change to our country , and that they should not depend on me or the nld or anybody else .
we will do our best , but in the end i want them to have this self-confidence to believe that they can do it for themselves .
how do you see the future of your party , the national league for democracy ?
we are going to stand as a political force because we have the full support of the people .
of course , the authorities are trying to deregister our party , and i am contesting that at court , but that is a legal matter .
the real political truth of the situation is that we have the confidence , the trust and the support of the people , and that will keep us going as the most important opposition force in burma today .
have you tried to get in touch with the government after your release ?
no , not yet .
i have , of course , been sending indirect messages through almost every speech i have made , every interview i have had , that i would like to have dialogue .
i think we should discuss our differences and come to an agreement that we should be prepared to compromise on both sides .
but why have n't you taken any concrete step to initiate this kind of a dialogue ?
we are waiting for the right time , which i hope is not too far off .
burma is a country with many ethnic minorities , whose relationship with the majority has been rather tense over the recent decades .
what do you plan to do to reach out to these groups ?
we have been reaching out to these groups for a number of years , and i can claim that we have had a certain amount of success .
not only do we have very strong allies among the parties which contested the 1990 elections , we also have the support of other ethnic groups , including the ceasefire groups along the frontiers , who have expressed an interest in what we are trying to do - to revive the spirit of true union .
last week , the nobel peace prize for the chinese democracy activist liu xiaobo turned into a major international controversy .
what is your reaction , being a nobel laureate yourself ?
i have a great respect for the norwegian nobel committee , and i believe they must have sound reasons for choosing to give him the award this year .
i personally do n't know much about liu xiabo because i have been under house arrest for about seven years , and all i know about him is that what i heard on the radio .
but i do believe that the nobel committee must have sound reasons for selecting him .
in europe , people are wondering what they can do to support burma .
what is your advice ?
first of all , it would be very helpful if all the countries of europe could speak with one voice .
even within the european union there are different attitudes and different voices , and i think that weakens the -lsb- burmese -rsb- opposition .
it would help us a great deal if all european countries called for certain steps to be taken in burma - the release of political prisoners , inclusiveness of the political process , specifically with the nld , and negotiations .
do you have any specific european countries in mind , which you want to see more active in this ?
as i am talking to you in germany - i would like germany to be more active .
you said in previous interviews that you will need time to form an opinion about international sanctions against the burmese regime .
what is your impression so far on this matter ?
so far , i have not got the impression that economic sanctions have really hurt the public , but of course there are other voices that are perhaps still waiting to be heard , so we have yet to find out .
i have been released just for over a month , and i have n't had time to go into this issue ; i am waiting to read the latest report of the imf , and perhaps the adb and other economic institutions .
how influential is the west in burma ?
compared with that , how do you see india 's and china 's role ?
i think the role of the west in burma and the role of india and china are quite different .
i would not like to think of them as competing for influence , or competing for ascendancy over burma .
it is not as though we were not able to shape our own destiny .
but certainly , because india and china are very close neighbors , they have a certain advantage over those countries that are situated very far away .
does this mean that what the west does with regard to burma is not so important ?
no , it has its importance , depending on how and what actions the west is taking , which is why i said earlier that it would be good if all the western nations could coordinate their efforts .
not just the western nations , it would be good if the whole international community , including the united nations , coordinated its efforts .
that would help us very greatly indeed , and if it called for the same basic steps , that would mean progress .
what are your expectations from india and china ?
we would like them to engage with us .
to begin with , we 'd very much like india and china to give us the opportunity to explain our point of view to them .
we have very little contact with china and india .
we have more contact with the indian government than with the chinese government , in fact i do n't think we have any contact with the chinese government at all .
we would like to have contact with them , we would like them to listen to our side of the story , and make them understand that we look upon them as neighbors , and that we would like to be friends with them .
we are not hostile to them even if we are working for democracy in burma .
what are your plans for the coming weeks ?
the man that i fear most in the world is the man who keeps my appointment book .
i have n't gone through next week 's appointments with him ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 15.12.2010 germany to cease drafting military conscripts next month großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 'll be fewer soldiers on parade in future the german cabinet has agreed a reform which will reduce the size of the military and suspend compulsory service from july on .
as a result , the last draft will be on january 3 , 2011 . the german government on wednesday approved the plans of its defense minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , to reduce the size of the german military , the bundeswehr , by 65,000 soldiers to 185,000 . included in the reform are plans to suspend conscription from july 1 next year .
this means that the last young men will receive their draft notices on january 3 , ending a practice which goes back to 1957 and the start of german rearmament after world war ii .
the government has decided only to suspend the draft and not to abolish it .
abolition would require a change to the constitution , and the provision will remain in case a general call-up becomes necessary in a time of crisis .
the new armed forces will include 170,000 professional soldiers and 15,000 volunteers , who will serve for up to 23 months . guttenberg argues that a smaller bundeswehr will be more effective in dealing with modern military challenges .

as a result , the last draft will be on january 3 , 2011 . the german government on wednesday approved the plans of its defense minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , to reduce the size of the german military , the bundeswehr , by 65,000 soldiers to 185,000 . included in the reform are plans to suspend conscription from july 1 next year .
this means that the last young men will receive their draft notices on january 3 , ending a practice which goes back to 1957 and the start of german rearmament after world war ii .
the government has decided only to suspend the draft and not to abolish it .
abolition would require a change to the constitution , and the provision will remain in case a general call-up becomes necessary in a time of crisis .
the new armed forces will include 170,000 professional soldiers and 15,000 volunteers , who will serve for up to 23 months . guttenberg argues that a smaller bundeswehr will be more effective in dealing with modern military challenges .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de medicine -pipe- 15.12.2010 berlin man still cured of hiv after three years , researchers say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. gero huetter is one of the co-authors of the paper three years after receiving a stem cell transplant , one man no longer has hiv .
however , scientists caution that this procedure can only be replicated in certain circumstances and merits further study . in a new study , german researchers have confirmed that an american man living in berlin was successfully cured of his hiv infection after having received a blood stem cell transplant in 2007 .
" in conclusion , our results strongly suggest that cure of hiv has been achieved in this patient , " the researchers write in the abstract to their paper , which was published last week in blood , a medical journal .
the new paper is a follow-up study by the same german team to one they had published in the new england journal of medicine in february 2009 .
that study found " the patient remained without viral rebound 20 months after transplantation and discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy . "
" we were n't able to find hiv in his cells , " said dr. gero huetter , a hematologist and professor at the university of heidelberg , and a co-author of the new paper , in an interview with deutsche welle . " the new cells have a natural resistance against hiv . "
three years ago , timothy ray brown had been an hiv-positive leukemia patient .
prior to receiving the stem cell transplant , he underwent intense chemotherapy to completely replace his immune system .
however , the new stem cells that he received had a rare genetic mutation - found naturally in just one percent of caucasians in northern and western europe - that causes certain cells to lack a particular receptor , known as the ccr5 receptor , which hiv binds to .
at the time huetter specifically was looking for bone marrow stem cell donors that contained the rare ccr5 deletion .
since his treatment , the so-called " berlin patient " has been effectively cured of aids and its disease-causing virus , hiv , but also leukemia .
this likely makes him the first , and so far , only person ever to have been cured of hiv , out of more than 30 million currently infected people worldwide .
scientists have previously seen a very small number of cases where the virus does not replicate inside the host and therefore does not cause aids .
however , these so-called " non-progressives , " represent an extremely small percentage of known hiv patients around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 30 million people worldwide are infected with hiv an " intriguing " step , aids researchers say in the wake of the new german paper , aids and hiv researchers around the world are starting to take stock of this important finding .
" it 's intriguing that this patient does not have a rebound of the hiv replication , " said jens lundgren , an aids researcher and professor at the university of copenhagen , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they have certainly proven the case that there is no apparent residual infection in this person , and the hiv had multiple opportunities to replicate . "
another german aids researcher , dr. jan van lunzen , of the university hospital eppendorf in hamburg , agreed with this assessment .
" it seems that so far , this patient is one that we could call cured from hiv , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle . " this is the only known case , so far . "
but lundgren cautioned that researchers can not claim that they have cured aids or hiv as this was only one , very particular case .
" we can not really make statements on cure rates based on a single patient , " the researcher , who was not part of the study , added .
" this has to be looked at much more comprehensively , and this raises the issue of who wants to undergo a stem cell transplantation ?
this is not a procedure that you want to do on a whim , if you 're otherwise healthy . "
huetter and his colleagues , however , say that the ccr5 technique has a good chance of becoming a new method for treating , or perhaps even curing hiv in the future .
" probably in five , 10 or 20 years there will be techniques and procedures which can knock down ccr5 in a more complete way and will substitute this current medication of antiretroviral therapy , " he said .

ecologists still hope they will be able to overturn the decision . moscow has approved a plan to build a highway through a forest outside the capital , in defiance of protests that had become a rallying cause for the opposition . demonstrations against the construction of a highway between moscow and st. petersburg had prompted president dmitry medvedev to postpone the project , in what many observers saw as a nod by the state to popular pressure . but deputy prime minister sergei ivanov said the government commission tasked with investigating the project had given its green light to the plan .
transport minister igor levitin said the road would be built by the end of 2013 , according to russian news agencies . the commission approved building the highway after " taking into account all the factors - transport , economic , social and legal , " ivanov , who headed the panel , said in comments broadcast on state television . " we believe that from the judicial point of view the proposed route is completely legal , " he said . environmental compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposing the government can be dangerous in russia ivanov added that four billion rubles -lrb- $ 130 million , 98 million euros -rrb- would be paid as compensation for the ecological damage to the khimki forest and that some 500 hectares -lrb- 1,200 acres -rrb- of new forest would be planted to replace the 100 destroyed . but ecologists continue to decry the project for destroying the area of mixed woods and marshes that play an important part in a sensitive forest , which is a haven for wildlife in the heavily built-up moscow region . " this is a birds ' paradise , " yevgenia chirikova , who for months has organized protests against the highway 's construction , told deutsche welle .
" there is a protected marsh area where we can find moose and wild boar .
even though one can drive from here to the kremlin in 25 minutes , we do have really wild places here . " while chirikova admitted a new highway connecting russia two largest cities is necessary , she added that despite presidential promises , the public had been left out of discussions on how work should proceed in the woods where peter the great 's father once hunted . " medvedev promised us public discussions : there were none .
he promised to listen to public experts : let 's hear them ! " she said . risks of opposition protests against the highway grew in magnitude over summer , culminating in a rare thousands-strong rally in central moscow in august led by veteran russian rocker and kremlin critic yury shevchuk . environmental activism remains a risky undertaking in russia .
police have broken up protests against the highway and journalists accusing the government of corruption in connection with the road 's construction have come under attack . mikhail beketov , the editor-in-chief of the local newspaper khimkinskaya pravda , was beaten by unknown assailants in 2008 so severely that he is now partially paralyzed , suffers from brain damage , has difficulty speaking and lost four fingers and part of his leg .
the attack came shortly after beketov had published an article in which he accused local officials of corruption . oleg kashin , a journalist for the kommersant daily , covered the issue and was beaten in an attack in november that was condemned around the world .
activist konstantin fetisov was also badly injured in an attack with a baseball bat in the same month and remains in a coma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beketov is partially paralyzed after being beaten over two years ago bigger than a highway the government 's response to the protests shows that the highway issue has expanded beyond an environmental concern , chirikova said . " the khimki forest is no longer just an environmental problem , " she said .
" there is an environmental side to it .
but this is a problem of corruption . " chirikova , who has been arrested a number of times for her work , said she felt threatened and worried for her two children and husband , who had his ribs broken in an attack . however , she added that she remained convinced that cutting down the forest 's trees was illegal , bad for her town and her country .
according to an opinion poll , three quarters of russians agree with her . " if we do n't fight and stand up for our rights , and keep silent about such crimes against beketov and fetisov , then this will lead us straight back to stalin 's gulag , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 15.12.2010 moscow to restart work on highway through khimki forest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parts of the khimki forest will become a highway by 2013 the russian government has lifted a halt on construction of a highway between moscow and st. petersburg that would destroy part of the khimki forest .
ecologists still hope they will be able to overturn the decision . moscow has approved a plan to build a highway through a forest outside the capital , in defiance of protests that had become a rallying cause for the opposition . demonstrations against the construction of a highway between moscow and st. petersburg had prompted president dmitry medvedev to postpone the project , in what many observers saw as a nod by the state to popular pressure . but deputy prime minister sergei ivanov said the government commission tasked with investigating the project had given its green light to the plan .
transport minister igor levitin said the road would be built by the end of 2013 , according to russian news agencies . the commission approved building the highway after " taking into account all the factors - transport , economic , social and legal , " ivanov , who headed the panel , said in comments broadcast on state television . " we believe that from the judicial point of view the proposed route is completely legal , " he said . environmental compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposing the government can be dangerous in russia ivanov added that four billion rubles -lrb- $ 130 million , 98 million euros -rrb- would be paid as compensation for the ecological damage to the khimki forest and that some 500 hectares -lrb- 1,200 acres -rrb- of new forest would be planted to replace the 100 destroyed . but ecologists continue to decry the project for destroying the area of mixed woods and marshes that play an important part in a sensitive forest , which is a haven for wildlife in the heavily built-up moscow region . " this is a birds ' paradise , " yevgenia chirikova , who for months has organized protests against the highway 's construction , told deutsche welle .
" there is a protected marsh area where we can find moose and wild boar .
even though one can drive from here to the kremlin in 25 minutes , we do have really wild places here . " while chirikova admitted a new highway connecting russia two largest cities is necessary , she added that despite presidential promises , the public had been left out of discussions on how work should proceed in the woods where peter the great 's father once hunted . " medvedev promised us public discussions : there were none .
he promised to listen to public experts : let 's hear them ! " she said . risks of opposition protests against the highway grew in magnitude over summer , culminating in a rare thousands-strong rally in central moscow in august led by veteran russian rocker and kremlin critic yury shevchuk . environmental activism remains a risky undertaking in russia .
police have broken up protests against the highway and journalists accusing the government of corruption in connection with the road 's construction have come under attack . mikhail beketov , the editor-in-chief of the local newspaper khimkinskaya pravda , was beaten by unknown assailants in 2008 so severely that he is now partially paralyzed , suffers from brain damage , has difficulty speaking and lost four fingers and part of his leg .
the attack came shortly after beketov had published an article in which he accused local officials of corruption . oleg kashin , a journalist for the kommersant daily , covered the issue and was beaten in an attack in november that was condemned around the world .
activist konstantin fetisov was also badly injured in an attack with a baseball bat in the same month and remains in a coma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beketov is partially paralyzed after being beaten over two years ago bigger than a highway the government 's response to the protests shows that the highway issue has expanded beyond an environmental concern , chirikova said . " the khimki forest is no longer just an environmental problem , " she said .
" there is an environmental side to it .
but this is a problem of corruption . " chirikova , who has been arrested a number of times for her work , said she felt threatened and worried for her two children and husband , who had his ribs broken in an attack . however , she added that she remained convinced that cutting down the forest 's trees was illegal , bad for her town and her country .
according to an opinion poll , three quarters of russians agree with her . " if we do n't fight and stand up for our rights , and keep silent about such crimes against beketov and fetisov , then this will lead us straight back to stalin 's gulag , " she said .
" as citizens we must realize that we can not run anywhere .
we can not go to the police or the prosecutor 's office , nobody will defend us .
only by uniting ourselves can we somehow help ourselves . " author : geert groot koerkamp , sean sinico -lrb- reuters , afp , ap -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of the focal points of the meeting is to be how to handle possible future debt crises in eurozone countries , such as the ones currently facing greece and ireland .

in 1991 , the pro-democracy activist received the nobel peace prize .
the 65-year old has spent 15 of the last 21 years in detention .
deutsche welle : what is your daily routine these days ?
aung san suu kyi : my daily routine is very , very hectic .
if i look back at today , i had about two , three appointments this morning and two in the afternoon , and i still have n't finished my work yet .
so , it is extremely hectic .
what kind of appointments are these ?
i am meeting diplomats , i am meeting political parties , i am meeting individuals , we have our national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- office meetings .
then i am speaking to people on the phone .
and there are individual journalists and correspondents , who have managed to come to burma , and i have to meet them as well .
what was the biggest change you noticed in your city after your house arrest was lifted ?
i think the number of hand phones !
the moment i was released , i saw all those people with their hand phones which they were using to take photographs .
i think what it means is that there is an improvement in communications .
and what about the burmese society ?
did you find any other changes ?
prices have gone up sky-high , and people are very concerned about it .
everybody talks about the rise in prices .
also , the attitude of the young people has improved considerably .
they want to be involved in the political process , and they are much more outgoing and proactive than they were seven years ago .
when you were released , it was striking that many young people turned up to greet you .
what are your expectations from the youth of burma ?
it is for them to understand that it is up to them to bring change to our country , and that they should not depend on me or the nld or anybody else .
we will do our best , but in the end i want them to have this self-confidence to believe that they can do it for themselves .
how do you see the future of your party , the national league for democracy ?
we are going to stand as a political force because we have the full support of the people .
of course , the authorities are trying to deregister our party , and i am contesting that at court , but that is a legal matter .
the real political truth of the situation is that we have the confidence , the trust and the support of the people , and that will keep us going as the most important opposition force in burma today .
have you tried to get in touch with the government after your release ?
no , not yet .
i have , of course , been sending indirect messages through almost every speech i have made , every interview i have had , that i would like to have dialogue .
i think we should discuss our differences and come to an agreement that we should be prepared to compromise on both sides .
but why have n't you taken any concrete step to initiate this kind of a dialogue ?
we are waiting for the right time , which i hope is not too far off .
burma is a country with many ethnic minorities , whose relationship with the majority has been rather tense over the recent decades .
what do you plan to do to reach out to these groups ?
we have been reaching out to these groups for a number of years , and i can claim that we have had a certain amount of success .
not only do we have very strong allies among the parties which contested the 1990 elections , we also have the support of other ethnic groups , including the ceasefire groups along the frontiers , who have expressed an interest in what we are trying to do - to revive the spirit of true union .
last week , the nobel peace prize for the chinese democracy activist liu xiaobo turned into a major international controversy .
what is your reaction , being a nobel laureate yourself ?
i have a great respect for the norwegian nobel committee , and i believe they must have sound reasons for choosing to give him the award this year .
i personally do n't know much about liu xiabo because i have been under house arrest for about seven years , and all i know about him is that what i heard on the radio .
but i do believe that the nobel committee must have sound reasons for selecting him .
in europe , people are wondering what they can do to support burma .
what is your advice ?
first of all , it would be very helpful if all the countries of europe could speak with one voice .
even within the european union there are different attitudes and different voices , and i think that weakens the -lsb- burmese -rsb- opposition .
it would help us a great deal if all european countries called for certain steps to be taken in burma - the release of political prisoners , inclusiveness of the political process , specifically with the nld , and negotiations .
do you have any specific european countries in mind , which you want to see more active in this ?
as i am talking to you in germany - i would like germany to be more active .
you said in previous interviews that you will need time to form an opinion about international sanctions against the burmese regime .
what is your impression so far on this matter ?
so far , i have not got the impression that economic sanctions have really hurt the public , but of course there are other voices that are perhaps still waiting to be heard , so we have yet to find out .
i have been released just for over a month , and i have n't had time to go into this issue ; i am waiting to read the latest report of the imf , and perhaps the adb and other economic institutions .
how influential is the west in burma ?
compared with that , how do you see india 's and china 's role ?
i think the role of the west in burma and the role of india and china are quite different .
i would not like to think of them as competing for influence , or competing for ascendancy over burma .
it is not as though we were not able to shape our own destiny .
but certainly , because india and china are very close neighbors , they have a certain advantage over those countries that are situated very far away .
does this mean that what the west does with regard to burma is not so important ?

in 1991 , the pro-democracy activist received the nobel peace prize .
the 65-year old has spent 15 of the last 21 years in detention .
deutsche welle : what is your daily routine these days ?
aung san suu kyi : my daily routine is very , very hectic .
if i look back at today , i had about two , three appointments this morning and two in the afternoon , and i still have n't finished my work yet .
so , it is extremely hectic .
what kind of appointments are these ?
i am meeting diplomats , i am meeting political parties , i am meeting individuals , we have our national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- office meetings .
then i am speaking to people on the phone .
and there are individual journalists and correspondents , who have managed to come to burma , and i have to meet them as well .
what was the biggest change you noticed in your city after your house arrest was lifted ?
i think the number of hand phones !
the moment i was released , i saw all those people with their hand phones which they were using to take photographs .
i think what it means is that there is an improvement in communications .
and what about the burmese society ?
did you find any other changes ?
prices have gone up sky-high , and people are very concerned about it .
everybody talks about the rise in prices .
also , the attitude of the young people has improved considerably .
they want to be involved in the political process , and they are much more outgoing and proactive than they were seven years ago .
when you were released , it was striking that many young people turned up to greet you .
what are your expectations from the youth of burma ?
it is for them to understand that it is up to them to bring change to our country , and that they should not depend on me or the nld or anybody else .
we will do our best , but in the end i want them to have this self-confidence to believe that they can do it for themselves .
how do you see the future of your party , the national league for democracy ?
we are going to stand as a political force because we have the full support of the people .
of course , the authorities are trying to deregister our party , and i am contesting that at court , but that is a legal matter .
the real political truth of the situation is that we have the confidence , the trust and the support of the people , and that will keep us going as the most important opposition force in burma today .
have you tried to get in touch with the government after your release ?
no , not yet .
i have , of course , been sending indirect messages through almost every speech i have made , every interview i have had , that i would like to have dialogue .
i think we should discuss our differences and come to an agreement that we should be prepared to compromise on both sides .
but why have n't you taken any concrete step to initiate this kind of a dialogue ?
we are waiting for the right time , which i hope is not too far off .
burma is a country with many ethnic minorities , whose relationship with the majority has been rather tense over the recent decades .
what do you plan to do to reach out to these groups ?
we have been reaching out to these groups for a number of years , and i can claim that we have had a certain amount of success .
not only do we have very strong allies among the parties which contested the 1990 elections , we also have the support of other ethnic groups , including the ceasefire groups along the frontiers , who have expressed an interest in what we are trying to do - to revive the spirit of true union .
last week , the nobel peace prize for the chinese democracy activist liu xiaobo turned into a major international controversy .
what is your reaction , being a nobel laureate yourself ?
i have a great respect for the norwegian nobel committee , and i believe they must have sound reasons for choosing to give him the award this year .
i personally do n't know much about liu xiabo because i have been under house arrest for about seven years , and all i know about him is that what i heard on the radio .
but i do believe that the nobel committee must have sound reasons for selecting him .
in europe , people are wondering what they can do to support burma .
what is your advice ?
first of all , it would be very helpful if all the countries of europe could speak with one voice .
even within the european union there are different attitudes and different voices , and i think that weakens the -lsb- burmese -rsb- opposition .
it would help us a great deal if all european countries called for certain steps to be taken in burma - the release of political prisoners , inclusiveness of the political process , specifically with the nld , and negotiations .
do you have any specific european countries in mind , which you want to see more active in this ?
as i am talking to you in germany - i would like germany to be more active .
you said in previous interviews that you will need time to form an opinion about international sanctions against the burmese regime .
what is your impression so far on this matter ?
so far , i have not got the impression that economic sanctions have really hurt the public , but of course there are other voices that are perhaps still waiting to be heard , so we have yet to find out .
i have been released just for over a month , and i have n't had time to go into this issue ; i am waiting to read the latest report of the imf , and perhaps the adb and other economic institutions .
how influential is the west in burma ?
compared with that , how do you see india 's and china 's role ?
i think the role of the west in burma and the role of india and china are quite different .
i would not like to think of them as competing for influence , or competing for ascendancy over burma .
it is not as though we were not able to shape our own destiny .
but certainly , because india and china are very close neighbors , they have a certain advantage over those countries that are situated very far away .
does this mean that what the west does with regard to burma is not so important ?
no , it has its importance , depending on how and what actions the west is taking , which is why i said earlier that it would be good if all the western nations could coordinate their efforts .
not just the western nations , it would be good if the whole international community , including the united nations , coordinated its efforts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de greece -pipe- 15.12.2010 strikes in greece turn violent as protesters clash with riot police großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters hurled petrol bombs at riot police demonstrations in greece have turned violent , with protesters clashing with riot police in the capital , athens .
greek public sector workers are on a 24-hour strike to protest against government austerity measures . a public sector strike in greece was marred by violence on wednesday with angry protesters throwing rocks , bottles and firebombs at riot police who retaliated with tear gas .
the clashes occurred near the country 's finance ministry , where demonstrators had hurled a fire bomb into the second floor of the building setting part of it on fire . the protests were part of a 24-hour public sector strike directed against a series of austerity measures .
the cuts are being implemented by the greek government to rein in the spending as part of a bailout for the debt-stricken country , financed by the european union and the international monetary fund . many public sector workers would see their salaries cut and pension benefits reduced if the full force of the budget measures is implemented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strikes caused traffic backups in athens the strike has severely impacted transportation networks .
flights in and out of the country have been grounded , ships remain anchored in greek harbors , and train lines are not running .
public transportation strikes in athens throughout the week have also led to heavy traffic problems . in addition , hospitals are running on skeleton crews , schools are closed and bank workers have not been on the job since tuesday .
year of strikes wednesday 's strikes are n't the first to take place in greece against the government 's budget reduction plans .
widespread strikes have taken place throughout the year as greece 's debt situation has continued to worsen .
despite public opposition to the budget cuts , there is little reason to believe the greek government will be deterred in their resolve to pass the austerity measures .
the socialist government of prime minister george papandreou has a majority in parliament , and the reforms are tied to the 110-billion-euro -lrb- $ 147 billion -rrb- bailout from the eu and the imf .
eu summit greece is n't the only european nation to have protests against government austerity measures on wednesday - public sector workers in spain , belgium and other countries are set to rally as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou is not likely to change his government 's plans " european trade unions ask the governments to stop attacking wages and welfare , to act together , to stop racing from one crisis to the next , to stop destroying our social europe , " said john monks , general secretary of the european trade union confederation ahead of the protests .
the strikes and protests come ahead of a summit of eu leaders in brussels on thursday and friday to discuss expanding the eurozone 's financial rescue fund for possible future cases of extreme debt similar to that experienced by greece .
so far , ireland has been the only nation to access the fund , but speculation that spain and portugal will soon follow has raised the question whether the 750-billion-euro bailout fund will be sufficient .

greek public sector workers are on a 24-hour strike to protest against government austerity measures . a public sector strike in greece was marred by violence on wednesday with angry protesters throwing rocks , bottles and firebombs at riot police who retaliated with tear gas .
the clashes occurred near the country 's finance ministry , where demonstrators had hurled a fire bomb into the second floor of the building setting part of it on fire . the protests were part of a 24-hour public sector strike directed against a series of austerity measures .
the cuts are being implemented by the greek government to rein in the spending as part of a bailout for the debt-stricken country , financed by the european union and the international monetary fund . many public sector workers would see their salaries cut and pension benefits reduced if the full force of the budget measures is implemented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strikes caused traffic backups in athens the strike has severely impacted transportation networks .
flights in and out of the country have been grounded , ships remain anchored in greek harbors , and train lines are not running .
public transportation strikes in athens throughout the week have also led to heavy traffic problems . in addition , hospitals are running on skeleton crews , schools are closed and bank workers have not been on the job since tuesday .
year of strikes wednesday 's strikes are n't the first to take place in greece against the government 's budget reduction plans .
widespread strikes have taken place throughout the year as greece 's debt situation has continued to worsen .
despite public opposition to the budget cuts , there is little reason to believe the greek government will be deterred in their resolve to pass the austerity measures .
the socialist government of prime minister george papandreou has a majority in parliament , and the reforms are tied to the 110-billion-euro -lrb- $ 147 billion -rrb- bailout from the eu and the imf .
eu summit greece is n't the only european nation to have protests against government austerity measures on wednesday - public sector workers in spain , belgium and other countries are set to rally as well .

the strikes and protests come ahead of a summit of eu leaders in brussels on thursday and friday to discuss expanding the eurozone 's financial rescue fund for possible future cases of extreme debt similar to that experienced by greece .
so far , ireland has been the only nation to access the fund , but speculation that spain and portugal will soon follow has raised the question whether the 750-billion-euro bailout fund will be sufficient .

in 1991 , the pro-democracy activist received the nobel peace prize .
the 65-year old has spent 15 of the last 21 years in detention .
deutsche welle : what is your daily routine these days ?
aung san suu kyi : my daily routine is very , very hectic .
if i look back at today , i had about two , three appointments this morning and two in the afternoon , and i still have n't finished my work yet .
so , it is extremely hectic .
what kind of appointments are these ?
i am meeting diplomats , i am meeting political parties , i am meeting individuals , we have our national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- office meetings .
then i am speaking to people on the phone .
and there are individual journalists and correspondents , who have managed to come to burma , and i have to meet them as well .
what was the biggest change you noticed in your city after your house arrest was lifted ?
i think the number of hand phones !
the moment i was released , i saw all those people with their hand phones which they were using to take photographs .
i think what it means is that there is an improvement in communications .
and what about the burmese society ?
did you find any other changes ?
prices have gone up sky-high , and people are very concerned about it .
everybody talks about the rise in prices .
also , the attitude of the young people has improved considerably .
they want to be involved in the political process , and they are much more outgoing and proactive than they were seven years ago .
when you were released , it was striking that many young people turned up to greet you .
what are your expectations from the youth of burma ?
it is for them to understand that it is up to them to bring change to our country , and that they should not depend on me or the nld or anybody else .
we will do our best , but in the end i want them to have this self-confidence to believe that they can do it for themselves .
how do you see the future of your party , the national league for democracy ?
we are going to stand as a political force because we have the full support of the people .
of course , the authorities are trying to deregister our party , and i am contesting that at court , but that is a legal matter .
the real political truth of the situation is that we have the confidence , the trust and the support of the people , and that will keep us going as the most important opposition force in burma today .
have you tried to get in touch with the government after your release ?
no , not yet .
i have , of course , been sending indirect messages through almost every speech i have made , every interview i have had , that i would like to have dialogue .
i think we should discuss our differences and come to an agreement that we should be prepared to compromise on both sides .
but why have n't you taken any concrete step to initiate this kind of a dialogue ?
we are waiting for the right time , which i hope is not too far off .
burma is a country with many ethnic minorities , whose relationship with the majority has been rather tense over the recent decades .
what do you plan to do to reach out to these groups ?
we have been reaching out to these groups for a number of years , and i can claim that we have had a certain amount of success .
not only do we have very strong allies among the parties which contested the 1990 elections , we also have the support of other ethnic groups , including the ceasefire groups along the frontiers , who have expressed an interest in what we are trying to do - to revive the spirit of true union .
last week , the nobel peace prize for the chinese democracy activist liu xiaobo turned into a major international controversy .
what is your reaction , being a nobel laureate yourself ?
i have a great respect for the norwegian nobel committee , and i believe they must have sound reasons for choosing to give him the award this year .
i personally do n't know much about liu xiabo because i have been under house arrest for about seven years , and all i know about him is that what i heard on the radio .
but i do believe that the nobel committee must have sound reasons for selecting him .
in europe , people are wondering what they can do to support burma .
what is your advice ?
first of all , it would be very helpful if all the countries of europe could speak with one voice .
even within the european union there are different attitudes and different voices , and i think that weakens the -lsb- burmese -rsb- opposition .
it would help us a great deal if all european countries called for certain steps to be taken in burma - the release of political prisoners , inclusiveness of the political process , specifically with the nld , and negotiations .
do you have any specific european countries in mind , which you want to see more active in this ?
as i am talking to you in germany - i would like germany to be more active .
you said in previous interviews that you will need time to form an opinion about international sanctions against the burmese regime .
what is your impression so far on this matter ?
so far , i have not got the impression that economic sanctions have really hurt the public , but of course there are other voices that are perhaps still waiting to be heard , so we have yet to find out .
i have been released just for over a month , and i have n't had time to go into this issue ; i am waiting to read the latest report of the imf , and perhaps the adb and other economic institutions .
how influential is the west in burma ?
compared with that , how do you see india 's and china 's role ?
i think the role of the west in burma and the role of india and china are quite different .
i would not like to think of them as competing for influence , or competing for ascendancy over burma .
it is not as though we were not able to shape our own destiny .
but certainly , because india and china are very close neighbors , they have a certain advantage over those countries that are situated very far away .
does this mean that what the west does with regard to burma is not so important ?
no , it has its importance , depending on how and what actions the west is taking , which is why i said earlier that it would be good if all the western nations could coordinate their efforts .
not just the western nations , it would be good if the whole international community , including the united nations , coordinated its efforts .
that would help us very greatly indeed , and if it called for the same basic steps , that would mean progress .
what are your expectations from india and china ?
we would like them to engage with us .
to begin with , we 'd very much like india and china to give us the opportunity to explain our point of view to them .
we have very little contact with china and india .
we have more contact with the indian government than with the chinese government , in fact i do n't think we have any contact with the chinese government at all .
we would like to have contact with them , we would like them to listen to our side of the story , and make them understand that we look upon them as neighbors , and that we would like to be friends with them .
we are not hostile to them even if we are working for democracy in burma .
what are your plans for the coming weeks ?
the man that i fear most in the world is the man who keeps my appointment book .
i have n't gone through next week 's appointments with him ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 15.12.2010 artists have n't abandoned search for psychedelic nirvana of inspiration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artists have often tried to capture their hallucinations from victorian use of cocaine eye-drops to amy winehouse 's reliance on horse sedatives , creative minds have sought out psychedelic experiences for centuries .
but does doping make for better art ? from poetry to pop music , the question has been asked repeatedly over the years : can mind-altering substances enhance an artist 's performance ? an exhibition currently taking place at london 's wellcome institute examines the huge influence dope has had on the arts - and artists of all kinds - across the ages . " there is a huge range not only of substances , but also across different periods of time , " curator emily sergeant said , while pointing to bamboo opium pipe , a plastic ashtray from the 1970s and some fly agaric mushrooms , which she said are illegal in the uk . spiders on caffeine a particularly compelling part of the exhibition , however , is not directly related to artist - but to spiders . bildunterschrift : the webs may not be functional for catching flies , but they could be considered art -lrb- left to right : benzedrine , caffeine , marijuana -rrb- three graphics are taken from a series of experiments carried out by nasa on arachnids given doses of the amphetamine benzedrine , caffeine and marijuana .
their web-making ability was then assessed and the results are curious : the spider on caffeine created the most unconventional web . in the other two cases the usual web structure was visible at the beginning of the process .
but the caffeine-fuelled spider was noticeably less systematic and its web had large gaps and no circular center , making it essentially non-functional . the survival of the artist , however , is admittedly less dependent on the functionality of his product and more on its aesthetic appeal .
during the 19th century , a large number of writers , artists and scientists experimented with mind-altering substances - many of them legal at the time - to find out what kind of experience they could have . " we have an example from france and the club des hashischins , a group of artists and writers who met under the guidance of a scientist , jacques moreau , and were administered a quantity of hashish and these experiences are recorded , " explained sergeant .
" moreau was interested in the effects of this substance on the genius : what would happen to an already extraordinary mind if it were altered in some way ? " first opium confession thomas de quincy may have been a genius , but his autobiographical " confessions of an english opium eater " from 1821 certainly influenced many creative minds , including composer hector berlioz , whose " symphonie fantastique " was inspired by it . " this was really the beginning of the modern european drug culture in many ways .
this was the first time that someone had written about their life in terms of their drug-taking and talked about what it was like to be an opium addict , " said mike jay , the exhibition 's co-curator and author of the accompanying book . bildunterschrift : this 1823 painting , " doctor and mrs syntax , " satirizes the trend of hosting nitrous oxide parties . these days , it 's practically a rite of passage for musicians to get arrested for possession of illegal drugs , but two centuries ago , composers were using drugs for a different reason : to enhance their ability to dream up new sounds , combinations of chords and assembling huge orchestras . " if you look at -lsb- french romantic composer hector -rsb- berlioz at the time , he was taking opium and writing about an opium dream , but actually he was in a very over-stimulated visionary state for about a year , hardly sleeping at all , " jay said .
" he was probably taking the opium to calm down .
so sometimes when we see creative people writing about drugs and taking drugs , the relationship is n't as it appears . " ' no nirvana of inspiration ' the exhibition is careful to avoid taking a position on drug use .
according to sergeant , there is a connection between drugs and art , but it is unclear whether drugs improve on talent . " it does n't seem from the material that we 've looked at that it is the answer to anything , " she said .
" there is no nirvana of inspiration that any one drug has unlocked .
but they have played this very important role in the lives of artists , writers and scientists throughout history .

but does doping make for better art ? from poetry to pop music , the question has been asked repeatedly over the years : can mind-altering substances enhance an artist 's performance ? an exhibition currently taking place at london 's wellcome institute examines the huge influence dope has had on the arts - and artists of all kinds - across the ages . " there is a huge range not only of substances , but also across different periods of time , " curator emily sergeant said , while pointing to bamboo opium pipe , a plastic ashtray from the 1970s and some fly agaric mushrooms , which she said are illegal in the uk . spiders on caffeine a particularly compelling part of the exhibition , however , is not directly related to artist - but to spiders . bildunterschrift : the webs may not be functional for catching flies , but they could be considered art -lrb- left to right : benzedrine , caffeine , marijuana -rrb- three graphics are taken from a series of experiments carried out by nasa on arachnids given doses of the amphetamine benzedrine , caffeine and marijuana .
their web-making ability was then assessed and the results are curious : the spider on caffeine created the most unconventional web . in the other two cases the usual web structure was visible at the beginning of the process .
but the caffeine-fuelled spider was noticeably less systematic and its web had large gaps and no circular center , making it essentially non-functional . the survival of the artist , however , is admittedly less dependent on the functionality of his product and more on its aesthetic appeal .
during the 19th century , a large number of writers , artists and scientists experimented with mind-altering substances - many of them legal at the time - to find out what kind of experience they could have . " we have an example from france and the club des hashischins , a group of artists and writers who met under the guidance of a scientist , jacques moreau , and were administered a quantity of hashish and these experiences are recorded , " explained sergeant .
" moreau was interested in the effects of this substance on the genius : what would happen to an already extraordinary mind if it were altered in some way ? " first opium confession thomas de quincy may have been a genius , but his autobiographical " confessions of an english opium eater " from 1821 certainly influenced many creative minds , including composer hector berlioz , whose " symphonie fantastique " was inspired by it . " this was really the beginning of the modern european drug culture in many ways .
this was the first time that someone had written about their life in terms of their drug-taking and talked about what it was like to be an opium addict , " said mike jay , the exhibition 's co-curator and author of the accompanying book . bildunterschrift : this 1823 painting , " doctor and mrs syntax , " satirizes the trend of hosting nitrous oxide parties . these days , it 's practically a rite of passage for musicians to get arrested for possession of illegal drugs , but two centuries ago , composers were using drugs for a different reason : to enhance their ability to dream up new sounds , combinations of chords and assembling huge orchestras . " if you look at -lsb- french romantic composer hector -rsb- berlioz at the time , he was taking opium and writing about an opium dream , but actually he was in a very over-stimulated visionary state for about a year , hardly sleeping at all , " jay said .
" he was probably taking the opium to calm down .
so sometimes when we see creative people writing about drugs and taking drugs , the relationship is n't as it appears . " ' no nirvana of inspiration ' the exhibition is careful to avoid taking a position on drug use .
according to sergeant , there is a connection between drugs and art , but it is unclear whether drugs improve on talent . " it does n't seem from the material that we 've looked at that it is the answer to anything , " she said .

as a result , the last draft will be on january 3 , 2011 . the german government on wednesday approved the plans of its defense minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , to reduce the size of the german military , the bundeswehr , by 65,000 soldiers to 185,000 . included in the reform are plans to suspend conscription from july 1 next year .
this means that the last young men will receive their draft notices on january 3 , ending a practice which goes back to 1957 and the start of german rearmament after world war ii .
the government has decided only to suspend the draft and not to abolish it .
abolition would require a change to the constitution , and the provision will remain in case a general call-up becomes necessary in a time of crisis .
the new armed forces will include 170,000 professional soldiers and 15,000 volunteers , who will serve for up to 23 months . guttenberg argues that a smaller bundeswehr will be more effective in dealing with modern military challenges .
a smaller military is still too expensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense minister has pushed for an end to conscription the plans are being made at a time when the military is under financial pressure . finance minister wolfgang schaeuble wants the defense ministry to save 8.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.2 billion -rrb- by 2014 .
the defense minister says he ca n't meet that target without reducing size of the military to 160,000 .
the suspension of conscription is expected to lead to an increase in the number of young people wanting to go to university .
the german states , which are responsible for financing education , say they are not prepared to pay the additional cost .
the chairman of the conference of state premiers , wolfgang boehmer , said that , if the central government created the financial burden , it should be prepared to discuss paying for it .
the suspension is also expected to lead to extra costs for social service providers , who have so far benefitted from the civilian service alternative to the draft . the cabinet also agreed on a new program of voluntary civil service , but the minister for families , kristina schroeder , has already said that it will not fill the gap completely .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de greece -pipe- 15.12.2010 strikes in greece turn violent as protesters clash with riot police großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters hurled petrol bombs at riot police demonstrations in greece have turned violent , with protesters clashing with riot police in the capital , athens .
greek public sector workers are on a 24-hour strike to protest against government austerity measures . a public sector strike in greece was marred by violence on wednesday with angry protesters throwing rocks , bottles and firebombs at riot police who retaliated with tear gas .
the clashes occurred near the country 's finance ministry , where demonstrators had hurled a fire bomb into the second floor of the building setting part of it on fire . the protests were part of a 24-hour public sector strike directed against a series of austerity measures .
the cuts are being implemented by the greek government to rein in the spending as part of a bailout for the debt-stricken country , financed by the european union and the international monetary fund . many public sector workers would see their salaries cut and pension benefits reduced if the full force of the budget measures is implemented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strikes caused traffic backups in athens the strike has severely impacted transportation networks .
flights in and out of the country have been grounded , ships remain anchored in greek harbors , and train lines are not running .
public transportation strikes in athens throughout the week have also led to heavy traffic problems . in addition , hospitals are running on skeleton crews , schools are closed and bank workers have not been on the job since tuesday .
year of strikes wednesday 's strikes are n't the first to take place in greece against the government 's budget reduction plans .
widespread strikes have taken place throughout the year as greece 's debt situation has continued to worsen .
despite public opposition to the budget cuts , there is little reason to believe the greek government will be deterred in their resolve to pass the austerity measures .
the socialist government of prime minister george papandreou has a majority in parliament , and the reforms are tied to the 110-billion-euro -lrb- $ 147 billion -rrb- bailout from the eu and the imf .
eu summit greece is n't the only european nation to have protests against government austerity measures on wednesday - public sector workers in spain , belgium and other countries are set to rally as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou is not likely to change his government 's plans " european trade unions ask the governments to stop attacking wages and welfare , to act together , to stop racing from one crisis to the next , to stop destroying our social europe , " said john monks , general secretary of the european trade union confederation ahead of the protests .
the strikes and protests come ahead of a summit of eu leaders in brussels on thursday and friday to discuss expanding the eurozone 's financial rescue fund for possible future cases of extreme debt similar to that experienced by greece .
so far , ireland has been the only nation to access the fund , but speculation that spain and portugal will soon follow has raised the question whether the 750-billion-euro bailout fund will be sufficient .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 15.12.2010 merkel stands firm , but german parliament split over euro crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in her speech , merkel stuck to her guns in a speech to parliament , german chancellor angela merkel has fortified her stance against eurozone bonds and increasing the eu 's financial rescue fund a day ahead of an eu summit to consider new rules for the eurozone . german chancellor angela merkel used a session of parliament on wednesday to set out her center-right government 's position on how to tackle problems facing the eurozone , ahead of a key european union summit on thursday and friday in brussels .
one of the focal points of the meeting is to be how to handle possible future debt crises in eurozone countries , such as the ones currently facing greece and ireland .
merkel insisted that no european country would be left behind should it face similar dire financial straits .
" no one in europe will be left alone , no one in europe will be abandoned , " merkel said .
" europe succeeds when it acts together and , i would add , europe succeeds only when it acts together . "
merkel accused of mishandling the situation the debate about the eu summit revealed a split in the german parliament over the issue of how to handle europe .
following merkel ’ s speech , the opposition social democratic party , the greens and the left party distanced themselves from merkel ’ s strategy . the head of the social democratic party bloc , frank-walter steinmeier said the government was sending out unclear signals , and that merkel ’ s hesitance had put germany ’ s commitment to european solidarity in doubt . merkel also came under attack from the head of the left party , gesine loetzsch .
she said the chancellor was rushing from one disaster to the next , whilst trying to give the impression that the situation was under control . " what we need now is investment in the future of europe , " loetzsch said .
crisis-proof euro after being forced to help bail out greece earlier this year , the european union created a financial rescue fund to be triggered in case of any future debt crisis .
ireland became the first country to access the fund last month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she believed in the strength of the euro some believe that the 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 997 billion -rrb- in the bailout fund wo n't be enough - particularly if financially troubled countries like spain or portugal are also forced to dip into it in the near future . according to some analysts , this could , in turn , threaten the eurozone itself , but chancellor merkel played down concerns about the eurozone 's common currency .
" it is undeniable that some eurozone countries face difficult challenges but it is also undeniable that the euro has shown itself to be crisis-proof , " she said .
spain causes market wobbles as if to illustrate the concerns about the potential for further bailouts , ratings agency moody ’ s warned spain on wednesday that its debt could be downgraded .
the euro slid in reaction to the news , while the borrowing costs of spain and portugal rose slightly .
the ratings agency standard and poor ’ s made a similar warning to belgium on tuesday . analysts have questioned whether the current fund would be sufficient to bailout spain , the eurozone 's fourth largest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's unemployment rate has topped 20 percent moody 's said it was concerned about spain 's high debt funding needs , its heavily indebted banks and its regional finances , but it did not expect madrid would have to follow greece and ireland in seeking an eu bailout . the portuguese government announced moves to cut red tape and boost growth , and said it would soon adopt quarterly fiscal targets , part of a broad effort to convince eu officials and financial markets it does not need a bailout . european commission president jose manuel barroso urged leaders to act fast to reach a consensus at the summit . germany pledges support for ecb meanwhile , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- is expected to ask euro zone member states for more capital , a move to lower its leverage as it helps tackle the debt crisis . that issue may be discussed among eu leaders on thursday , when they will be joined for dinner by ecb president jean-claude trichet .
the ecb has come under pressure to step up its bond-buying program to help the likes of ireland , greece and portugal . germany said it would support giving the ecb more capital , with an official saying the move would show financial markets that the central bank had the firepower to buy new government bonds if needed .
no support for european bonds jean-claude juncker , prime minister of luxembourg and the chairman of the group of eurozone finance ministers recently floated the idea of a common european bond to help relieve pressure on weaker members of the eurozone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker likes the idea of a single european bond merkel has been staunchly opposed to this proposal and reiterated her resistance again on wednesday .
she said that what she described as a " collectivization of risk " among eurozone nations would be a mistake .
germany fears that if adopted , eurobonds would significantly raise its borrowing costs , which are currently among the lowest in europe .
a report published in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday estimated the cost for germany of a common eurozone bond to be at least 17 billion euros annually .

dw-world.de eurobond proposals wo n't go away chancellor merkel has dismissed calls for the eurozone to pool sovereign debt due to the high costs it would impose on germany .

however , scientists caution that this procedure can only be replicated in certain circumstances and merits further study . in a new study , german researchers have confirmed that an american man living in berlin was successfully cured of his hiv infection after having received a blood stem cell transplant in 2007 .
" in conclusion , our results strongly suggest that cure of hiv has been achieved in this patient , " the researchers write in the abstract to their paper , which was published last week in blood , a medical journal .
the new paper is a follow-up study by the same german team to one they had published in the new england journal of medicine in february 2009 .
that study found " the patient remained without viral rebound 20 months after transplantation and discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy . "
" we were n't able to find hiv in his cells , " said dr. gero huetter , a hematologist and professor at the university of heidelberg , and a co-author of the new paper , in an interview with deutsche welle . " the new cells have a natural resistance against hiv . "
three years ago , timothy ray brown had been an hiv-positive leukemia patient .
prior to receiving the stem cell transplant , he underwent intense chemotherapy to completely replace his immune system .
however , the new stem cells that he received had a rare genetic mutation - found naturally in just one percent of caucasians in northern and western europe - that causes certain cells to lack a particular receptor , known as the ccr5 receptor , which hiv binds to .
at the time huetter specifically was looking for bone marrow stem cell donors that contained the rare ccr5 deletion .
since his treatment , the so-called " berlin patient " has been effectively cured of aids and its disease-causing virus , hiv , but also leukemia .
this likely makes him the first , and so far , only person ever to have been cured of hiv , out of more than 30 million currently infected people worldwide .
scientists have previously seen a very small number of cases where the virus does not replicate inside the host and therefore does not cause aids .
however , these so-called " non-progressives , " represent an extremely small percentage of known hiv patients around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 30 million people worldwide are infected with hiv an " intriguing " step , aids researchers say in the wake of the new german paper , aids and hiv researchers around the world are starting to take stock of this important finding .
" it 's intriguing that this patient does not have a rebound of the hiv replication , " said jens lundgren , an aids researcher and professor at the university of copenhagen , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they have certainly proven the case that there is no apparent residual infection in this person , and the hiv had multiple opportunities to replicate . "
another german aids researcher , dr. jan van lunzen , of the university hospital eppendorf in hamburg , agreed with this assessment .
" it seems that so far , this patient is one that we could call cured from hiv , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle . " this is the only known case , so far . "
but lundgren cautioned that researchers can not claim that they have cured aids or hiv as this was only one , very particular case .
" we can not really make statements on cure rates based on a single patient , " the researcher , who was not part of the study , added .
" this has to be looked at much more comprehensively , and this raises the issue of who wants to undergo a stem cell transplantation ?
this is not a procedure that you want to do on a whim , if you 're otherwise healthy . "
huetter and his colleagues , however , say that the ccr5 technique has a good chance of becoming a new method for treating , or perhaps even curing hiv in the future .
" probably in five , 10 or 20 years there will be techniques and procedures which can knock down ccr5 in a more complete way and will substitute this current medication of antiretroviral therapy , " he said .

dw-akademie director gerda meuer was invited to speak at a two-day conference held in the bhutan capital , thimphu . “ the challenges of public service broadcasting ” was the title of the media conference organized in november by the bhutan centre for media and democracy and the bhutan broadcasting service -lrb- bbs -rrb- , the country ’ s sole television broadcaster .
politicians , media representatives and academics – the majority from bhutan itself – came to thimphu to discuss the challenges .
also invited were experts from thailand , the philippines and ireland , and gerda meuer , director of dw-akademie , from germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meuer looked back at 60 years of german public broadcasting .
“ following world war ii the allies wanted to create a media system in germany that was decentralized , politically and economically independent , and that represented all layers of society .
they wanted an open dialogue for everyone , ” she said .
she explained the structure of the german public broadcasting system and described the functions of the various broadcasting boards .
but , she warned , “ one can not simply copy the models of other countries and transfer them to one ’ s own .
the goal is to find a system that best suits one ’ s own country . ”
with its strategic importance , bhutan is the size of switzerland and lies between china and india .
800,000 inhabitants live in the kingdom which the monarch is aiming to restructure into a democracy – in harmony with a unique political philosophy .
traditionally , the country ’ s leader is committed to the “ gross national happiness ” , where each political decision has to be in line with the individual ’ s and society ’ s well-being .
this is quite different to the western idea of growth .
accordingly , the media workshop in thimphu developed recommendations which would make it possible to transform the bhutanese state broadcaster into a public broadcaster .
“ now our primary objective is to create our own understanding of public service broadcasting , ” said pema choden , bbs director .
“ at the same time we need to find our own role within the new political context . ”

offenders , however , are rarely reported to authorities and the media coverage is insufficient .
a joint gtz and dw-akademie radio workshop focused on the issue . the radio journalist participants recorded women who had experienced physical or emotional violence and men who had inflicted such violence .
“ this workshop was part of gtz ’ s supranational project ‘ convomujer – combating violence against women in peru , ecuador , bolivia and paraguay ’ , ” says dw-akademie project manager , vera möller-holtkamp .
education , prevention and solidarity are the main project goals .
the radio reports resulting from this particular workshop are also aimed at encouraging afflicted women to seek help .
journalists from community radio stations belonging to the peruvian umbrella organization coordinadora nacional de radio -lrb- cnr -rrb- came from various regions to attend the workshop held in the capital , lima .
with support from dw-akademie trainer hans-günter kellner and a local cnr trainer , the participants produced reports , interviews and short information announcements .
these are to be aired locally and also offered free of charge on cnr ’ s website to radio stations which did not take part in the workshop .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the participants researched potential social and cultural reasons for the violence .
they talked with psychologists , social workers and women affected by it , choosing new angles to report on the issue .
the results included a report about a once-violent man who underwent therapy and now heads a men ’ s self-help group .
“ it would be good if the media included more background reports on this issue in their long-term program planning , ” says dw-akademie trainer , elena ern .

some 300 serbian journalists , broadcast technicians , and media managers have participated in workshops since then . ten years of media development in serbia – a good reason for dw-akademie and former participants to take stock of the work achieved so far and to look ahead .
at the end of november the europe and central asia division invited alumni to a conference in belgrade .
the goal was to combine an informal get-together with a one-day workshop involving groups and discussions on dw-akademie ’ s performance .
“ what are we doing well and what can we do better ? ” were the central questions posed to twenty serbian journalists from all regions in the country .
the alumni gave top praise to dw-akademie ’ s advanced training in areas such as interview training , environmental reporting and online journalism .
additional plus points were given for discussions with german experts and networking with other participants .
starting in 2011 , a new , regional dw-akademie blog will support this exchange online .
the alumni also had suggestions for future projects .
one participant proposed the joint construction of an exchange platform for radio and television reports .
others hoped for more involvement of upper management in the projects to help overcome management ’ s reluctance to work with new ideas .
participants mentioned other barriers making it difficult to implement what they had learned including a lack of finances and time , as well as political pressure .
“ we really appreciate the feedback and now have new ideas which we ’ ll include in our upcoming projects , ” says filip slavkovic who coordinates dw-akademie projects in southeastern europe .
further workshops together with the osce media department are planned for serbia starting at the beginning of 2011 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as a result , the last draft will be on january 3 , 2011 . the german government on wednesday approved the plans of its defense minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , to reduce the size of the german military , the bundeswehr , by 65,000 soldiers to 185,000 . included in the reform are plans to suspend conscription from july 1 next year .
this means that the last young men will receive their draft notices on january 3 , ending a practice which goes back to 1957 and the start of german rearmament after world war ii .
the government has decided only to suspend the draft and not to abolish it .
abolition would require a change to the constitution , and the provision will remain in case a general call-up becomes necessary in a time of crisis .
the new armed forces will include 170,000 professional soldiers and 15,000 volunteers , who will serve for up to 23 months . guttenberg argues that a smaller bundeswehr will be more effective in dealing with modern military challenges .
a smaller military is still too expensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense minister has pushed for an end to conscription the plans are being made at a time when the military is under financial pressure . finance minister wolfgang schaeuble wants the defense ministry to save 8.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.2 billion -rrb- by 2014 .
the defense minister says he ca n't meet that target without reducing size of the military to 160,000 .
the suspension of conscription is expected to lead to an increase in the number of young people wanting to go to university .
the german states , which are responsible for financing education , say they are not prepared to pay the additional cost .
the chairman of the conference of state premiers , wolfgang boehmer , said that , if the central government created the financial burden , it should be prepared to discuss paying for it .
the suspension is also expected to lead to extra costs for social service providers , who have so far benefitted from the civilian service alternative to the draft . the cabinet also agreed on a new program of voluntary civil service , but the minister for families , kristina schroeder , has already said that it will not fill the gap completely .

in 1991 , the pro-democracy activist received the nobel peace prize .
the 65-year old has spent 15 of the last 21 years in detention .
deutsche welle : what is your daily routine these days ?
aung san suu kyi : my daily routine is very , very hectic .
if i look back at today , i had about two , three appointments this morning and two in the afternoon , and i still have n't finished my work yet .
so , it is extremely hectic .
what kind of appointments are these ?
i am meeting diplomats , i am meeting political parties , i am meeting individuals , we have our national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- office meetings .
then i am speaking to people on the phone .
and there are individual journalists and correspondents , who have managed to come to burma , and i have to meet them as well .
what was the biggest change you noticed in your city after your house arrest was lifted ?
i think the number of hand phones !
the moment i was released , i saw all those people with their hand phones which they were using to take photographs .
i think what it means is that there is an improvement in communications .
and what about the burmese society ?
did you find any other changes ?
prices have gone up sky-high , and people are very concerned about it .
everybody talks about the rise in prices .
also , the attitude of the young people has improved considerably .
they want to be involved in the political process , and they are much more outgoing and proactive than they were seven years ago .
when you were released , it was striking that many young people turned up to greet you .
what are your expectations from the youth of burma ?
it is for them to understand that it is up to them to bring change to our country , and that they should not depend on me or the nld or anybody else .
we will do our best , but in the end i want them to have this self-confidence to believe that they can do it for themselves .
how do you see the future of your party , the national league for democracy ?
we are going to stand as a political force because we have the full support of the people .
of course , the authorities are trying to deregister our party , and i am contesting that at court , but that is a legal matter .
the real political truth of the situation is that we have the confidence , the trust and the support of the people , and that will keep us going as the most important opposition force in burma today .
have you tried to get in touch with the government after your release ?
no , not yet .
i have , of course , been sending indirect messages through almost every speech i have made , every interview i have had , that i would like to have dialogue .
i think we should discuss our differences and come to an agreement that we should be prepared to compromise on both sides .
but why have n't you taken any concrete step to initiate this kind of a dialogue ?
we are waiting for the right time , which i hope is not too far off .
burma is a country with many ethnic minorities , whose relationship with the majority has been rather tense over the recent decades .
what do you plan to do to reach out to these groups ?
we have been reaching out to these groups for a number of years , and i can claim that we have had a certain amount of success .
not only do we have very strong allies among the parties which contested the 1990 elections , we also have the support of other ethnic groups , including the ceasefire groups along the frontiers , who have expressed an interest in what we are trying to do - to revive the spirit of true union .
last week , the nobel peace prize for the chinese democracy activist liu xiaobo turned into a major international controversy .
what is your reaction , being a nobel laureate yourself ?
i have a great respect for the norwegian nobel committee , and i believe they must have sound reasons for choosing to give him the award this year .
i personally do n't know much about liu xiabo because i have been under house arrest for about seven years , and all i know about him is that what i heard on the radio .
but i do believe that the nobel committee must have sound reasons for selecting him .
in europe , people are wondering what they can do to support burma .
what is your advice ?
first of all , it would be very helpful if all the countries of europe could speak with one voice .
even within the european union there are different attitudes and different voices , and i think that weakens the -lsb- burmese -rsb- opposition .
it would help us a great deal if all european countries called for certain steps to be taken in burma - the release of political prisoners , inclusiveness of the political process , specifically with the nld , and negotiations .
do you have any specific european countries in mind , which you want to see more active in this ?
as i am talking to you in germany - i would like germany to be more active .
you said in previous interviews that you will need time to form an opinion about international sanctions against the burmese regime .
what is your impression so far on this matter ?
so far , i have not got the impression that economic sanctions have really hurt the public , but of course there are other voices that are perhaps still waiting to be heard , so we have yet to find out .
i have been released just for over a month , and i have n't had time to go into this issue ; i am waiting to read the latest report of the imf , and perhaps the adb and other economic institutions .
how influential is the west in burma ?
compared with that , how do you see india 's and china 's role ?
i think the role of the west in burma and the role of india and china are quite different .
i would not like to think of them as competing for influence , or competing for ascendancy over burma .
it is not as though we were not able to shape our own destiny .
but certainly , because india and china are very close neighbors , they have a certain advantage over those countries that are situated very far away .
does this mean that what the west does with regard to burma is not so important ?
no , it has its importance , depending on how and what actions the west is taking , which is why i said earlier that it would be good if all the western nations could coordinate their efforts .
not just the western nations , it would be good if the whole international community , including the united nations , coordinated its efforts .
that would help us very greatly indeed , and if it called for the same basic steps , that would mean progress .
what are your expectations from india and china ?
we would like them to engage with us .
to begin with , we 'd very much like india and china to give us the opportunity to explain our point of view to them .
we have very little contact with china and india .
we have more contact with the indian government than with the chinese government , in fact i do n't think we have any contact with the chinese government at all .
we would like to have contact with them , we would like them to listen to our side of the story , and make them understand that we look upon them as neighbors , and that we would like to be friends with them .
we are not hostile to them even if we are working for democracy in burma .
what are your plans for the coming weeks ?
the man that i fear most in the world is the man who keeps my appointment book .
i have n't gone through next week 's appointments with him ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 15.12.2010 artists have n't abandoned search for psychedelic nirvana of inspiration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artists have often tried to capture their hallucinations from victorian use of cocaine eye-drops to amy winehouse 's reliance on horse sedatives , creative minds have sought out psychedelic experiences for centuries .
but does doping make for better art ? from poetry to pop music , the question has been asked repeatedly over the years : can mind-altering substances enhance an artist 's performance ? an exhibition currently taking place at london 's wellcome institute examines the huge influence dope has had on the arts - and artists of all kinds - across the ages . " there is a huge range not only of substances , but also across different periods of time , " curator emily sergeant said , while pointing to bamboo opium pipe , a plastic ashtray from the 1970s and some fly agaric mushrooms , which she said are illegal in the uk . spiders on caffeine a particularly compelling part of the exhibition , however , is not directly related to artist - but to spiders . bildunterschrift : the webs may not be functional for catching flies , but they could be considered art -lrb- left to right : benzedrine , caffeine , marijuana -rrb- three graphics are taken from a series of experiments carried out by nasa on arachnids given doses of the amphetamine benzedrine , caffeine and marijuana .
their web-making ability was then assessed and the results are curious : the spider on caffeine created the most unconventional web . in the other two cases the usual web structure was visible at the beginning of the process .
but the caffeine-fuelled spider was noticeably less systematic and its web had large gaps and no circular center , making it essentially non-functional . the survival of the artist , however , is admittedly less dependent on the functionality of his product and more on its aesthetic appeal .
during the 19th century , a large number of writers , artists and scientists experimented with mind-altering substances - many of them legal at the time - to find out what kind of experience they could have . " we have an example from france and the club des hashischins , a group of artists and writers who met under the guidance of a scientist , jacques moreau , and were administered a quantity of hashish and these experiences are recorded , " explained sergeant .
" moreau was interested in the effects of this substance on the genius : what would happen to an already extraordinary mind if it were altered in some way ? " first opium confession thomas de quincy may have been a genius , but his autobiographical " confessions of an english opium eater " from 1821 certainly influenced many creative minds , including composer hector berlioz , whose " symphonie fantastique " was inspired by it . " this was really the beginning of the modern european drug culture in many ways .
this was the first time that someone had written about their life in terms of their drug-taking and talked about what it was like to be an opium addict , " said mike jay , the exhibition 's co-curator and author of the accompanying book . bildunterschrift : this 1823 painting , " doctor and mrs syntax , " satirizes the trend of hosting nitrous oxide parties . these days , it 's practically a rite of passage for musicians to get arrested for possession of illegal drugs , but two centuries ago , composers were using drugs for a different reason : to enhance their ability to dream up new sounds , combinations of chords and assembling huge orchestras . " if you look at -lsb- french romantic composer hector -rsb- berlioz at the time , he was taking opium and writing about an opium dream , but actually he was in a very over-stimulated visionary state for about a year , hardly sleeping at all , " jay said .
" he was probably taking the opium to calm down .
so sometimes when we see creative people writing about drugs and taking drugs , the relationship is n't as it appears . " ' no nirvana of inspiration ' the exhibition is careful to avoid taking a position on drug use .
according to sergeant , there is a connection between drugs and art , but it is unclear whether drugs improve on talent . " it does n't seem from the material that we 've looked at that it is the answer to anything , " she said .
" there is no nirvana of inspiration that any one drug has unlocked .
but they have played this very important role in the lives of artists , writers and scientists throughout history .

in this postcard from vienna , kerry skyring explains how austria is coping with the onslaught . weird , is n't it ?
vienna is the birthplace of modern diplomacy .
the vienna convention on diplomatic relations underwrites the entire framework of modern international relations .
agreed in vienna in 1961 , it 's about to celebrate its half century - just as an upstart australian threatens to bring the whole diplomatic edifice tumbling down . under the vienna convention , diplomats enjoy a special status .
they 're privileged , that is , not subject to the same rules as you and i , and they are - or were - the keepers of state secrets .
oh , how a week of wikileaks can change the world ! and what better barricade from which to observe this revolution than the banks of the danube , the hofburg palace and the other landmarks where modern diplomacy decided its own game plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's kerry skyring says austrians are n't surprised the first leaks allowed us a look into austrian banks and their behavior over the past decade .
us cables from american diplomats in vienna show alarm at how lightly these drivers of the austrian economy - the banks - stepped into the muddy waters of business with regimes which washington liked to call " rogue states . " a transfer to north korea here , a deal with iran there and while we 're at it , let 's overlook the russian mafia boss who wants to launder his ukrainian gas company at an austrian bank .
what george w bush called the " axis of evil " was just another country or three for austrian companies and their bankers . what we have learnt is that the banks did do business with unsavory characters in eastern europe and that the americans called austrian politicians in for a few drinks and a bit of a chat - all according to vienna convention rules and the expectation of confidentiality .
they also hauled the bankers over the coals and as a result , the banks cut their ties to the appalling people they were doing business with . this brings us to the most revealing part of the wikileaks cables .
us diplomats see " austria 's engagement with the world slipping and narrowing . "
its chancellor werner faymann , a social democrat , is " not interested in foreign relations . "
austria , conclude the americans , is using its neutrality and pacifism as cover for business-led offensives .
washington laments that when it comes to sending its soldiers abroad , austria is " risk averse " in the extreme . the fact is : the americans are right about vienna .
it does do deals with dubious regimes and it does n't want to send its soldiers off to fight america 's or anyone else 's wars .
wikileaks revelations have brought a little huffing and puffing from austrian politicians who feel personally slighted , but i think they actually welcome the leaks .
these once secret cables tell the voters , in lines crafted by gifted wordsmiths , that their elected lawmakers are just like them : not too enamored of the americans and not too concerned about the ethics of the persons with whom they are doing business . seen from the banks of the danube , the vienna convention , 50 years old next year , is looking weak and quite leaky . author : kerry skyring , vienna editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mikhail khodorkovsky is standing trial on charges of embezzling oil worth billions of dollars . a russian court has unexpectedly delayed the delivery of a verdict for imprisoned oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky - formerly russia 's richest man - who faces charges of stealing over 200 tons of oil from his own wells .
a court spokesperson did not give a reason for the delay , but said the verdict would now be handed down on december 27 .
lawyers for khodorkovsky said they had not been informed of the decision to delay the verdict .
since his incarceration , khodorkovsky has been russia 's highest-profile inmate .
the 47-year-old khodorkovsky has been an outspoken critic of the kremlin , and particularly of prime minister vladimir putin .
the former oil billionaire , who was a major shareholder in failed petroleum company yukos , is already serving an eight-year sentence for tax evasion , which is set to expire in 2011 .
if found guilty of the fresh charges , he faces an additional six years in prison .
if found innocent , his release could come just months ahead of the next russian presidential election .
khodorkovsky 's year-and-a-half trial has been the subject of intense international scrutiny , particularly from the united states and germany , which accuse the kremlin of staging a political show trial with no legal basis .
russia analysts have kept a close eye on the khodorkovsky case , which they say could be a major indicator of president dmitry medvedev 's progress in reforming the country 's judicial system .

one of the focal points of the meeting is to be how to handle possible future debt crises in eurozone countries , such as the ones currently facing greece and ireland .
merkel insisted that no european country would be left behind should it face similar dire financial straits .
" no one in europe will be left alone , no one in europe will be abandoned , " merkel said .
" europe succeeds when it acts together and , i would add , europe succeeds only when it acts together . "
merkel accused of mishandling the situation the debate about the eu summit revealed a split in the german parliament over the issue of how to handle europe .
following merkel ’ s speech , the opposition social democratic party , the greens and the left party distanced themselves from merkel ’ s strategy . the head of the social democratic party bloc , frank-walter steinmeier said the government was sending out unclear signals , and that merkel ’ s hesitance had put germany ’ s commitment to european solidarity in doubt . merkel also came under attack from the head of the left party , gesine loetzsch .
she said the chancellor was rushing from one disaster to the next , whilst trying to give the impression that the situation was under control . " what we need now is investment in the future of europe , " loetzsch said .
crisis-proof euro after being forced to help bail out greece earlier this year , the european union created a financial rescue fund to be triggered in case of any future debt crisis .
ireland became the first country to access the fund last month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she believed in the strength of the euro some believe that the 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 997 billion -rrb- in the bailout fund wo n't be enough - particularly if financially troubled countries like spain or portugal are also forced to dip into it in the near future . according to some analysts , this could , in turn , threaten the eurozone itself , but chancellor merkel played down concerns about the eurozone 's common currency .
" it is undeniable that some eurozone countries face difficult challenges but it is also undeniable that the euro has shown itself to be crisis-proof , " she said .
spain causes market wobbles as if to illustrate the concerns about the potential for further bailouts , ratings agency moody ’ s warned spain on wednesday that its debt could be downgraded .
the euro slid in reaction to the news , while the borrowing costs of spain and portugal rose slightly .
the ratings agency standard and poor ’ s made a similar warning to belgium on tuesday . analysts have questioned whether the current fund would be sufficient to bailout spain , the eurozone 's fourth largest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's unemployment rate has topped 20 percent moody 's said it was concerned about spain 's high debt funding needs , its heavily indebted banks and its regional finances , but it did not expect madrid would have to follow greece and ireland in seeking an eu bailout . the portuguese government announced moves to cut red tape and boost growth , and said it would soon adopt quarterly fiscal targets , part of a broad effort to convince eu officials and financial markets it does not need a bailout . european commission president jose manuel barroso urged leaders to act fast to reach a consensus at the summit . germany pledges support for ecb meanwhile , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- is expected to ask euro zone member states for more capital , a move to lower its leverage as it helps tackle the debt crisis . that issue may be discussed among eu leaders on thursday , when they will be joined for dinner by ecb president jean-claude trichet .
the ecb has come under pressure to step up its bond-buying program to help the likes of ireland , greece and portugal . germany said it would support giving the ecb more capital , with an official saying the move would show financial markets that the central bank had the firepower to buy new government bonds if needed .
no support for european bonds jean-claude juncker , prime minister of luxembourg and the chairman of the group of eurozone finance ministers recently floated the idea of a common european bond to help relieve pressure on weaker members of the eurozone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker likes the idea of a single european bond merkel has been staunchly opposed to this proposal and reiterated her resistance again on wednesday .
she said that what she described as a " collectivization of risk " among eurozone nations would be a mistake .
germany fears that if adopted , eurobonds would significantly raise its borrowing costs , which are currently among the lowest in europe .
a report published in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on monday estimated the cost for germany of a common eurozone bond to be at least 17 billion euros annually .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 15.12.2010 bulgaria plans to sack diplomats who were communist spies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half of bulgaria 's eu diplomats are former spies bulgarian prime minister boyko borisov has called for 45 top diplomats to be sacked after it was revealed they had worked as agents for the secret police under communist rule . the bulgarian government said on wednesday it would seek to recall 45 top diplomats after a commission revealed they had worked for the secret police under communist rule .
a historical commission , which was given the task of examining the archives of the former secret police , found that a number of diplomats , including the current bulgarian ambassadors in london , berlin , rome , geneva , madrid , tokyo and moscow had collaborated with the former darzhavna sigurnost security service before the collapse of the soviet bloc in 1990 .
" imagine these agents in western european countries .
they once worked against them as ideological enemies and now they are representing our government there , " prime minister boiko borisov told reporters . " my opinion is that we have to part with these people and i suppose my party will back me up . "
collaboration with secret intelligence services remains a sensitive issue throughout the former communist bloc .
but bulgaria has been among the last to confront its communist past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian prime minister wants to get rid of former spies half of eu diplomats are former agents the strongly anti-communist blue coalition bloc said it was " shameful " that half of bulgaria 's ambassadors to european union countries spied for the communists .
once an obedient ally of moscow , bulgaria had a notorious network of spies before the fall of the iron curtain .
the bulgarian secret police was implicated in plots ranging from a failed assassination attempt on pope john paul ii to the killing of an exiled dissident in london with a poison-tipped umbrella .
the bulgarian foreign minister nikolay mladenov said it was " absolutely unacceptable " that so many embassies were still led by former intelligence agents .
a drive for more transparency in 2006 , the bulgarian government passed legislation to open the archives of the former secret police , but the measure does not oblige former agents to quit their current posts .
those who collaborated with the police are free to apply for positions in the civil service , or for political office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of diplomats had received kgb training the government will appeal to president georgi parvanov , who appoints ambassadors , to recall the former agents , mladenov told reporters .
he said the government would also propose legal changes to prevent former agents from getting diplomatic appointments .
prominent suspects the commission says information it has come across also shows parvanov himself may have worked for the pre-1990 secret police .
parvanov has said he wrote a book review for a man who later turned out to be an agent , but has denied he was ever a collaborator himself .
the commission found that 45 percent of the 462 former and current diplomats who have served since the fall of communism in 1989 , had been agents .
analysts say former kgb-trained bulgarian officers and their informants have used skills learned working for the secret police to take top positions in government , business and bulgaria 's powerful underworld .
" if half of our ambassadors were agents , imagine what the situation is within the country , " prime minister borisov said .
" we have certainly underestimated the heavy damage which the former darzhavna sigurnost has dealt to the state . "

mikhail khodorkovsky is standing trial on charges of embezzling oil worth billions of dollars . a russian court has unexpectedly delayed the delivery of a verdict for imprisoned oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky - formerly russia 's richest man - who faces charges of stealing over 200 tons of oil from his own wells .
a court spokesperson did not give a reason for the delay , but said the verdict would now be handed down on december 27 .
lawyers for khodorkovsky said they had not been informed of the decision to delay the verdict .
since his incarceration , khodorkovsky has been russia 's highest-profile inmate .
the 47-year-old khodorkovsky has been an outspoken critic of the kremlin , and particularly of prime minister vladimir putin .
the former oil billionaire , who was a major shareholder in failed petroleum company yukos , is already serving an eight-year sentence for tax evasion , which is set to expire in 2011 .
if found guilty of the fresh charges , he faces an additional six years in prison .
if found innocent , his release could come just months ahead of the next russian presidential election .
khodorkovsky 's year-and-a-half trial has been the subject of intense international scrutiny , particularly from the united states and germany , which accuse the kremlin of staging a political show trial with no legal basis .
russia analysts have kept a close eye on the khodorkovsky case , which they say could be a major indicator of president dmitry medvedev 's progress in reforming the country 's judicial system .

in 1991 , the pro-democracy activist received the nobel peace prize .
the 65-year old has spent 15 of the last 21 years in detention .
deutsche welle : what is your daily routine these days ?
aung san suu kyi : my daily routine is very , very hectic .
if i look back at today , i had about two , three appointments this morning and two in the afternoon , and i still have n't finished my work yet .
so , it is extremely hectic .
what kind of appointments are these ?
i am meeting diplomats , i am meeting political parties , i am meeting individuals , we have our national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- office meetings .
then i am speaking to people on the phone .
and there are individual journalists and correspondents , who have managed to come to burma , and i have to meet them as well .
what was the biggest change you noticed in your city after your house arrest was lifted ?
i think the number of hand phones !
the moment i was released , i saw all those people with their hand phones which they were using to take photographs .
i think what it means is that there is an improvement in communications .
and what about the burmese society ?
did you find any other changes ?
prices have gone up sky-high , and people are very concerned about it .
everybody talks about the rise in prices .
also , the attitude of the young people has improved considerably .
they want to be involved in the political process , and they are much more outgoing and proactive than they were seven years ago .
when you were released , it was striking that many young people turned up to greet you .
what are your expectations from the youth of burma ?
it is for them to understand that it is up to them to bring change to our country , and that they should not depend on me or the nld or anybody else .
we will do our best , but in the end i want them to have this self-confidence to believe that they can do it for themselves .
how do you see the future of your party , the national league for democracy ?
we are going to stand as a political force because we have the full support of the people .
of course , the authorities are trying to deregister our party , and i am contesting that at court , but that is a legal matter .
the real political truth of the situation is that we have the confidence , the trust and the support of the people , and that will keep us going as the most important opposition force in burma today .
have you tried to get in touch with the government after your release ?
no , not yet .
i have , of course , been sending indirect messages through almost every speech i have made , every interview i have had , that i would like to have dialogue .
i think we should discuss our differences and come to an agreement that we should be prepared to compromise on both sides .
but why have n't you taken any concrete step to initiate this kind of a dialogue ?
we are waiting for the right time , which i hope is not too far off .
burma is a country with many ethnic minorities , whose relationship with the majority has been rather tense over the recent decades .
what do you plan to do to reach out to these groups ?
we have been reaching out to these groups for a number of years , and i can claim that we have had a certain amount of success .
not only do we have very strong allies among the parties which contested the 1990 elections , we also have the support of other ethnic groups , including the ceasefire groups along the frontiers , who have expressed an interest in what we are trying to do - to revive the spirit of true union .
last week , the nobel peace prize for the chinese democracy activist liu xiaobo turned into a major international controversy .
what is your reaction , being a nobel laureate yourself ?
i have a great respect for the norwegian nobel committee , and i believe they must have sound reasons for choosing to give him the award this year .
i personally do n't know much about liu xiabo because i have been under house arrest for about seven years , and all i know about him is that what i heard on the radio .
but i do believe that the nobel committee must have sound reasons for selecting him .
in europe , people are wondering what they can do to support burma .
what is your advice ?
first of all , it would be very helpful if all the countries of europe could speak with one voice .
even within the european union there are different attitudes and different voices , and i think that weakens the -lsb- burmese -rsb- opposition .
it would help us a great deal if all european countries called for certain steps to be taken in burma - the release of political prisoners , inclusiveness of the political process , specifically with the nld , and negotiations .
do you have any specific european countries in mind , which you want to see more active in this ?
as i am talking to you in germany - i would like germany to be more active .
you said in previous interviews that you will need time to form an opinion about international sanctions against the burmese regime .
what is your impression so far on this matter ?
so far , i have not got the impression that economic sanctions have really hurt the public , but of course there are other voices that are perhaps still waiting to be heard , so we have yet to find out .
i have been released just for over a month , and i have n't had time to go into this issue ; i am waiting to read the latest report of the imf , and perhaps the adb and other economic institutions .
how influential is the west in burma ?
compared with that , how do you see india 's and china 's role ?
i think the role of the west in burma and the role of india and china are quite different .
i would not like to think of them as competing for influence , or competing for ascendancy over burma .
it is not as though we were not able to shape our own destiny .
but certainly , because india and china are very close neighbors , they have a certain advantage over those countries that are situated very far away .
does this mean that what the west does with regard to burma is not so important ?
no , it has its importance , depending on how and what actions the west is taking , which is why i said earlier that it would be good if all the western nations could coordinate their efforts .
not just the western nations , it would be good if the whole international community , including the united nations , coordinated its efforts .
that would help us very greatly indeed , and if it called for the same basic steps , that would mean progress .
what are your expectations from india and china ?
we would like them to engage with us .
to begin with , we 'd very much like india and china to give us the opportunity to explain our point of view to them .
we have very little contact with china and india .
we have more contact with the indian government than with the chinese government , in fact i do n't think we have any contact with the chinese government at all .
we would like to have contact with them , we would like them to listen to our side of the story , and make them understand that we look upon them as neighbors , and that we would like to be friends with them .
we are not hostile to them even if we are working for democracy in burma .
what are your plans for the coming weeks ?
the man that i fear most in the world is the man who keeps my appointment book .
i have n't gone through next week 's appointments with him ...

greek public sector workers are on a 24-hour strike to protest against government austerity measures . a public sector strike in greece was marred by violence on wednesday with angry protesters throwing rocks , bottles and firebombs at riot police who retaliated with tear gas .
the clashes occurred near the country 's finance ministry , where demonstrators had hurled a fire bomb into the second floor of the building setting part of it on fire . the protests were part of a 24-hour public sector strike directed against a series of austerity measures .
the cuts are being implemented by the greek government to rein in the spending as part of a bailout for the debt-stricken country , financed by the european union and the international monetary fund . many public sector workers would see their salaries cut and pension benefits reduced if the full force of the budget measures is implemented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strikes caused traffic backups in athens the strike has severely impacted transportation networks .
flights in and out of the country have been grounded , ships remain anchored in greek harbors , and train lines are not running .
public transportation strikes in athens throughout the week have also led to heavy traffic problems . in addition , hospitals are running on skeleton crews , schools are closed and bank workers have not been on the job since tuesday .
year of strikes wednesday 's strikes are n't the first to take place in greece against the government 's budget reduction plans .
widespread strikes have taken place throughout the year as greece 's debt situation has continued to worsen .
despite public opposition to the budget cuts , there is little reason to believe the greek government will be deterred in their resolve to pass the austerity measures .
the socialist government of prime minister george papandreou has a majority in parliament , and the reforms are tied to the 110-billion-euro -lrb- $ 147 billion -rrb- bailout from the eu and the imf .
eu summit greece is n't the only european nation to have protests against government austerity measures on wednesday - public sector workers in spain , belgium and other countries are set to rally as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou is not likely to change his government 's plans " european trade unions ask the governments to stop attacking wages and welfare , to act together , to stop racing from one crisis to the next , to stop destroying our social europe , " said john monks , general secretary of the european trade union confederation ahead of the protests .
the strikes and protests come ahead of a summit of eu leaders in brussels on thursday and friday to discuss expanding the eurozone 's financial rescue fund for possible future cases of extreme debt similar to that experienced by greece .
so far , ireland has been the only nation to access the fund , but speculation that spain and portugal will soon follow has raised the question whether the 750-billion-euro bailout fund will be sufficient .

as a result , the last draft will be on january 3 , 2011 . the german government on wednesday approved the plans of its defense minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , to reduce the size of the german military , the bundeswehr , by 65,000 soldiers to 185,000 . included in the reform are plans to suspend conscription from july 1 next year .
this means that the last young men will receive their draft notices on january 3 , ending a practice which goes back to 1957 and the start of german rearmament after world war ii .
the government has decided only to suspend the draft and not to abolish it .
abolition would require a change to the constitution , and the provision will remain in case a general call-up becomes necessary in a time of crisis .
the new armed forces will include 170,000 professional soldiers and 15,000 volunteers , who will serve for up to 23 months . guttenberg argues that a smaller bundeswehr will be more effective in dealing with modern military challenges .
a smaller military is still too expensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense minister has pushed for an end to conscription the plans are being made at a time when the military is under financial pressure . finance minister wolfgang schaeuble wants the defense ministry to save 8.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.2 billion -rrb- by 2014 .
the defense minister says he ca n't meet that target without reducing size of the military to 160,000 .
the suspension of conscription is expected to lead to an increase in the number of young people wanting to go to university .
the german states , which are responsible for financing education , say they are not prepared to pay the additional cost .
the chairman of the conference of state premiers , wolfgang boehmer , said that , if the central government created the financial burden , it should be prepared to discuss paying for it .
the suspension is also expected to lead to extra costs for social service providers , who have so far benefitted from the civilian service alternative to the draft . the cabinet also agreed on a new program of voluntary civil service , but the minister for families , kristina schroeder , has already said that it will not fill the gap completely .

but does doping make for better art ? from poetry to pop music , the question has been asked repeatedly over the years : can mind-altering substances enhance an artist 's performance ? an exhibition currently taking place at london 's wellcome institute examines the huge influence dope has had on the arts - and artists of all kinds - across the ages . " there is a huge range not only of substances , but also across different periods of time , " curator emily sergeant said , while pointing to bamboo opium pipe , a plastic ashtray from the 1970s and some fly agaric mushrooms , which she said are illegal in the uk . spiders on caffeine a particularly compelling part of the exhibition , however , is not directly related to artist - but to spiders . bildunterschrift : the webs may not be functional for catching flies , but they could be considered art -lrb- left to right : benzedrine , caffeine , marijuana -rrb- three graphics are taken from a series of experiments carried out by nasa on arachnids given doses of the amphetamine benzedrine , caffeine and marijuana .
their web-making ability was then assessed and the results are curious : the spider on caffeine created the most unconventional web . in the other two cases the usual web structure was visible at the beginning of the process .
but the caffeine-fuelled spider was noticeably less systematic and its web had large gaps and no circular center , making it essentially non-functional . the survival of the artist , however , is admittedly less dependent on the functionality of his product and more on its aesthetic appeal .
during the 19th century , a large number of writers , artists and scientists experimented with mind-altering substances - many of them legal at the time - to find out what kind of experience they could have . " we have an example from france and the club des hashischins , a group of artists and writers who met under the guidance of a scientist , jacques moreau , and were administered a quantity of hashish and these experiences are recorded , " explained sergeant .
" moreau was interested in the effects of this substance on the genius : what would happen to an already extraordinary mind if it were altered in some way ? " first opium confession thomas de quincy may have been a genius , but his autobiographical " confessions of an english opium eater " from 1821 certainly influenced many creative minds , including composer hector berlioz , whose " symphonie fantastique " was inspired by it . " this was really the beginning of the modern european drug culture in many ways .
this was the first time that someone had written about their life in terms of their drug-taking and talked about what it was like to be an opium addict , " said mike jay , the exhibition 's co-curator and author of the accompanying book . bildunterschrift : this 1823 painting , " doctor and mrs syntax , " satirizes the trend of hosting nitrous oxide parties . these days , it 's practically a rite of passage for musicians to get arrested for possession of illegal drugs , but two centuries ago , composers were using drugs for a different reason : to enhance their ability to dream up new sounds , combinations of chords and assembling huge orchestras . " if you look at -lsb- french romantic composer hector -rsb- berlioz at the time , he was taking opium and writing about an opium dream , but actually he was in a very over-stimulated visionary state for about a year , hardly sleeping at all , " jay said .
" he was probably taking the opium to calm down .
so sometimes when we see creative people writing about drugs and taking drugs , the relationship is n't as it appears . " ' no nirvana of inspiration ' the exhibition is careful to avoid taking a position on drug use .
according to sergeant , there is a connection between drugs and art , but it is unclear whether drugs improve on talent . " it does n't seem from the material that we 've looked at that it is the answer to anything , " she said .
" there is no nirvana of inspiration that any one drug has unlocked .

a historical commission , which was given the task of examining the archives of the former secret police , found that a number of diplomats , including the current bulgarian ambassadors in london , berlin , rome , geneva , madrid , tokyo and moscow had collaborated with the former darzhavna sigurnost security service before the collapse of the soviet bloc in 1990 .
" imagine these agents in western european countries .
they once worked against them as ideological enemies and now they are representing our government there , " prime minister boiko borisov told reporters . " my opinion is that we have to part with these people and i suppose my party will back me up . "
collaboration with secret intelligence services remains a sensitive issue throughout the former communist bloc .
but bulgaria has been among the last to confront its communist past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian prime minister wants to get rid of former spies half of eu diplomats are former agents the strongly anti-communist blue coalition bloc said it was " shameful " that half of bulgaria 's ambassadors to european union countries spied for the communists .
once an obedient ally of moscow , bulgaria had a notorious network of spies before the fall of the iron curtain .
the bulgarian secret police was implicated in plots ranging from a failed assassination attempt on pope john paul ii to the killing of an exiled dissident in london with a poison-tipped umbrella .
the bulgarian foreign minister nikolay mladenov said it was " absolutely unacceptable " that so many embassies were still led by former intelligence agents .
a drive for more transparency in 2006 , the bulgarian government passed legislation to open the archives of the former secret police , but the measure does not oblige former agents to quit their current posts .
those who collaborated with the police are free to apply for positions in the civil service , or for political office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of diplomats had received kgb training the government will appeal to president georgi parvanov , who appoints ambassadors , to recall the former agents , mladenov told reporters .
he said the government would also propose legal changes to prevent former agents from getting diplomatic appointments .
prominent suspects the commission says information it has come across also shows parvanov himself may have worked for the pre-1990 secret police .
parvanov has said he wrote a book review for a man who later turned out to be an agent , but has denied he was ever a collaborator himself .
the commission found that 45 percent of the 462 former and current diplomats who have served since the fall of communism in 1989 , had been agents .
analysts say former kgb-trained bulgarian officers and their informants have used skills learned working for the secret police to take top positions in government , business and bulgaria 's powerful underworld .
" if half of our ambassadors were agents , imagine what the situation is within the country , " prime minister borisov said .
" we have certainly underestimated the heavy damage which the former darzhavna sigurnost has dealt to the state . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 15.12.2010 artists have n't abandoned search for psychedelic nirvana of inspiration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artists have often tried to capture their hallucinations from victorian use of cocaine eye-drops to amy winehouse 's reliance on horse sedatives , creative minds have sought out psychedelic experiences for centuries .
but does doping make for better art ? from poetry to pop music , the question has been asked repeatedly over the years : can mind-altering substances enhance an artist 's performance ? an exhibition currently taking place at london 's wellcome institute examines the huge influence dope has had on the arts - and artists of all kinds - across the ages . " there is a huge range not only of substances , but also across different periods of time , " curator emily sergeant said , while pointing to bamboo opium pipe , a plastic ashtray from the 1970s and some fly agaric mushrooms , which she said are illegal in the uk . spiders on caffeine a particularly compelling part of the exhibition , however , is not directly related to artist - but to spiders . bildunterschrift : the webs may not be functional for catching flies , but they could be considered art -lrb- left to right : benzedrine , caffeine , marijuana -rrb- three graphics are taken from a series of experiments carried out by nasa on arachnids given doses of the amphetamine benzedrine , caffeine and marijuana .
their web-making ability was then assessed and the results are curious : the spider on caffeine created the most unconventional web . in the other two cases the usual web structure was visible at the beginning of the process .
but the caffeine-fuelled spider was noticeably less systematic and its web had large gaps and no circular center , making it essentially non-functional . the survival of the artist , however , is admittedly less dependent on the functionality of his product and more on its aesthetic appeal .
during the 19th century , a large number of writers , artists and scientists experimented with mind-altering substances - many of them legal at the time - to find out what kind of experience they could have . " we have an example from france and the club des hashischins , a group of artists and writers who met under the guidance of a scientist , jacques moreau , and were administered a quantity of hashish and these experiences are recorded , " explained sergeant .
" moreau was interested in the effects of this substance on the genius : what would happen to an already extraordinary mind if it were altered in some way ? " first opium confession thomas de quincy may have been a genius , but his autobiographical " confessions of an english opium eater " from 1821 certainly influenced many creative minds , including composer hector berlioz , whose " symphonie fantastique " was inspired by it . " this was really the beginning of the modern european drug culture in many ways .
this was the first time that someone had written about their life in terms of their drug-taking and talked about what it was like to be an opium addict , " said mike jay , the exhibition 's co-curator and author of the accompanying book . bildunterschrift : this 1823 painting , " doctor and mrs syntax , " satirizes the trend of hosting nitrous oxide parties . these days , it 's practically a rite of passage for musicians to get arrested for possession of illegal drugs , but two centuries ago , composers were using drugs for a different reason : to enhance their ability to dream up new sounds , combinations of chords and assembling huge orchestras . " if you look at -lsb- french romantic composer hector -rsb- berlioz at the time , he was taking opium and writing about an opium dream , but actually he was in a very over-stimulated visionary state for about a year , hardly sleeping at all , " jay said .
" he was probably taking the opium to calm down .
so sometimes when we see creative people writing about drugs and taking drugs , the relationship is n't as it appears . " ' no nirvana of inspiration ' the exhibition is careful to avoid taking a position on drug use .
according to sergeant , there is a connection between drugs and art , but it is unclear whether drugs improve on talent . " it does n't seem from the material that we 've looked at that it is the answer to anything , " she said .

in this postcard from vienna , kerry skyring explains how austria is coping with the onslaught . weird , is n't it ?
vienna is the birthplace of modern diplomacy .
the vienna convention on diplomatic relations underwrites the entire framework of modern international relations .
agreed in vienna in 1961 , it 's about to celebrate its half century - just as an upstart australian threatens to bring the whole diplomatic edifice tumbling down . under the vienna convention , diplomats enjoy a special status .
they 're privileged , that is , not subject to the same rules as you and i , and they are - or were - the keepers of state secrets .
oh , how a week of wikileaks can change the world ! and what better barricade from which to observe this revolution than the banks of the danube , the hofburg palace and the other landmarks where modern diplomacy decided its own game plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's kerry skyring says austrians are n't surprised the first leaks allowed us a look into austrian banks and their behavior over the past decade .
us cables from american diplomats in vienna show alarm at how lightly these drivers of the austrian economy - the banks - stepped into the muddy waters of business with regimes which washington liked to call " rogue states . " a transfer to north korea here , a deal with iran there and while we 're at it , let 's overlook the russian mafia boss who wants to launder his ukrainian gas company at an austrian bank .
what george w bush called the " axis of evil " was just another country or three for austrian companies and their bankers . what we have learnt is that the banks did do business with unsavory characters in eastern europe and that the americans called austrian politicians in for a few drinks and a bit of a chat - all according to vienna convention rules and the expectation of confidentiality .
they also hauled the bankers over the coals and as a result , the banks cut their ties to the appalling people they were doing business with . this brings us to the most revealing part of the wikileaks cables .
us diplomats see " austria 's engagement with the world slipping and narrowing . "
its chancellor werner faymann , a social democrat , is " not interested in foreign relations . "
austria , conclude the americans , is using its neutrality and pacifism as cover for business-led offensives .
washington laments that when it comes to sending its soldiers abroad , austria is " risk averse " in the extreme . the fact is : the americans are right about vienna .
it does do deals with dubious regimes and it does n't want to send its soldiers off to fight america 's or anyone else 's wars .
wikileaks revelations have brought a little huffing and puffing from austrian politicians who feel personally slighted , but i think they actually welcome the leaks .
these once secret cables tell the voters , in lines crafted by gifted wordsmiths , that their elected lawmakers are just like them : not too enamored of the americans and not too concerned about the ethics of the persons with whom they are doing business . seen from the banks of the danube , the vienna convention , 50 years old next year , is looking weak and quite leaky . author : kerry skyring , vienna editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 15.12.2010 postcard from europe : a little headache called austria großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there appears to be little interest in world affairs at the hofburg palace the wikileaks disclosures show that one of europe 's smallest countries is apparently causing a big headache for washington .
in this postcard from vienna , kerry skyring explains how austria is coping with the onslaught . weird , is n't it ?
vienna is the birthplace of modern diplomacy .
the vienna convention on diplomatic relations underwrites the entire framework of modern international relations .
agreed in vienna in 1961 , it 's about to celebrate its half century - just as an upstart australian threatens to bring the whole diplomatic edifice tumbling down . under the vienna convention , diplomats enjoy a special status .
they 're privileged , that is , not subject to the same rules as you and i , and they are - or were - the keepers of state secrets .
oh , how a week of wikileaks can change the world ! and what better barricade from which to observe this revolution than the banks of the danube , the hofburg palace and the other landmarks where modern diplomacy decided its own game plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's kerry skyring says austrians are n't surprised the first leaks allowed us a look into austrian banks and their behavior over the past decade .
us cables from american diplomats in vienna show alarm at how lightly these drivers of the austrian economy - the banks - stepped into the muddy waters of business with regimes which washington liked to call " rogue states . " a transfer to north korea here , a deal with iran there and while we 're at it , let 's overlook the russian mafia boss who wants to launder his ukrainian gas company at an austrian bank .
what george w bush called the " axis of evil " was just another country or three for austrian companies and their bankers . what we have learnt is that the banks did do business with unsavory characters in eastern europe and that the americans called austrian politicians in for a few drinks and a bit of a chat - all according to vienna convention rules and the expectation of confidentiality .
they also hauled the bankers over the coals and as a result , the banks cut their ties to the appalling people they were doing business with . this brings us to the most revealing part of the wikileaks cables .
us diplomats see " austria 's engagement with the world slipping and narrowing . "
its chancellor werner faymann , a social democrat , is " not interested in foreign relations . "
austria , conclude the americans , is using its neutrality and pacifism as cover for business-led offensives .
washington laments that when it comes to sending its soldiers abroad , austria is " risk averse " in the extreme . the fact is : the americans are right about vienna .
it does do deals with dubious regimes and it does n't want to send its soldiers off to fight america 's or anyone else 's wars .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de medicine -pipe- 15.12.2010 berlin man still cured of hiv after three years , researchers say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. gero huetter is one of the co-authors of the paper three years after receiving a stem cell transplant , one man no longer has hiv .
however , scientists caution that this procedure can only be replicated in certain circumstances and merits further study . in a new study , german researchers have confirmed that an american man living in berlin was successfully cured of his hiv infection after having received a blood stem cell transplant in 2007 .
" in conclusion , our results strongly suggest that cure of hiv has been achieved in this patient , " the researchers write in the abstract to their paper , which was published last week in blood , a medical journal .
the new paper is a follow-up study by the same german team to one they had published in the new england journal of medicine in february 2009 .
that study found " the patient remained without viral rebound 20 months after transplantation and discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy . "
" we were n't able to find hiv in his cells , " said dr. gero huetter , a hematologist and professor at the university of heidelberg , and a co-author of the new paper , in an interview with deutsche welle . " the new cells have a natural resistance against hiv . "
three years ago , timothy ray brown had been an hiv-positive leukemia patient .
prior to receiving the stem cell transplant , he underwent intense chemotherapy to completely replace his immune system .
however , the new stem cells that he received had a rare genetic mutation - found naturally in just one percent of caucasians in northern and western europe - that causes certain cells to lack a particular receptor , known as the ccr5 receptor , which hiv binds to .
at the time huetter specifically was looking for bone marrow stem cell donors that contained the rare ccr5 deletion .
since his treatment , the so-called " berlin patient " has been effectively cured of aids and its disease-causing virus , hiv , but also leukemia .
this likely makes him the first , and so far , only person ever to have been cured of hiv , out of more than 30 million currently infected people worldwide .
scientists have previously seen a very small number of cases where the virus does not replicate inside the host and therefore does not cause aids .
however , these so-called " non-progressives , " represent an extremely small percentage of known hiv patients around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 30 million people worldwide are infected with hiv an " intriguing " step , aids researchers say in the wake of the new german paper , aids and hiv researchers around the world are starting to take stock of this important finding .
" it 's intriguing that this patient does not have a rebound of the hiv replication , " said jens lundgren , an aids researcher and professor at the university of copenhagen , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they have certainly proven the case that there is no apparent residual infection in this person , and the hiv had multiple opportunities to replicate . "
another german aids researcher , dr. jan van lunzen , of the university hospital eppendorf in hamburg , agreed with this assessment .
" it seems that so far , this patient is one that we could call cured from hiv , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle . " this is the only known case , so far . "
but lundgren cautioned that researchers can not claim that they have cured aids or hiv as this was only one , very particular case .
" we can not really make statements on cure rates based on a single patient , " the researcher , who was not part of the study , added .
" this has to be looked at much more comprehensively , and this raises the issue of who wants to undergo a stem cell transplantation ?
this is not a procedure that you want to do on a whim , if you 're otherwise healthy . "
huetter and his colleagues , however , say that the ccr5 technique has a good chance of becoming a new method for treating , or perhaps even curing hiv in the future .
" probably in five , 10 or 20 years there will be techniques and procedures which can knock down ccr5 in a more complete way and will substitute this current medication of antiretroviral therapy , " he said .

as a result , the last draft will be on january 3 , 2011 . the german government on wednesday approved the plans of its defense minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , to reduce the size of the german military , the bundeswehr , by 65,000 soldiers to 185,000 . included in the reform are plans to suspend conscription from july 1 next year .
this means that the last young men will receive their draft notices on january 3 , ending a practice which goes back to 1957 and the start of german rearmament after world war ii .
the government has decided only to suspend the draft and not to abolish it .
abolition would require a change to the constitution , and the provision will remain in case a general call-up becomes necessary in a time of crisis .
the new armed forces will include 170,000 professional soldiers and 15,000 volunteers , who will serve for up to 23 months . guttenberg argues that a smaller bundeswehr will be more effective in dealing with modern military challenges .

as a result , the last draft will be on january 3 , 2011 . the german government on wednesday approved the plans of its defense minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , to reduce the size of the german military , the bundeswehr , by 65,000 soldiers to 185,000 . included in the reform are plans to suspend conscription from july 1 next year .
this means that the last young men will receive their draft notices on january 3 , ending a practice which goes back to 1957 and the start of german rearmament after world war ii .
the government has decided only to suspend the draft and not to abolish it .
abolition would require a change to the constitution , and the provision will remain in case a general call-up becomes necessary in a time of crisis .
the new armed forces will include 170,000 professional soldiers and 15,000 volunteers , who will serve for up to 23 months . guttenberg argues that a smaller bundeswehr will be more effective in dealing with modern military challenges .

dw-akademie director gerda meuer was invited to speak at a two-day conference held in the bhutan capital , thimphu . “ the challenges of public service broadcasting ” was the title of the media conference organized in november by the bhutan centre for media and democracy and the bhutan broadcasting service -lrb- bbs -rrb- , the country ’ s sole television broadcaster .
politicians , media representatives and academics – the majority from bhutan itself – came to thimphu to discuss the challenges .
also invited were experts from thailand , the philippines and ireland , and gerda meuer , director of dw-akademie , from germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meuer looked back at 60 years of german public broadcasting .
“ following world war ii the allies wanted to create a media system in germany that was decentralized , politically and economically independent , and that represented all layers of society .
they wanted an open dialogue for everyone , ” she said .
she explained the structure of the german public broadcasting system and described the functions of the various broadcasting boards .
but , she warned , “ one can not simply copy the models of other countries and transfer them to one ’ s own .
the goal is to find a system that best suits one ’ s own country . ”
with its strategic importance , bhutan is the size of switzerland and lies between china and india .
800,000 inhabitants live in the kingdom which the monarch is aiming to restructure into a democracy – in harmony with a unique political philosophy .
traditionally , the country ’ s leader is committed to the “ gross national happiness ” , where each political decision has to be in line with the individual ’ s and society ’ s well-being .
this is quite different to the western idea of growth .
accordingly , the media workshop in thimphu developed recommendations which would make it possible to transform the bhutanese state broadcaster into a public broadcaster .
“ now our primary objective is to create our own understanding of public service broadcasting , ” said pema choden , bbs director .
“ at the same time we need to find our own role within the new political context . ”

but does doping make for better art ? from poetry to pop music , the question has been asked repeatedly over the years : can mind-altering substances enhance an artist 's performance ? an exhibition currently taking place at london 's wellcome institute examines the huge influence dope has had on the arts - and artists of all kinds - across the ages . " there is a huge range not only of substances , but also across different periods of time , " curator emily sergeant said , while pointing to bamboo opium pipe , a plastic ashtray from the 1970s and some fly agaric mushrooms , which she said are illegal in the uk . spiders on caffeine a particularly compelling part of the exhibition , however , is not directly related to artist - but to spiders . bildunterschrift : the webs may not be functional for catching flies , but they could be considered art -lrb- left to right : benzedrine , caffeine , marijuana -rrb- three graphics are taken from a series of experiments carried out by nasa on arachnids given doses of the amphetamine benzedrine , caffeine and marijuana .

but the caffeine-fuelled spider was noticeably less systematic and its web had large gaps and no circular center , making it essentially non-functional . the survival of the artist , however , is admittedly less dependent on the functionality of his product and more on its aesthetic appeal .
during the 19th century , a large number of writers , artists and scientists experimented with mind-altering substances - many of them legal at the time - to find out what kind of experience they could have . " we have an example from france and the club des hashischins , a group of artists and writers who met under the guidance of a scientist , jacques moreau , and were administered a quantity of hashish and these experiences are recorded , " explained sergeant .
" moreau was interested in the effects of this substance on the genius : what would happen to an already extraordinary mind if it were altered in some way ?

" if you look at -lsb- french romantic composer hector -rsb- berlioz at the time , he was taking opium and writing about an opium dream , but actually he was in a very over-stimulated visionary state for about a year , hardly sleeping at all , " jay said .
" he was probably taking the opium to calm down .
so sometimes when we see creative people writing about drugs and taking drugs , the relationship is n't as it appears . " ' no nirvana of inspiration ' the exhibition is careful to avoid taking a position on drug use .
according to sergeant , there is a connection between drugs and art , but it is unclear whether drugs improve on talent . " it does n't seem from the material that we 've looked at that it is the answer to anything , " she said .

some 300 serbian journalists , broadcast technicians , and media managers have participated in workshops since then . ten years of media development in serbia – a good reason for dw-akademie and former participants to take stock of the work achieved so far and to look ahead .
at the end of november the europe and central asia division invited alumni to a conference in belgrade .
the goal was to combine an informal get-together with a one-day workshop involving groups and discussions on dw-akademie ’ s performance .
“ what are we doing well and what can we do better ? ” were the central questions posed to twenty serbian journalists from all regions in the country .
the alumni gave top praise to dw-akademie ’ s advanced training in areas such as interview training , environmental reporting and online journalism .
additional plus points were given for discussions with german experts and networking with other participants .
starting in 2011 , a new , regional dw-akademie blog will support this exchange online .
the alumni also had suggestions for future projects .
one participant proposed the joint construction of an exchange platform for radio and television reports .
others hoped for more involvement of upper management in the projects to help overcome management ’ s reluctance to work with new ideas .
participants mentioned other barriers making it difficult to implement what they had learned including a lack of finances and time , as well as political pressure .
“ we really appreciate the feedback and now have new ideas which we ’ ll include in our upcoming projects , ” says filip slavkovic who coordinates dw-akademie projects in southeastern europe .
further workshops together with the osce media department are planned for serbia starting at the beginning of 2011 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

offenders , however , are rarely reported to authorities and the media coverage is insufficient .
a joint gtz and dw-akademie radio workshop focused on the issue . the radio journalist participants recorded women who had experienced physical or emotional violence and men who had inflicted such violence .
“ this workshop was part of gtz ’ s supranational project ‘ convomujer – combating violence against women in peru , ecuador , bolivia and paraguay ’ , ” says dw-akademie project manager , vera möller-holtkamp .
education , prevention and solidarity are the main project goals .
the radio reports resulting from this particular workshop are also aimed at encouraging afflicted women to seek help .
journalists from community radio stations belonging to the peruvian umbrella organization coordinadora nacional de radio -lrb- cnr -rrb- came from various regions to attend the workshop held in the capital , lima .
with support from dw-akademie trainer hans-günter kellner and a local cnr trainer , the participants produced reports , interviews and short information announcements .
these are to be aired locally and also offered free of charge on cnr ’ s website to radio stations which did not take part in the workshop .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the participants researched potential social and cultural reasons for the violence .
they talked with psychologists , social workers and women affected by it , choosing new angles to report on the issue .
the results included a report about a once-violent man who underwent therapy and now heads a men ’ s self-help group .

mikhail khodorkovsky is standing trial on charges of embezzling oil worth billions of dollars . a russian court has unexpectedly delayed the delivery of a verdict for imprisoned oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky - formerly russia 's richest man - who faces charges of stealing over 200 tons of oil from his own wells .
a court spokesperson did not give a reason for the delay , but said the verdict would now be handed down on december 27 .
lawyers for khodorkovsky said they had not been informed of the decision to delay the verdict .
since his incarceration , khodorkovsky has been russia 's highest-profile inmate .
the 47-year-old khodorkovsky has been an outspoken critic of the kremlin , and particularly of prime minister vladimir putin .
the former oil billionaire , who was a major shareholder in failed petroleum company yukos , is already serving an eight-year sentence for tax evasion , which is set to expire in 2011 .
if found guilty of the fresh charges , he faces an additional six years in prison .
if found innocent , his release could come just months ahead of the next russian presidential election .
khodorkovsky 's year-and-a-half trial has been the subject of intense international scrutiny , particularly from the united states and germany , which accuse the kremlin of staging a political show trial with no legal basis .
russia analysts have kept a close eye on the khodorkovsky case , which they say could be a major indicator of president dmitry medvedev 's progress in reforming the country 's judicial system .

in 1991 , the pro-democracy activist received the nobel peace prize .
the 65-year old has spent 15 of the last 21 years in detention .
deutsche welle : what is your daily routine these days ?
aung san suu kyi : my daily routine is very , very hectic .
if i look back at today , i had about two , three appointments this morning and two in the afternoon , and i still have n't finished my work yet .
so , it is extremely hectic .
what kind of appointments are these ?
i am meeting diplomats , i am meeting political parties , i am meeting individuals , we have our national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- office meetings .
then i am speaking to people on the phone .
and there are individual journalists and correspondents , who have managed to come to burma , and i have to meet them as well .
what was the biggest change you noticed in your city after your house arrest was lifted ?
i think the number of hand phones !
the moment i was released , i saw all those people with their hand phones which they were using to take photographs .
i think what it means is that there is an improvement in communications .
and what about the burmese society ?
did you find any other changes ?
prices have gone up sky-high , and people are very concerned about it .
everybody talks about the rise in prices .
also , the attitude of the young people has improved considerably .
they want to be involved in the political process , and they are much more outgoing and proactive than they were seven years ago .
when you were released , it was striking that many young people turned up to greet you .
what are your expectations from the youth of burma ?
it is for them to understand that it is up to them to bring change to our country , and that they should not depend on me or the nld or anybody else .
we will do our best , but in the end i want them to have this self-confidence to believe that they can do it for themselves .
how do you see the future of your party , the national league for democracy ?
we are going to stand as a political force because we have the full support of the people .
of course , the authorities are trying to deregister our party , and i am contesting that at court , but that is a legal matter .
the real political truth of the situation is that we have the confidence , the trust and the support of the people , and that will keep us going as the most important opposition force in burma today .
have you tried to get in touch with the government after your release ?
no , not yet .
i have , of course , been sending indirect messages through almost every speech i have made , every interview i have had , that i would like to have dialogue .
i think we should discuss our differences and come to an agreement that we should be prepared to compromise on both sides .
but why have n't you taken any concrete step to initiate this kind of a dialogue ?
we are waiting for the right time , which i hope is not too far off .
burma is a country with many ethnic minorities , whose relationship with the majority has been rather tense over the recent decades .
what do you plan to do to reach out to these groups ?
we have been reaching out to these groups for a number of years , and i can claim that we have had a certain amount of success .
not only do we have very strong allies among the parties which contested the 1990 elections , we also have the support of other ethnic groups , including the ceasefire groups along the frontiers , who have expressed an interest in what we are trying to do - to revive the spirit of true union .
last week , the nobel peace prize for the chinese democracy activist liu xiaobo turned into a major international controversy .
what is your reaction , being a nobel laureate yourself ?
i have a great respect for the norwegian nobel committee , and i believe they must have sound reasons for choosing to give him the award this year .
i personally do n't know much about liu xiabo because i have been under house arrest for about seven years , and all i know about him is that what i heard on the radio .
but i do believe that the nobel committee must have sound reasons for selecting him .
in europe , people are wondering what they can do to support burma .
what is your advice ?
first of all , it would be very helpful if all the countries of europe could speak with one voice .
even within the european union there are different attitudes and different voices , and i think that weakens the -lsb- burmese -rsb- opposition .
it would help us a great deal if all european countries called for certain steps to be taken in burma - the release of political prisoners , inclusiveness of the political process , specifically with the nld , and negotiations .
do you have any specific european countries in mind , which you want to see more active in this ?
as i am talking to you in germany - i would like germany to be more active .
you said in previous interviews that you will need time to form an opinion about international sanctions against the burmese regime .
what is your impression so far on this matter ?
so far , i have not got the impression that economic sanctions have really hurt the public , but of course there are other voices that are perhaps still waiting to be heard , so we have yet to find out .
i have been released just for over a month , and i have n't had time to go into this issue ; i am waiting to read the latest report of the imf , and perhaps the adb and other economic institutions .
how influential is the west in burma ?
compared with that , how do you see india 's and china 's role ?
i think the role of the west in burma and the role of india and china are quite different .
i would not like to think of them as competing for influence , or competing for ascendancy over burma .
it is not as though we were not able to shape our own destiny .
but certainly , because india and china are very close neighbors , they have a certain advantage over those countries that are situated very far away .
does this mean that what the west does with regard to burma is not so important ?
no , it has its importance , depending on how and what actions the west is taking , which is why i said earlier that it would be good if all the western nations could coordinate their efforts .
not just the western nations , it would be good if the whole international community , including the united nations , coordinated its efforts .
that would help us very greatly indeed , and if it called for the same basic steps , that would mean progress .
what are your expectations from india and china ?
we would like them to engage with us .
to begin with , we 'd very much like india and china to give us the opportunity to explain our point of view to them .
we have very little contact with china and india .
we have more contact with the indian government than with the chinese government , in fact i do n't think we have any contact with the chinese government at all .
we would like to have contact with them , we would like them to listen to our side of the story , and make them understand that we look upon them as neighbors , and that we would like to be friends with them .
we are not hostile to them even if we are working for democracy in burma .
what are your plans for the coming weeks ?
the man that i fear most in the world is the man who keeps my appointment book .
i have n't gone through next week 's appointments with him ...

in 1991 , the pro-democracy activist received the nobel peace prize .
the 65-year old has spent 15 of the last 21 years in detention .
deutsche welle : what is your daily routine these days ?
aung san suu kyi : my daily routine is very , very hectic .
if i look back at today , i had about two , three appointments this morning and two in the afternoon , and i still have n't finished my work yet .
so , it is extremely hectic .
what kind of appointments are these ?
i am meeting diplomats , i am meeting political parties , i am meeting individuals , we have our national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- office meetings .
then i am speaking to people on the phone .
and there are individual journalists and correspondents , who have managed to come to burma , and i have to meet them as well .
what was the biggest change you noticed in your city after your house arrest was lifted ?
i think the number of hand phones !
the moment i was released , i saw all those people with their hand phones which they were using to take photographs .
i think what it means is that there is an improvement in communications .
and what about the burmese society ?
did you find any other changes ?
prices have gone up sky-high , and people are very concerned about it .
everybody talks about the rise in prices .
also , the attitude of the young people has improved considerably .
they want to be involved in the political process , and they are much more outgoing and proactive than they were seven years ago .
when you were released , it was striking that many young people turned up to greet you .
what are your expectations from the youth of burma ?
it is for them to understand that it is up to them to bring change to our country , and that they should not depend on me or the nld or anybody else .
we will do our best , but in the end i want them to have this self-confidence to believe that they can do it for themselves .
how do you see the future of your party , the national league for democracy ?
we are going to stand as a political force because we have the full support of the people .
of course , the authorities are trying to deregister our party , and i am contesting that at court , but that is a legal matter .
the real political truth of the situation is that we have the confidence , the trust and the support of the people , and that will keep us going as the most important opposition force in burma today .
have you tried to get in touch with the government after your release ?
no , not yet .
i have , of course , been sending indirect messages through almost every speech i have made , every interview i have had , that i would like to have dialogue .
i think we should discuss our differences and come to an agreement that we should be prepared to compromise on both sides .
but why have n't you taken any concrete step to initiate this kind of a dialogue ?
we are waiting for the right time , which i hope is not too far off .
burma is a country with many ethnic minorities , whose relationship with the majority has been rather tense over the recent decades .
what do you plan to do to reach out to these groups ?
we have been reaching out to these groups for a number of years , and i can claim that we have had a certain amount of success .
not only do we have very strong allies among the parties which contested the 1990 elections , we also have the support of other ethnic groups , including the ceasefire groups along the frontiers , who have expressed an interest in what we are trying to do - to revive the spirit of true union .
last week , the nobel peace prize for the chinese democracy activist liu xiaobo turned into a major international controversy .
what is your reaction , being a nobel laureate yourself ?
i have a great respect for the norwegian nobel committee , and i believe they must have sound reasons for choosing to give him the award this year .
i personally do n't know much about liu xiabo because i have been under house arrest for about seven years , and all i know about him is that what i heard on the radio .
but i do believe that the nobel committee must have sound reasons for selecting him .
in europe , people are wondering what they can do to support burma .
what is your advice ?
first of all , it would be very helpful if all the countries of europe could speak with one voice .
even within the european union there are different attitudes and different voices , and i think that weakens the -lsb- burmese -rsb- opposition .
it would help us a great deal if all european countries called for certain steps to be taken in burma - the release of political prisoners , inclusiveness of the political process , specifically with the nld , and negotiations .
do you have any specific european countries in mind , which you want to see more active in this ?
as i am talking to you in germany - i would like germany to be more active .
you said in previous interviews that you will need time to form an opinion about international sanctions against the burmese regime .
what is your impression so far on this matter ?
so far , i have not got the impression that economic sanctions have really hurt the public , but of course there are other voices that are perhaps still waiting to be heard , so we have yet to find out .
i have been released just for over a month , and i have n't had time to go into this issue ; i am waiting to read the latest report of the imf , and perhaps the adb and other economic institutions .
how influential is the west in burma ?
compared with that , how do you see india 's and china 's role ?
i think the role of the west in burma and the role of india and china are quite different .
i would not like to think of them as competing for influence , or competing for ascendancy over burma .
it is not as though we were not able to shape our own destiny .
but certainly , because india and china are very close neighbors , they have a certain advantage over those countries that are situated very far away .
does this mean that what the west does with regard to burma is not so important ?
no , it has its importance , depending on how and what actions the west is taking , which is why i said earlier that it would be good if all the western nations could coordinate their efforts .
not just the western nations , it would be good if the whole international community , including the united nations , coordinated its efforts .
that would help us very greatly indeed , and if it called for the same basic steps , that would mean progress .
what are your expectations from india and china ?
we would like them to engage with us .
to begin with , we 'd very much like india and china to give us the opportunity to explain our point of view to them .
we have very little contact with china and india .
we have more contact with the indian government than with the chinese government , in fact i do n't think we have any contact with the chinese government at all .
we would like to have contact with them , we would like them to listen to our side of the story , and make them understand that we look upon them as neighbors , and that we would like to be friends with them .
we are not hostile to them even if we are working for democracy in burma .
what are your plans for the coming weeks ?
the man that i fear most in the world is the man who keeps my appointment book .
i have n't gone through next week 's appointments with him ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 15.12.2010 artists have n't abandoned search for psychedelic nirvana of inspiration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artists have often tried to capture their hallucinations from victorian use of cocaine eye-drops to amy winehouse 's reliance on horse sedatives , creative minds have sought out psychedelic experiences for centuries .
but does doping make for better art ? from poetry to pop music , the question has been asked repeatedly over the years : can mind-altering substances enhance an artist 's performance ? an exhibition currently taking place at london 's wellcome institute examines the huge influence dope has had on the arts - and artists of all kinds - across the ages . " there is a huge range not only of substances , but also across different periods of time , " curator emily sergeant said , while pointing to bamboo opium pipe , a plastic ashtray from the 1970s and some fly agaric mushrooms , which she said are illegal in the uk . spiders on caffeine a particularly compelling part of the exhibition , however , is not directly related to artist - but to spiders . bildunterschrift : the webs may not be functional for catching flies , but they could be considered art -lrb- left to right : benzedrine , caffeine , marijuana -rrb- three graphics are taken from a series of experiments carried out by nasa on arachnids given doses of the amphetamine benzedrine , caffeine and marijuana .
their web-making ability was then assessed and the results are curious : the spider on caffeine created the most unconventional web . in the other two cases the usual web structure was visible at the beginning of the process .
but the caffeine-fuelled spider was noticeably less systematic and its web had large gaps and no circular center , making it essentially non-functional . the survival of the artist , however , is admittedly less dependent on the functionality of his product and more on its aesthetic appeal .
during the 19th century , a large number of writers , artists and scientists experimented with mind-altering substances - many of them legal at the time - to find out what kind of experience they could have . " we have an example from france and the club des hashischins , a group of artists and writers who met under the guidance of a scientist , jacques moreau , and were administered a quantity of hashish and these experiences are recorded , " explained sergeant .
" moreau was interested in the effects of this substance on the genius : what would happen to an already extraordinary mind if it were altered in some way ? " first opium confession thomas de quincy may have been a genius , but his autobiographical " confessions of an english opium eater " from 1821 certainly influenced many creative minds , including composer hector berlioz , whose " symphonie fantastique " was inspired by it . " this was really the beginning of the modern european drug culture in many ways .
this was the first time that someone had written about their life in terms of their drug-taking and talked about what it was like to be an opium addict , " said mike jay , the exhibition 's co-curator and author of the accompanying book . bildunterschrift : this 1823 painting , " doctor and mrs syntax , " satirizes the trend of hosting nitrous oxide parties . these days , it 's practically a rite of passage for musicians to get arrested for possession of illegal drugs , but two centuries ago , composers were using drugs for a different reason : to enhance their ability to dream up new sounds , combinations of chords and assembling huge orchestras . " if you look at -lsb- french romantic composer hector -rsb- berlioz at the time , he was taking opium and writing about an opium dream , but actually he was in a very over-stimulated visionary state for about a year , hardly sleeping at all , " jay said .
" he was probably taking the opium to calm down .
so sometimes when we see creative people writing about drugs and taking drugs , the relationship is n't as it appears . " ' no nirvana of inspiration ' the exhibition is careful to avoid taking a position on drug use .
according to sergeant , there is a connection between drugs and art , but it is unclear whether drugs improve on talent . " it does n't seem from the material that we 've looked at that it is the answer to anything , " she said .
" there is no nirvana of inspiration that any one drug has unlocked .
but they have played this very important role in the lives of artists , writers and scientists throughout history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de medicine -pipe- 15.12.2010 berlin man still cured of hiv after three years , researchers say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. gero huetter is one of the co-authors of the paper three years after receiving a stem cell transplant , one man no longer has hiv .
however , scientists caution that this procedure can only be replicated in certain circumstances and merits further study . in a new study , german researchers have confirmed that an american man living in berlin was successfully cured of his hiv infection after having received a blood stem cell transplant in 2007 .
" in conclusion , our results strongly suggest that cure of hiv has been achieved in this patient , " the researchers write in the abstract to their paper , which was published last week in blood , a medical journal .
the new paper is a follow-up study by the same german team to one they had published in the new england journal of medicine in february 2009 .
that study found " the patient remained without viral rebound 20 months after transplantation and discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy . "
" we were n't able to find hiv in his cells , " said dr. gero huetter , a hematologist and professor at the university of heidelberg , and a co-author of the new paper , in an interview with deutsche welle . " the new cells have a natural resistance against hiv . "
three years ago , timothy ray brown had been an hiv-positive leukemia patient .
prior to receiving the stem cell transplant , he underwent intense chemotherapy to completely replace his immune system .
however , the new stem cells that he received had a rare genetic mutation - found naturally in just one percent of caucasians in northern and western europe - that causes certain cells to lack a particular receptor , known as the ccr5 receptor , which hiv binds to .
at the time huetter specifically was looking for bone marrow stem cell donors that contained the rare ccr5 deletion .
since his treatment , the so-called " berlin patient " has been effectively cured of aids and its disease-causing virus , hiv , but also leukemia .
this likely makes him the first , and so far , only person ever to have been cured of hiv , out of more than 30 million currently infected people worldwide .
scientists have previously seen a very small number of cases where the virus does not replicate inside the host and therefore does not cause aids .
however , these so-called " non-progressives , " represent an extremely small percentage of known hiv patients around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 30 million people worldwide are infected with hiv an " intriguing " step , aids researchers say in the wake of the new german paper , aids and hiv researchers around the world are starting to take stock of this important finding .
" it 's intriguing that this patient does not have a rebound of the hiv replication , " said jens lundgren , an aids researcher and professor at the university of copenhagen , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they have certainly proven the case that there is no apparent residual infection in this person , and the hiv had multiple opportunities to replicate . "
another german aids researcher , dr. jan van lunzen , of the university hospital eppendorf in hamburg , agreed with this assessment .
" it seems that so far , this patient is one that we could call cured from hiv , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle . " this is the only known case , so far . "
but lundgren cautioned that researchers can not claim that they have cured aids or hiv as this was only one , very particular case .
" we can not really make statements on cure rates based on a single patient , " the researcher , who was not part of the study , added .
" this has to be looked at much more comprehensively , and this raises the issue of who wants to undergo a stem cell transplantation ?
this is not a procedure that you want to do on a whim , if you 're otherwise healthy . "
huetter and his colleagues , however , say that the ccr5 technique has a good chance of becoming a new method for treating , or perhaps even curing hiv in the future .
" probably in five , 10 or 20 years there will be techniques and procedures which can knock down ccr5 in a more complete way and will substitute this current medication of antiretroviral therapy , " he said .

italy 's interior minister defended the conduct of the police after the riots in rome 's historic center shocked italy .
scores of cars were set alight , shop windows were smashed and around 100 people were injured in clashes between demonstrators and police . authorities said 26 people were arrested and charged .
the violence erupted close to parliament buildings where a key confidence vote on prime minister silvio berlusconi was being held .
the government eventually won by just 3 votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi survived the no-confidence vote by 3 votes " what happened yesterday was not an expression of freedom .
it was an attack by organized groups of hooligans , " berlusconi said on wednesday .
for interior minister roberto maroni , police in rome showed restraint in dealing with the violence .
" i can say that in the end things went well , " maroni told the corriere della sera newspaper .
" someone could have been killed . "
maroni blamed the riots on leftist extremists who had infiltrated a student march .
critics said that by keeping the demonstrators away from the parliament buildings , police had allowed the demonstrators to rampage in other parts of the city .
damage to rome 's historic center the riots were concentrated around the main via del corso and the central piazza del popolo and piazza venezia that are normally filled with tourists .
the streets were left scattered with debris , including burnt-out cars , melted bicycles and broken shop glass .
more than 90 people were hurt , and 60 taken to hospital after the clashes .
a number of police officers were among those who were injured .
the demonstration had begun as a peaceful march by students angry that prime minister silvio berlusconi had narrowly survived the confidence vote earlier in the day .
opposition members accused the leader of having bought votes and blackmailed potential dissenters in order to stay in power .
however , the peaceful march was hijacked by a small core of violent protesters .
members of a violent group known as the black bloc took over , throwing cobblestones , bottles and metal poles at police .
they also set fire to a number of vehicles .
costly repairs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has faced days of protests shopkeepers have begun assessing the damage .
instead of welcoming christmas shoppers , luca spieza spent wednesday sifting through a pile of mangled glasses that were on display in the window of his optician 's shop .
he described what happened when the black bloc arrived : " my car was burning in front of my shop , " speiza told deutsche welle .
" on the right side , police , on the left , young people and in front there was a fire . "
speiza 's own car was set on fire and he and his elderly father were trapped in his smoke-filled shop for almost half an hour .
he estimated the damage to his merchandise , car and shop to total around 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 27,000 -rrb- .
rome 's mayor gianni alemanno said the clashes were " shocking " and likened them to the " gratuitous violence that was on the streets of rome in the 1970s and that i hoped never to see again . "
alemanno estimated the damage at 20 million euros .
parliament blocked off one place where protesters did not make their mark was the area around italy 's parliament .
dozens of police vans and hundreds of officers blocked off the zone to anyone except politicians and reporters .
center-left politician niki vendola sees cordoned-off area as a metaphor for how out-of-touch the current government is .
" barricading the parliamentary palace brings to mind medieval times , when the sovereigns were separate and untouchable , " vendola told deutsche welle .
" this shows how italy is living a modern version of medieval times . "
two influential italian newspapers , la repubblica and corriere della sera said that early elections were the likely outcome of the current political unrest in italy .
the current berlusconi government took power in 2008 with a mandate set to run until 2013 .

greek public sector workers are on a 24-hour strike to protest against government austerity measures . a public sector strike in greece was marred by violence on wednesday with angry protesters throwing rocks , bottles and firebombs at riot police who retaliated with tear gas .
the clashes occurred near the country 's finance ministry , where demonstrators had hurled a fire bomb into the second floor of the building setting part of it on fire . the protests were part of a 24-hour public sector strike directed against a series of austerity measures .
the cuts are being implemented by the greek government to rein in the spending as part of a bailout for the debt-stricken country , financed by the european union and the international monetary fund . many public sector workers would see their salaries cut and pension benefits reduced if the full force of the budget measures is implemented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strikes caused traffic backups in athens the strike has severely impacted transportation networks .
flights in and out of the country have been grounded , ships remain anchored in greek harbors , and train lines are not running .
public transportation strikes in athens throughout the week have also led to heavy traffic problems . in addition , hospitals are running on skeleton crews , schools are closed and bank workers have not been on the job since tuesday .
year of strikes wednesday 's strikes are n't the first to take place in greece against the government 's budget reduction plans .
widespread strikes have taken place throughout the year as greece 's debt situation has continued to worsen .
despite public opposition to the budget cuts , there is little reason to believe the greek government will be deterred in their resolve to pass the austerity measures .
the socialist government of prime minister george papandreou has a majority in parliament , and the reforms are tied to the 110-billion-euro -lrb- $ 147 billion -rrb- bailout from the eu and the imf .
eu summit greece is n't the only european nation to have protests against government austerity measures on wednesday - public sector workers in spain , belgium and other countries are set to rally as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou is not likely to change his government 's plans " european trade unions ask the governments to stop attacking wages and welfare , to act together , to stop racing from one crisis to the next , to stop destroying our social europe , " said john monks , general secretary of the european trade union confederation ahead of the protests .
the strikes and protests come ahead of a summit of eu leaders in brussels on thursday and friday to discuss expanding the eurozone 's financial rescue fund for possible future cases of extreme debt similar to that experienced by greece .
so far , ireland has been the only nation to access the fund , but speculation that spain and portugal will soon follow has raised the question whether the 750-billion-euro bailout fund will be sufficient .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de medicine -pipe- 15.12.2010 berlin man still cured of hiv after three years , researchers say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dr. gero huetter is one of the co-authors of the paper three years after receiving a stem cell transplant , one man no longer has hiv .
however , scientists caution that this procedure can only be replicated in certain circumstances and merits further study . in a new study , german researchers have confirmed that an american man living in berlin was successfully cured of his hiv infection after having received a blood stem cell transplant in 2007 .
" in conclusion , our results strongly suggest that cure of hiv has been achieved in this patient , " the researchers write in the abstract to their paper , which was published last week in blood , a medical journal .
the new paper is a follow-up study by the same german team to one they had published in the new england journal of medicine in february 2009 .
that study found " the patient remained without viral rebound 20 months after transplantation and discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy . "
" we were n't able to find hiv in his cells , " said dr. gero huetter , a hematologist and professor at the university of heidelberg , and a co-author of the new paper , in an interview with deutsche welle . " the new cells have a natural resistance against hiv . "
three years ago , timothy ray brown had been an hiv-positive leukemia patient .
prior to receiving the stem cell transplant , he underwent intense chemotherapy to completely replace his immune system .
however , the new stem cells that he received had a rare genetic mutation - found naturally in just one percent of caucasians in northern and western europe - that causes certain cells to lack a particular receptor , known as the ccr5 receptor , which hiv binds to .
at the time huetter specifically was looking for bone marrow stem cell donors that contained the rare ccr5 deletion .
since his treatment , the so-called " berlin patient " has been effectively cured of aids and its disease-causing virus , hiv , but also leukemia .
this likely makes him the first , and so far , only person ever to have been cured of hiv , out of more than 30 million currently infected people worldwide .
scientists have previously seen a very small number of cases where the virus does not replicate inside the host and therefore does not cause aids .
however , these so-called " non-progressives , " represent an extremely small percentage of known hiv patients around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 30 million people worldwide are infected with hiv an " intriguing " step , aids researchers say in the wake of the new german paper , aids and hiv researchers around the world are starting to take stock of this important finding .
" it 's intriguing that this patient does not have a rebound of the hiv replication , " said jens lundgren , an aids researcher and professor at the university of copenhagen , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" they have certainly proven the case that there is no apparent residual infection in this person , and the hiv had multiple opportunities to replicate . "
another german aids researcher , dr. jan van lunzen , of the university hospital eppendorf in hamburg , agreed with this assessment .
" it seems that so far , this patient is one that we could call cured from hiv , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle . " this is the only known case , so far . "
but lundgren cautioned that researchers can not claim that they have cured aids or hiv as this was only one , very particular case .
" we can not really make statements on cure rates based on a single patient , " the researcher , who was not part of the study , added .
" this has to be looked at much more comprehensively , and this raises the issue of who wants to undergo a stem cell transplantation ?
this is not a procedure that you want to do on a whim , if you 're otherwise healthy . "
huetter and his colleagues , however , say that the ccr5 technique has a good chance of becoming a new method for treating , or perhaps even curing hiv in the future .
" probably in five , 10 or 20 years there will be techniques and procedures which can knock down ccr5 in a more complete way and will substitute this current medication of antiretroviral therapy , " he said .

they arrested around 1,000 young people at the kievsky railway station , where a big clash was reportedly being planned and organized over the internet .
many of the youths chanted far-right slogans and raised their right arms in nazi-style salutes .
police say they confiscated many weapons .
the police closed a major shopping mall and the subway station at the site , and passers-by were said to be fleeing the area .
the kievsky station is a popular location for traders from the caucasus to sell their wares .
the planned riot followed unrest last saturday , in which some 5,000 football fans and members of far-right groups rioted outside the kremlin . they were protesting police handling of the killing of the 28-year-old spartak moscow fan yegor sviridov the previous week .
widespread resentment of immigrants gangs of muslims were reported to be planning a counter-rally at the kievsky station , and russian nationalists were said to be preparing to clash with them .
according to reports , in spite of the police action , small groups fought with each other , using iron bars and baseball bats .
similar events were reported from other cities , such as saint petersburg and samara .
the unrest marks a new stage in the resentment of immigration to russia 's big cities from the southern republics and central asia .
every year dozens of immigrant workers , who are accused of taking jobs from local people at low rates of pay , are murdered .
the moscow city administration has been under pressure to limit the number of migrants and to give their jobs to ethnic russians .

ecologists still hope they will be able to overturn the decision . moscow has approved a plan to build a highway through a forest outside the capital , in defiance of protests that had become a rallying cause for the opposition . demonstrations against the construction of a highway between moscow and st. petersburg had prompted president dmitry medvedev to postpone the project , in what many observers saw as a nod by the state to popular pressure . but deputy prime minister sergei ivanov said the government commission tasked with investigating the project had given its green light to the plan .
transport minister igor levitin said the road would be built by the end of 2013 , according to russian news agencies . the commission approved building the highway after " taking into account all the factors - transport , economic , social and legal , " ivanov , who headed the panel , said in comments broadcast on state television . " we believe that from the judicial point of view the proposed route is completely legal , " he said . environmental compensation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposing the government can be dangerous in russia ivanov added that four billion rubles -lrb- $ 130 million , 98 million euros -rrb- would be paid as compensation for the ecological damage to the khimki forest and that some 500 hectares -lrb- 1,200 acres -rrb- of new forest would be planted to replace the 100 destroyed . but ecologists continue to decry the project for destroying the area of mixed woods and marshes that play an important part in a sensitive forest , which is a haven for wildlife in the heavily built-up moscow region . " this is a birds ' paradise , " yevgenia chirikova , who for months has organized protests against the highway 's construction , told deutsche welle .
" there is a protected marsh area where we can find moose and wild boar .
even though one can drive from here to the kremlin in 25 minutes , we do have really wild places here . " while chirikova admitted a new highway connecting russia two largest cities is necessary , she added that despite presidential promises , the public had been left out of discussions on how work should proceed in the woods where peter the great 's father once hunted . " medvedev promised us public discussions : there were none .
he promised to listen to public experts : let 's hear them ! " she said . risks of opposition protests against the highway grew in magnitude over summer , culminating in a rare thousands-strong rally in central moscow in august led by veteran russian rocker and kremlin critic yury shevchuk . environmental activism remains a risky undertaking in russia .
police have broken up protests against the highway and journalists accusing the government of corruption in connection with the road 's construction have come under attack . mikhail beketov , the editor-in-chief of the local newspaper khimkinskaya pravda , was beaten by unknown assailants in 2008 so severely that he is now partially paralyzed , suffers from brain damage , has difficulty speaking and lost four fingers and part of his leg .
the attack came shortly after beketov had published an article in which he accused local officials of corruption . oleg kashin , a journalist for the kommersant daily , covered the issue and was beaten in an attack in november that was condemned around the world .
activist konstantin fetisov was also badly injured in an attack with a baseball bat in the same month and remains in a coma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beketov is partially paralyzed after being beaten over two years ago bigger than a highway the government 's response to the protests shows that the highway issue has expanded beyond an environmental concern , chirikova said . " the khimki forest is no longer just an environmental problem , " she said .
" there is an environmental side to it .
but this is a problem of corruption . " chirikova , who has been arrested a number of times for her work , said she felt threatened and worried for her two children and husband , who had his ribs broken in an attack . however , she added that she remained convinced that cutting down the forest 's trees was illegal , bad for her town and her country .
according to an opinion poll , three quarters of russians agree with her . " if we do n't fight and stand up for our rights , and keep silent about such crimes against beketov and fetisov , then this will lead us straight back to stalin 's gulag , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de greece -pipe- 15.12.2010 strikes in greece turn violent as protesters clash with riot police großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters hurled petrol bombs at riot police demonstrations in greece have turned violent , with protesters clashing with riot police in the capital , athens .
greek public sector workers are on a 24-hour strike to protest against government austerity measures . a public sector strike in greece was marred by violence on wednesday with angry protesters throwing rocks , bottles and firebombs at riot police who retaliated with tear gas .
the clashes occurred near the country 's finance ministry , where demonstrators had hurled a fire bomb into the second floor of the building setting part of it on fire . the protests were part of a 24-hour public sector strike directed against a series of austerity measures .
the cuts are being implemented by the greek government to rein in the spending as part of a bailout for the debt-stricken country , financed by the european union and the international monetary fund . many public sector workers would see their salaries cut and pension benefits reduced if the full force of the budget measures is implemented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strikes caused traffic backups in athens the strike has severely impacted transportation networks .
flights in and out of the country have been grounded , ships remain anchored in greek harbors , and train lines are not running .
public transportation strikes in athens throughout the week have also led to heavy traffic problems . in addition , hospitals are running on skeleton crews , schools are closed and bank workers have not been on the job since tuesday .
year of strikes wednesday 's strikes are n't the first to take place in greece against the government 's budget reduction plans .
widespread strikes have taken place throughout the year as greece 's debt situation has continued to worsen .
despite public opposition to the budget cuts , there is little reason to believe the greek government will be deterred in their resolve to pass the austerity measures .
the socialist government of prime minister george papandreou has a majority in parliament , and the reforms are tied to the 110-billion-euro -lrb- $ 147 billion -rrb- bailout from the eu and the imf .
eu summit greece is n't the only european nation to have protests against government austerity measures on wednesday - public sector workers in spain , belgium and other countries are set to rally as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou is not likely to change his government 's plans " european trade unions ask the governments to stop attacking wages and welfare , to act together , to stop racing from one crisis to the next , to stop destroying our social europe , " said john monks , general secretary of the european trade union confederation ahead of the protests .
the strikes and protests come ahead of a summit of eu leaders in brussels on thursday and friday to discuss expanding the eurozone 's financial rescue fund for possible future cases of extreme debt similar to that experienced by greece .

mikhail khodorkovsky is standing trial on charges of embezzling oil worth billions of dollars . a russian court has unexpectedly delayed the delivery of a verdict for imprisoned oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky - formerly russia 's richest man - who faces charges of stealing over 200 tons of oil from his own wells .
a court spokesperson did not give a reason for the delay , but said the verdict would now be handed down on december 27 .
lawyers for khodorkovsky said they had not been informed of the decision to delay the verdict .
since his incarceration , khodorkovsky has been russia 's highest-profile inmate .
the 47-year-old khodorkovsky has been an outspoken critic of the kremlin , and particularly of prime minister vladimir putin .
the former oil billionaire , who was a major shareholder in failed petroleum company yukos , is already serving an eight-year sentence for tax evasion , which is set to expire in 2011 .
if found guilty of the fresh charges , he faces an additional six years in prison .
if found innocent , his release could come just months ahead of the next russian presidential election .
khodorkovsky 's year-and-a-half trial has been the subject of intense international scrutiny , particularly from the united states and germany , which accuse the kremlin of staging a political show trial with no legal basis .
russia analysts have kept a close eye on the khodorkovsky case , which they say could be a major indicator of president dmitry medvedev 's progress in reforming the country 's judicial system .

merkel insisted that no european country would be left behind should it face similar dire financial straits .
" no one in europe will be left alone , no one in europe will be abandoned , " merkel said .
" europe succeeds when it acts together and , i would add , europe succeeds only when it acts together . "

greek public sector workers are on a 24-hour strike to protest against government austerity measures . a public sector strike in greece was marred by violence on wednesday with angry protesters throwing rocks , bottles and firebombs at riot police who retaliated with tear gas .
the clashes occurred near the country 's finance ministry , where demonstrators had hurled a fire bomb into the second floor of the building setting part of it on fire . the protests were part of a 24-hour public sector strike directed against a series of austerity measures .
the cuts are being implemented by the greek government to rein in the spending as part of a bailout for the debt-stricken country , financed by the european union and the international monetary fund . many public sector workers would see their salaries cut and pension benefits reduced if the full force of the budget measures is implemented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strikes caused traffic backups in athens the strike has severely impacted transportation networks .
flights in and out of the country have been grounded , ships remain anchored in greek harbors , and train lines are not running .
public transportation strikes in athens throughout the week have also led to heavy traffic problems . in addition , hospitals are running on skeleton crews , schools are closed and bank workers have not been on the job since tuesday .
year of strikes wednesday 's strikes are n't the first to take place in greece against the government 's budget reduction plans .
widespread strikes have taken place throughout the year as greece 's debt situation has continued to worsen .
despite public opposition to the budget cuts , there is little reason to believe the greek government will be deterred in their resolve to pass the austerity measures .
the socialist government of prime minister george papandreou has a majority in parliament , and the reforms are tied to the 110-billion-euro -lrb- $ 147 billion -rrb- bailout from the eu and the imf .
eu summit greece is n't the only european nation to have protests against government austerity measures on wednesday - public sector workers in spain , belgium and other countries are set to rally as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou is not likely to change his government 's plans " european trade unions ask the governments to stop attacking wages and welfare , to act together , to stop racing from one crisis to the next , to stop destroying our social europe , " said john monks , general secretary of the european trade union confederation ahead of the protests .
the strikes and protests come ahead of a summit of eu leaders in brussels on thursday and friday to discuss expanding the eurozone 's financial rescue fund for possible future cases of extreme debt similar to that experienced by greece .
so far , ireland has been the only nation to access the fund , but speculation that spain and portugal will soon follow has raised the question whether the 750-billion-euro bailout fund will be sufficient .

as a result , the last draft will be on january 3 , 2011 . the german government on wednesday approved the plans of its defense minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , to reduce the size of the german military , the bundeswehr , by 65,000 soldiers to 185,000 . included in the reform are plans to suspend conscription from july 1 next year .
this means that the last young men will receive their draft notices on january 3 , ending a practice which goes back to 1957 and the start of german rearmament after world war ii .
the government has decided only to suspend the draft and not to abolish it .
abolition would require a change to the constitution , and the provision will remain in case a general call-up becomes necessary in a time of crisis .
the new armed forces will include 170,000 professional soldiers and 15,000 volunteers , who will serve for up to 23 months . guttenberg argues that a smaller bundeswehr will be more effective in dealing with modern military challenges .
a smaller military is still too expensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense minister has pushed for an end to conscription the plans are being made at a time when the military is under financial pressure . finance minister wolfgang schaeuble wants the defense ministry to save 8.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.2 billion -rrb- by 2014 .
the defense minister says he ca n't meet that target without reducing size of the military to 160,000 .
the suspension of conscription is expected to lead to an increase in the number of young people wanting to go to university .
the german states , which are responsible for financing education , say they are not prepared to pay the additional cost .
the chairman of the conference of state premiers , wolfgang boehmer , said that , if the central government created the financial burden , it should be prepared to discuss paying for it .
the suspension is also expected to lead to extra costs for social service providers , who have so far benefitted from the civilian service alternative to the draft . the cabinet also agreed on a new program of voluntary civil service , but the minister for families , kristina schroeder , has already said that it will not fill the gap completely .

but does doping make for better art ? from poetry to pop music , the question has been asked repeatedly over the years : can mind-altering substances enhance an artist 's performance ? an exhibition currently taking place at london 's wellcome institute examines the huge influence dope has had on the arts - and artists of all kinds - across the ages . " there is a huge range not only of substances , but also across different periods of time , " curator emily sergeant said , while pointing to bamboo opium pipe , a plastic ashtray from the 1970s and some fly agaric mushrooms , which she said are illegal in the uk . spiders on caffeine a particularly compelling part of the exhibition , however , is not directly related to artist - but to spiders . bildunterschrift : the webs may not be functional for catching flies , but they could be considered art -lrb- left to right : benzedrine , caffeine , marijuana -rrb- three graphics are taken from a series of experiments carried out by nasa on arachnids given doses of the amphetamine benzedrine , caffeine and marijuana .
their web-making ability was then assessed and the results are curious : the spider on caffeine created the most unconventional web . in the other two cases the usual web structure was visible at the beginning of the process .
but the caffeine-fuelled spider was noticeably less systematic and its web had large gaps and no circular center , making it essentially non-functional . the survival of the artist , however , is admittedly less dependent on the functionality of his product and more on its aesthetic appeal .
during the 19th century , a large number of writers , artists and scientists experimented with mind-altering substances - many of them legal at the time - to find out what kind of experience they could have . " we have an example from france and the club des hashischins , a group of artists and writers who met under the guidance of a scientist , jacques moreau , and were administered a quantity of hashish and these experiences are recorded , " explained sergeant .
" moreau was interested in the effects of this substance on the genius : what would happen to an already extraordinary mind if it were altered in some way ? " first opium confession thomas de quincy may have been a genius , but his autobiographical " confessions of an english opium eater " from 1821 certainly influenced many creative minds , including composer hector berlioz , whose " symphonie fantastique " was inspired by it . " this was really the beginning of the modern european drug culture in many ways .
this was the first time that someone had written about their life in terms of their drug-taking and talked about what it was like to be an opium addict , " said mike jay , the exhibition 's co-curator and author of the accompanying book . bildunterschrift : this 1823 painting , " doctor and mrs syntax , " satirizes the trend of hosting nitrous oxide parties . these days , it 's practically a rite of passage for musicians to get arrested for possession of illegal drugs , but two centuries ago , composers were using drugs for a different reason : to enhance their ability to dream up new sounds , combinations of chords and assembling huge orchestras . " if you look at -lsb- french romantic composer hector -rsb- berlioz at the time , he was taking opium and writing about an opium dream , but actually he was in a very over-stimulated visionary state for about a year , hardly sleeping at all , " jay said .
" he was probably taking the opium to calm down .
so sometimes when we see creative people writing about drugs and taking drugs , the relationship is n't as it appears . " ' no nirvana of inspiration ' the exhibition is careful to avoid taking a position on drug use .
according to sergeant , there is a connection between drugs and art , but it is unclear whether drugs improve on talent . " it does n't seem from the material that we 've looked at that it is the answer to anything , " she said .
" there is no nirvana of inspiration that any one drug has unlocked .
but they have played this very important role in the lives of artists , writers and scientists throughout history .

italy 's interior minister defended the conduct of the police after the riots in rome 's historic center shocked italy .
scores of cars were set alight , shop windows were smashed and around 100 people were injured in clashes between demonstrators and police . authorities said 26 people were arrested and charged .
the violence erupted close to parliament buildings where a key confidence vote on prime minister silvio berlusconi was being held .
the government eventually won by just 3 votes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi has faced days of protests " what happened yesterday was not an expression of freedom .
it was an attack by organized groups of hooligans , " berlusconi said on wednesday .
for interior minister roberto maroni , police in rome showed restraint in dealing with the violence .
" i can say that in the end things went well , " maroni told the corriere della sera newspaper .
" someone could have been killed . "
maroni blamed the riots on leftist extremists who had infiltrated a student march .
critics said that by keeping the demonstrators away from the parliament buildings , police had allowed the demonstrators to rampage in other parts of the city .
damage to rome 's historic center the riots were concentrated around the main via del corso and the central piazza del popolo and piazza venezia that are normally filled with tourists .
the streets were left scattered with debris , including burnt-out cars , melted bicycles and broken shop glass .
more than 90 people were hurt , and 60 taken to hospital after the clashes .
a number of police officers were among those who were injured .
the demonstration had begun as a peaceful march by students angry that prime minister silvio berlusconi had narrowly survived the confidence vote earlier in the day .
opposition members accused the leader of having bought votes and blackmailed potential dissenters in order to stay in power .
however , the peaceful march was hijacked by a small core of violent protesters .
members of a violent group known as the black bloc took over , throwing cobblestones , bottles and metal poles at police .
they also set fire to a number of vehicles .
costly repairs # b # shopkeepers have begun assessing the damage .
instead of welcoming christmas shoppers , luca spieza spent wednesday sifting through a pile of mangled glasses that were on display in the window of his optician 's shop .
he described what happened when the black bloc arrived : " my car was burning in front of my shop , " speiza told deutsche welle .
" on the right side , police , on the left , young people and in front there was a fire . "
speiza 's own car was set on fire and he and his elderly father were trapped in his smoke-filled shop for almost half an hour .
he estimated the damage to his merchandise , car and shop to total around 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 27,000 -rrb- .
rome 's mayor gianni alemanno said the clashes were " shocking " and likened them to the " gratuitous violence that was on the streets of rome in the 1970s and that i hoped never to see again . "
alemanno estimated the damage at 20 million euros .
parliament blocked off one place where protesters did not make their mark was the area around italy 's parliament .
dozens of police vans and hundreds of officers blocked off the zone to anyone except politicians and reporters .
center-left politician niki vendola sees cordoned-off area as a metaphor for how out-of-touch the current government is .
" barricading the parliamentary palace brings to mind medieval times , when the sovereigns were separate and untouchable , " vendola told deutsche welle .
" this shows how italy is living a modern version of medieval times . "
two influential italian newspapers , la repubblica and corriere della sera said that early elections were the likely outcome of the current political unrest in italy .
the current berlusconi government took power in 2008 with a mandate set to run until 2013 .

in 1991 , the pro-democracy activist received the nobel peace prize .
the 65-year old has spent 15 of the last 21 years in detention .
deutsche welle : what is your daily routine these days ?
aung san suu kyi : my daily routine is very , very hectic .
if i look back at today , i had about two , three appointments this morning and two in the afternoon , and i still have n't finished my work yet .
so , it is extremely hectic .
what kind of appointments are these ?
i am meeting diplomats , i am meeting political parties , i am meeting individuals , we have our national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- office meetings .
then i am speaking to people on the phone .
and there are individual journalists and correspondents , who have managed to come to burma , and i have to meet them as well .
what was the biggest change you noticed in your city after your house arrest was lifted ?
i think the number of hand phones !
the moment i was released , i saw all those people with their hand phones which they were using to take photographs .
i think what it means is that there is an improvement in communications .
and what about the burmese society ?
did you find any other changes ?
prices have gone up sky-high , and people are very concerned about it .
everybody talks about the rise in prices .
also , the attitude of the young people has improved considerably .
they want to be involved in the political process , and they are much more outgoing and proactive than they were seven years ago .
when you were released , it was striking that many young people turned up to greet you .
what are your expectations from the youth of burma ?
it is for them to understand that it is up to them to bring change to our country , and that they should not depend on me or the nld or anybody else .
we will do our best , but in the end i want them to have this self-confidence to believe that they can do it for themselves .
how do you see the future of your party , the national league for democracy ?
we are going to stand as a political force because we have the full support of the people .
of course , the authorities are trying to deregister our party , and i am contesting that at court , but that is a legal matter .
the real political truth of the situation is that we have the confidence , the trust and the support of the people , and that will keep us going as the most important opposition force in burma today .
have you tried to get in touch with the government after your release ?
no , not yet .
i have , of course , been sending indirect messages through almost every speech i have made , every interview i have had , that i would like to have dialogue .
i think we should discuss our differences and come to an agreement that we should be prepared to compromise on both sides .
but why have n't you taken any concrete step to initiate this kind of a dialogue ?
we are waiting for the right time , which i hope is not too far off .
burma is a country with many ethnic minorities , whose relationship with the majority has been rather tense over the recent decades .
what do you plan to do to reach out to these groups ?
we have been reaching out to these groups for a number of years , and i can claim that we have had a certain amount of success .
not only do we have very strong allies among the parties which contested the 1990 elections , we also have the support of other ethnic groups , including the ceasefire groups along the frontiers , who have expressed an interest in what we are trying to do - to revive the spirit of true union .
last week , the nobel peace prize for the chinese democracy activist liu xiaobo turned into a major international controversy .
what is your reaction , being a nobel laureate yourself ?
i have a great respect for the norwegian nobel committee , and i believe they must have sound reasons for choosing to give him the award this year .
i personally do n't know much about liu xiabo because i have been under house arrest for about seven years , and all i know about him is that what i heard on the radio .
but i do believe that the nobel committee must have sound reasons for selecting him .
in europe , people are wondering what they can do to support burma .
what is your advice ?
first of all , it would be very helpful if all the countries of europe could speak with one voice .
even within the european union there are different attitudes and different voices , and i think that weakens the -lsb- burmese -rsb- opposition .
it would help us a great deal if all european countries called for certain steps to be taken in burma - the release of political prisoners , inclusiveness of the political process , specifically with the nld , and negotiations .
do you have any specific european countries in mind , which you want to see more active in this ?
as i am talking to you in germany - i would like germany to be more active .
you said in previous interviews that you will need time to form an opinion about international sanctions against the burmese regime .
what is your impression so far on this matter ?
so far , i have not got the impression that economic sanctions have really hurt the public , but of course there are other voices that are perhaps still waiting to be heard , so we have yet to find out .
i have been released just for over a month , and i have n't had time to go into this issue ; i am waiting to read the latest report of the imf , and perhaps the adb and other economic institutions .
how influential is the west in burma ?
compared with that , how do you see india 's and china 's role ?
i think the role of the west in burma and the role of india and china are quite different .
i would not like to think of them as competing for influence , or competing for ascendancy over burma .
it is not as though we were not able to shape our own destiny .
but certainly , because india and china are very close neighbors , they have a certain advantage over those countries that are situated very far away .
does this mean that what the west does with regard to burma is not so important ?
no , it has its importance , depending on how and what actions the west is taking , which is why i said earlier that it would be good if all the western nations could coordinate their efforts .
not just the western nations , it would be good if the whole international community , including the united nations , coordinated its efforts .
that would help us very greatly indeed , and if it called for the same basic steps , that would mean progress .
what are your expectations from india and china ?
we would like them to engage with us .
to begin with , we 'd very much like india and china to give us the opportunity to explain our point of view to them .
we have very little contact with china and india .
we have more contact with the indian government than with the chinese government , in fact i do n't think we have any contact with the chinese government at all .
we would like to have contact with them , we would like them to listen to our side of the story , and make them understand that we look upon them as neighbors , and that we would like to be friends with them .
we are not hostile to them even if we are working for democracy in burma .
what are your plans for the coming weeks ?
the man that i fear most in the world is the man who keeps my appointment book .
i have n't gone through next week 's appointments with him ...

greek public sector workers are on a 24-hour strike to protest against government austerity measures . a public sector strike in greece was marred by violence on wednesday with angry protesters throwing rocks , bottles and firebombs at riot police who retaliated with tear gas .
the clashes occurred near the country 's finance ministry , where demonstrators had hurled a fire bomb into the second floor of the building setting part of it on fire . the protests were part of a 24-hour public sector strike directed against a series of austerity measures .
the cuts are being implemented by the greek government to rein in the spending as part of a bailout for the debt-stricken country , financed by the european union and the international monetary fund . many public sector workers would see their salaries cut and pension benefits reduced if the full force of the budget measures is implemented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strikes caused traffic backups in athens the strike has severely impacted transportation networks .
flights in and out of the country have been grounded , ships remain anchored in greek harbors , and train lines are not running .
public transportation strikes in athens throughout the week have also led to heavy traffic problems . in addition , hospitals are running on skeleton crews , schools are closed and bank workers have not been on the job since tuesday .
year of strikes wednesday 's strikes are n't the first to take place in greece against the government 's budget reduction plans .
widespread strikes have taken place throughout the year as greece 's debt situation has continued to worsen .
despite public opposition to the budget cuts , there is little reason to believe the greek government will be deterred in their resolve to pass the austerity measures .
the socialist government of prime minister george papandreou has a majority in parliament , and the reforms are tied to the 110-billion-euro -lrb- $ 147 billion -rrb- bailout from the eu and the imf .
eu summit greece is n't the only european nation to have protests against government austerity measures on wednesday - public sector workers in spain , belgium and other countries are set to rally as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou is not likely to change his government 's plans " european trade unions ask the governments to stop attacking wages and welfare , to act together , to stop racing from one crisis to the next , to stop destroying our social europe , " said john monks , general secretary of the european trade union confederation ahead of the protests .
the strikes and protests come ahead of a summit of eu leaders in brussels on thursday and friday to discuss expanding the eurozone 's financial rescue fund for possible future cases of extreme debt similar to that experienced by greece .
so far , ireland has been the only nation to access the fund , but speculation that spain and portugal will soon follow has raised the question whether the 750-billion-euro bailout fund will be sufficient .

some 300 serbian journalists , broadcast technicians , and media managers have participated in workshops since then . ten years of media development in serbia – a good reason for dw-akademie and former participants to take stock of the work achieved so far and to look ahead .
at the end of november the europe and central asia division invited alumni to a conference in belgrade .
the goal was to combine an informal get-together with a one-day workshop involving groups and discussions on dw-akademie ’ s performance .
“ what are we doing well and what can we do better ? ” were the central questions posed to twenty serbian journalists from all regions in the country .
the alumni gave top praise to dw-akademie ’ s advanced training in areas such as interview training , environmental reporting and online journalism .
additional plus points were given for discussions with german experts and networking with other participants .
starting in 2011 , a new , regional dw-akademie blog will support this exchange online .
the alumni also had suggestions for future projects .
one participant proposed the joint construction of an exchange platform for radio and television reports .
others hoped for more involvement of upper management in the projects to help overcome management ’ s reluctance to work with new ideas .
participants mentioned other barriers making it difficult to implement what they had learned including a lack of finances and time , as well as political pressure .
“ we really appreciate the feedback and now have new ideas which we ’ ll include in our upcoming projects , ” says filip slavkovic who coordinates dw-akademie projects in southeastern europe .
further workshops together with the osce media department are planned for serbia starting at the beginning of 2011 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

greek public sector workers are on a 24-hour strike to protest against government austerity measures . a public sector strike in greece was marred by violence on wednesday with angry protesters throwing rocks , bottles and firebombs at riot police who retaliated with tear gas .
the clashes occurred near the country 's finance ministry , where demonstrators had hurled a fire bomb into the second floor of the building setting part of it on fire . the protests were part of a 24-hour public sector strike directed against a series of austerity measures .
the cuts are being implemented by the greek government to rein in the spending as part of a bailout for the debt-stricken country , financed by the european union and the international monetary fund . many public sector workers would see their salaries cut and pension benefits reduced if the full force of the budget measures is implemented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strikes caused traffic backups in athens the strike has severely impacted transportation networks .
flights in and out of the country have been grounded , ships remain anchored in greek harbors , and train lines are not running .
public transportation strikes in athens throughout the week have also led to heavy traffic problems . in addition , hospitals are running on skeleton crews , schools are closed and bank workers have not been on the job since tuesday .
year of strikes wednesday 's strikes are n't the first to take place in greece against the government 's budget reduction plans .
widespread strikes have taken place throughout the year as greece 's debt situation has continued to worsen .
despite public opposition to the budget cuts , there is little reason to believe the greek government will be deterred in their resolve to pass the austerity measures .
the socialist government of prime minister george papandreou has a majority in parliament , and the reforms are tied to the 110-billion-euro -lrb- $ 147 billion -rrb- bailout from the eu and the imf .
eu summit greece is n't the only european nation to have protests against government austerity measures on wednesday - public sector workers in spain , belgium and other countries are set to rally as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou is not likely to change his government 's plans " european trade unions ask the governments to stop attacking wages and welfare , to act together , to stop racing from one crisis to the next , to stop destroying our social europe , " said john monks , general secretary of the european trade union confederation ahead of the protests .
the strikes and protests come ahead of a summit of eu leaders in brussels on thursday and friday to discuss expanding the eurozone 's financial rescue fund for possible future cases of extreme debt similar to that experienced by greece .
so far , ireland has been the only nation to access the fund , but speculation that spain and portugal will soon follow has raised the question whether the 750-billion-euro bailout fund will be sufficient .

as a result , the last draft will be on january 3 , 2011 . the german government on wednesday approved the plans of its defense minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg , to reduce the size of the german military , the bundeswehr , by 65,000 soldiers to 185,000 . included in the reform are plans to suspend conscription from july 1 next year .
this means that the last young men will receive their draft notices on january 3 , ending a practice which goes back to 1957 and the start of german rearmament after world war ii .
the government has decided only to suspend the draft and not to abolish it .
abolition would require a change to the constitution , and the provision will remain in case a general call-up becomes necessary in a time of crisis .
the new armed forces will include 170,000 professional soldiers and 15,000 volunteers , who will serve for up to 23 months . guttenberg argues that a smaller bundeswehr will be more effective in dealing with modern military challenges .
a smaller military is still too expensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense minister has pushed for an end to conscription the plans are being made at a time when the military is under financial pressure . finance minister wolfgang schaeuble wants the defense ministry to save 8.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 11.2 billion -rrb- by 2014 .
the defense minister says he ca n't meet that target without reducing size of the military to 160,000 .
the suspension of conscription is expected to lead to an increase in the number of young people wanting to go to university .
the german states , which are responsible for financing education , say they are not prepared to pay the additional cost .
the chairman of the conference of state premiers , wolfgang boehmer , said that , if the central government created the financial burden , it should be prepared to discuss paying for it .
the suspension is also expected to lead to extra costs for social service providers , who have so far benefitted from the civilian service alternative to the draft . the cabinet also agreed on a new program of voluntary civil service , but the minister for families , kristina schroeder , has already said that it will not fill the gap completely .

vienna is the birthplace of modern diplomacy .
the vienna convention on diplomatic relations underwrites the entire framework of modern international relations .

they 're privileged , that is , not subject to the same rules as you and i , and they are - or were - the keepers of state secrets .

" a transfer to north korea here , a deal with iran there and while we 're at it , let 's overlook the russian mafia boss who wants to launder his ukrainian gas company at an austrian bank .
what george w bush called the " axis of evil " was just another country or three for austrian companies and their bankers . what we have learnt is that the banks did do business with unsavory characters in eastern europe and that the americans called austrian politicians in for a few drinks and a bit of a chat - all according to vienna convention rules and the expectation of confidentiality .
they also hauled the bankers over the coals and as a result , the banks cut their ties to the appalling people they were doing business with . this brings us to the most revealing part of the wikileaks cables .
us diplomats see " austria 's engagement with the world slipping and narrowing . "
its chancellor werner faymann , a social democrat , is " not interested in foreign relations . "
austria , conclude the americans , is using its neutrality and pacifism as cover for business-led offensives .

it does do deals with dubious regimes and it does n't want to send its soldiers off to fight america 's or anyone else 's wars .

they 're privileged , that is , not subject to the same rules as you and i , and they are - or were - the keepers of state secrets .
oh , how a week of wikileaks can change the world ! and what better barricade from which to observe this revolution than the banks of the danube , the hofburg palace and the other landmarks where modern diplomacy decided its own game plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's kerry skyring says austrians are n't surprised the first leaks allowed us a look into austrian banks and their behavior over the past decade .
us cables from american diplomats in vienna show alarm at how lightly these drivers of the austrian economy - the banks - stepped into the muddy waters of business with regimes which washington liked to call " rogue states . " a transfer to north korea here , a deal with iran there and while we 're at it , let 's overlook the russian mafia boss who wants to launder his ukrainian gas company at an austrian bank .
what george w bush called the " axis of evil " was just another country or three for austrian companies and their bankers . what we have learnt is that the banks did do business with unsavory characters in eastern europe and that the americans called austrian politicians in for a few drinks and a bit of a chat - all according to vienna convention rules and the expectation of confidentiality .
they also hauled the bankers over the coals and as a result , the banks cut their ties to the appalling people they were doing business with . this brings us to the most revealing part of the wikileaks cables .
us diplomats see " austria 's engagement with the world slipping and narrowing . "
its chancellor werner faymann , a social democrat , is " not interested in foreign relations . "
austria , conclude the americans , is using its neutrality and pacifism as cover for business-led offensives .
washington laments that when it comes to sending its soldiers abroad , austria is " risk averse " in the extreme . the fact is : the americans are right about vienna .
it does do deals with dubious regimes and it does n't want to send its soldiers off to fight america 's or anyone else 's wars .
wikileaks revelations have brought a little huffing and puffing from austrian politicians who feel personally slighted , but i think they actually welcome the leaks .
these once secret cables tell the voters , in lines crafted by gifted wordsmiths , that their elected lawmakers are just like them : not too enamored of the americans and not too concerned about the ethics of the persons with whom they are doing business . seen from the banks of the danube , the vienna convention , 50 years old next year , is looking weak and quite leaky . author : kerry skyring , vienna editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mikhail khodorkovsky is standing trial on charges of embezzling oil worth billions of dollars . a russian court has unexpectedly delayed the delivery of a verdict for imprisoned oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky - formerly russia 's richest man - who faces charges of stealing over 200 tons of oil from his own wells .
a court spokesperson did not give a reason for the delay , but said the verdict would now be handed down on december 27 .
lawyers for khodorkovsky said they had not been informed of the decision to delay the verdict .
since his incarceration , khodorkovsky has been russia 's highest-profile inmate .
the 47-year-old khodorkovsky has been an outspoken critic of the kremlin , and particularly of prime minister vladimir putin .
the former oil billionaire , who was a major shareholder in failed petroleum company yukos , is already serving an eight-year sentence for tax evasion , which is set to expire in 2011 .
if found guilty of the fresh charges , he faces an additional six years in prison .
if found innocent , his release could come just months ahead of the next russian presidential election .
khodorkovsky 's year-and-a-half trial has been the subject of intense international scrutiny , particularly from the united states and germany , which accuse the kremlin of staging a political show trial with no legal basis .
russia analysts have kept a close eye on the khodorkovsky case , which they say could be a major indicator of president dmitry medvedev 's progress in reforming the country 's judicial system .
