program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 31.01.2010 german film promoters are riding a new wave of popularity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the white ribbon ' is this year 's breakthrough german film can be grateful to florian henckel von donnersmarck .
his oscar-winning 2006 feature ' the lives of others ' - about east germany under the stasi secret police - marked an industry comeback . today , the goethe institute headquarters in munich is the transitional home to a surprisingly large collection of film trophies .
awards for best actress , best film score and best director are stacked up on a desk , having arrived from small film festivals from all over germany , and around the world .
when a winning director ca n't travel to a film festival in asia or the caribbean to collect their award , then an employee of the local goethe institute in that city steps in to pick it up on their behalf .
promoting german culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tragicomic ' good bye lenin ! ' opened doors christian lueffe is responsible for the coordination of the goethe institut 's german film program overseas ; they provide current films to about 40 cinemas around the world .
after they pick what movies are shown , the institute has to organize copies of the films and get distribution and clearance rights for showing abroad .
then the film has to be translated for dubbing or subtitles .
lueffe says people who come to the goethe institut 's films often view them as a way to learn more about german culture .
they 're not necessarily just for people who already have a deep understanding of the country .
the movies might even become an incentive for people to learn the language and visit germany .
" images , music , language - film is an ideal medium because the way it is assembled , you experience all of that at once , " said lueffe .
at least half the events hosted by the munich goethe-institute are film screenings , he says .
international presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' lives of others ' director von donnersmarck spearheaded a comeback the goethe institut is n't the only film-promotion group in munich ; there 's also an organization that is simply called german films .
it lobbies to get german films into festivals around the world .
german films has a different mandate than the goethe institut , which tries to use films as a way of increasing culture awareness .
the group 's goal is to distribute german film as widely as possible , and get new movies in festivals and out on the international market .
response has n't always been as good it is today .
for a while it seemed like german film was dropping low down on the international film-circuit radar .
but now german films are winning more and more accolades .
scooping up the prizes " das weisse band , " or " the white ribbon , " is a black and white film about children in a small german village just prior to world war i. it is the latest example of a german success story ; it won the palme d 'or in cannes , the european film award for best film , and the golden globe , also for best foreign film .
moreover , german-speaking actors have prominently appeared in international productions lately , including austrian-born christoph waltz , who recently won a golden globe - and is pegged to take home an oscar - for his role in quentin tarantino 's " inglorious basterds . "
mariette rissenbeek , from the festival and pr department of german films , said she thought the 2003 film " good bye , lenin ! " about a man who tries to recreate east germany after the fall of the wall , acted as an " international door-opener for german films . "
" foreign investors saw that german films do make money at the box office and they can be entertaining , " rissenbeek said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 31.01.2010 german film promoters are riding a new wave of popularity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the white ribbon ' is this year 's breakthrough german film can be grateful to florian henckel von donnersmarck .
his oscar-winning 2006 feature ' the lives of others ' - about east germany under the stasi secret police - marked an industry comeback . today , the goethe institute headquarters in munich is the transitional home to a surprisingly large collection of film trophies .
awards for best actress , best film score and best director are stacked up on a desk , having arrived from small film festivals from all over germany , and around the world .
when a winning director ca n't travel to a film festival in asia or the caribbean to collect their award , then an employee of the local goethe institute in that city steps in to pick it up on their behalf .
promoting german culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tragicomic ' good bye lenin ! ' opened doors christian lueffe is responsible for the coordination of the goethe institut 's german film program overseas ; they provide current films to about 40 cinemas around the world .
after they pick what movies are shown , the institute has to organize copies of the films and get distribution and clearance rights for showing abroad .
then the film has to be translated for dubbing or subtitles .
lueffe says people who come to the goethe institut 's films often view them as a way to learn more about german culture .
they 're not necessarily just for people who already have a deep understanding of the country .
the movies might even become an incentive for people to learn the language and visit germany .
" images , music , language - film is an ideal medium because the way it is assembled , you experience all of that at once , " said lueffe .
at least half the events hosted by the munich goethe-institute are film screenings , he says .
international presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' lives of others ' director von donnersmarck spearheaded a comeback the goethe institut is n't the only film-promotion group in munich ; there 's also an organization that is simply called german films .
it lobbies to get german films into festivals around the world .
german films has a different mandate than the goethe institut , which tries to use films as a way of increasing culture awareness .
the group 's goal is to distribute german film as widely as possible , and get new movies in festivals and out on the international market .
response has n't always been as good it is today .
for a while it seemed like german film was dropping low down on the international film-circuit radar .
but now german films are winning more and more accolades .
scooping up the prizes " das weisse band , " or " the white ribbon , " is a black and white film about children in a small german village just prior to world war i. it is the latest example of a german success story ; it won the palme d 'or in cannes , the european film award for best film , and the golden globe , also for best foreign film .
moreover , german-speaking actors have prominently appeared in international productions lately , including austrian-born christoph waltz , who recently won a golden globe - and is pegged to take home an oscar - for his role in quentin tarantino 's " inglorious basterds . "
mariette rissenbeek , from the festival and pr department of german films , said she thought the 2003 film " good bye , lenin ! " about a man who tries to recreate east germany after the fall of the wall , acted as an " international door-opener for german films . "
" foreign investors saw that german films do make money at the box office and they can be entertaining , " rissenbeek said .

his oscar-winning 2006 feature ' the lives of others ' - about east germany under the stasi secret police - marked an industry comeback . today , the goethe institute headquarters in munich is the transitional home to a surprisingly large collection of film trophies .
awards for best actress , best film score and best director are stacked up on a desk , having arrived from small film festivals from all over germany , and around the world .
when a winning director ca n't travel to a film festival in asia or the caribbean to collect their award , then an employee of the local goethe institute in that city steps in to pick it up on their behalf .
promoting german culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tragicomic ' good bye lenin ! ' opened doors christian lueffe is responsible for the coordination of the goethe institut 's german film program overseas ; they provide current films to about 40 cinemas around the world .
after they pick what movies are shown , the institute has to organize copies of the films and get distribution and clearance rights for showing abroad .
then the film has to be translated for dubbing or subtitles .
lueffe says people who come to the goethe institut 's films often view them as a way to learn more about german culture .
they 're not necessarily just for people who already have a deep understanding of the country .
the movies might even become an incentive for people to learn the language and visit germany .
" images , music , language - film is an ideal medium because the way it is assembled , you experience all of that at once , " said lueffe .
at least half the events hosted by the munich goethe-institute are film screenings , he says .
international presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' lives of others ' director von donnersmarck spearheaded a comeback the goethe institut is n't the only film-promotion group in munich ; there 's also an organization that is simply called german films .
it lobbies to get german films into festivals around the world .
german films has a different mandate than the goethe institut , which tries to use films as a way of increasing culture awareness .
the group 's goal is to distribute german film as widely as possible , and get new movies in festivals and out on the international market .
response has n't always been as good it is today .
for a while it seemed like german film was dropping low down on the international film-circuit radar .
but now german films are winning more and more accolades .
scooping up the prizes " das weisse band , " or " the white ribbon , " is a black and white film about children in a small german village just prior to world war i. it is the latest example of a german success story ; it won the palme d 'or in cannes , the european film award for best film , and the golden globe , also for best foreign film .
moreover , german-speaking actors have prominently appeared in international productions lately , including austrian-born christoph waltz , who recently won a golden globe - and is pegged to take home an oscar - for his role in quentin tarantino 's " inglorious basterds . "
mariette rissenbeek , from the festival and pr department of german films , said she thought the 2003 film " good bye , lenin ! " about a man who tries to recreate east germany after the fall of the wall , acted as an " international door-opener for german films . "
" foreign investors saw that german films do make money at the box office and they can be entertaining , " rissenbeek said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 31.01.2010 german film promoters are riding a new wave of popularity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' the white ribbon ' is this year 's breakthrough german film can be grateful to florian henckel von donnersmarck .
his oscar-winning 2006 feature ' the lives of others ' - about east germany under the stasi secret police - marked an industry comeback . today , the goethe institute headquarters in munich is the transitional home to a surprisingly large collection of film trophies .
awards for best actress , best film score and best director are stacked up on a desk , having arrived from small film festivals from all over germany , and around the world .
when a winning director ca n't travel to a film festival in asia or the caribbean to collect their award , then an employee of the local goethe institute in that city steps in to pick it up on their behalf .
promoting german culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tragicomic ' good bye lenin ! ' opened doors christian lueffe is responsible for the coordination of the goethe institut 's german film program overseas ; they provide current films to about 40 cinemas around the world .
after they pick what movies are shown , the institute has to organize copies of the films and get distribution and clearance rights for showing abroad .
then the film has to be translated for dubbing or subtitles .
lueffe says people who come to the goethe institut 's films often view them as a way to learn more about german culture .
they 're not necessarily just for people who already have a deep understanding of the country .
the movies might even become an incentive for people to learn the language and visit germany .
" images , music , language - film is an ideal medium because the way it is assembled , you experience all of that at once , " said lueffe .
at least half the events hosted by the munich goethe-institute are film screenings , he says .
international presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' lives of others ' director von donnersmarck spearheaded a comeback the goethe institut is n't the only film-promotion group in munich ; there 's also an organization that is simply called german films .
it lobbies to get german films into festivals around the world .
german films has a different mandate than the goethe institut , which tries to use films as a way of increasing culture awareness .
the group 's goal is to distribute german film as widely as possible , and get new movies in festivals and out on the international market .
response has n't always been as good it is today .
for a while it seemed like german film was dropping low down on the international film-circuit radar .
but now german films are winning more and more accolades .
scooping up the prizes " das weisse band , " or " the white ribbon , " is a black and white film about children in a small german village just prior to world war i. it is the latest example of a german success story ; it won the palme d 'or in cannes , the european film award for best film , and the golden globe , also for best foreign film .
moreover , german-speaking actors have prominently appeared in international productions lately , including austrian-born christoph waltz , who recently won a golden globe - and is pegged to take home an oscar - for his role in quentin tarantino 's " inglorious basterds . "
mariette rissenbeek , from the festival and pr department of german films , said she thought the 2003 film " good bye , lenin ! " about a man who tries to recreate east germany after the fall of the wall , acted as an " international door-opener for german films . "
" foreign investors saw that german films do make money at the box office and they can be entertaining , " rissenbeek said .

his oscar-winning 2006 feature ' the lives of others ' - about east germany under the stasi secret police - marked an industry comeback . today , the goethe institute headquarters in munich is the transitional home to a surprisingly large collection of film trophies .
awards for best actress , best film score and best director are stacked up on a desk , having arrived from small film festivals from all over germany , and around the world .

after they pick what movies are shown , the institute has to organize copies of the films and get distribution and clearance rights for showing abroad .
then the film has to be translated for dubbing or subtitles .
lueffe says people who come to the goethe institut 's films often view them as a way to learn more about german culture .
they 're not necessarily just for people who already have a deep understanding of the country .
the movies might even become an incentive for people to learn the language and visit germany .

mariette rissenbeek , from the festival and pr department of german films , said she thought the 2003 film " good bye , lenin ! " about a man who tries to recreate east germany after the fall of the wall , acted as an " international door-opener for german films . "

his oscar-winning 2006 feature ' the lives of others ' - about east germany under the stasi secret police - marked an industry comeback . today , the goethe institute headquarters in munich is the transitional home to a surprisingly large collection of film trophies .
awards for best actress , best film score and best director are stacked up on a desk , having arrived from small film festivals from all over germany , and around the world .
when a winning director ca n't travel to a film festival in asia or the caribbean to collect their award , then an employee of the local goethe institute in that city steps in to pick it up on their behalf .
promoting german culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tragicomic ' good bye lenin ! ' opened doors christian lueffe is responsible for the coordination of the goethe institut 's german film program overseas ; they provide current films to about 40 cinemas around the world .
after they pick what movies are shown , the institute has to organize copies of the films and get distribution and clearance rights for showing abroad .
then the film has to be translated for dubbing or subtitles .
lueffe says people who come to the goethe institut 's films often view them as a way to learn more about german culture .
they 're not necessarily just for people who already have a deep understanding of the country .
the movies might even become an incentive for people to learn the language and visit germany .
" images , music , language - film is an ideal medium because the way it is assembled , you experience all of that at once , " said lueffe .
at least half the events hosted by the munich goethe-institute are film screenings , he says .
international presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' lives of others ' director von donnersmarck spearheaded a comeback the goethe institut is n't the only film-promotion group in munich ; there 's also an organization that is simply called german films .
it lobbies to get german films into festivals around the world .
german films has a different mandate than the goethe institut , which tries to use films as a way of increasing culture awareness .
the group 's goal is to distribute german film as widely as possible , and get new movies in festivals and out on the international market .
response has n't always been as good it is today .
for a while it seemed like german film was dropping low down on the international film-circuit radar .
but now german films are winning more and more accolades .
scooping up the prizes " das weisse band , " or " the white ribbon , " is a black and white film about children in a small german village just prior to world war i. it is the latest example of a german success story ; it won the palme d 'or in cannes , the european film award for best film , and the golden globe , also for best foreign film .
moreover , german-speaking actors have prominently appeared in international productions lately , including austrian-born christoph waltz , who recently won a golden globe - and is pegged to take home an oscar - for his role in quentin tarantino 's " inglorious basterds . "
mariette rissenbeek , from the festival and pr department of german films , said she thought the 2003 film " good bye , lenin ! " about a man who tries to recreate east germany after the fall of the wall , acted as an " international door-opener for german films . "
" foreign investors saw that german films do make money at the box office and they can be entertaining , " rissenbeek said .

lueffe says people who come to the goethe institut 's films often view them as a way to learn more about german culture .

his oscar-winning 2006 feature ' the lives of others ' - about east germany under the stasi secret police - marked an industry comeback . today , the goethe institute headquarters in munich is the transitional home to a surprisingly large collection of film trophies .
awards for best actress , best film score and best director are stacked up on a desk , having arrived from small film festivals from all over germany , and around the world .

after they pick what movies are shown , the institute has to organize copies of the films and get distribution and clearance rights for showing abroad .
then the film has to be translated for dubbing or subtitles .
lueffe says people who come to the goethe institut 's films often view them as a way to learn more about german culture .
they 're not necessarily just for people who already have a deep understanding of the country .
the movies might even become an incentive for people to learn the language and visit germany .
" images , music , language - film is an ideal medium because the way it is assembled , you experience all of that at once , " said lueffe .

moreover , german-speaking actors have prominently appeared in international productions lately , including austrian-born christoph waltz , who recently won a golden globe - and is pegged to take home an oscar - for his role in quentin tarantino 's " inglorious basterds . "
mariette rissenbeek , from the festival and pr department of german films , said she thought the 2003 film " good bye , lenin ! " about a man who tries to recreate east germany after the fall of the wall , acted as an " international door-opener for german films . "
