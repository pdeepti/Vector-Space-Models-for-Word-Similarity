world water week , which has run since 1991 , will award this year 's stockholm water prize to cholera researcher rita colwell . the 20th annual world water week conference focuses on how to better help the 884 million people worldwide who do not have access to clean drinking water . " driven by demographic change and economic growth , water is increasingly withdrawn , used , reused , treated , and disposed of , " organizers cautioned in their introduction to this year 's conference . " urbanization , agriculture , industry and climate change exert mounting pressure on both the quantity and quality of our water resources , " they added in a statement on the conference website . it is expected that more than 2,500 experts , decision-makers and business innovators will attend the event to discuss the escalating global water crisis . in the build-up to this year 's event , unicef , the united nations children 's fund , has drawn particular attention to the 1.5 million children who die each year from diseases related to contaminated water and poor hygiene . the stockholm water prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to clean water is essential for tackling world poverty , says the siwi the symposium in the swedish capital is put together by the stockholm water institute -lrb- siwi -rrb- , the organization which also awards an annual prize worth $ 150,000 -lrb- 116,000 euros -rrb- to recognize achievements in water science , water management , action or awareness building . the recipient of the 2010 stockholm water prize is the us researcher rita colwell , known for her work on infectious waterborne diseases like cholera . colwell has been praised for her " pioneering research " which identified that the cholera bacteria could survive by attaching to zooplankton in rivers , lakes and oceans .
it was previously thought that cholera could break out only due to release of sewage , but scientists now know that certain changes in the natural environment can also spread the disease . cholera is estimated to cause some 120,000 deaths each year and infects 3 to 5 million people .
siwi said colwell 's work had " helped protect the health and lives of millions . " the water crisis academics and water and sanitation ngos argue that access to water is central to alleviating poverty , improving worldwide health standards and security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 884 million people worldwide do not have access to clean drinking water speaking at the united nations ' high-level interactive dialogue on water last march , deputy secretary-general asha rose-migiro said " access to clean water and adequate sanitation are a pre-requisite for lifting people out of poverty . " the un has been accused of marginalizing water and sanitation issues in its millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- aimed at improving the lives of billions in the developing world . anders berntell from siwi told the inter press news agency that water has not received proper attention , yet is integral to fulfilling mdgs such as reducing extreme poverty and hunger by 50 percent by 2015 . " without water , we can never fight hunger ; without toilets in schools , girls will continue to drop out before finalizing their education ; and without adequate sanitation and hygiene , diseases will continue to spread , " berntell said .
the world water week conference runs until september 11 .

while it has been an accepted practice in the united states for a long time , that 's not the case in europe . when germans want to talk about whistle-blowing they quickly run into a linguistic problem : there is no german word for it .
in order to describe a whistle-blower in their own language germans have to resort to a negatively connotated word like informant or paraphrase it some other way .
that 's why germans often simply use the english word to talk about whistle-blowing .
the lack of a proper name for the practice is indicative of the role and acceptance of whistle-blowing in germany .
" in germany there are no laws to protect whistle-blowers or to serve as an incentive for whistle-blowing , " johannes ludwig , a professor at hamburg 's university of applied sciences and a board member of germany 's whistle-blower netzwerk , told deutsche welle .
" in the us there is both . "
the reasons why whistle-blowing plays a much smaller role in germany than in the us are historical and also shaped by mentality , argues ludwig .
the us was founded by people that did n't want to acccept the traditional hierarchical structures in europe .
" and that 's why in the us everything that has to do with the state and government has to work effectively and serve a clear purpose .
the americans have a much looser understanding of government and state and their relation to government and business is much less bureacratic and authority-driven than ours . "
what 's more , argues ludwig , democracy in germany , even compared to other european countries has a relatively short history .
" and that 's why it is understandable that rules or laws about whistle-blowing which actually only serves the purpose to improve things , are not as developed in germany as they are in other countries . "
protecting whistle-blowers since the civil war by comparison , the first legal incentive for whistle-blowing in the us dates back to the civil war .
the false claims act , which was passed by congress in 1863 , was a reaction by the federal government to deal with fraud .
basically it promised a reward to whistle-blowers who could prove that the government was being defrauded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enron scandal led to a further tightening of whistle-blower laws with some minor changes that law is still in effect today and remains an important factor in recognizing fraud , says alexander dyck , a finance professor and whistle-blowing expert at the rotman school of management at the university of toronto .
" if someone brings information to light through whistle-blowing action and the government is being defrauded and the action is successfully pursued than that whistle-blower is entitled to between 15 and 30 percent of the money the government collects as a result of stopping this wrongdoing , " he told deutsche wellle .
tightening whistle-blower protection through sarbanes-oxley more recently , the us government improved protection for whistle-blowers through the so-called sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 as a reaction to the enron and other corporate scandals .
it also opened up the false claims act to private corporations .
" corporations effectively have to have a whistle-blowing policy , have to set up a hotline , whereby if there are employees or others in the firm who think there is some wrongdoing , you can make the phone calls and allegations and that information is then communicated to folks within the firm that then follow up on this , " explains dyck .
the purpose of all those and additional measures that were instituted in march is to provide incentives for whistle-blowers to speak up about wrongdoings they know about and to protect them as much as possible from retribution for doing it .
less stringent laws , more formal channels in europe in europe , not just in germany , many of these mechanisms simply do n't exist yet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major us companies are required to have instituted protections for whistle-blowers " one possible reason for less whistle-blowing in europe is that many of the activities that whistle-blowing might bring to light would n't be illegal in many european countries , says dyck .
" some things of corporate wrongdoing would be illegal in the us , but would not be illegal in europe , so whistle-blowing on them would n't be very effective . "
however , dyck also offers a more positive explanation of why whistle-blowing is less of a phenomenon in europe than in the us : " there are more formal channels in europe for employees who are concerned about wrongdoing to bring that information to light without going through a whistle-blowing channel , " he notes . " the existence of works councils , worker representatives on boards provide another channel for that sort of information to perculate up to the highest level of decision making that would n't require going through a formal whistle-blowing channel . "
while it might take some time until european countries institute an office of the whistle-blower protection program like it exists within the us department of labor , the experts agree that europe needs to provide more incentives for whistle-blowers to speak out if it wants to get serious about improving corporate governance both in the business and governmental sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 05.09.2010 one in five germans would vote for banker embroiled in race row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin says he will fight his dismissal from the bundesbank a survey says one in five germans would vote for a party headed by outspoken banker thilo sarrazin , whose controversial book on race and integration has topped german best-seller lists since being published last week . around 20 percent of german voters would back a party set up by thilo sarrazin , the controversial banker who has kicked up a storm with his views on race and immigration , a survey revealed on sunday .
no such party exists ; sarrazin is a member of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and intends to remain there - despite recent moves by the spd to evict him .
however , just over 18 percent of germans polled said they would vote for a party led by sarrazin , according to the survey published in the mass-circulated bild am sonntag newspaper .
sarrazin , a board member in germany 's central bank , sparked a furious debate when he said that muslim immigrants in germany were failing to integrate , had too many children and achieved poor levels of education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' germany does away with itself ' is topping best-seller lists the 65-year-old banker sparked widepread anger by saying the causes were not just social , but genetic .
his book , germany does away with itself , argues that intelligence is largely inherited , and that muslim immigrants were bringing down german standards .
book hugely popular according to the bild survey , sarrazin 's views found the greatest support amongst followers of the radical left party , but also resonated with voters of the current center-right coalition .
" for them , sarrazin is somebody who is finally saying what many are thinking , " said the head of pollsters emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner .
demand has surged for sarrazin 's book , which has topped the bestseller list on bookseller amazon 's german website since its publication a week ago .
book tour dates are sold out across the country .
" the rush is unbelievable , " said marion boesker in the munich literature house , a venue where sarrazin is scheduled to appear .
she added that people were worried that sarrazin 's visit could be cancelled .
" the audience does n't want censorship .
they want to talk about the things that are affecting them , " boesker added .
sarrazin calls criticism ' political show trial ' sarrazin 's spd , meanwhile , has initiated procedures to evict him from the party , while the central bank has asked president christian wulff to approve his dismissal from the bank 's board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans think sarrazin should ' shut up ' sarrazin has threatened to go to court to prevent his dismissal from the bundesbank .
in extracts from an interview with the news weekly focus , released ahead of publication on monday , sarrazin likened the wave of criticism of him against him to a " political show trial . "
he said if german president christian wulff approved his sacking in the next few days , the decision would be overturned by the justice system .
" the president will have to consider carefully whether he wants to see this political show trial to its end , and then see -lrb- his decision -rrb- thrown out by the courts , " sarrazin said .
rules designed to protect the bundesbank 's independence mean the german president 's approval must be sought for the dismissal of a board member - something that has never happened since the institution was founded over 50 years ago .

sure , back in the 1970s there 's no lack of soccer talent in the east of germany - but the money is n't there to support it .
this season not a single eastern german team is in the top flight , the bundesliga . managers of eastern german football clubs may be forgiven for hankering after the good old days .
under the communist east german government they did n't have to spend their time chasing sponsors , dealing with tax returns or worrying about revenue .
most importantly , though , east german clubs were real contenders back in the day .
fc magdeburg won the european cup winners ' cup in 1974 .
that same year , the east german team defeated west germany during the fifa world cup .
clubs like dynamo dresden or 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig were playing at the top of their game .
twenty years after unification , these same clubs are now languishing in the lower divisions of the league tables .
they 're lucky to attract a crowd of a thousand to watch them play , and with every annual review they fear for their licenses .
not a single club from the east is in germany 's top division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german teams have n't always been bad at soccer there wo n't even be any bundesliga games in reunified berlin this season - after 13 years , hertha bsc , in the old days a west german team , was relegated back in may , following a dismal campaign .
three eastern german clubs will be playing alongside hertha in the second division , and there are another five in the third .
hans-georg moldenhauer , president of the north-eastern german football association -lrb- nofv -rrb- admits that " the current situation of professional football in eastern germany is far from satisfactory . "
so how did it come to this sad state of affairs ?
wherever you go , the answer is the same : not enough sponsors , not enough money , and a history of poor management .
the amalgamation of east and west german soccer into one unified german competitive group in 1991 was too much of a challenge for the east german clubs ; they simply were n't able to make the leap from socialism to capitalism in the space of just a few months .
" all of a sudden we got no state subsidies any more , and we had no idea how to run a market-based operation , " said detlef krauspe , the former boss of sachsen leipzig .
the best players , like andreas thom , ulf kirsten , and later michael ballack , moved to the rich clubs in the west .
the former east had no private companies that could have invested money in the teams .
vicious circle there are some such companies today , but most of them are only small or medium-sized businesses with very little money for sports sponsorship .
" the eastern german clubs have lots of small sponsors that do n't provide that much in the way of finance , and do n't offer long-term partnerships , " says nofv president moldenhauer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german clubs generally only make news when fans make trouble the clubs are therefore hardly ever in a position to make major investments .
in order to attract big companies as sponsorship partners - like the deal bayern munich has secured with deutsche telekom - the eastern german clubs would have to be much more successful than they are at present .
they would also have to acquire a more positive image .
the image of eastern german soccer has suffered badly in recent years .
media reports have focused not on victories but increasingly on hooliganism , riots and racist attacks , both inside and outside the stadiums .
georg moldenhauer says it 's unfair .
" this is n't an eastern german problem , and it 's not football 's problem either - it 's a problem for all of society , " he says .
the media generally find stories like these more interesting than devoting themselves to the analysis of fourth-division games .
rb leipzig as a model now , though , eastern german football has a new story to tempt the sports reporters : rb leipzig .
in 2009 austrian drinks manufacturer red bull acquired a license from the club ssv markranstaedt in saxony to compete in german football .
a new club , rb leipzig , was founded , replacing ssv in the fifth-division nofv-oberliga sued .
players were bought for the team , as was the license for leipzig central stadium , subsequently renamed the red bull arena .
at the end of its first season rb leipzig finished league champion and was immediately promoted to the regionalliga .
the new management 's goal is for the team to play in the bundesliga within 10 years .
since the start of the 2010 season , the red bull arena , the biggest stadium in the territory of the eastern states , has been rb leipzig 's home ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red bull has pumped money into leipzig but the project is far from popular among football fans in leipzig .
there have been huge protests and a lot of hostility from supporters of fc sachsen leipzig and 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig .
they 're worried about a decline in traditional fan culture and the commercialization of soccer in the region .
by contrast , though , a large part of the local population approves of red bull 's investment .
nofv president moldenhauer is also happy about it .
" in the past two decades we 've always criticized the fact that the big sponsors just are n't out there , " he says .
" so i 'm pleased that now , for the first time , we have a model for this kind of partnership here in eastern germany . "
moldenhauer believes that what is almost more important is the signal it sends out to regional football : " we badly need clubs here to act as beacons , " he says : to set high standards once again , and have a positive effect on eastern german football .
investing in young talent however , moldenhauer admits that the rb leipzig model is an exception rather than a panacea : " the clubs here must keep working on what they already have going for them , which is the fantastic work they do with young players . "
in the past , eastern clubs were more or less forced to develop young local talent because they could n't afford to buy in players from elsewhere .
in addition to the work done by the clubs , the controversial east german sports schools -lrb- kjs -rrb- have now been transformed into modern football academies , and talented local children have profited from them .
the german football association has also invested - albeit not yet enough - in eastern german football : eight of its 36 elite sports schools are now located in the east .
bildunterschrift : adler left his home team leipzig to play for leverkusen but what happens if a club ca n't persuade its own up-and-coming footballers to stay , simply because it is n't able to offer them much of a future ?
german national team goalkeeper rene adler plays not for his home club , vfb leipzig , but for bayer leverkusen - even though he 's often talks about how much leipzig means to him .
georg moldenhauer does n't think this will stop the eastern clubs from rising to the top of the tree once more .
" even if two out of every 10 good players move on , we 'll still have a good quota , " he says .
he points out that this problem does n't just affect eastern germany .
all over the world top players are keen to move to the top clubs .
moldenhauer cites the example of sami khedira : he did n't stay in stuttgart , but allowed himself to be seduced away by real madrid .
cautiously optimistic the nofv president believes that , in recent years , most clubs have improved their structures and have caught up with their western counterparts , particularly where management is concerned .
the lack of big sponsors and the money they bring remains a problem , but there 's not much the clubs can do about that .
in spite of their economic woes , some have been developing very positively for quite a while now - and they are not just the usual suspects .
moldenhauer singles out energie cottbus and erzgebirge aue .
" it 's astonishing what energie cottbus has achieved with the little it has at its disposal , " he says .

sure , back in the 1970s there 's no lack of soccer talent in the east of germany - but the money is n't there to support it .
this season not a single eastern german team is in the top flight , the bundesliga . managers of eastern german football clubs may be forgiven for hankering after the good old days .
under the communist east german government they did n't have to spend their time chasing sponsors , dealing with tax returns or worrying about revenue .
most importantly , though , east german clubs were real contenders back in the day .
fc magdeburg won the european cup winners ' cup in 1974 .
that same year , the east german team defeated west germany during the fifa world cup .
clubs like dynamo dresden or 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig were playing at the top of their game .
twenty years after unification , these same clubs are now languishing in the lower divisions of the league tables .
they 're lucky to attract a crowd of a thousand to watch them play , and with every annual review they fear for their licenses .
not a single club from the east is in germany 's top division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german teams have n't always been bad at soccer there wo n't even be any bundesliga games in reunified berlin this season - after 13 years , hertha bsc , in the old days a west german team , was relegated back in may , following a dismal campaign .
three eastern german clubs will be playing alongside hertha in the second division , and there are another five in the third .
hans-georg moldenhauer , president of the north-eastern german football association -lrb- nofv -rrb- admits that " the current situation of professional football in eastern germany is far from satisfactory . "
so how did it come to this sad state of affairs ?
wherever you go , the answer is the same : not enough sponsors , not enough money , and a history of poor management .
the amalgamation of east and west german soccer into one unified german competitive group in 1991 was too much of a challenge for the east german clubs ; they simply were n't able to make the leap from socialism to capitalism in the space of just a few months .
" all of a sudden we got no state subsidies any more , and we had no idea how to run a market-based operation , " said detlef krauspe , the former boss of sachsen leipzig .
the best players , like andreas thom , ulf kirsten , and later michael ballack , moved to the rich clubs in the west .
the former east had no private companies that could have invested money in the teams .
vicious circle there are some such companies today , but most of them are only small or medium-sized businesses with very little money for sports sponsorship .
" the eastern german clubs have lots of small sponsors that do n't provide that much in the way of finance , and do n't offer long-term partnerships , " says nofv president moldenhauer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german clubs generally only make news when fans make trouble the clubs are therefore hardly ever in a position to make major investments .
in order to attract big companies as sponsorship partners - like the deal bayern munich has secured with deutsche telekom - the eastern german clubs would have to be much more successful than they are at present .
they would also have to acquire a more positive image .
the image of eastern german soccer has suffered badly in recent years .
media reports have focused not on victories but increasingly on hooliganism , riots and racist attacks , both inside and outside the stadiums .
georg moldenhauer says it 's unfair .
" this is n't an eastern german problem , and it 's not football 's problem either - it 's a problem for all of society , " he says .
the media generally find stories like these more interesting than devoting themselves to the analysis of fourth-division games .
rb leipzig as a model now , though , eastern german football has a new story to tempt the sports reporters : rb leipzig .
in 2009 austrian drinks manufacturer red bull acquired a license from the club ssv markranstaedt in saxony to compete in german football .
a new club , rb leipzig , was founded , replacing ssv in the fifth-division nofv-oberliga sued .
players were bought for the team , as was the license for leipzig central stadium , subsequently renamed the red bull arena .
at the end of its first season rb leipzig finished league champion and was immediately promoted to the regionalliga .
the new management 's goal is for the team to play in the bundesliga within 10 years .
since the start of the 2010 season , the red bull arena , the biggest stadium in the territory of the eastern states , has been rb leipzig 's home ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red bull has pumped money into leipzig but the project is far from popular among football fans in leipzig .
there have been huge protests and a lot of hostility from supporters of fc sachsen leipzig and 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig .
they 're worried about a decline in traditional fan culture and the commercialization of soccer in the region .
by contrast , though , a large part of the local population approves of red bull 's investment .
nofv president moldenhauer is also happy about it .
" in the past two decades we 've always criticized the fact that the big sponsors just are n't out there , " he says .
" so i 'm pleased that now , for the first time , we have a model for this kind of partnership here in eastern germany . "
moldenhauer believes that what is almost more important is the signal it sends out to regional football : " we badly need clubs here to act as beacons , " he says : to set high standards once again , and have a positive effect on eastern german football .
investing in young talent however , moldenhauer admits that the rb leipzig model is an exception rather than a panacea : " the clubs here must keep working on what they already have going for them , which is the fantastic work they do with young players . "
in the past , eastern clubs were more or less forced to develop young local talent because they could n't afford to buy in players from elsewhere .
in addition to the work done by the clubs , the controversial east german sports schools -lrb- kjs -rrb- have now been transformed into modern football academies , and talented local children have profited from them .
the german football association has also invested - albeit not yet enough - in eastern german football : eight of its 36 elite sports schools are now located in the east .
bildunterschrift : adler left his home team leipzig to play for leverkusen but what happens if a club ca n't persuade its own up-and-coming footballers to stay , simply because it is n't able to offer them much of a future ?
german national team goalkeeper rene adler plays not for his home club , vfb leipzig , but for bayer leverkusen - even though he 's often talks about how much leipzig means to him .
georg moldenhauer does n't think this will stop the eastern clubs from rising to the top of the tree once more .
" even if two out of every 10 good players move on , we 'll still have a good quota , " he says .
he points out that this problem does n't just affect eastern germany .
all over the world top players are keen to move to the top clubs .
moldenhauer cites the example of sami khedira : he did n't stay in stuttgart , but allowed himself to be seduced away by real madrid .
cautiously optimistic the nofv president believes that , in recent years , most clubs have improved their structures and have caught up with their western counterparts , particularly where management is concerned .
the lack of big sponsors and the money they bring remains a problem , but there 's not much the clubs can do about that .
in spite of their economic woes , some have been developing very positively for quite a while now - and they are not just the usual suspects .
moldenhauer singles out energie cottbus and erzgebirge aue .
" it 's astonishing what energie cottbus has achieved with the little it has at its disposal , " he says .

hans-georg moldenhauer , president of the north-eastern german football association -lrb- nofv -rrb- admits that " the current situation of professional football in eastern germany is far from satisfactory . "
so how did it come to this sad state of affairs ?
wherever you go , the answer is the same : not enough sponsors , not enough money , and a history of poor management .
the amalgamation of east and west german soccer into one unified german competitive group in 1991 was too much of a challenge for the east german clubs ; they simply were n't able to make the leap from socialism to capitalism in the space of just a few months .
" all of a sudden we got no state subsidies any more , and we had no idea how to run a market-based operation , " said detlef krauspe , the former boss of sachsen leipzig .
the best players , like andreas thom , ulf kirsten , and later michael ballack , moved to the rich clubs in the west .
the former east had no private companies that could have invested money in the teams .
vicious circle there are some such companies today , but most of them are only small or medium-sized businesses with very little money for sports sponsorship .
" the eastern german clubs have lots of small sponsors that do n't provide that much in the way of finance , and do n't offer long-term partnerships , " says nofv president moldenhauer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german clubs generally only make news when fans make trouble the clubs are therefore hardly ever in a position to make major investments .
in order to attract big companies as sponsorship partners - like the deal bayern munich has secured with deutsche telekom - the eastern german clubs would have to be much more successful than they are at present .
they would also have to acquire a more positive image .
the image of eastern german soccer has suffered badly in recent years .
media reports have focused not on victories but increasingly on hooliganism , riots and racist attacks , both inside and outside the stadiums .
georg moldenhauer says it 's unfair .
" this is n't an eastern german problem , and it 's not football 's problem either - it 's a problem for all of society , " he says .
the media generally find stories like these more interesting than devoting themselves to the analysis of fourth-division games .
rb leipzig as a model now , though , eastern german football has a new story to tempt the sports reporters : rb leipzig .
in 2009 austrian drinks manufacturer red bull acquired a license from the club ssv markranstaedt in saxony to compete in german football .
a new club , rb leipzig , was founded , replacing ssv in the fifth-division nofv-oberliga sued .
players were bought for the team , as was the license for leipzig central stadium , subsequently renamed the red bull arena .
at the end of its first season rb leipzig finished league champion and was immediately promoted to the regionalliga .
the new management 's goal is for the team to play in the bundesliga within 10 years .
since the start of the 2010 season , the red bull arena , the biggest stadium in the territory of the eastern states , has been rb leipzig 's home ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red bull has pumped money into leipzig but the project is far from popular among football fans in leipzig .
there have been huge protests and a lot of hostility from supporters of fc sachsen leipzig and 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig .
they 're worried about a decline in traditional fan culture and the commercialization of soccer in the region .
by contrast , though , a large part of the local population approves of red bull 's investment .
nofv president moldenhauer is also happy about it .
" in the past two decades we 've always criticized the fact that the big sponsors just are n't out there , " he says .
" so i 'm pleased that now , for the first time , we have a model for this kind of partnership here in eastern germany . "
moldenhauer believes that what is almost more important is the signal it sends out to regional football : " we badly need clubs here to act as beacons , " he says : to set high standards once again , and have a positive effect on eastern german football .
investing in young talent however , moldenhauer admits that the rb leipzig model is an exception rather than a panacea : " the clubs here must keep working on what they already have going for them , which is the fantastic work they do with young players . "
in the past , eastern clubs were more or less forced to develop young local talent because they could n't afford to buy in players from elsewhere .
in addition to the work done by the clubs , the controversial east german sports schools -lrb- kjs -rrb- have now been transformed into modern football academies , and talented local children have profited from them .
the german football association has also invested - albeit not yet enough - in eastern german football : eight of its 36 elite sports schools are now located in the east .
bildunterschrift : adler left his home team leipzig to play for leverkusen but what happens if a club ca n't persuade its own up-and-coming footballers to stay , simply because it is n't able to offer them much of a future ?
german national team goalkeeper rene adler plays not for his home club , vfb leipzig , but for bayer leverkusen - even though he 's often talks about how much leipzig means to him .
georg moldenhauer does n't think this will stop the eastern clubs from rising to the top of the tree once more .
" even if two out of every 10 good players move on , we 'll still have a good quota , " he says .
he points out that this problem does n't just affect eastern germany .
all over the world top players are keen to move to the top clubs .
moldenhauer cites the example of sami khedira : he did n't stay in stuttgart , but allowed himself to be seduced away by real madrid .
cautiously optimistic the nofv president believes that , in recent years , most clubs have improved their structures and have caught up with their western counterparts , particularly where management is concerned .
the lack of big sponsors and the money they bring remains a problem , but there 's not much the clubs can do about that .
in spite of their economic woes , some have been developing very positively for quite a while now - and they are not just the usual suspects .

sure , back in the 1970s there 's no lack of soccer talent in the east of germany - but the money is n't there to support it .
this season not a single eastern german team is in the top flight , the bundesliga . managers of eastern german football clubs may be forgiven for hankering after the good old days .
under the communist east german government they did n't have to spend their time chasing sponsors , dealing with tax returns or worrying about revenue .
most importantly , though , east german clubs were real contenders back in the day .
fc magdeburg won the european cup winners ' cup in 1974 .
that same year , the east german team defeated west germany during the fifa world cup .
clubs like dynamo dresden or 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig were playing at the top of their game .
twenty years after unification , these same clubs are now languishing in the lower divisions of the league tables .
they 're lucky to attract a crowd of a thousand to watch them play , and with every annual review they fear for their licenses .
not a single club from the east is in germany 's top division .

this season not a single eastern german team is in the top flight , the bundesliga . managers of eastern german football clubs may be forgiven for hankering after the good old days .
under the communist east german government they did n't have to spend their time chasing sponsors , dealing with tax returns or worrying about revenue .
most importantly , though , east german clubs were real contenders back in the day .
fc magdeburg won the european cup winners ' cup in 1974 .
that same year , the east german team defeated west germany during the fifa world cup .
clubs like dynamo dresden or 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig were playing at the top of their game .
twenty years after unification , these same clubs are now languishing in the lower divisions of the league tables .
they 're lucky to attract a crowd of a thousand to watch them play , and with every annual review they fear for their licenses .
not a single club from the east is in germany 's top division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german teams have n't always been bad at soccer there wo n't even be any bundesliga games in reunified berlin this season - after 13 years , hertha bsc , in the old days a west german team , was relegated back in may , following a dismal campaign .
three eastern german clubs will be playing alongside hertha in the second division , and there are another five in the third .
hans-georg moldenhauer , president of the north-eastern german football association -lrb- nofv -rrb- admits that " the current situation of professional football in eastern germany is far from satisfactory . "
so how did it come to this sad state of affairs ?
wherever you go , the answer is the same : not enough sponsors , not enough money , and a history of poor management .
the amalgamation of east and west german soccer into one unified german competitive group in 1991 was too much of a challenge for the east german clubs ; they simply were n't able to make the leap from socialism to capitalism in the space of just a few months .
" all of a sudden we got no state subsidies any more , and we had no idea how to run a market-based operation , " said detlef krauspe , the former boss of sachsen leipzig .
the best players , like andreas thom , ulf kirsten , and later michael ballack , moved to the rich clubs in the west .
the former east had no private companies that could have invested money in the teams .
vicious circle there are some such companies today , but most of them are only small or medium-sized businesses with very little money for sports sponsorship .
" the eastern german clubs have lots of small sponsors that do n't provide that much in the way of finance , and do n't offer long-term partnerships , " says nofv president moldenhauer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german clubs generally only make news when fans make trouble the clubs are therefore hardly ever in a position to make major investments .
in order to attract big companies as sponsorship partners - like the deal bayern munich has secured with deutsche telekom - the eastern german clubs would have to be much more successful than they are at present .
they would also have to acquire a more positive image .
the image of eastern german soccer has suffered badly in recent years .
media reports have focused not on victories but increasingly on hooliganism , riots and racist attacks , both inside and outside the stadiums .
georg moldenhauer says it 's unfair .
" this is n't an eastern german problem , and it 's not football 's problem either - it 's a problem for all of society , " he says .
the media generally find stories like these more interesting than devoting themselves to the analysis of fourth-division games .
rb leipzig as a model now , though , eastern german football has a new story to tempt the sports reporters : rb leipzig .
in 2009 austrian drinks manufacturer red bull acquired a license from the club ssv markranstaedt in saxony to compete in german football .
a new club , rb leipzig , was founded , replacing ssv in the fifth-division nofv-oberliga sued .
players were bought for the team , as was the license for leipzig central stadium , subsequently renamed the red bull arena .
at the end of its first season rb leipzig finished league champion and was immediately promoted to the regionalliga .
the new management 's goal is for the team to play in the bundesliga within 10 years .
since the start of the 2010 season , the red bull arena , the biggest stadium in the territory of the eastern states , has been rb leipzig 's home ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red bull has pumped money into leipzig but the project is far from popular among football fans in leipzig .
there have been huge protests and a lot of hostility from supporters of fc sachsen leipzig and 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig .
they 're worried about a decline in traditional fan culture and the commercialization of soccer in the region .
by contrast , though , a large part of the local population approves of red bull 's investment .
nofv president moldenhauer is also happy about it .
" in the past two decades we 've always criticized the fact that the big sponsors just are n't out there , " he says .
" so i 'm pleased that now , for the first time , we have a model for this kind of partnership here in eastern germany . "
moldenhauer believes that what is almost more important is the signal it sends out to regional football : " we badly need clubs here to act as beacons , " he says : to set high standards once again , and have a positive effect on eastern german football .
investing in young talent however , moldenhauer admits that the rb leipzig model is an exception rather than a panacea : " the clubs here must keep working on what they already have going for them , which is the fantastic work they do with young players . "
in the past , eastern clubs were more or less forced to develop young local talent because they could n't afford to buy in players from elsewhere .
in addition to the work done by the clubs , the controversial east german sports schools -lrb- kjs -rrb- have now been transformed into modern football academies , and talented local children have profited from them .
the german football association has also invested - albeit not yet enough - in eastern german football : eight of its 36 elite sports schools are now located in the east .
bildunterschrift : adler left his home team leipzig to play for leverkusen but what happens if a club ca n't persuade its own up-and-coming footballers to stay , simply because it is n't able to offer them much of a future ?
german national team goalkeeper rene adler plays not for his home club , vfb leipzig , but for bayer leverkusen - even though he 's often talks about how much leipzig means to him .
georg moldenhauer does n't think this will stop the eastern clubs from rising to the top of the tree once more .
" even if two out of every 10 good players move on , we 'll still have a good quota , " he says .
he points out that this problem does n't just affect eastern germany .
all over the world top players are keen to move to the top clubs .
moldenhauer cites the example of sami khedira : he did n't stay in stuttgart , but allowed himself to be seduced away by real madrid .
cautiously optimistic the nofv president believes that , in recent years , most clubs have improved their structures and have caught up with their western counterparts , particularly where management is concerned .
the lack of big sponsors and the money they bring remains a problem , but there 's not much the clubs can do about that .
in spite of their economic woes , some have been developing very positively for quite a while now - and they are not just the usual suspects .
moldenhauer singles out energie cottbus and erzgebirge aue .
" it 's astonishing what energie cottbus has achieved with the little it has at its disposal , " he says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 05.09.2010 surfers hit the waves in munich 's first summer of legal river surfing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's surfing spot is just a few meters away from the city 's busy streets riding waves in the middle of the city ?
a river in munich 's english garden has hosted surfers and curious spectators alike for 30 years .
although long forbidden , experienced surfers can now ride the waves legally . it 's a sight munich residents know well : up to 100 surfers daily hit the waves on a man-made river in the city 's english garden .
there , the icy water flows at a rate of 20 tons per second , and the temperature never gets above 15 degrees celsius -lrb- 60 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
up until this summer , surfing in the english garden was forbidden - at least officially .
" there were times when we really had problems with the police , " said 42-year-old veteran surfer carsten kurmis .
" we lost the joy of surfing because we 'd have to keep one eye on the wave and one eye on the street in case an officer came . "
calls to better enforce the surfing ban increased in 2007 after an australian student drowned while swimming in the river .
swimming is technically still forbidden , but munich 's mayor christian ude personally intervened to make sure qualified surfers could still ride the waves .
now around 200 experienced river riders have registered for access to the city 's so-called eisbach , or " icy brook . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surfer carsten kurmis loves to hit the water all year , day and night on the eisbach year-round munich 's environment secretary joachim lorenz explained just why the city intervened to make the eisbach available to surfers .
" it adds to the image of the city .
we 're a cosmopolitan city that loves sports , and we 're proud to have what is probably the world 's largest urban surfing spot , " lorenz said .
carsten kurmis sees the issue more personally .
he began surfing on a cold november day 24 years ago .
since then , he has surfed nearly every day and sometimes at night - even in winter , when the water temperature drops to around 4 degrees celsius .
" it 's partly the sports aspect , but it 's also a way to shut out the everyday .
for an hour , you can say : i 'm in another world , " kurmis explained .
" you 're only 10 meters -lrb- 33 feet -rrb- away from a major freeway , but you 're in nature and in this completely different setting . "
the waves of the future kurmis is n't the only one who was glad about the city 's move .
a group called surfing in munich spent three years trying to prevent surfers from being blocked from the eisbach .
the group raised awareness about plans to better enforce the surfing ban and collected signatures against it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : offermanns pays tribute to mayor ude 's engagement with a gift " that used to be almost like a secret society with almost no newcomers , but now the circle of people who surf the eisbach has grown , " said surfing in munich speaker petra offermanns .
but with increased interest comes increased responsibility , as the 2007 drowning showed .
munich 's river surfers look out for each other and prevent the inexperienced from getting in over their heads .
" for beginners , it 's simply too dangerous , so the surfers keep anyone who does n't have much practice out of the water , " offermanns said .
her group is also trying to get authorization for two other surfing spots in the city - one for beginners and one for experts - especially now that more and more people are heading to the eisbach in hopes of trying out the waves .
" it used to be that you could surf alone at night , but now there are people there day and night .
when there are 25 to 30 people waiting to surf on both sides , it takes so long to get in the water that it 's not fun , " said offermanns .
until then , surfers will have to endure long lines in munich , but onlookers can look forward to a steady stream of talent .

opposition parties and environmentalists are firmly against the changes . germany 's coalition government has agreed to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear power stations . " there will be a staggered extension of the lifespans , " press agency reuters reported an unnamed government official as saying on sunday evening . the official said plants would fall into two separate groups , based on the year that they were built , to determine their closure dates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters rallied against nuclear power outside the talks according to the german news agency dpa , the planned changes would mean that newer reactors built after 1980 would stay open for 14 years longer than originally planned under the government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder . older plants would be kept open for an additional eight years .
environment minister norbert roettgen and economy minister rainer bruederle confirmed later on sunday evening that the extension had been agreed upon . the coalition also agreed to an annual 2.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- tax on energy suppliers who use nuclear fuel rods to generate power .
however , the tax will be limited to a six-year period following objections from industry bosses . the negotiations , which lasted 10 hours , came amid a long-running row about extending the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants . hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside the chancellery where german chancellor angela merkel was meeting with fellow coalition leaders guido westerwelle of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of bavaria 's christian social union , along with other parliamentary leaders .
demanding an end to nuclear power , some of the demonstrators carried banners saying , " nuclear power : only the risk is secured . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with differences on nuclear policy within her own party sunday 's meeting focused on granting the country 's nuclear power plants an extra 10 to 15 years of production time and to decide on a levy for the utility companies ' expected additional profits .
schroeder 's government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 .
merkel wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
she has called the extension a " bridge . "
opposition vows to resist plans a government-commissioned report last week said without nuclear power , germany can forget its target of reducing co2 emissions by 80 percent of 1990 levels in 2050 .
the opposition and environmental groups have criticized the report as proof of merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- caving in to the country 's powerful nuclear lobby .
" the german government is reviving one of the biggest social conflicts in germany for no reason , " sigmar gabriel , head of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said on the sidelines of the anti-nuclear power demonstration in berlin on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current closure dates were agreed by the schroeder government surveys show that most germans favour an end to nuclear power generation .
germany has 17 active nuclear reactors , which account for 22.6 percent of the electricity generated in the country .
settling of differences roettgen , from the cdu , said last week he wanted to limit the extension to eight years .
bruederle , from the pro-business fdp , favored an extension of up to 20 years .
the center-right coalition no longer has a majority in the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , so ratification of the proposals would be difficult .
the coalition has hinted at the solution of bypassing the bundesrat entirely , prompting anger from state governments which are represented in the house .

no such party exists ; sarrazin is a member of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and intends to remain there - despite recent moves by the spd to evict him .
however , just over 18 percent of germans polled said they would vote for a party led by sarrazin , according to the survey published in the mass-circulated bild am sonntag newspaper .
sarrazin , a board member in germany 's central bank , sparked a furious debate when he said that muslim immigrants in germany were failing to integrate , had too many children and achieved poor levels of education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' germany does away with itself ' is topping best-seller lists the 65-year-old banker sparked widepread anger by saying the causes were not just social , but genetic .
his book , germany does away with itself , argues that intelligence is largely inherited , and that muslim immigrants were bringing down german standards .
book hugely popular according to the bild survey , sarrazin 's views found the greatest support amongst followers of the radical left party , but also resonated with voters of the current center-right coalition .
" for them , sarrazin is somebody who is finally saying what many are thinking , " said the head of pollsters emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner .
demand has surged for sarrazin 's book , which has topped the bestseller list on bookseller amazon 's german website since its publication a week ago .
book tour dates are sold out across the country .
" the rush is unbelievable , " said marion boesker in the munich literature house , a venue where sarrazin is scheduled to appear .
she added that people were worried that sarrazin 's visit could be cancelled .
" the audience does n't want censorship .
they want to talk about the things that are affecting them , " boesker added .
sarrazin calls criticism ' political show trial ' sarrazin 's spd , meanwhile , has initiated procedures to evict him from the party , while the central bank has asked president christian wulff to approve his dismissal from the bank 's board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans think sarrazin should ' shut up ' sarrazin has threatened to go to court to prevent his dismissal from the bundesbank .
in extracts from an interview with the news weekly focus , released ahead of publication on monday , sarrazin likened the wave of criticism of him against him to a " political show trial . "
he said if german president christian wulff approved his sacking in the next few days , the decision would be overturned by the justice system .
" the president will have to consider carefully whether he wants to see this political show trial to its end , and then see -lrb- his decision -rrb- thrown out by the courts , " sarrazin said .
rules designed to protect the bundesbank 's independence mean the german president 's approval must be sought for the dismissal of a board member - something that has never happened since the institution was founded over 50 years ago .

no such party exists ; sarrazin is a member of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and intends to remain there - despite recent moves by the spd to evict him .
however , just over 18 percent of germans polled said they would vote for a party led by sarrazin , according to the survey published in the mass-circulated bild am sonntag newspaper .
sarrazin , a board member in germany 's central bank , sparked a furious debate when he said that muslim immigrants in germany were failing to integrate , had too many children and achieved poor levels of education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' germany does away with itself ' is topping best-seller lists the 65-year-old banker sparked widepread anger by saying the causes were not just social , but genetic .
his book , germany does away with itself , argues that intelligence is largely inherited , and that muslim immigrants were bringing down german standards .
book hugely popular according to the bild survey , sarrazin 's views found the greatest support amongst followers of the radical left party , but also resonated with voters of the current center-right coalition .
" for them , sarrazin is somebody who is finally saying what many are thinking , " said the head of pollsters emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner .
demand has surged for sarrazin 's book , which has topped the bestseller list on bookseller amazon 's german website since its publication a week ago .
book tour dates are sold out across the country .
" the rush is unbelievable , " said marion boesker in the munich literature house , a venue where sarrazin is scheduled to appear .
she added that people were worried that sarrazin 's visit could be cancelled .
" the audience does n't want censorship .
they want to talk about the things that are affecting them , " boesker added .
sarrazin calls criticism ' political show trial ' sarrazin 's spd , meanwhile , has initiated procedures to evict him from the party , while the central bank has asked president christian wulff to approve his dismissal from the bank 's board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans think sarrazin should ' shut up ' sarrazin has threatened to go to court to prevent his dismissal from the bundesbank .
in extracts from an interview with the news weekly focus , released ahead of publication on monday , sarrazin likened the wave of criticism of him against him to a " political show trial . "
he said if german president christian wulff approved his sacking in the next few days , the decision would be overturned by the justice system .
" the president will have to consider carefully whether he wants to see this political show trial to its end , and then see -lrb- his decision -rrb- thrown out by the courts , " sarrazin said .
rules designed to protect the bundesbank 's independence mean the german president 's approval must be sought for the dismissal of a board member - something that has never happened since the institution was founded over 50 years ago .

world water week , which has run since 1991 , will award this year 's stockholm water prize to cholera researcher rita colwell . the 20th annual world water week conference focuses on how to better help the 884 million people worldwide who do not have access to clean drinking water . " driven by demographic change and economic growth , water is increasingly withdrawn , used , reused , treated , and disposed of , " organizers cautioned in their introduction to this year 's conference . " urbanization , agriculture , industry and climate change exert mounting pressure on both the quantity and quality of our water resources , " they added in a statement on the conference website . it is expected that more than 2,500 experts , decision-makers and business innovators will attend the event to discuss the escalating global water crisis . in the build-up to this year 's event , unicef , the united nations children 's fund , has drawn particular attention to the 1.5 million children who die each year from diseases related to contaminated water and poor hygiene . the stockholm water prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to clean water is essential for tackling world poverty , says the siwi the symposium in the swedish capital is put together by the stockholm water institute -lrb- siwi -rrb- , the organization which also awards an annual prize worth $ 150,000 -lrb- 116,000 euros -rrb- to recognize achievements in water science , water management , action or awareness building . the recipient of the 2010 stockholm water prize is the us researcher rita colwell , known for her work on infectious waterborne diseases like cholera . colwell has been praised for her " pioneering research " which identified that the cholera bacteria could survive by attaching to zooplankton in rivers , lakes and oceans .
it was previously thought that cholera could break out only due to release of sewage , but scientists now know that certain changes in the natural environment can also spread the disease . cholera is estimated to cause some 120,000 deaths each year and infects 3 to 5 million people .
siwi said colwell 's work had " helped protect the health and lives of millions . " the water crisis academics and water and sanitation ngos argue that access to water is central to alleviating poverty , improving worldwide health standards and security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 884 million people worldwide do not have access to clean drinking water speaking at the united nations ' high-level interactive dialogue on water last march , deputy secretary-general asha rose-migiro said " access to clean water and adequate sanitation are a pre-requisite for lifting people out of poverty . " the un has been accused of marginalizing water and sanitation issues in its millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- aimed at improving the lives of billions in the developing world . anders berntell from siwi told the inter press news agency that water has not received proper attention , yet is integral to fulfilling mdgs such as reducing extreme poverty and hunger by 50 percent by 2015 . " without water , we can never fight hunger ; without toilets in schools , girls will continue to drop out before finalizing their education ; and without adequate sanitation and hygiene , diseases will continue to spread , " berntell said .
the world water week conference runs until september 11 .

" urbanization , agriculture , industry and climate change exert mounting pressure on both the quantity and quality of our water resources , " they added in a statement on the conference website . it is expected that more than 2,500 experts , decision-makers and business innovators will attend the event to discuss the escalating global water crisis . in the build-up to this year 's event , unicef , the united nations children 's fund , has drawn particular attention to the 1.5 million children who die each year from diseases related to contaminated water and poor hygiene . the stockholm water prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to clean water is essential for tackling world poverty , says the siwi the symposium in the swedish capital is put together by the stockholm water institute -lrb- siwi -rrb- , the organization which also awards an annual prize worth $ 150,000 -lrb- 116,000 euros -rrb- to recognize achievements in water science , water management , action or awareness building . the recipient of the 2010 stockholm water prize is the us researcher rita colwell , known for her work on infectious waterborne diseases like cholera . colwell has been praised for her " pioneering research " which identified that the cholera bacteria could survive by attaching to zooplankton in rivers , lakes and oceans .
it was previously thought that cholera could break out only due to release of sewage , but scientists now know that certain changes in the natural environment can also spread the disease . cholera is estimated to cause some 120,000 deaths each year and infects 3 to 5 million people .
siwi said colwell 's work had " helped protect the health and lives of millions . " the water crisis academics and water and sanitation ngos argue that access to water is central to alleviating poverty , improving worldwide health standards and security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 884 million people worldwide do not have access to clean drinking water speaking at the united nations ' high-level interactive dialogue on water last march , deputy secretary-general asha rose-migiro said " access to clean water and adequate sanitation are a pre-requisite for lifting people out of poverty . " the un has been accused of marginalizing water and sanitation issues in its millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- aimed at improving the lives of billions in the developing world . anders berntell from siwi told the inter press news agency that water has not received proper attention , yet is integral to fulfilling mdgs such as reducing extreme poverty and hunger by 50 percent by 2015 . " without water , we can never fight hunger ; without toilets in schools , girls will continue to drop out before finalizing their education ; and without adequate sanitation and hygiene , diseases will continue to spread , " berntell said .

the man , identified as ahmad s , reportedly has ties to the taiba mosque in hamburg where the perpetrators of the september 11 attacks met .
german authorities closed the mosque last month .
the spiegel report says ahmad s made the statement under interrogation by the us military at bagram military prison .
the 36 year-old suspect from hamburg is alleged to be a member of the " islamist movement of uzbekistan , " according to the report .
the group is affiliated with the taliban and has instigated attacks on pakistani security forces and nato troops in afghanistan .
german media are reporting that ahmad s was apprehended at the beginning of july .
the german foreign ministry has only confirmed it was involved in providing consular assistance for a man held by the united states in afghanistan .
spiegel said he flew with his wife , a brother and another married couple to pershawar via the gulf state of qatar before heading to the afghan-pakistan border .

" this is a big problem and we can talk about it openly , without arousing suspicions of xenophobia , " merkel said in the interview published on sunday , september 5 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is more work to do on subject of immigration , says merkel but merkel warned against automatically linking certain religions with violence .

she said one solution would be to hire more civil servants with a foreign background . " it would surely help if we had more migrants in the police , youth welfare offices and other authorities , " she said . sarrazin debate her comments came after germany 's central bank voted on thursday to sack its controversial member thilo sarrazin , who sparked outrage and debate with claims in his new book that muslim immigrants are lowering german intelligence and harming society more than they contributed to it .

in extracts from an interview with the news weekly focus , released ahead of monday 's publication , sarrazin likened a wave of criticism of him to a " political show trial . "

" this is a big problem and we can talk about it openly , without arousing suspicions of xenophobia , " merkel said in the interview published on sunday , september 5 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is more work to do on subject of immigration , says merkel but merkel warned against automatically linking certain religions with violence . " this is misleading , " she said .
" violence among young people is often a sign that they see no perspective for themselves .
all that helps is education , education , education . " " our state is making many offers , but the main responsibility lies with the parents , and can not be taken on by schools or the state , " merkel added . merkel said it was crucial to maintain law and order in violent city districts with high migrant populations .
she said one solution would be to hire more civil servants with a foreign background . " it would surely help if we had more migrants in the police , youth welfare offices and other authorities , " she said . sarrazin debate her comments came after germany 's central bank voted on thursday to sack its controversial member thilo sarrazin , who sparked outrage and debate with claims in his new book that muslim immigrants are lowering german intelligence and harming society more than they contributed to it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book has caused an uproar in germany sarrazin , a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- received partial backing from party leader sigmar gabriel , who said there was an element of truth in his book , entitled " germany abolishes itself . "
" i think we are experiencing much of what he is describing in -lrb- the book -rrb- .
there is no question , " gabriel said .
he did not , however , share sarrazin 's thesis that muslim integration problems resulted from genetic predispositions .
the spd has initiated procedures to evict sarrazin from the party , while the central bank has asked president christian wulff to approve his dismissal from the bank 's board .
the german government 's official in charge of integration , maria boehmer , acknowledged that there were problems in conveying immigration policy .
" the gap between the population and politics concerns me , " boehmer told focus magazine .
reaction to the thilo sarrazin case shows " that we have to take the offensive and talk about problems and successes of -lrb- our -rrb- integration policy " .

opposition parties and environmentalists are firmly against the changes . germany 's coalition government has agreed to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear power stations . " there will be a staggered extension of the lifespans , " press agency reuters reported an unnamed government official as saying on sunday evening . the official said plants would fall into two separate groups , based on the year that they were built , to determine their closure dates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters rallied against nuclear power outside the talks according to the german news agency dpa , the planned changes would mean that newer reactors built after 1980 would stay open for 14 years longer than originally planned under the government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder . older plants would be kept open for an additional eight years .
environment minister norbert roettgen and economy minister rainer bruederle confirmed later on sunday evening that the extension had been agreed upon . the coalition also agreed to an annual 2.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- tax on energy suppliers who use nuclear fuel rods to generate power .
however , the tax will be limited to a six-year period following objections from industry bosses . the negotiations , which lasted 10 hours , came amid a long-running row about extending the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants . hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside the chancellery where german chancellor angela merkel was meeting with fellow coalition leaders guido westerwelle of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of bavaria 's christian social union , along with other parliamentary leaders .
demanding an end to nuclear power , some of the demonstrators carried banners saying , " nuclear power : only the risk is secured . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with differences on nuclear policy within her own party sunday 's meeting focused on granting the country 's nuclear power plants an extra 10 to 15 years of production time and to decide on a levy for the utility companies ' expected additional profits .
schroeder 's government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 .
merkel wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
she has called the extension a " bridge . "
opposition vows to resist plans a government-commissioned report last week said without nuclear power , germany can forget its target of reducing co2 emissions by 80 percent of 1990 levels in 2050 .
the opposition and environmental groups have criticized the report as proof of merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- caving in to the country 's powerful nuclear lobby .
" the german government is reviving one of the biggest social conflicts in germany for no reason , " sigmar gabriel , head of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said on the sidelines of the anti-nuclear power demonstration in berlin on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current closure dates were agreed by the schroeder government surveys show that most germans favour an end to nuclear power generation .
germany has 17 active nuclear reactors , which account for 22.6 percent of the electricity generated in the country .
settling of differences roettgen , from the cdu , said last week he wanted to limit the extension to eight years .
bruederle , from the pro-business fdp , favored an extension of up to 20 years .
the center-right coalition no longer has a majority in the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , so ratification of the proposals would be difficult .
the coalition has hinted at the solution of bypassing the bundesrat entirely , prompting anger from state governments which are represented in the house .

opposition parties and environmentalists are firmly against the changes . germany 's coalition government has agreed to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear power stations . " there will be a staggered extension of the lifespans , " press agency reuters reported an unnamed government official as saying on sunday evening . the official said plants would fall into two separate groups , based on the year that they were built , to determine their closure dates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters rallied against nuclear power outside the talks according to the german news agency dpa , the planned changes would mean that newer reactors built after 1980 would stay open for 14 years longer than originally planned under the government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder . older plants would be kept open for an additional eight years .
environment minister norbert roettgen and economy minister rainer bruederle confirmed later on sunday evening that the extension had been agreed upon . the coalition also agreed to an annual 2.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- tax on energy suppliers who use nuclear fuel rods to generate power .
however , the tax will be limited to a six-year period following objections from industry bosses . the negotiations , which lasted 10 hours , came amid a long-running row about extending the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants . hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside the chancellery where german chancellor angela merkel was meeting with fellow coalition leaders guido westerwelle of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of bavaria 's christian social union , along with other parliamentary leaders .
demanding an end to nuclear power , some of the demonstrators carried banners saying , " nuclear power : only the risk is secured . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with differences on nuclear policy within her own party sunday 's meeting focused on granting the country 's nuclear power plants an extra 10 to 15 years of production time and to decide on a levy for the utility companies ' expected additional profits .
schroeder 's government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 .
merkel wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
she has called the extension a " bridge . "
opposition vows to resist plans a government-commissioned report last week said without nuclear power , germany can forget its target of reducing co2 emissions by 80 percent of 1990 levels in 2050 .
the opposition and environmental groups have criticized the report as proof of merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- caving in to the country 's powerful nuclear lobby .
" the german government is reviving one of the biggest social conflicts in germany for no reason , " sigmar gabriel , head of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said on the sidelines of the anti-nuclear power demonstration in berlin on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current closure dates were agreed by the schroeder government surveys show that most germans favour an end to nuclear power generation .
germany has 17 active nuclear reactors , which account for 22.6 percent of the electricity generated in the country .
settling of differences roettgen , from the cdu , said last week he wanted to limit the extension to eight years .
bruederle , from the pro-business fdp , favored an extension of up to 20 years .
the center-right coalition no longer has a majority in the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , so ratification of the proposals would be difficult .
the coalition has hinted at the solution of bypassing the bundesrat entirely , prompting anger from state governments which are represented in the house .

a river in munich 's english garden has hosted surfers and curious spectators alike for 30 years .
although long forbidden , experienced surfers can now ride the waves legally . it 's a sight munich residents know well : up to 100 surfers daily hit the waves on a man-made river in the city 's english garden .
there , the icy water flows at a rate of 20 tons per second , and the temperature never gets above 15 degrees celsius -lrb- 60 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
up until this summer , surfing in the english garden was forbidden - at least officially .
" there were times when we really had problems with the police , " said 42-year-old veteran surfer carsten kurmis .
" we lost the joy of surfing because we 'd have to keep one eye on the wave and one eye on the street in case an officer came . "
calls to better enforce the surfing ban increased in 2007 after an australian student drowned while swimming in the river .
swimming is technically still forbidden , but munich 's mayor christian ude personally intervened to make sure qualified surfers could still ride the waves .
now around 200 experienced river riders have registered for access to the city 's so-called eisbach , or " icy brook . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surfer carsten kurmis loves to hit the water all year , day and night on the eisbach year-round munich 's environment secretary joachim lorenz explained just why the city intervened to make the eisbach available to surfers .
" it adds to the image of the city .
we 're a cosmopolitan city that loves sports , and we 're proud to have what is probably the world 's largest urban surfing spot , " lorenz said .
carsten kurmis sees the issue more personally .
he began surfing on a cold november day 24 years ago .
since then , he has surfed nearly every day and sometimes at night - even in winter , when the water temperature drops to around 4 degrees celsius .
" it 's partly the sports aspect , but it 's also a way to shut out the everyday .
for an hour , you can say : i 'm in another world , " kurmis explained .
" you 're only 10 meters -lrb- 33 feet -rrb- away from a major freeway , but you 're in nature and in this completely different setting . "
the waves of the future kurmis is n't the only one who was glad about the city 's move .
a group called surfing in munich spent three years trying to prevent surfers from being blocked from the eisbach .
the group raised awareness about plans to better enforce the surfing ban and collected signatures against it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : offermanns pays tribute to mayor ude 's engagement with a gift " that used to be almost like a secret society with almost no newcomers , but now the circle of people who surf the eisbach has grown , " said surfing in munich speaker petra offermanns .
but with increased interest comes increased responsibility , as the 2007 drowning showed .
munich 's river surfers look out for each other and prevent the inexperienced from getting in over their heads .
" for beginners , it 's simply too dangerous , so the surfers keep anyone who does n't have much practice out of the water , " offermanns said .
her group is also trying to get authorization for two other surfing spots in the city - one for beginners and one for experts - especially now that more and more people are heading to the eisbach in hopes of trying out the waves .
" it used to be that you could surf alone at night , but now there are people there day and night .
when there are 25 to 30 people waiting to surf on both sides , it takes so long to get in the water that it 's not fun , " said offermanns .
until then , surfers will have to endure long lines in munich , but onlookers can look forward to a steady stream of talent .

" there were times when we really had problems with the police , " said 42-year-old veteran surfer carsten kurmis .
" we lost the joy of surfing because we 'd have to keep one eye on the wave and one eye on the street in case an officer came . "
calls to better enforce the surfing ban increased in 2007 after an australian student drowned while swimming in the river .
swimming is technically still forbidden , but munich 's mayor christian ude personally intervened to make sure qualified surfers could still ride the waves .
now around 200 experienced river riders have registered for access to the city 's so-called eisbach , or " icy brook . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surfer carsten kurmis loves to hit the water all year , day and night on the eisbach year-round munich 's environment secretary joachim lorenz explained just why the city intervened to make the eisbach available to surfers .
" it adds to the image of the city .
we 're a cosmopolitan city that loves sports , and we 're proud to have what is probably the world 's largest urban surfing spot , " lorenz said .
carsten kurmis sees the issue more personally .
he began surfing on a cold november day 24 years ago .
since then , he has surfed nearly every day and sometimes at night - even in winter , when the water temperature drops to around 4 degrees celsius .
" it 's partly the sports aspect , but it 's also a way to shut out the everyday .
for an hour , you can say : i 'm in another world , " kurmis explained .
" you 're only 10 meters -lrb- 33 feet -rrb- away from a major freeway , but you 're in nature and in this completely different setting . "
the waves of the future kurmis is n't the only one who was glad about the city 's move .
a group called surfing in munich spent three years trying to prevent surfers from being blocked from the eisbach .
the group raised awareness about plans to better enforce the surfing ban and collected signatures against it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : offermanns pays tribute to mayor ude 's engagement with a gift " that used to be almost like a secret society with almost no newcomers , but now the circle of people who surf the eisbach has grown , " said surfing in munich speaker petra offermanns .
but with increased interest comes increased responsibility , as the 2007 drowning showed .
munich 's river surfers look out for each other and prevent the inexperienced from getting in over their heads .
" for beginners , it 's simply too dangerous , so the surfers keep anyone who does n't have much practice out of the water , " offermanns said .
her group is also trying to get authorization for two other surfing spots in the city - one for beginners and one for experts - especially now that more and more people are heading to the eisbach in hopes of trying out the waves .
" it used to be that you could surf alone at night , but now there are people there day and night .
when there are 25 to 30 people waiting to surf on both sides , it takes so long to get in the water that it 's not fun , " said offermanns .
until then , surfers will have to endure long lines in munich , but onlookers can look forward to a steady stream of talent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : wikileaks disclosures wikileaks exposes shell 's infiltration of nigeria 's government opinion : wikileaks is a test of us commitment to free press wikileaks cables show consistent us foreign policy , say experts wikileaks release could lead to shift from transparency to secrecy crime -pipe- 05.09.2010 europe , us take different approaches to whistle-blowing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks has stirred up a debate over whistle-blowing the ongoing wrangling over the methods of wikileaks has led to a broader debate about whistle-blowing .
while it has been an accepted practice in the united states for a long time , that 's not the case in europe . when germans want to talk about whistle-blowing they quickly run into a linguistic problem : there is no german word for it .
in order to describe a whistle-blower in their own language germans have to resort to a negatively connotated word like informant or paraphrase it some other way .
that 's why germans often simply use the english word to talk about whistle-blowing .
the lack of a proper name for the practice is indicative of the role and acceptance of whistle-blowing in germany .
" in germany there are no laws to protect whistle-blowers or to serve as an incentive for whistle-blowing , " johannes ludwig , a professor at hamburg 's university of applied sciences and a board member of germany 's whistle-blower netzwerk , told deutsche welle .
" in the us there is both . "
the reasons why whistle-blowing plays a much smaller role in germany than in the us are historical and also shaped by mentality , argues ludwig .
the us was founded by people that did n't want to acccept the traditional hierarchical structures in europe .
" and that 's why in the us everything that has to do with the state and government has to work effectively and serve a clear purpose .
the americans have a much looser understanding of government and state and their relation to government and business is much less bureacratic and authority-driven than ours . "
what 's more , argues ludwig , democracy in germany , even compared to other european countries has a relatively short history .
" and that 's why it is understandable that rules or laws about whistle-blowing which actually only serves the purpose to improve things , are not as developed in germany as they are in other countries . "
protecting whistle-blowers since the civil war by comparison , the first legal incentive for whistle-blowing in the us dates back to the civil war .
the false claims act , which was passed by congress in 1863 , was a reaction by the federal government to deal with fraud .
basically it promised a reward to whistle-blowers who could prove that the government was being defrauded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enron scandal led to a further tightening of whistle-blower laws with some minor changes that law is still in effect today and remains an important factor in recognizing fraud , says alexander dyck , a finance professor and whistle-blowing expert at the rotman school of management at the university of toronto .
" if someone brings information to light through whistle-blowing action and the government is being defrauded and the action is successfully pursued than that whistle-blower is entitled to between 15 and 30 percent of the money the government collects as a result of stopping this wrongdoing , " he told deutsche wellle .
tightening whistle-blower protection through sarbanes-oxley more recently , the us government improved protection for whistle-blowers through the so-called sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 as a reaction to the enron and other corporate scandals .
it also opened up the false claims act to private corporations .
" corporations effectively have to have a whistle-blowing policy , have to set up a hotline , whereby if there are employees or others in the firm who think there is some wrongdoing , you can make the phone calls and allegations and that information is then communicated to folks within the firm that then follow up on this , " explains dyck .
the purpose of all those and additional measures that were instituted in march is to provide incentives for whistle-blowers to speak up about wrongdoings they know about and to protect them as much as possible from retribution for doing it .
less stringent laws , more formal channels in europe in europe , not just in germany , many of these mechanisms simply do n't exist yet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major us companies are required to have instituted protections for whistle-blowers " one possible reason for less whistle-blowing in europe is that many of the activities that whistle-blowing might bring to light would n't be illegal in many european countries , says dyck .
" some things of corporate wrongdoing would be illegal in the us , but would not be illegal in europe , so whistle-blowing on them would n't be very effective . "
however , dyck also offers a more positive explanation of why whistle-blowing is less of a phenomenon in europe than in the us : " there are more formal channels in europe for employees who are concerned about wrongdoing to bring that information to light without going through a whistle-blowing channel , " he notes . " the existence of works councils , worker representatives on boards provide another channel for that sort of information to perculate up to the highest level of decision making that would n't require going through a formal whistle-blowing channel . "
while it might take some time until european countries institute an office of the whistle-blower protection program like it exists within the us department of labor , the experts agree that europe needs to provide more incentives for whistle-blowers to speak out if it wants to get serious about improving corporate governance both in the business and governmental sector .

sure , back in the 1970s there 's no lack of soccer talent in the east of germany - but the money is n't there to support it .
this season not a single eastern german team is in the top flight , the bundesliga . managers of eastern german football clubs may be forgiven for hankering after the good old days .
under the communist east german government they did n't have to spend their time chasing sponsors , dealing with tax returns or worrying about revenue .
most importantly , though , east german clubs were real contenders back in the day .
fc magdeburg won the european cup winners ' cup in 1974 .
that same year , the east german team defeated west germany during the fifa world cup .
clubs like dynamo dresden or 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig were playing at the top of their game .
twenty years after unification , these same clubs are now languishing in the lower divisions of the league tables .
they 're lucky to attract a crowd of a thousand to watch them play , and with every annual review they fear for their licenses .
not a single club from the east is in germany 's top division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german teams have n't always been bad at soccer there wo n't even be any bundesliga games in reunified berlin this season - after 13 years , hertha bsc , in the old days a west german team , was relegated back in may , following a dismal campaign .
three eastern german clubs will be playing alongside hertha in the second division , and there are another five in the third .
hans-georg moldenhauer , president of the north-eastern german football association -lrb- nofv -rrb- admits that " the current situation of professional football in eastern germany is far from satisfactory . "
so how did it come to this sad state of affairs ?
wherever you go , the answer is the same : not enough sponsors , not enough money , and a history of poor management .
the amalgamation of east and west german soccer into one unified german competitive group in 1991 was too much of a challenge for the east german clubs ; they simply were n't able to make the leap from socialism to capitalism in the space of just a few months .
" all of a sudden we got no state subsidies any more , and we had no idea how to run a market-based operation , " said detlef krauspe , the former boss of sachsen leipzig .
the best players , like andreas thom , ulf kirsten , and later michael ballack , moved to the rich clubs in the west .
the former east had no private companies that could have invested money in the teams .
vicious circle there are some such companies today , but most of them are only small or medium-sized businesses with very little money for sports sponsorship .
" the eastern german clubs have lots of small sponsors that do n't provide that much in the way of finance , and do n't offer long-term partnerships , " says nofv president moldenhauer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german clubs generally only make news when fans make trouble the clubs are therefore hardly ever in a position to make major investments .
in order to attract big companies as sponsorship partners - like the deal bayern munich has secured with deutsche telekom - the eastern german clubs would have to be much more successful than they are at present .
they would also have to acquire a more positive image .
the image of eastern german soccer has suffered badly in recent years .
media reports have focused not on victories but increasingly on hooliganism , riots and racist attacks , both inside and outside the stadiums .
georg moldenhauer says it 's unfair .
" this is n't an eastern german problem , and it 's not football 's problem either - it 's a problem for all of society , " he says .
the media generally find stories like these more interesting than devoting themselves to the analysis of fourth-division games .
rb leipzig as a model now , though , eastern german football has a new story to tempt the sports reporters : rb leipzig .
in 2009 austrian drinks manufacturer red bull acquired a license from the club ssv markranstaedt in saxony to compete in german football .
a new club , rb leipzig , was founded , replacing ssv in the fifth-division nofv-oberliga sued .
players were bought for the team , as was the license for leipzig central stadium , subsequently renamed the red bull arena .
at the end of its first season rb leipzig finished league champion and was immediately promoted to the regionalliga .
the new management 's goal is for the team to play in the bundesliga within 10 years .
since the start of the 2010 season , the red bull arena , the biggest stadium in the territory of the eastern states , has been rb leipzig 's home ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red bull has pumped money into leipzig but the project is far from popular among football fans in leipzig .
there have been huge protests and a lot of hostility from supporters of fc sachsen leipzig and 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig .
they 're worried about a decline in traditional fan culture and the commercialization of soccer in the region .
by contrast , though , a large part of the local population approves of red bull 's investment .
nofv president moldenhauer is also happy about it .
" in the past two decades we 've always criticized the fact that the big sponsors just are n't out there , " he says .
" so i 'm pleased that now , for the first time , we have a model for this kind of partnership here in eastern germany . "
moldenhauer believes that what is almost more important is the signal it sends out to regional football : " we badly need clubs here to act as beacons , " he says : to set high standards once again , and have a positive effect on eastern german football .
investing in young talent however , moldenhauer admits that the rb leipzig model is an exception rather than a panacea : " the clubs here must keep working on what they already have going for them , which is the fantastic work they do with young players . "
in the past , eastern clubs were more or less forced to develop young local talent because they could n't afford to buy in players from elsewhere .
in addition to the work done by the clubs , the controversial east german sports schools -lrb- kjs -rrb- have now been transformed into modern football academies , and talented local children have profited from them .
the german football association has also invested - albeit not yet enough - in eastern german football : eight of its 36 elite sports schools are now located in the east .
bildunterschrift : adler left his home team leipzig to play for leverkusen but what happens if a club ca n't persuade its own up-and-coming footballers to stay , simply because it is n't able to offer them much of a future ?
german national team goalkeeper rene adler plays not for his home club , vfb leipzig , but for bayer leverkusen - even though he 's often talks about how much leipzig means to him .
georg moldenhauer does n't think this will stop the eastern clubs from rising to the top of the tree once more .
" even if two out of every 10 good players move on , we 'll still have a good quota , " he says .
he points out that this problem does n't just affect eastern germany .
all over the world top players are keen to move to the top clubs .
moldenhauer cites the example of sami khedira : he did n't stay in stuttgart , but allowed himself to be seduced away by real madrid .
cautiously optimistic the nofv president believes that , in recent years , most clubs have improved their structures and have caught up with their western counterparts , particularly where management is concerned .
the lack of big sponsors and the money they bring remains a problem , but there 's not much the clubs can do about that .
in spite of their economic woes , some have been developing very positively for quite a while now - and they are not just the usual suspects .
moldenhauer singles out energie cottbus and erzgebirge aue .
" it 's astonishing what energie cottbus has achieved with the little it has at its disposal , " he says .

no such party exists ; sarrazin is a member of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and intends to remain there - despite recent moves by the spd to evict him .
however , just over 18 percent of germans polled said they would vote for a party led by sarrazin , according to the survey published in the mass-circulated bild am sonntag newspaper .
sarrazin , a board member in germany 's central bank , sparked a furious debate when he said that muslim immigrants in germany were failing to integrate , had too many children and achieved poor levels of education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' germany does away with itself ' is topping best-seller lists the 65-year-old banker sparked widepread anger by saying the causes were not just social , but genetic .
his book , germany does away with itself , argues that intelligence is largely inherited , and that muslim immigrants were bringing down german standards .
book hugely popular according to the bild survey , sarrazin 's views found the greatest support amongst followers of the radical left party , but also resonated with voters of the current center-right coalition .
" for them , sarrazin is somebody who is finally saying what many are thinking , " said the head of pollsters emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner .
demand has surged for sarrazin 's book , which has topped the bestseller list on bookseller amazon 's german website since its publication a week ago .
book tour dates are sold out across the country .
" the rush is unbelievable , " said marion boesker in the munich literature house , a venue where sarrazin is scheduled to appear .
she added that people were worried that sarrazin 's visit could be cancelled .
" the audience does n't want censorship .
they want to talk about the things that are affecting them , " boesker added .
sarrazin calls criticism ' political show trial ' sarrazin 's spd , meanwhile , has initiated procedures to evict him from the party , while the central bank has asked president christian wulff to approve his dismissal from the bank 's board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans think sarrazin should ' shut up ' sarrazin has threatened to go to court to prevent his dismissal from the bundesbank .
in extracts from an interview with the news weekly focus , released ahead of publication on monday , sarrazin likened the wave of criticism of him against him to a " political show trial . "
he said if german president christian wulff approved his sacking in the next few days , the decision would be overturned by the justice system .
" the president will have to consider carefully whether he wants to see this political show trial to its end , and then see -lrb- his decision -rrb- thrown out by the courts , " sarrazin said .
rules designed to protect the bundesbank 's independence mean the german president 's approval must be sought for the dismissal of a board member - something that has never happened since the institution was founded over 50 years ago .

world water week , which has run since 1991 , will award this year 's stockholm water prize to cholera researcher rita colwell . the 20th annual world water week conference focuses on how to better help the 884 million people worldwide who do not have access to clean drinking water . " driven by demographic change and economic growth , water is increasingly withdrawn , used , reused , treated , and disposed of , " organizers cautioned in their introduction to this year 's conference . " urbanization , agriculture , industry and climate change exert mounting pressure on both the quantity and quality of our water resources , " they added in a statement on the conference website . it is expected that more than 2,500 experts , decision-makers and business innovators will attend the event to discuss the escalating global water crisis . in the build-up to this year 's event , unicef , the united nations children 's fund , has drawn particular attention to the 1.5 million children who die each year from diseases related to contaminated water and poor hygiene . the stockholm water prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to clean water is essential for tackling world poverty , says the siwi the symposium in the swedish capital is put together by the stockholm water institute -lrb- siwi -rrb- , the organization which also awards an annual prize worth $ 150,000 -lrb- 116,000 euros -rrb- to recognize achievements in water science , water management , action or awareness building . the recipient of the 2010 stockholm water prize is the us researcher rita colwell , known for her work on infectious waterborne diseases like cholera . colwell has been praised for her " pioneering research " which identified that the cholera bacteria could survive by attaching to zooplankton in rivers , lakes and oceans .
it was previously thought that cholera could break out only due to release of sewage , but scientists now know that certain changes in the natural environment can also spread the disease . cholera is estimated to cause some 120,000 deaths each year and infects 3 to 5 million people .
siwi said colwell 's work had " helped protect the health and lives of millions . " the water crisis academics and water and sanitation ngos argue that access to water is central to alleviating poverty , improving worldwide health standards and security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 884 million people worldwide do not have access to clean drinking water speaking at the united nations ' high-level interactive dialogue on water last march , deputy secretary-general asha rose-migiro said " access to clean water and adequate sanitation are a pre-requisite for lifting people out of poverty . " the un has been accused of marginalizing water and sanitation issues in its millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- aimed at improving the lives of billions in the developing world . anders berntell from siwi told the inter press news agency that water has not received proper attention , yet is integral to fulfilling mdgs such as reducing extreme poverty and hunger by 50 percent by 2015 . " without water , we can never fight hunger ; without toilets in schools , girls will continue to drop out before finalizing their education ; and without adequate sanitation and hygiene , diseases will continue to spread , " berntell said .
the world water week conference runs until september 11 .

opposition parties and environmentalists are firmly against the changes . germany 's coalition government has agreed to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear power stations . " there will be a staggered extension of the lifespans , " press agency reuters reported an unnamed government official as saying on sunday evening . the official said plants would fall into two separate groups , based on the year that they were built , to determine their closure dates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters rallied against nuclear power outside the talks according to the german news agency dpa , the planned changes would mean that newer reactors built after 1980 would stay open for 14 years longer than originally planned under the government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder . older plants would be kept open for an additional eight years .
environment minister norbert roettgen and economy minister rainer bruederle confirmed later on sunday evening that the extension had been agreed upon . the coalition also agreed to an annual 2.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- tax on energy suppliers who use nuclear fuel rods to generate power .
however , the tax will be limited to a six-year period following objections from industry bosses . the negotiations , which lasted 10 hours , came amid a long-running row about extending the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants . hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside the chancellery where german chancellor angela merkel was meeting with fellow coalition leaders guido westerwelle of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of bavaria 's christian social union , along with other parliamentary leaders .
demanding an end to nuclear power , some of the demonstrators carried banners saying , " nuclear power : only the risk is secured . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with differences on nuclear policy within her own party sunday 's meeting focused on granting the country 's nuclear power plants an extra 10 to 15 years of production time and to decide on a levy for the utility companies ' expected additional profits .
schroeder 's government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 .
merkel wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
she has called the extension a " bridge . "
opposition vows to resist plans a government-commissioned report last week said without nuclear power , germany can forget its target of reducing co2 emissions by 80 percent of 1990 levels in 2050 .
the opposition and environmental groups have criticized the report as proof of merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- caving in to the country 's powerful nuclear lobby .
" the german government is reviving one of the biggest social conflicts in germany for no reason , " sigmar gabriel , head of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said on the sidelines of the anti-nuclear power demonstration in berlin on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current closure dates were agreed by the schroeder government surveys show that most germans favour an end to nuclear power generation .
germany has 17 active nuclear reactors , which account for 22.6 percent of the electricity generated in the country .
settling of differences roettgen , from the cdu , said last week he wanted to limit the extension to eight years .
bruederle , from the pro-business fdp , favored an extension of up to 20 years .
the center-right coalition no longer has a majority in the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , so ratification of the proposals would be difficult .
the coalition has hinted at the solution of bypassing the bundesrat entirely , prompting anger from state governments which are represented in the house .

sure , back in the 1970s there 's no lack of soccer talent in the east of germany - but the money is n't there to support it .
this season not a single eastern german team is in the top flight , the bundesliga . managers of eastern german football clubs may be forgiven for hankering after the good old days .
under the communist east german government they did n't have to spend their time chasing sponsors , dealing with tax returns or worrying about revenue .
most importantly , though , east german clubs were real contenders back in the day .
fc magdeburg won the european cup winners ' cup in 1974 .
that same year , the east german team defeated west germany during the fifa world cup .
clubs like dynamo dresden or 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig were playing at the top of their game .
twenty years after unification , these same clubs are now languishing in the lower divisions of the league tables .
they 're lucky to attract a crowd of a thousand to watch them play , and with every annual review they fear for their licenses .
not a single club from the east is in germany 's top division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german teams have n't always been bad at soccer there wo n't even be any bundesliga games in reunified berlin this season - after 13 years , hertha bsc , in the old days a west german team , was relegated back in may , following a dismal campaign .
three eastern german clubs will be playing alongside hertha in the second division , and there are another five in the third .
hans-georg moldenhauer , president of the north-eastern german football association -lrb- nofv -rrb- admits that " the current situation of professional football in eastern germany is far from satisfactory . "
so how did it come to this sad state of affairs ?
wherever you go , the answer is the same : not enough sponsors , not enough money , and a history of poor management .
the amalgamation of east and west german soccer into one unified german competitive group in 1991 was too much of a challenge for the east german clubs ; they simply were n't able to make the leap from socialism to capitalism in the space of just a few months .
" all of a sudden we got no state subsidies any more , and we had no idea how to run a market-based operation , " said detlef krauspe , the former boss of sachsen leipzig .
the best players , like andreas thom , ulf kirsten , and later michael ballack , moved to the rich clubs in the west .
the former east had no private companies that could have invested money in the teams .
vicious circle there are some such companies today , but most of them are only small or medium-sized businesses with very little money for sports sponsorship .
" the eastern german clubs have lots of small sponsors that do n't provide that much in the way of finance , and do n't offer long-term partnerships , " says nofv president moldenhauer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german clubs generally only make news when fans make trouble the clubs are therefore hardly ever in a position to make major investments .
in order to attract big companies as sponsorship partners - like the deal bayern munich has secured with deutsche telekom - the eastern german clubs would have to be much more successful than they are at present .
they would also have to acquire a more positive image .
the image of eastern german soccer has suffered badly in recent years .
media reports have focused not on victories but increasingly on hooliganism , riots and racist attacks , both inside and outside the stadiums .
georg moldenhauer says it 's unfair .
" this is n't an eastern german problem , and it 's not football 's problem either - it 's a problem for all of society , " he says .
the media generally find stories like these more interesting than devoting themselves to the analysis of fourth-division games .
rb leipzig as a model now , though , eastern german football has a new story to tempt the sports reporters : rb leipzig .
in 2009 austrian drinks manufacturer red bull acquired a license from the club ssv markranstaedt in saxony to compete in german football .
a new club , rb leipzig , was founded , replacing ssv in the fifth-division nofv-oberliga sued .
players were bought for the team , as was the license for leipzig central stadium , subsequently renamed the red bull arena .
at the end of its first season rb leipzig finished league champion and was immediately promoted to the regionalliga .
the new management 's goal is for the team to play in the bundesliga within 10 years .
since the start of the 2010 season , the red bull arena , the biggest stadium in the territory of the eastern states , has been rb leipzig 's home ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red bull has pumped money into leipzig but the project is far from popular among football fans in leipzig .
there have been huge protests and a lot of hostility from supporters of fc sachsen leipzig and 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig .
they 're worried about a decline in traditional fan culture and the commercialization of soccer in the region .
by contrast , though , a large part of the local population approves of red bull 's investment .
nofv president moldenhauer is also happy about it .
" in the past two decades we 've always criticized the fact that the big sponsors just are n't out there , " he says .
" so i 'm pleased that now , for the first time , we have a model for this kind of partnership here in eastern germany . "
moldenhauer believes that what is almost more important is the signal it sends out to regional football : " we badly need clubs here to act as beacons , " he says : to set high standards once again , and have a positive effect on eastern german football .
investing in young talent however , moldenhauer admits that the rb leipzig model is an exception rather than a panacea : " the clubs here must keep working on what they already have going for them , which is the fantastic work they do with young players . "
in the past , eastern clubs were more or less forced to develop young local talent because they could n't afford to buy in players from elsewhere .
in addition to the work done by the clubs , the controversial east german sports schools -lrb- kjs -rrb- have now been transformed into modern football academies , and talented local children have profited from them .
the german football association has also invested - albeit not yet enough - in eastern german football : eight of its 36 elite sports schools are now located in the east .
bildunterschrift : adler left his home team leipzig to play for leverkusen but what happens if a club ca n't persuade its own up-and-coming footballers to stay , simply because it is n't able to offer them much of a future ?
german national team goalkeeper rene adler plays not for his home club , vfb leipzig , but for bayer leverkusen - even though he 's often talks about how much leipzig means to him .
georg moldenhauer does n't think this will stop the eastern clubs from rising to the top of the tree once more .
" even if two out of every 10 good players move on , we 'll still have a good quota , " he says .
he points out that this problem does n't just affect eastern germany .
all over the world top players are keen to move to the top clubs .
moldenhauer cites the example of sami khedira : he did n't stay in stuttgart , but allowed himself to be seduced away by real madrid .
cautiously optimistic the nofv president believes that , in recent years , most clubs have improved their structures and have caught up with their western counterparts , particularly where management is concerned .
the lack of big sponsors and the money they bring remains a problem , but there 's not much the clubs can do about that .
in spite of their economic woes , some have been developing very positively for quite a while now - and they are not just the usual suspects .
moldenhauer singles out energie cottbus and erzgebirge aue .
" it 's astonishing what energie cottbus has achieved with the little it has at its disposal , " he says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 05.09.2010 german government decides to extend lifespan of nuclear plants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's reactors were due to be closed down by 2021 german chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has decided to extend the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants .
opposition parties and environmentalists are firmly against the changes . germany 's coalition government has agreed to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear power stations . " there will be a staggered extension of the lifespans , " press agency reuters reported an unnamed government official as saying on sunday evening . the official said plants would fall into two separate groups , based on the year that they were built , to determine their closure dates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters rallied against nuclear power outside the talks according to the german news agency dpa , the planned changes would mean that newer reactors built after 1980 would stay open for 14 years longer than originally planned under the government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder . older plants would be kept open for an additional eight years .
environment minister norbert roettgen and economy minister rainer bruederle confirmed later on sunday evening that the extension had been agreed upon . the coalition also agreed to an annual 2.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- tax on energy suppliers who use nuclear fuel rods to generate power .
however , the tax will be limited to a six-year period following objections from industry bosses . the negotiations , which lasted 10 hours , came amid a long-running row about extending the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants . hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside the chancellery where german chancellor angela merkel was meeting with fellow coalition leaders guido westerwelle of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of bavaria 's christian social union , along with other parliamentary leaders .
demanding an end to nuclear power , some of the demonstrators carried banners saying , " nuclear power : only the risk is secured . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with differences on nuclear policy within her own party sunday 's meeting focused on granting the country 's nuclear power plants an extra 10 to 15 years of production time and to decide on a levy for the utility companies ' expected additional profits .
schroeder 's government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 .
merkel wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
she has called the extension a " bridge . "
opposition vows to resist plans a government-commissioned report last week said without nuclear power , germany can forget its target of reducing co2 emissions by 80 percent of 1990 levels in 2050 .
the opposition and environmental groups have criticized the report as proof of merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- caving in to the country 's powerful nuclear lobby .
" the german government is reviving one of the biggest social conflicts in germany for no reason , " sigmar gabriel , head of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said on the sidelines of the anti-nuclear power demonstration in berlin on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current closure dates were agreed by the schroeder government surveys show that most germans favour an end to nuclear power generation .
germany has 17 active nuclear reactors , which account for 22.6 percent of the electricity generated in the country .
settling of differences roettgen , from the cdu , said last week he wanted to limit the extension to eight years .
bruederle , from the pro-business fdp , favored an extension of up to 20 years .
the center-right coalition no longer has a majority in the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , so ratification of the proposals would be difficult .
the coalition has hinted at the solution of bypassing the bundesrat entirely , prompting anger from state governments which are represented in the house .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 05.09.2010 german government decides to extend lifespan of nuclear plants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's reactors were due to be closed down by 2021 german chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has decided to extend the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants .
opposition parties and environmentalists are firmly against the changes . germany 's coalition government has agreed to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear power stations . " there will be a staggered extension of the lifespans , " press agency reuters reported an unnamed government official as saying on sunday evening . the official said plants would fall into two separate groups , based on the year that they were built , to determine their closure dates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters rallied against nuclear power outside the talks according to the german news agency dpa , the planned changes would mean that newer reactors built after 1980 would stay open for 14 years longer than originally planned under the government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder . older plants would be kept open for an additional eight years .
environment minister norbert roettgen and economy minister rainer bruederle confirmed later on sunday evening that the extension had been agreed upon . the coalition also agreed to an annual 2.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- tax on energy suppliers who use nuclear fuel rods to generate power .
however , the tax will be limited to a six-year period following objections from industry bosses . the negotiations , which lasted 10 hours , came amid a long-running row about extending the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants . hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside the chancellery where german chancellor angela merkel was meeting with fellow coalition leaders guido westerwelle of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of bavaria 's christian social union , along with other parliamentary leaders .
demanding an end to nuclear power , some of the demonstrators carried banners saying , " nuclear power : only the risk is secured . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with differences on nuclear policy within her own party sunday 's meeting focused on granting the country 's nuclear power plants an extra 10 to 15 years of production time and to decide on a levy for the utility companies ' expected additional profits .
schroeder 's government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 .
merkel wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
she has called the extension a " bridge . "
opposition vows to resist plans a government-commissioned report last week said without nuclear power , germany can forget its target of reducing co2 emissions by 80 percent of 1990 levels in 2050 .
the opposition and environmental groups have criticized the report as proof of merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- caving in to the country 's powerful nuclear lobby .
" the german government is reviving one of the biggest social conflicts in germany for no reason , " sigmar gabriel , head of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said on the sidelines of the anti-nuclear power demonstration in berlin on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current closure dates were agreed by the schroeder government surveys show that most germans favour an end to nuclear power generation .
germany has 17 active nuclear reactors , which account for 22.6 percent of the electricity generated in the country .
settling of differences roettgen , from the cdu , said last week he wanted to limit the extension to eight years .
bruederle , from the pro-business fdp , favored an extension of up to 20 years .
the center-right coalition no longer has a majority in the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , so ratification of the proposals would be difficult .
the coalition has hinted at the solution of bypassing the bundesrat entirely , prompting anger from state governments which are represented in the house .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 05.09.2010 eastern german soccer clubs struggle to stay in the game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lokomotive leipzig a respected team ?
sure , back in the 1970s there 's no lack of soccer talent in the east of germany - but the money is n't there to support it .
this season not a single eastern german team is in the top flight , the bundesliga . managers of eastern german football clubs may be forgiven for hankering after the good old days .
under the communist east german government they did n't have to spend their time chasing sponsors , dealing with tax returns or worrying about revenue .
most importantly , though , east german clubs were real contenders back in the day .
fc magdeburg won the european cup winners ' cup in 1974 .
that same year , the east german team defeated west germany during the fifa world cup .
clubs like dynamo dresden or 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig were playing at the top of their game .
twenty years after unification , these same clubs are now languishing in the lower divisions of the league tables .
they 're lucky to attract a crowd of a thousand to watch them play , and with every annual review they fear for their licenses .
not a single club from the east is in germany 's top division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german teams have n't always been bad at soccer there wo n't even be any bundesliga games in reunified berlin this season - after 13 years , hertha bsc , in the old days a west german team , was relegated back in may , following a dismal campaign .
three eastern german clubs will be playing alongside hertha in the second division , and there are another five in the third .
hans-georg moldenhauer , president of the north-eastern german football association -lrb- nofv -rrb- admits that " the current situation of professional football in eastern germany is far from satisfactory . "
so how did it come to this sad state of affairs ?
wherever you go , the answer is the same : not enough sponsors , not enough money , and a history of poor management .
the amalgamation of east and west german soccer into one unified german competitive group in 1991 was too much of a challenge for the east german clubs ; they simply were n't able to make the leap from socialism to capitalism in the space of just a few months .
" all of a sudden we got no state subsidies any more , and we had no idea how to run a market-based operation , " said detlef krauspe , the former boss of sachsen leipzig .
the best players , like andreas thom , ulf kirsten , and later michael ballack , moved to the rich clubs in the west .
the former east had no private companies that could have invested money in the teams .
vicious circle there are some such companies today , but most of them are only small or medium-sized businesses with very little money for sports sponsorship .
" the eastern german clubs have lots of small sponsors that do n't provide that much in the way of finance , and do n't offer long-term partnerships , " says nofv president moldenhauer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german clubs generally only make news when fans make trouble the clubs are therefore hardly ever in a position to make major investments .
in order to attract big companies as sponsorship partners - like the deal bayern munich has secured with deutsche telekom - the eastern german clubs would have to be much more successful than they are at present .
they would also have to acquire a more positive image .
the image of eastern german soccer has suffered badly in recent years .
media reports have focused not on victories but increasingly on hooliganism , riots and racist attacks , both inside and outside the stadiums .
georg moldenhauer says it 's unfair .
" this is n't an eastern german problem , and it 's not football 's problem either - it 's a problem for all of society , " he says .
the media generally find stories like these more interesting than devoting themselves to the analysis of fourth-division games .
rb leipzig as a model now , though , eastern german football has a new story to tempt the sports reporters : rb leipzig .
in 2009 austrian drinks manufacturer red bull acquired a license from the club ssv markranstaedt in saxony to compete in german football .
a new club , rb leipzig , was founded , replacing ssv in the fifth-division nofv-oberliga sued .
players were bought for the team , as was the license for leipzig central stadium , subsequently renamed the red bull arena .
at the end of its first season rb leipzig finished league champion and was immediately promoted to the regionalliga .
the new management 's goal is for the team to play in the bundesliga within 10 years .
since the start of the 2010 season , the red bull arena , the biggest stadium in the territory of the eastern states , has been rb leipzig 's home ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red bull has pumped money into leipzig but the project is far from popular among football fans in leipzig .
there have been huge protests and a lot of hostility from supporters of fc sachsen leipzig and 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig .
they 're worried about a decline in traditional fan culture and the commercialization of soccer in the region .
by contrast , though , a large part of the local population approves of red bull 's investment .
nofv president moldenhauer is also happy about it .
" in the past two decades we 've always criticized the fact that the big sponsors just are n't out there , " he says .
" so i 'm pleased that now , for the first time , we have a model for this kind of partnership here in eastern germany . "
moldenhauer believes that what is almost more important is the signal it sends out to regional football : " we badly need clubs here to act as beacons , " he says : to set high standards once again , and have a positive effect on eastern german football .
investing in young talent however , moldenhauer admits that the rb leipzig model is an exception rather than a panacea : " the clubs here must keep working on what they already have going for them , which is the fantastic work they do with young players . "
in the past , eastern clubs were more or less forced to develop young local talent because they could n't afford to buy in players from elsewhere .
in addition to the work done by the clubs , the controversial east german sports schools -lrb- kjs -rrb- have now been transformed into modern football academies , and talented local children have profited from them .
the german football association has also invested - albeit not yet enough - in eastern german football : eight of its 36 elite sports schools are now located in the east .
bildunterschrift : adler left his home team leipzig to play for leverkusen but what happens if a club ca n't persuade its own up-and-coming footballers to stay , simply because it is n't able to offer them much of a future ?
german national team goalkeeper rene adler plays not for his home club , vfb leipzig , but for bayer leverkusen - even though he 's often talks about how much leipzig means to him .
georg moldenhauer does n't think this will stop the eastern clubs from rising to the top of the tree once more .
" even if two out of every 10 good players move on , we 'll still have a good quota , " he says .
he points out that this problem does n't just affect eastern germany .
all over the world top players are keen to move to the top clubs .
moldenhauer cites the example of sami khedira : he did n't stay in stuttgart , but allowed himself to be seduced away by real madrid .
cautiously optimistic the nofv president believes that , in recent years , most clubs have improved their structures and have caught up with their western counterparts , particularly where management is concerned .
the lack of big sponsors and the money they bring remains a problem , but there 's not much the clubs can do about that .
in spite of their economic woes , some have been developing very positively for quite a while now - and they are not just the usual suspects .
moldenhauer singles out energie cottbus and erzgebirge aue .
" it 's astonishing what energie cottbus has achieved with the little it has at its disposal , " he says .

" this is a big problem and we can talk about it openly , without arousing suspicions of xenophobia , " merkel said in the interview published on sunday , september 5 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is more work to do on subject of immigration , says merkel but merkel warned against automatically linking certain religions with violence . " this is misleading , " she said .
" violence among young people is often a sign that they see no perspective for themselves .
all that helps is education , education , education . " " our state is making many offers , but the main responsibility lies with the parents , and can not be taken on by schools or the state , " merkel added . merkel said it was crucial to maintain law and order in violent city districts with high migrant populations .
she said one solution would be to hire more civil servants with a foreign background . " it would surely help if we had more migrants in the police , youth welfare offices and other authorities , " she said . sarrazin debate her comments came after germany 's central bank voted on thursday to sack its controversial member thilo sarrazin , who sparked outrage and debate with claims in his new book that muslim immigrants are lowering german intelligence and harming society more than they contributed to it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book has caused an uproar in germany sarrazin , a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- received partial backing from party leader sigmar gabriel , who said there was an element of truth in his book , entitled " germany abolishes itself . "
" i think we are experiencing much of what he is describing in -lrb- the book -rrb- .
there is no question , " gabriel said .
he did not , however , share sarrazin 's thesis that muslim integration problems resulted from genetic predispositions .
the spd has initiated procedures to evict sarrazin from the party , while the central bank has asked president christian wulff to approve his dismissal from the bank 's board .
the german government 's official in charge of integration , maria boehmer , acknowledged that there were problems in conveying immigration policy .
" the gap between the population and politics concerns me , " boehmer told focus magazine .
reaction to the thilo sarrazin case shows " that we have to take the offensive and talk about problems and successes of -lrb- our -rrb- integration policy " .
legal challenge sarrazin has threatened to go to court to prevent his dismissal from the bundesbank .
in extracts from an interview with the news weekly focus , released ahead of monday 's publication , sarrazin likened a wave of criticism of him to a " political show trial . "
he said if german president christian wulff approved his sacking in the next few days , the decision would be overturned by the justice system .
" the president will have to consider carefully whether he wants to see this political show trial to its end , and then see -lrb- his decision -rrb- thrown out by the courts , " sarrazin said .
rules designed to protect the bundesbank 's independence mean the german president 's approval must be sought for the dismissal of a board member - something that has never happened since it the institution founded in 1957 . author : nigel tandy -lrb- reuters / dpa -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no such party exists ; sarrazin is a member of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and intends to remain there - despite recent moves by the spd to evict him .
however , just over 18 percent of germans polled said they would vote for a party led by sarrazin , according to the survey published in the mass-circulated bild am sonntag newspaper .
sarrazin , a board member in germany 's central bank , sparked a furious debate when he said that muslim immigrants in germany were failing to integrate , had too many children and achieved poor levels of education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' germany does away with itself ' is topping best-seller lists the 65-year-old banker sparked widepread anger by saying the causes were not just social , but genetic .
his book , germany does away with itself , argues that intelligence is largely inherited , and that muslim immigrants were bringing down german standards .
book hugely popular according to the bild survey , sarrazin 's views found the greatest support amongst followers of the radical left party , but also resonated with voters of the current center-right coalition .
" for them , sarrazin is somebody who is finally saying what many are thinking , " said the head of pollsters emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner .
demand has surged for sarrazin 's book , which has topped the bestseller list on bookseller amazon 's german website since its publication a week ago .
book tour dates are sold out across the country .
" the rush is unbelievable , " said marion boesker in the munich literature house , a venue where sarrazin is scheduled to appear .
she added that people were worried that sarrazin 's visit could be cancelled .
" the audience does n't want censorship .
they want to talk about the things that are affecting them , " boesker added .
sarrazin calls criticism ' political show trial ' sarrazin 's spd , meanwhile , has initiated procedures to evict him from the party , while the central bank has asked president christian wulff to approve his dismissal from the bank 's board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans think sarrazin should ' shut up ' sarrazin has threatened to go to court to prevent his dismissal from the bundesbank .
in extracts from an interview with the news weekly focus , released ahead of publication on monday , sarrazin likened the wave of criticism of him against him to a " political show trial . "
he said if german president christian wulff approved his sacking in the next few days , the decision would be overturned by the justice system .
" the president will have to consider carefully whether he wants to see this political show trial to its end , and then see -lrb- his decision -rrb- thrown out by the courts , " sarrazin said .
rules designed to protect the bundesbank 's independence mean the german president 's approval must be sought for the dismissal of a board member - something that has never happened since the institution was founded over 50 years ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 05.09.2010 german government decides to extend lifespan of nuclear plants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's reactors were due to be closed down by 2021 german chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has decided to extend the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants .
opposition parties and environmentalists are firmly against the changes . germany 's coalition government has agreed to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear power stations . " there will be a staggered extension of the lifespans , " press agency reuters reported an unnamed government official as saying on sunday evening . the official said plants would fall into two separate groups , based on the year that they were built , to determine their closure dates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters rallied against nuclear power outside the talks according to the german news agency dpa , the planned changes would mean that newer reactors built after 1980 would stay open for 14 years longer than originally planned under the government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder . older plants would be kept open for an additional eight years .
environment minister norbert roettgen and economy minister rainer bruederle confirmed later on sunday evening that the extension had been agreed upon . the coalition also agreed to an annual 2.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- tax on energy suppliers who use nuclear fuel rods to generate power .
however , the tax will be limited to a six-year period following objections from industry bosses . the negotiations , which lasted 10 hours , came amid a long-running row about extending the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants . hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside the chancellery where german chancellor angela merkel was meeting with fellow coalition leaders guido westerwelle of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of bavaria 's christian social union , along with other parliamentary leaders .
demanding an end to nuclear power , some of the demonstrators carried banners saying , " nuclear power : only the risk is secured . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with differences on nuclear policy within her own party sunday 's meeting focused on granting the country 's nuclear power plants an extra 10 to 15 years of production time and to decide on a levy for the utility companies ' expected additional profits .
schroeder 's government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 .
merkel wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
she has called the extension a " bridge . "
opposition vows to resist plans a government-commissioned report last week said without nuclear power , germany can forget its target of reducing co2 emissions by 80 percent of 1990 levels in 2050 .
the opposition and environmental groups have criticized the report as proof of merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- caving in to the country 's powerful nuclear lobby .
" the german government is reviving one of the biggest social conflicts in germany for no reason , " sigmar gabriel , head of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said on the sidelines of the anti-nuclear power demonstration in berlin on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current closure dates were agreed by the schroeder government surveys show that most germans favour an end to nuclear power generation .
germany has 17 active nuclear reactors , which account for 22.6 percent of the electricity generated in the country .
settling of differences roettgen , from the cdu , said last week he wanted to limit the extension to eight years .
bruederle , from the pro-business fdp , favored an extension of up to 20 years .
the center-right coalition no longer has a majority in the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , so ratification of the proposals would be difficult .
the coalition has hinted at the solution of bypassing the bundesrat entirely , prompting anger from state governments which are represented in the house .

world water week , which has run since 1991 , will award this year 's stockholm water prize to cholera researcher rita colwell . the 20th annual world water week conference focuses on how to better help the 884 million people worldwide who do not have access to clean drinking water .

" urbanization , agriculture , industry and climate change exert mounting pressure on both the quantity and quality of our water resources , " they added in a statement on the conference website . it is expected that more than 2,500 experts , decision-makers and business innovators will attend the event to discuss the escalating global water crisis . in the build-up to this year 's event , unicef , the united nations children 's fund , has drawn particular attention to the 1.5 million children who die each year from diseases related to contaminated water and poor hygiene . the stockholm water prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to clean water is essential for tackling world poverty , says the siwi the symposium in the swedish capital is put together by the stockholm water institute -lrb- siwi -rrb- , the organization which also awards an annual prize worth $ 150,000 -lrb- 116,000 euros -rrb- to recognize achievements in water science , water management , action or awareness building . the recipient of the 2010 stockholm water prize is the us researcher rita colwell , known for her work on infectious waterborne diseases like cholera . colwell has been praised for her " pioneering research " which identified that the cholera bacteria could survive by attaching to zooplankton in rivers , lakes and oceans .

no such party exists ; sarrazin is a member of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and intends to remain there - despite recent moves by the spd to evict him .
however , just over 18 percent of germans polled said they would vote for a party led by sarrazin , according to the survey published in the mass-circulated bild am sonntag newspaper .
sarrazin , a board member in germany 's central bank , sparked a furious debate when he said that muslim immigrants in germany were failing to integrate , had too many children and achieved poor levels of education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' germany does away with itself ' is topping best-seller lists the 65-year-old banker sparked widepread anger by saying the causes were not just social , but genetic .
his book , germany does away with itself , argues that intelligence is largely inherited , and that muslim immigrants were bringing down german standards .
book hugely popular according to the bild survey , sarrazin 's views found the greatest support amongst followers of the radical left party , but also resonated with voters of the current center-right coalition .
" for them , sarrazin is somebody who is finally saying what many are thinking , " said the head of pollsters emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner .
demand has surged for sarrazin 's book , which has topped the bestseller list on bookseller amazon 's german website since its publication a week ago .
book tour dates are sold out across the country .

she added that people were worried that sarrazin 's visit could be cancelled .
" the audience does n't want censorship .
they want to talk about the things that are affecting them , " boesker added .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans think sarrazin should ' shut up ' sarrazin has threatened to go to court to prevent his dismissal from the bundesbank .
in extracts from an interview with the news weekly focus , released ahead of publication on monday , sarrazin likened the wave of criticism of him against him to a " political show trial . "
he said if german president christian wulff approved his sacking in the next few days , the decision would be overturned by the justice system .
" the president will have to consider carefully whether he wants to see this political show trial to its end , and then see -lrb- his decision -rrb- thrown out by the courts , " sarrazin said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 05.09.2010 eastern german soccer clubs struggle to stay in the game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lokomotive leipzig a respected team ?
sure , back in the 1970s there 's no lack of soccer talent in the east of germany - but the money is n't there to support it .
this season not a single eastern german team is in the top flight , the bundesliga . managers of eastern german football clubs may be forgiven for hankering after the good old days .
under the communist east german government they did n't have to spend their time chasing sponsors , dealing with tax returns or worrying about revenue .
most importantly , though , east german clubs were real contenders back in the day .
fc magdeburg won the european cup winners ' cup in 1974 .
that same year , the east german team defeated west germany during the fifa world cup .
clubs like dynamo dresden or 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig were playing at the top of their game .
twenty years after unification , these same clubs are now languishing in the lower divisions of the league tables .
they 're lucky to attract a crowd of a thousand to watch them play , and with every annual review they fear for their licenses .
not a single club from the east is in germany 's top division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german teams have n't always been bad at soccer there wo n't even be any bundesliga games in reunified berlin this season - after 13 years , hertha bsc , in the old days a west german team , was relegated back in may , following a dismal campaign .
three eastern german clubs will be playing alongside hertha in the second division , and there are another five in the third .
hans-georg moldenhauer , president of the north-eastern german football association -lrb- nofv -rrb- admits that " the current situation of professional football in eastern germany is far from satisfactory . "
so how did it come to this sad state of affairs ?
wherever you go , the answer is the same : not enough sponsors , not enough money , and a history of poor management .
the amalgamation of east and west german soccer into one unified german competitive group in 1991 was too much of a challenge for the east german clubs ; they simply were n't able to make the leap from socialism to capitalism in the space of just a few months .
" all of a sudden we got no state subsidies any more , and we had no idea how to run a market-based operation , " said detlef krauspe , the former boss of sachsen leipzig .
the best players , like andreas thom , ulf kirsten , and later michael ballack , moved to the rich clubs in the west .
the former east had no private companies that could have invested money in the teams .
vicious circle there are some such companies today , but most of them are only small or medium-sized businesses with very little money for sports sponsorship .
" the eastern german clubs have lots of small sponsors that do n't provide that much in the way of finance , and do n't offer long-term partnerships , " says nofv president moldenhauer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german clubs generally only make news when fans make trouble the clubs are therefore hardly ever in a position to make major investments .
in order to attract big companies as sponsorship partners - like the deal bayern munich has secured with deutsche telekom - the eastern german clubs would have to be much more successful than they are at present .
they would also have to acquire a more positive image .
the image of eastern german soccer has suffered badly in recent years .
media reports have focused not on victories but increasingly on hooliganism , riots and racist attacks , both inside and outside the stadiums .
georg moldenhauer says it 's unfair .
" this is n't an eastern german problem , and it 's not football 's problem either - it 's a problem for all of society , " he says .
the media generally find stories like these more interesting than devoting themselves to the analysis of fourth-division games .
rb leipzig as a model now , though , eastern german football has a new story to tempt the sports reporters : rb leipzig .
in 2009 austrian drinks manufacturer red bull acquired a license from the club ssv markranstaedt in saxony to compete in german football .
a new club , rb leipzig , was founded , replacing ssv in the fifth-division nofv-oberliga sued .
players were bought for the team , as was the license for leipzig central stadium , subsequently renamed the red bull arena .
at the end of its first season rb leipzig finished league champion and was immediately promoted to the regionalliga .
the new management 's goal is for the team to play in the bundesliga within 10 years .
since the start of the 2010 season , the red bull arena , the biggest stadium in the territory of the eastern states , has been rb leipzig 's home ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red bull has pumped money into leipzig but the project is far from popular among football fans in leipzig .
there have been huge protests and a lot of hostility from supporters of fc sachsen leipzig and 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig .
they 're worried about a decline in traditional fan culture and the commercialization of soccer in the region .
by contrast , though , a large part of the local population approves of red bull 's investment .
nofv president moldenhauer is also happy about it .
" in the past two decades we 've always criticized the fact that the big sponsors just are n't out there , " he says .
" so i 'm pleased that now , for the first time , we have a model for this kind of partnership here in eastern germany . "
moldenhauer believes that what is almost more important is the signal it sends out to regional football : " we badly need clubs here to act as beacons , " he says : to set high standards once again , and have a positive effect on eastern german football .
investing in young talent however , moldenhauer admits that the rb leipzig model is an exception rather than a panacea : " the clubs here must keep working on what they already have going for them , which is the fantastic work they do with young players . "
in the past , eastern clubs were more or less forced to develop young local talent because they could n't afford to buy in players from elsewhere .
in addition to the work done by the clubs , the controversial east german sports schools -lrb- kjs -rrb- have now been transformed into modern football academies , and talented local children have profited from them .
the german football association has also invested - albeit not yet enough - in eastern german football : eight of its 36 elite sports schools are now located in the east .
bildunterschrift : adler left his home team leipzig to play for leverkusen but what happens if a club ca n't persuade its own up-and-coming footballers to stay , simply because it is n't able to offer them much of a future ?
german national team goalkeeper rene adler plays not for his home club , vfb leipzig , but for bayer leverkusen - even though he 's often talks about how much leipzig means to him .
georg moldenhauer does n't think this will stop the eastern clubs from rising to the top of the tree once more .
" even if two out of every 10 good players move on , we 'll still have a good quota , " he says .
he points out that this problem does n't just affect eastern germany .
all over the world top players are keen to move to the top clubs .
moldenhauer cites the example of sami khedira : he did n't stay in stuttgart , but allowed himself to be seduced away by real madrid .
cautiously optimistic the nofv president believes that , in recent years , most clubs have improved their structures and have caught up with their western counterparts , particularly where management is concerned .
the lack of big sponsors and the money they bring remains a problem , but there 's not much the clubs can do about that .
in spite of their economic woes , some have been developing very positively for quite a while now - and they are not just the usual suspects .
moldenhauer singles out energie cottbus and erzgebirge aue .
" it 's astonishing what energie cottbus has achieved with the little it has at its disposal , " he says .

the man , identified as ahmad s , reportedly has ties to the taiba mosque in hamburg where the perpetrators of the september 11 attacks met .
german authorities closed the mosque last month .
the spiegel report says ahmad s made the statement under interrogation by the us military at bagram military prison .
the 36 year-old suspect from hamburg is alleged to be a member of the " islamist movement of uzbekistan , " according to the report .
the group is affiliated with the taliban and has instigated attacks on pakistani security forces and nato troops in afghanistan .
german media are reporting that ahmad s was apprehended at the beginning of july .
the german foreign ministry has only confirmed it was involved in providing consular assistance for a man held by the united states in afghanistan .
spiegel said he flew with his wife , a brother and another married couple to pershawar via the gulf state of qatar before heading to the afghan-pakistan border .

german authorities closed the mosque last month .
the spiegel report says ahmad s made the statement under interrogation by the us military at bagram military prison .
the 36 year-old suspect from hamburg is alleged to be a member of the " islamist movement of uzbekistan , " according to the report .

while it has been an accepted practice in the united states for a long time , that 's not the case in europe . when germans want to talk about whistle-blowing they quickly run into a linguistic problem : there is no german word for it .
in order to describe a whistle-blower in their own language germans have to resort to a negatively connotated word like informant or paraphrase it some other way .
that 's why germans often simply use the english word to talk about whistle-blowing .
the lack of a proper name for the practice is indicative of the role and acceptance of whistle-blowing in germany .
" in germany there are no laws to protect whistle-blowers or to serve as an incentive for whistle-blowing , " johannes ludwig , a professor at hamburg 's university of applied sciences and a board member of germany 's whistle-blower netzwerk , told deutsche welle .
" in the us there is both . "
the reasons why whistle-blowing plays a much smaller role in germany than in the us are historical and also shaped by mentality , argues ludwig .
the us was founded by people that did n't want to acccept the traditional hierarchical structures in europe .
" and that 's why in the us everything that has to do with the state and government has to work effectively and serve a clear purpose .
the americans have a much looser understanding of government and state and their relation to government and business is much less bureacratic and authority-driven than ours . "
what 's more , argues ludwig , democracy in germany , even compared to other european countries has a relatively short history .
" and that 's why it is understandable that rules or laws about whistle-blowing which actually only serves the purpose to improve things , are not as developed in germany as they are in other countries . "
protecting whistle-blowers since the civil war by comparison , the first legal incentive for whistle-blowing in the us dates back to the civil war .
the false claims act , which was passed by congress in 1863 , was a reaction by the federal government to deal with fraud .
basically it promised a reward to whistle-blowers who could prove that the government was being defrauded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enron scandal led to a further tightening of whistle-blower laws with some minor changes that law is still in effect today and remains an important factor in recognizing fraud , says alexander dyck , a finance professor and whistle-blowing expert at the rotman school of management at the university of toronto .
" if someone brings information to light through whistle-blowing action and the government is being defrauded and the action is successfully pursued than that whistle-blower is entitled to between 15 and 30 percent of the money the government collects as a result of stopping this wrongdoing , " he told deutsche wellle .
tightening whistle-blower protection through sarbanes-oxley more recently , the us government improved protection for whistle-blowers through the so-called sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 as a reaction to the enron and other corporate scandals .
it also opened up the false claims act to private corporations .
" corporations effectively have to have a whistle-blowing policy , have to set up a hotline , whereby if there are employees or others in the firm who think there is some wrongdoing , you can make the phone calls and allegations and that information is then communicated to folks within the firm that then follow up on this , " explains dyck .
the purpose of all those and additional measures that were instituted in march is to provide incentives for whistle-blowers to speak up about wrongdoings they know about and to protect them as much as possible from retribution for doing it .
less stringent laws , more formal channels in europe in europe , not just in germany , many of these mechanisms simply do n't exist yet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major us companies are required to have instituted protections for whistle-blowers " one possible reason for less whistle-blowing in europe is that many of the activities that whistle-blowing might bring to light would n't be illegal in many european countries , says dyck .
" some things of corporate wrongdoing would be illegal in the us , but would not be illegal in europe , so whistle-blowing on them would n't be very effective . "
however , dyck also offers a more positive explanation of why whistle-blowing is less of a phenomenon in europe than in the us : " there are more formal channels in europe for employees who are concerned about wrongdoing to bring that information to light without going through a whistle-blowing channel , " he notes . " the existence of works councils , worker representatives on boards provide another channel for that sort of information to perculate up to the highest level of decision making that would n't require going through a formal whistle-blowing channel . "
while it might take some time until european countries institute an office of the whistle-blower protection program like it exists within the us department of labor , the experts agree that europe needs to provide more incentives for whistle-blowers to speak out if it wants to get serious about improving corporate governance both in the business and governmental sector .

" if someone brings information to light through whistle-blowing action and the government is being defrauded and the action is successfully pursued than that whistle-blower is entitled to between 15 and 30 percent of the money the government collects as a result of stopping this wrongdoing , " he told deutsche wellle .
tightening whistle-blower protection through sarbanes-oxley more recently , the us government improved protection for whistle-blowers through the so-called sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 as a reaction to the enron and other corporate scandals .
it also opened up the false claims act to private corporations .
" corporations effectively have to have a whistle-blowing policy , have to set up a hotline , whereby if there are employees or others in the firm who think there is some wrongdoing , you can make the phone calls and allegations and that information is then communicated to folks within the firm that then follow up on this , " explains dyck .
the purpose of all those and additional measures that were instituted in march is to provide incentives for whistle-blowers to speak up about wrongdoings they know about and to protect them as much as possible from retribution for doing it .
less stringent laws , more formal channels in europe in europe , not just in germany , many of these mechanisms simply do n't exist yet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major us companies are required to have instituted protections for whistle-blowers " one possible reason for less whistle-blowing in europe is that many of the activities that whistle-blowing might bring to light would n't be illegal in many european countries , says dyck .
" some things of corporate wrongdoing would be illegal in the us , but would not be illegal in europe , so whistle-blowing on them would n't be very effective . "
however , dyck also offers a more positive explanation of why whistle-blowing is less of a phenomenon in europe than in the us : " there are more formal channels in europe for employees who are concerned about wrongdoing to bring that information to light without going through a whistle-blowing channel , " he notes . " the existence of works councils , worker representatives on boards provide another channel for that sort of information to perculate up to the highest level of decision making that would n't require going through a formal whistle-blowing channel . "
while it might take some time until european countries institute an office of the whistle-blower protection program like it exists within the us department of labor , the experts agree that europe needs to provide more incentives for whistle-blowers to speak out if it wants to get serious about improving corporate governance both in the business and governmental sector .

sure , back in the 1970s there 's no lack of soccer talent in the east of germany - but the money is n't there to support it .
this season not a single eastern german team is in the top flight , the bundesliga . managers of eastern german football clubs may be forgiven for hankering after the good old days .
under the communist east german government they did n't have to spend their time chasing sponsors , dealing with tax returns or worrying about revenue .
most importantly , though , east german clubs were real contenders back in the day .
fc magdeburg won the european cup winners ' cup in 1974 .
that same year , the east german team defeated west germany during the fifa world cup .
clubs like dynamo dresden or 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig were playing at the top of their game .
twenty years after unification , these same clubs are now languishing in the lower divisions of the league tables .
they 're lucky to attract a crowd of a thousand to watch them play , and with every annual review they fear for their licenses .
not a single club from the east is in germany 's top division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german teams have n't always been bad at soccer there wo n't even be any bundesliga games in reunified berlin this season - after 13 years , hertha bsc , in the old days a west german team , was relegated back in may , following a dismal campaign .
three eastern german clubs will be playing alongside hertha in the second division , and there are another five in the third .
hans-georg moldenhauer , president of the north-eastern german football association -lrb- nofv -rrb- admits that " the current situation of professional football in eastern germany is far from satisfactory . "
so how did it come to this sad state of affairs ?
wherever you go , the answer is the same : not enough sponsors , not enough money , and a history of poor management .
the amalgamation of east and west german soccer into one unified german competitive group in 1991 was too much of a challenge for the east german clubs ; they simply were n't able to make the leap from socialism to capitalism in the space of just a few months .
" all of a sudden we got no state subsidies any more , and we had no idea how to run a market-based operation , " said detlef krauspe , the former boss of sachsen leipzig .
the best players , like andreas thom , ulf kirsten , and later michael ballack , moved to the rich clubs in the west .
the former east had no private companies that could have invested money in the teams .
vicious circle there are some such companies today , but most of them are only small or medium-sized businesses with very little money for sports sponsorship .
" the eastern german clubs have lots of small sponsors that do n't provide that much in the way of finance , and do n't offer long-term partnerships , " says nofv president moldenhauer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german clubs generally only make news when fans make trouble the clubs are therefore hardly ever in a position to make major investments .
in order to attract big companies as sponsorship partners - like the deal bayern munich has secured with deutsche telekom - the eastern german clubs would have to be much more successful than they are at present .
they would also have to acquire a more positive image .
the image of eastern german soccer has suffered badly in recent years .
media reports have focused not on victories but increasingly on hooliganism , riots and racist attacks , both inside and outside the stadiums .
georg moldenhauer says it 's unfair .
" this is n't an eastern german problem , and it 's not football 's problem either - it 's a problem for all of society , " he says .
the media generally find stories like these more interesting than devoting themselves to the analysis of fourth-division games .
rb leipzig as a model now , though , eastern german football has a new story to tempt the sports reporters : rb leipzig .
in 2009 austrian drinks manufacturer red bull acquired a license from the club ssv markranstaedt in saxony to compete in german football .
a new club , rb leipzig , was founded , replacing ssv in the fifth-division nofv-oberliga sued .
players were bought for the team , as was the license for leipzig central stadium , subsequently renamed the red bull arena .
at the end of its first season rb leipzig finished league champion and was immediately promoted to the regionalliga .
the new management 's goal is for the team to play in the bundesliga within 10 years .
since the start of the 2010 season , the red bull arena , the biggest stadium in the territory of the eastern states , has been rb leipzig 's home ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red bull has pumped money into leipzig but the project is far from popular among football fans in leipzig .
there have been huge protests and a lot of hostility from supporters of fc sachsen leipzig and 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig .
they 're worried about a decline in traditional fan culture and the commercialization of soccer in the region .
by contrast , though , a large part of the local population approves of red bull 's investment .
nofv president moldenhauer is also happy about it .
" in the past two decades we 've always criticized the fact that the big sponsors just are n't out there , " he says .
" so i 'm pleased that now , for the first time , we have a model for this kind of partnership here in eastern germany . "
moldenhauer believes that what is almost more important is the signal it sends out to regional football : " we badly need clubs here to act as beacons , " he says : to set high standards once again , and have a positive effect on eastern german football .
investing in young talent however , moldenhauer admits that the rb leipzig model is an exception rather than a panacea : " the clubs here must keep working on what they already have going for them , which is the fantastic work they do with young players . "
in the past , eastern clubs were more or less forced to develop young local talent because they could n't afford to buy in players from elsewhere .
in addition to the work done by the clubs , the controversial east german sports schools -lrb- kjs -rrb- have now been transformed into modern football academies , and talented local children have profited from them .
the german football association has also invested - albeit not yet enough - in eastern german football : eight of its 36 elite sports schools are now located in the east .
bildunterschrift : adler left his home team leipzig to play for leverkusen but what happens if a club ca n't persuade its own up-and-coming footballers to stay , simply because it is n't able to offer them much of a future ?
german national team goalkeeper rene adler plays not for his home club , vfb leipzig , but for bayer leverkusen - even though he 's often talks about how much leipzig means to him .
georg moldenhauer does n't think this will stop the eastern clubs from rising to the top of the tree once more .
" even if two out of every 10 good players move on , we 'll still have a good quota , " he says .
he points out that this problem does n't just affect eastern germany .
all over the world top players are keen to move to the top clubs .
moldenhauer cites the example of sami khedira : he did n't stay in stuttgart , but allowed himself to be seduced away by real madrid .
cautiously optimistic the nofv president believes that , in recent years , most clubs have improved their structures and have caught up with their western counterparts , particularly where management is concerned .
the lack of big sponsors and the money they bring remains a problem , but there 's not much the clubs can do about that .
in spite of their economic woes , some have been developing very positively for quite a while now - and they are not just the usual suspects .

moldenhauer believes that what is almost more important is the signal it sends out to regional football : " we badly need clubs here to act as beacons , " he says : to set high standards once again , and have a positive effect on eastern german football .
investing in young talent however , moldenhauer admits that the rb leipzig model is an exception rather than a panacea : " the clubs here must keep working on what they already have going for them , which is the fantastic work they do with young players . "
in the past , eastern clubs were more or less forced to develop young local talent because they could n't afford to buy in players from elsewhere .
in addition to the work done by the clubs , the controversial east german sports schools -lrb- kjs -rrb- have now been transformed into modern football academies , and talented local children have profited from them .
the german football association has also invested - albeit not yet enough - in eastern german football : eight of its 36 elite sports schools are now located in the east .

sure , back in the 1970s there 's no lack of soccer talent in the east of germany - but the money is n't there to support it .
this season not a single eastern german team is in the top flight , the bundesliga . managers of eastern german football clubs may be forgiven for hankering after the good old days .
under the communist east german government they did n't have to spend their time chasing sponsors , dealing with tax returns or worrying about revenue .
most importantly , though , east german clubs were real contenders back in the day .
fc magdeburg won the european cup winners ' cup in 1974 .
that same year , the east german team defeated west germany during the fifa world cup .
clubs like dynamo dresden or 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig were playing at the top of their game .
twenty years after unification , these same clubs are now languishing in the lower divisions of the league tables .
they 're lucky to attract a crowd of a thousand to watch them play , and with every annual review they fear for their licenses .
not a single club from the east is in germany 's top division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german teams have n't always been bad at soccer there wo n't even be any bundesliga games in reunified berlin this season - after 13 years , hertha bsc , in the old days a west german team , was relegated back in may , following a dismal campaign .
three eastern german clubs will be playing alongside hertha in the second division , and there are another five in the third .
hans-georg moldenhauer , president of the north-eastern german football association -lrb- nofv -rrb- admits that " the current situation of professional football in eastern germany is far from satisfactory . "
so how did it come to this sad state of affairs ?
wherever you go , the answer is the same : not enough sponsors , not enough money , and a history of poor management .
the amalgamation of east and west german soccer into one unified german competitive group in 1991 was too much of a challenge for the east german clubs ; they simply were n't able to make the leap from socialism to capitalism in the space of just a few months .
" all of a sudden we got no state subsidies any more , and we had no idea how to run a market-based operation , " said detlef krauspe , the former boss of sachsen leipzig .
the best players , like andreas thom , ulf kirsten , and later michael ballack , moved to the rich clubs in the west .
the former east had no private companies that could have invested money in the teams .
vicious circle there are some such companies today , but most of them are only small or medium-sized businesses with very little money for sports sponsorship .
" the eastern german clubs have lots of small sponsors that do n't provide that much in the way of finance , and do n't offer long-term partnerships , " says nofv president moldenhauer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german clubs generally only make news when fans make trouble the clubs are therefore hardly ever in a position to make major investments .
in order to attract big companies as sponsorship partners - like the deal bayern munich has secured with deutsche telekom - the eastern german clubs would have to be much more successful than they are at present .
they would also have to acquire a more positive image .
the image of eastern german soccer has suffered badly in recent years .
media reports have focused not on victories but increasingly on hooliganism , riots and racist attacks , both inside and outside the stadiums .
georg moldenhauer says it 's unfair .
" this is n't an eastern german problem , and it 's not football 's problem either - it 's a problem for all of society , " he says .
the media generally find stories like these more interesting than devoting themselves to the analysis of fourth-division games .
rb leipzig as a model now , though , eastern german football has a new story to tempt the sports reporters : rb leipzig .
in 2009 austrian drinks manufacturer red bull acquired a license from the club ssv markranstaedt in saxony to compete in german football .
a new club , rb leipzig , was founded , replacing ssv in the fifth-division nofv-oberliga sued .
players were bought for the team , as was the license for leipzig central stadium , subsequently renamed the red bull arena .
at the end of its first season rb leipzig finished league champion and was immediately promoted to the regionalliga .
the new management 's goal is for the team to play in the bundesliga within 10 years .

vicious circle there are some such companies today , but most of them are only small or medium-sized businesses with very little money for sports sponsorship .
" the eastern german clubs have lots of small sponsors that do n't provide that much in the way of finance , and do n't offer long-term partnerships , " says nofv president moldenhauer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german clubs generally only make news when fans make trouble the clubs are therefore hardly ever in a position to make major investments .
in order to attract big companies as sponsorship partners - like the deal bayern munich has secured with deutsche telekom - the eastern german clubs would have to be much more successful than they are at present .
they would also have to acquire a more positive image .
the image of eastern german soccer has suffered badly in recent years .
media reports have focused not on victories but increasingly on hooliganism , riots and racist attacks , both inside and outside the stadiums .
georg moldenhauer says it 's unfair .
" this is n't an eastern german problem , and it 's not football 's problem either - it 's a problem for all of society , " he says .
the media generally find stories like these more interesting than devoting themselves to the analysis of fourth-division games .
rb leipzig as a model now , though , eastern german football has a new story to tempt the sports reporters : rb leipzig .
in 2009 austrian drinks manufacturer red bull acquired a license from the club ssv markranstaedt in saxony to compete in german football .
a new club , rb leipzig , was founded , replacing ssv in the fifth-division nofv-oberliga sued .
players were bought for the team , as was the license for leipzig central stadium , subsequently renamed the red bull arena .
at the end of its first season rb leipzig finished league champion and was immediately promoted to the regionalliga .
the new management 's goal is for the team to play in the bundesliga within 10 years .
since the start of the 2010 season , the red bull arena , the biggest stadium in the territory of the eastern states , has been rb leipzig 's home ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red bull has pumped money into leipzig but the project is far from popular among football fans in leipzig .
there have been huge protests and a lot of hostility from supporters of fc sachsen leipzig and 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig .
they 're worried about a decline in traditional fan culture and the commercialization of soccer in the region .
by contrast , though , a large part of the local population approves of red bull 's investment .
nofv president moldenhauer is also happy about it .
" in the past two decades we 've always criticized the fact that the big sponsors just are n't out there , " he says .
" so i 'm pleased that now , for the first time , we have a model for this kind of partnership here in eastern germany . "
moldenhauer believes that what is almost more important is the signal it sends out to regional football : " we badly need clubs here to act as beacons , " he says : to set high standards once again , and have a positive effect on eastern german football .
investing in young talent however , moldenhauer admits that the rb leipzig model is an exception rather than a panacea : " the clubs here must keep working on what they already have going for them , which is the fantastic work they do with young players . "
in the past , eastern clubs were more or less forced to develop young local talent because they could n't afford to buy in players from elsewhere .
in addition to the work done by the clubs , the controversial east german sports schools -lrb- kjs -rrb- have now been transformed into modern football academies , and talented local children have profited from them .
the german football association has also invested - albeit not yet enough - in eastern german football : eight of its 36 elite sports schools are now located in the east .
bildunterschrift : adler left his home team leipzig to play for leverkusen but what happens if a club ca n't persuade its own up-and-coming footballers to stay , simply because it is n't able to offer them much of a future ?
german national team goalkeeper rene adler plays not for his home club , vfb leipzig , but for bayer leverkusen - even though he 's often talks about how much leipzig means to him .
georg moldenhauer does n't think this will stop the eastern clubs from rising to the top of the tree once more .
" even if two out of every 10 good players move on , we 'll still have a good quota , " he says .
he points out that this problem does n't just affect eastern germany .
all over the world top players are keen to move to the top clubs .

cautiously optimistic the nofv president believes that , in recent years , most clubs have improved their structures and have caught up with their western counterparts , particularly where management is concerned .

sure , back in the 1970s there 's no lack of soccer talent in the east of germany - but the money is n't there to support it .
this season not a single eastern german team is in the top flight , the bundesliga . managers of eastern german football clubs may be forgiven for hankering after the good old days .
under the communist east german government they did n't have to spend their time chasing sponsors , dealing with tax returns or worrying about revenue .
most importantly , though , east german clubs were real contenders back in the day .
fc magdeburg won the european cup winners ' cup in 1974 .
that same year , the east german team defeated west germany during the fifa world cup .
clubs like dynamo dresden or 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig were playing at the top of their game .
twenty years after unification , these same clubs are now languishing in the lower divisions of the league tables .
they 're lucky to attract a crowd of a thousand to watch them play , and with every annual review they fear for their licenses .
not a single club from the east is in germany 's top division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german teams have n't always been bad at soccer there wo n't even be any bundesliga games in reunified berlin this season - after 13 years , hertha bsc , in the old days a west german team , was relegated back in may , following a dismal campaign .
three eastern german clubs will be playing alongside hertha in the second division , and there are another five in the third .
hans-georg moldenhauer , president of the north-eastern german football association -lrb- nofv -rrb- admits that " the current situation of professional football in eastern germany is far from satisfactory . "
so how did it come to this sad state of affairs ?
wherever you go , the answer is the same : not enough sponsors , not enough money , and a history of poor management .
the amalgamation of east and west german soccer into one unified german competitive group in 1991 was too much of a challenge for the east german clubs ; they simply were n't able to make the leap from socialism to capitalism in the space of just a few months .
" all of a sudden we got no state subsidies any more , and we had no idea how to run a market-based operation , " said detlef krauspe , the former boss of sachsen leipzig .
the best players , like andreas thom , ulf kirsten , and later michael ballack , moved to the rich clubs in the west .
the former east had no private companies that could have invested money in the teams .
vicious circle there are some such companies today , but most of them are only small or medium-sized businesses with very little money for sports sponsorship .

no such party exists ; sarrazin is a member of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and intends to remain there - despite recent moves by the spd to evict him .
however , just over 18 percent of germans polled said they would vote for a party led by sarrazin , according to the survey published in the mass-circulated bild am sonntag newspaper .
sarrazin , a board member in germany 's central bank , sparked a furious debate when he said that muslim immigrants in germany were failing to integrate , had too many children and achieved poor levels of education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' germany does away with itself ' is topping best-seller lists the 65-year-old banker sparked widepread anger by saying the causes were not just social , but genetic .
his book , germany does away with itself , argues that intelligence is largely inherited , and that muslim immigrants were bringing down german standards .
book hugely popular according to the bild survey , sarrazin 's views found the greatest support amongst followers of the radical left party , but also resonated with voters of the current center-right coalition .
" for them , sarrazin is somebody who is finally saying what many are thinking , " said the head of pollsters emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner .
demand has surged for sarrazin 's book , which has topped the bestseller list on bookseller amazon 's german website since its publication a week ago .
book tour dates are sold out across the country .
" the rush is unbelievable , " said marion boesker in the munich literature house , a venue where sarrazin is scheduled to appear .
she added that people were worried that sarrazin 's visit could be cancelled .
" the audience does n't want censorship .
they want to talk about the things that are affecting them , " boesker added .
sarrazin calls criticism ' political show trial ' sarrazin 's spd , meanwhile , has initiated procedures to evict him from the party , while the central bank has asked president christian wulff to approve his dismissal from the bank 's board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans think sarrazin should ' shut up ' sarrazin has threatened to go to court to prevent his dismissal from the bundesbank .
in extracts from an interview with the news weekly focus , released ahead of publication on monday , sarrazin likened the wave of criticism of him against him to a " political show trial . "
he said if german president christian wulff approved his sacking in the next few days , the decision would be overturned by the justice system .
" the president will have to consider carefully whether he wants to see this political show trial to its end , and then see -lrb- his decision -rrb- thrown out by the courts , " sarrazin said .
rules designed to protect the bundesbank 's independence mean the german president 's approval must be sought for the dismissal of a board member - something that has never happened since the institution was founded over 50 years ago .

german authorities closed the mosque last month .
the spiegel report says ahmad s made the statement under interrogation by the us military at bagram military prison .

" this is a big problem and we can talk about it openly , without arousing suspicions of xenophobia , " merkel said in the interview published on sunday , september 5 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is more work to do on subject of immigration , says merkel but merkel warned against automatically linking certain religions with violence .

no such party exists ; sarrazin is a member of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and intends to remain there - despite recent moves by the spd to evict him .
however , just over 18 percent of germans polled said they would vote for a party led by sarrazin , according to the survey published in the mass-circulated bild am sonntag newspaper .
sarrazin , a board member in germany 's central bank , sparked a furious debate when he said that muslim immigrants in germany were failing to integrate , had too many children and achieved poor levels of education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' germany does away with itself ' is topping best-seller lists the 65-year-old banker sparked widepread anger by saying the causes were not just social , but genetic .
his book , germany does away with itself , argues that intelligence is largely inherited , and that muslim immigrants were bringing down german standards .
book hugely popular according to the bild survey , sarrazin 's views found the greatest support amongst followers of the radical left party , but also resonated with voters of the current center-right coalition .
" for them , sarrazin is somebody who is finally saying what many are thinking , " said the head of pollsters emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner .
demand has surged for sarrazin 's book , which has topped the bestseller list on bookseller amazon 's german website since its publication a week ago .
book tour dates are sold out across the country .
" the rush is unbelievable , " said marion boesker in the munich literature house , a venue where sarrazin is scheduled to appear .
she added that people were worried that sarrazin 's visit could be cancelled .
" the audience does n't want censorship .
they want to talk about the things that are affecting them , " boesker added .
sarrazin calls criticism ' political show trial ' sarrazin 's spd , meanwhile , has initiated procedures to evict him from the party , while the central bank has asked president christian wulff to approve his dismissal from the bank 's board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans think sarrazin should ' shut up ' sarrazin has threatened to go to court to prevent his dismissal from the bundesbank .
in extracts from an interview with the news weekly focus , released ahead of publication on monday , sarrazin likened the wave of criticism of him against him to a " political show trial . "
he said if german president christian wulff approved his sacking in the next few days , the decision would be overturned by the justice system .
" the president will have to consider carefully whether he wants to see this political show trial to its end , and then see -lrb- his decision -rrb- thrown out by the courts , " sarrazin said .
rules designed to protect the bundesbank 's independence mean the german president 's approval must be sought for the dismissal of a board member - something that has never happened since the institution was founded over 50 years ago .

it was previously thought that cholera could break out only due to release of sewage , but scientists now know that certain changes in the natural environment can also spread the disease . cholera is estimated to cause some 120,000 deaths each year and infects 3 to 5 million people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 05.09.2010 german government decides to extend lifespan of nuclear plants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's reactors were due to be closed down by 2021 german chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has decided to extend the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants .
opposition parties and environmentalists are firmly against the changes . germany 's coalition government has agreed to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear power stations . " there will be a staggered extension of the lifespans , " press agency reuters reported an unnamed government official as saying on sunday evening . the official said plants would fall into two separate groups , based on the year that they were built , to determine their closure dates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters rallied against nuclear power outside the talks according to the german news agency dpa , the planned changes would mean that newer reactors built after 1980 would stay open for 14 years longer than originally planned under the government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder . older plants would be kept open for an additional eight years .
environment minister norbert roettgen and economy minister rainer bruederle confirmed later on sunday evening that the extension had been agreed upon . the coalition also agreed to an annual 2.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- tax on energy suppliers who use nuclear fuel rods to generate power .
however , the tax will be limited to a six-year period following objections from industry bosses . the negotiations , which lasted 10 hours , came amid a long-running row about extending the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants . hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside the chancellery where german chancellor angela merkel was meeting with fellow coalition leaders guido westerwelle of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of bavaria 's christian social union , along with other parliamentary leaders .
demanding an end to nuclear power , some of the demonstrators carried banners saying , " nuclear power : only the risk is secured . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with differences on nuclear policy within her own party sunday 's meeting focused on granting the country 's nuclear power plants an extra 10 to 15 years of production time and to decide on a levy for the utility companies ' expected additional profits .
schroeder 's government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 .
merkel wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
she has called the extension a " bridge . "
opposition vows to resist plans a government-commissioned report last week said without nuclear power , germany can forget its target of reducing co2 emissions by 80 percent of 1990 levels in 2050 .
the opposition and environmental groups have criticized the report as proof of merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- caving in to the country 's powerful nuclear lobby .
" the german government is reviving one of the biggest social conflicts in germany for no reason , " sigmar gabriel , head of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said on the sidelines of the anti-nuclear power demonstration in berlin on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current closure dates were agreed by the schroeder government surveys show that most germans favour an end to nuclear power generation .
germany has 17 active nuclear reactors , which account for 22.6 percent of the electricity generated in the country .
settling of differences roettgen , from the cdu , said last week he wanted to limit the extension to eight years .
bruederle , from the pro-business fdp , favored an extension of up to 20 years .
the center-right coalition no longer has a majority in the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , so ratification of the proposals would be difficult .
the coalition has hinted at the solution of bypassing the bundesrat entirely , prompting anger from state governments which are represented in the house .

" driven by demographic change and economic growth , water is increasingly withdrawn , used , reused , treated , and disposed of , " organizers cautioned in their introduction to this year 's conference . " urbanization , agriculture , industry and climate change exert mounting pressure on both the quantity and quality of our water resources , " they added in a statement on the conference website . it is expected that more than 2,500 experts , decision-makers and business innovators will attend the event to discuss the escalating global water crisis . in the build-up to this year 's event , unicef , the united nations children 's fund , has drawn particular attention to the 1.5 million children who die each year from diseases related to contaminated water and poor hygiene . the stockholm water prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to clean water is essential for tackling world poverty , says the siwi the symposium in the swedish capital is put together by the stockholm water institute -lrb- siwi -rrb- , the organization which also awards an annual prize worth $ 150,000 -lrb- 116,000 euros -rrb- to recognize achievements in water science , water management , action or awareness building . the recipient of the 2010 stockholm water prize is the us researcher rita colwell , known for her work on infectious waterborne diseases like cholera . colwell has been praised for her " pioneering research " which identified that the cholera bacteria could survive by attaching to zooplankton in rivers , lakes and oceans .
it was previously thought that cholera could break out only due to release of sewage , but scientists now know that certain changes in the natural environment can also spread the disease . cholera is estimated to cause some 120,000 deaths each year and infects 3 to 5 million people .
siwi said colwell 's work had " helped protect the health and lives of millions . " the water crisis academics and water and sanitation ngos argue that access to water is central to alleviating poverty , improving worldwide health standards and security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 884 million people worldwide do not have access to clean drinking water speaking at the united nations ' high-level interactive dialogue on water last march , deputy secretary-general asha rose-migiro said " access to clean water and adequate sanitation are a pre-requisite for lifting people out of poverty . " the un has been accused of marginalizing water and sanitation issues in its millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- aimed at improving the lives of billions in the developing world . anders berntell from siwi told the inter press news agency that water has not received proper attention , yet is integral to fulfilling mdgs such as reducing extreme poverty and hunger by 50 percent by 2015 . " without water , we can never fight hunger ; without toilets in schools , girls will continue to drop out before finalizing their education ; and without adequate sanitation and hygiene , diseases will continue to spread , " berntell said .
the world water week conference runs until september 11 .

opposition parties and environmentalists are firmly against the changes . germany 's coalition government has agreed to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear power stations . " there will be a staggered extension of the lifespans , " press agency reuters reported an unnamed government official as saying on sunday evening . the official said plants would fall into two separate groups , based on the year that they were built , to determine their closure dates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters rallied against nuclear power outside the talks according to the german news agency dpa , the planned changes would mean that newer reactors built after 1980 would stay open for 14 years longer than originally planned under the government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder . older plants would be kept open for an additional eight years .
environment minister norbert roettgen and economy minister rainer bruederle confirmed later on sunday evening that the extension had been agreed upon . the coalition also agreed to an annual 2.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- tax on energy suppliers who use nuclear fuel rods to generate power .
however , the tax will be limited to a six-year period following objections from industry bosses . the negotiations , which lasted 10 hours , came amid a long-running row about extending the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants . hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside the chancellery where german chancellor angela merkel was meeting with fellow coalition leaders guido westerwelle of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of bavaria 's christian social union , along with other parliamentary leaders .
demanding an end to nuclear power , some of the demonstrators carried banners saying , " nuclear power : only the risk is secured . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with differences on nuclear policy within her own party sunday 's meeting focused on granting the country 's nuclear power plants an extra 10 to 15 years of production time and to decide on a levy for the utility companies ' expected additional profits .
schroeder 's government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 .
merkel wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
she has called the extension a " bridge . "
opposition vows to resist plans a government-commissioned report last week said without nuclear power , germany can forget its target of reducing co2 emissions by 80 percent of 1990 levels in 2050 .
the opposition and environmental groups have criticized the report as proof of merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- caving in to the country 's powerful nuclear lobby .
" the german government is reviving one of the biggest social conflicts in germany for no reason , " sigmar gabriel , head of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said on the sidelines of the anti-nuclear power demonstration in berlin on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current closure dates were agreed by the schroeder government surveys show that most germans favour an end to nuclear power generation .
germany has 17 active nuclear reactors , which account for 22.6 percent of the electricity generated in the country .
settling of differences roettgen , from the cdu , said last week he wanted to limit the extension to eight years .
bruederle , from the pro-business fdp , favored an extension of up to 20 years .
the center-right coalition no longer has a majority in the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , so ratification of the proposals would be difficult .
the coalition has hinted at the solution of bypassing the bundesrat entirely , prompting anger from state governments which are represented in the house .

opposition parties and environmentalists are firmly against the changes . germany 's coalition government has agreed to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear power stations . " there will be a staggered extension of the lifespans , " press agency reuters reported an unnamed government official as saying on sunday evening . the official said plants would fall into two separate groups , based on the year that they were built , to determine their closure dates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters rallied against nuclear power outside the talks according to the german news agency dpa , the planned changes would mean that newer reactors built after 1980 would stay open for 14 years longer than originally planned under the government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder . older plants would be kept open for an additional eight years .
environment minister norbert roettgen and economy minister rainer bruederle confirmed later on sunday evening that the extension had been agreed upon . the coalition also agreed to an annual 2.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- tax on energy suppliers who use nuclear fuel rods to generate power .
however , the tax will be limited to a six-year period following objections from industry bosses . the negotiations , which lasted 10 hours , came amid a long-running row about extending the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants . hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside the chancellery where german chancellor angela merkel was meeting with fellow coalition leaders guido westerwelle of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of bavaria 's christian social union , along with other parliamentary leaders .
demanding an end to nuclear power , some of the demonstrators carried banners saying , " nuclear power : only the risk is secured . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with differences on nuclear policy within her own party sunday 's meeting focused on granting the country 's nuclear power plants an extra 10 to 15 years of production time and to decide on a levy for the utility companies ' expected additional profits .
schroeder 's government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 .
merkel wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
she has called the extension a " bridge . "
opposition vows to resist plans a government-commissioned report last week said without nuclear power , germany can forget its target of reducing co2 emissions by 80 percent of 1990 levels in 2050 .
the opposition and environmental groups have criticized the report as proof of merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- caving in to the country 's powerful nuclear lobby .
" the german government is reviving one of the biggest social conflicts in germany for no reason , " sigmar gabriel , head of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said on the sidelines of the anti-nuclear power demonstration in berlin on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current closure dates were agreed by the schroeder government surveys show that most germans favour an end to nuclear power generation .
germany has 17 active nuclear reactors , which account for 22.6 percent of the electricity generated in the country .
settling of differences roettgen , from the cdu , said last week he wanted to limit the extension to eight years .
bruederle , from the pro-business fdp , favored an extension of up to 20 years .
the center-right coalition no longer has a majority in the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , so ratification of the proposals would be difficult .
the coalition has hinted at the solution of bypassing the bundesrat entirely , prompting anger from state governments which are represented in the house .

" this is a big problem and we can talk about it openly , without arousing suspicions of xenophobia , " merkel said in the interview published on sunday , september 5 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is more work to do on subject of immigration , says merkel but merkel warned against automatically linking certain religions with violence . " this is misleading , " she said .
" violence among young people is often a sign that they see no perspective for themselves .
all that helps is education , education , education . " " our state is making many offers , but the main responsibility lies with the parents , and can not be taken on by schools or the state , " merkel added . merkel said it was crucial to maintain law and order in violent city districts with high migrant populations .
she said one solution would be to hire more civil servants with a foreign background . " it would surely help if we had more migrants in the police , youth welfare offices and other authorities , " she said . sarrazin debate her comments came after germany 's central bank voted on thursday to sack its controversial member thilo sarrazin , who sparked outrage and debate with claims in his new book that muslim immigrants are lowering german intelligence and harming society more than they contributed to it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book has caused an uproar in germany sarrazin , a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- received partial backing from party leader sigmar gabriel , who said there was an element of truth in his book , entitled " germany abolishes itself . "
" i think we are experiencing much of what he is describing in -lrb- the book -rrb- .
there is no question , " gabriel said .
he did not , however , share sarrazin 's thesis that muslim integration problems resulted from genetic predispositions .
the spd has initiated procedures to evict sarrazin from the party , while the central bank has asked president christian wulff to approve his dismissal from the bank 's board .
the german government 's official in charge of integration , maria boehmer , acknowledged that there were problems in conveying immigration policy .
" the gap between the population and politics concerns me , " boehmer told focus magazine .
reaction to the thilo sarrazin case shows " that we have to take the offensive and talk about problems and successes of -lrb- our -rrb- integration policy " .
legal challenge sarrazin has threatened to go to court to prevent his dismissal from the bundesbank .
in extracts from an interview with the news weekly focus , released ahead of monday 's publication , sarrazin likened a wave of criticism of him to a " political show trial . "
he said if german president christian wulff approved his sacking in the next few days , the decision would be overturned by the justice system .
" the president will have to consider carefully whether he wants to see this political show trial to its end , and then see -lrb- his decision -rrb- thrown out by the courts , " sarrazin said .
rules designed to protect the bundesbank 's independence mean the german president 's approval must be sought for the dismissal of a board member - something that has never happened since it the institution founded in 1957 . author : nigel tandy -lrb- reuters / dpa -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

world water week , which has run since 1991 , will award this year 's stockholm water prize to cholera researcher rita colwell . the 20th annual world water week conference focuses on how to better help the 884 million people worldwide who do not have access to clean drinking water . " driven by demographic change and economic growth , water is increasingly withdrawn , used , reused , treated , and disposed of , " organizers cautioned in their introduction to this year 's conference . " urbanization , agriculture , industry and climate change exert mounting pressure on both the quantity and quality of our water resources , " they added in a statement on the conference website . it is expected that more than 2,500 experts , decision-makers and business innovators will attend the event to discuss the escalating global water crisis . in the build-up to this year 's event , unicef , the united nations children 's fund , has drawn particular attention to the 1.5 million children who die each year from diseases related to contaminated water and poor hygiene . the stockholm water prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to clean water is essential for tackling world poverty , says the siwi the symposium in the swedish capital is put together by the stockholm water institute -lrb- siwi -rrb- , the organization which also awards an annual prize worth $ 150,000 -lrb- 116,000 euros -rrb- to recognize achievements in water science , water management , action or awareness building . the recipient of the 2010 stockholm water prize is the us researcher rita colwell , known for her work on infectious waterborne diseases like cholera . colwell has been praised for her " pioneering research " which identified that the cholera bacteria could survive by attaching to zooplankton in rivers , lakes and oceans .
it was previously thought that cholera could break out only due to release of sewage , but scientists now know that certain changes in the natural environment can also spread the disease . cholera is estimated to cause some 120,000 deaths each year and infects 3 to 5 million people .
siwi said colwell 's work had " helped protect the health and lives of millions . " the water crisis academics and water and sanitation ngos argue that access to water is central to alleviating poverty , improving worldwide health standards and security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 884 million people worldwide do not have access to clean drinking water speaking at the united nations ' high-level interactive dialogue on water last march , deputy secretary-general asha rose-migiro said " access to clean water and adequate sanitation are a pre-requisite for lifting people out of poverty . " the un has been accused of marginalizing water and sanitation issues in its millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- aimed at improving the lives of billions in the developing world . anders berntell from siwi told the inter press news agency that water has not received proper attention , yet is integral to fulfilling mdgs such as reducing extreme poverty and hunger by 50 percent by 2015 . " without water , we can never fight hunger ; without toilets in schools , girls will continue to drop out before finalizing their education ; and without adequate sanitation and hygiene , diseases will continue to spread , " berntell said .

world water week , which has run since 1991 , will award this year 's stockholm water prize to cholera researcher rita colwell . the 20th annual world water week conference focuses on how to better help the 884 million people worldwide who do not have access to clean drinking water . " driven by demographic change and economic growth , water is increasingly withdrawn , used , reused , treated , and disposed of , " organizers cautioned in their introduction to this year 's conference . " urbanization , agriculture , industry and climate change exert mounting pressure on both the quantity and quality of our water resources , " they added in a statement on the conference website . it is expected that more than 2,500 experts , decision-makers and business innovators will attend the event to discuss the escalating global water crisis . in the build-up to this year 's event , unicef , the united nations children 's fund , has drawn particular attention to the 1.5 million children who die each year from diseases related to contaminated water and poor hygiene . the stockholm water prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to clean water is essential for tackling world poverty , says the siwi the symposium in the swedish capital is put together by the stockholm water institute -lrb- siwi -rrb- , the organization which also awards an annual prize worth $ 150,000 -lrb- 116,000 euros -rrb- to recognize achievements in water science , water management , action or awareness building . the recipient of the 2010 stockholm water prize is the us researcher rita colwell , known for her work on infectious waterborne diseases like cholera . colwell has been praised for her " pioneering research " which identified that the cholera bacteria could survive by attaching to zooplankton in rivers , lakes and oceans .
it was previously thought that cholera could break out only due to release of sewage , but scientists now know that certain changes in the natural environment can also spread the disease . cholera is estimated to cause some 120,000 deaths each year and infects 3 to 5 million people .
siwi said colwell 's work had " helped protect the health and lives of millions . " the water crisis academics and water and sanitation ngos argue that access to water is central to alleviating poverty , improving worldwide health standards and security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 884 million people worldwide do not have access to clean drinking water speaking at the united nations ' high-level interactive dialogue on water last march , deputy secretary-general asha rose-migiro said " access to clean water and adequate sanitation are a pre-requisite for lifting people out of poverty . " the un has been accused of marginalizing water and sanitation issues in its millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- aimed at improving the lives of billions in the developing world . anders berntell from siwi told the inter press news agency that water has not received proper attention , yet is integral to fulfilling mdgs such as reducing extreme poverty and hunger by 50 percent by 2015 . " without water , we can never fight hunger ; without toilets in schools , girls will continue to drop out before finalizing their education ; and without adequate sanitation and hygiene , diseases will continue to spread , " berntell said .
the world water week conference runs until september 11 .

no such party exists ; sarrazin is a member of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and intends to remain there - despite recent moves by the spd to evict him .
however , just over 18 percent of germans polled said they would vote for a party led by sarrazin , according to the survey published in the mass-circulated bild am sonntag newspaper .
sarrazin , a board member in germany 's central bank , sparked a furious debate when he said that muslim immigrants in germany were failing to integrate , had too many children and achieved poor levels of education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' germany does away with itself ' is topping best-seller lists the 65-year-old banker sparked widepread anger by saying the causes were not just social , but genetic .
his book , germany does away with itself , argues that intelligence is largely inherited , and that muslim immigrants were bringing down german standards .
book hugely popular according to the bild survey , sarrazin 's views found the greatest support amongst followers of the radical left party , but also resonated with voters of the current center-right coalition .
" for them , sarrazin is somebody who is finally saying what many are thinking , " said the head of pollsters emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner .
demand has surged for sarrazin 's book , which has topped the bestseller list on bookseller amazon 's german website since its publication a week ago .
book tour dates are sold out across the country .
" the rush is unbelievable , " said marion boesker in the munich literature house , a venue where sarrazin is scheduled to appear .
she added that people were worried that sarrazin 's visit could be cancelled .
" the audience does n't want censorship .
they want to talk about the things that are affecting them , " boesker added .
sarrazin calls criticism ' political show trial ' sarrazin 's spd , meanwhile , has initiated procedures to evict him from the party , while the central bank has asked president christian wulff to approve his dismissal from the bank 's board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans think sarrazin should ' shut up ' sarrazin has threatened to go to court to prevent his dismissal from the bundesbank .
in extracts from an interview with the news weekly focus , released ahead of publication on monday , sarrazin likened the wave of criticism of him against him to a " political show trial . "
he said if german president christian wulff approved his sacking in the next few days , the decision would be overturned by the justice system .
" the president will have to consider carefully whether he wants to see this political show trial to its end , and then see -lrb- his decision -rrb- thrown out by the courts , " sarrazin said .
rules designed to protect the bundesbank 's independence mean the german president 's approval must be sought for the dismissal of a board member - something that has never happened since the institution was founded over 50 years ago .

no such party exists ; sarrazin is a member of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and intends to remain there - despite recent moves by the spd to evict him .
however , just over 18 percent of germans polled said they would vote for a party led by sarrazin , according to the survey published in the mass-circulated bild am sonntag newspaper .
sarrazin , a board member in germany 's central bank , sparked a furious debate when he said that muslim immigrants in germany were failing to integrate , had too many children and achieved poor levels of education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' germany does away with itself ' is topping best-seller lists the 65-year-old banker sparked widepread anger by saying the causes were not just social , but genetic .
his book , germany does away with itself , argues that intelligence is largely inherited , and that muslim immigrants were bringing down german standards .
book hugely popular according to the bild survey , sarrazin 's views found the greatest support amongst followers of the radical left party , but also resonated with voters of the current center-right coalition .
" for them , sarrazin is somebody who is finally saying what many are thinking , " said the head of pollsters emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner .
demand has surged for sarrazin 's book , which has topped the bestseller list on bookseller amazon 's german website since its publication a week ago .
book tour dates are sold out across the country .
" the rush is unbelievable , " said marion boesker in the munich literature house , a venue where sarrazin is scheduled to appear .
she added that people were worried that sarrazin 's visit could be cancelled .
" the audience does n't want censorship .
they want to talk about the things that are affecting them , " boesker added .
sarrazin calls criticism ' political show trial ' sarrazin 's spd , meanwhile , has initiated procedures to evict him from the party , while the central bank has asked president christian wulff to approve his dismissal from the bank 's board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans think sarrazin should ' shut up ' sarrazin has threatened to go to court to prevent his dismissal from the bundesbank .
in extracts from an interview with the news weekly focus , released ahead of publication on monday , sarrazin likened the wave of criticism of him against him to a " political show trial . "
he said if german president christian wulff approved his sacking in the next few days , the decision would be overturned by the justice system .
" the president will have to consider carefully whether he wants to see this political show trial to its end , and then see -lrb- his decision -rrb- thrown out by the courts , " sarrazin said .
rules designed to protect the bundesbank 's independence mean the german president 's approval must be sought for the dismissal of a board member - something that has never happened since the institution was founded over 50 years ago .

opposition parties and environmentalists are firmly against the changes . germany 's coalition government has agreed to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear power stations . " there will be a staggered extension of the lifespans , " press agency reuters reported an unnamed government official as saying on sunday evening . the official said plants would fall into two separate groups , based on the year that they were built , to determine their closure dates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters rallied against nuclear power outside the talks according to the german news agency dpa , the planned changes would mean that newer reactors built after 1980 would stay open for 14 years longer than originally planned under the government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder . older plants would be kept open for an additional eight years .
environment minister norbert roettgen and economy minister rainer bruederle confirmed later on sunday evening that the extension had been agreed upon . the coalition also agreed to an annual 2.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- tax on energy suppliers who use nuclear fuel rods to generate power .
however , the tax will be limited to a six-year period following objections from industry bosses . the negotiations , which lasted 10 hours , came amid a long-running row about extending the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants . hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside the chancellery where german chancellor angela merkel was meeting with fellow coalition leaders guido westerwelle of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of bavaria 's christian social union , along with other parliamentary leaders .
demanding an end to nuclear power , some of the demonstrators carried banners saying , " nuclear power : only the risk is secured . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with differences on nuclear policy within her own party sunday 's meeting focused on granting the country 's nuclear power plants an extra 10 to 15 years of production time and to decide on a levy for the utility companies ' expected additional profits .
schroeder 's government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 .
merkel wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
she has called the extension a " bridge . "
opposition vows to resist plans a government-commissioned report last week said without nuclear power , germany can forget its target of reducing co2 emissions by 80 percent of 1990 levels in 2050 .
the opposition and environmental groups have criticized the report as proof of merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- caving in to the country 's powerful nuclear lobby .
" the german government is reviving one of the biggest social conflicts in germany for no reason , " sigmar gabriel , head of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said on the sidelines of the anti-nuclear power demonstration in berlin on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current closure dates were agreed by the schroeder government surveys show that most germans favour an end to nuclear power generation .
germany has 17 active nuclear reactors , which account for 22.6 percent of the electricity generated in the country .
settling of differences roettgen , from the cdu , said last week he wanted to limit the extension to eight years .
bruederle , from the pro-business fdp , favored an extension of up to 20 years .
the center-right coalition no longer has a majority in the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , so ratification of the proposals would be difficult .
the coalition has hinted at the solution of bypassing the bundesrat entirely , prompting anger from state governments which are represented in the house .

opposition parties and environmentalists are firmly against the changes . germany 's coalition government has agreed to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear power stations . " there will be a staggered extension of the lifespans , " press agency reuters reported an unnamed government official as saying on sunday evening . the official said plants would fall into two separate groups , based on the year that they were built , to determine their closure dates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters rallied against nuclear power outside the talks according to the german news agency dpa , the planned changes would mean that newer reactors built after 1980 would stay open for 14 years longer than originally planned under the government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder . older plants would be kept open for an additional eight years .
environment minister norbert roettgen and economy minister rainer bruederle confirmed later on sunday evening that the extension had been agreed upon . the coalition also agreed to an annual 2.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- tax on energy suppliers who use nuclear fuel rods to generate power .
however , the tax will be limited to a six-year period following objections from industry bosses . the negotiations , which lasted 10 hours , came amid a long-running row about extending the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants . hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside the chancellery where german chancellor angela merkel was meeting with fellow coalition leaders guido westerwelle of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of bavaria 's christian social union , along with other parliamentary leaders .
demanding an end to nuclear power , some of the demonstrators carried banners saying , " nuclear power : only the risk is secured . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with differences on nuclear policy within her own party sunday 's meeting focused on granting the country 's nuclear power plants an extra 10 to 15 years of production time and to decide on a levy for the utility companies ' expected additional profits .
schroeder 's government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 .
merkel wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
she has called the extension a " bridge . "

world water week , which has run since 1991 , will award this year 's stockholm water prize to cholera researcher rita colwell . the 20th annual world water week conference focuses on how to better help the 884 million people worldwide who do not have access to clean drinking water . " driven by demographic change and economic growth , water is increasingly withdrawn , used , reused , treated , and disposed of , " organizers cautioned in their introduction to this year 's conference . " urbanization , agriculture , industry and climate change exert mounting pressure on both the quantity and quality of our water resources , " they added in a statement on the conference website . it is expected that more than 2,500 experts , decision-makers and business innovators will attend the event to discuss the escalating global water crisis . in the build-up to this year 's event , unicef , the united nations children 's fund , has drawn particular attention to the 1.5 million children who die each year from diseases related to contaminated water and poor hygiene . the stockholm water prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to clean water is essential for tackling world poverty , says the siwi the symposium in the swedish capital is put together by the stockholm water institute -lrb- siwi -rrb- , the organization which also awards an annual prize worth $ 150,000 -lrb- 116,000 euros -rrb- to recognize achievements in water science , water management , action or awareness building . the recipient of the 2010 stockholm water prize is the us researcher rita colwell , known for her work on infectious waterborne diseases like cholera . colwell has been praised for her " pioneering research " which identified that the cholera bacteria could survive by attaching to zooplankton in rivers , lakes and oceans .
it was previously thought that cholera could break out only due to release of sewage , but scientists now know that certain changes in the natural environment can also spread the disease . cholera is estimated to cause some 120,000 deaths each year and infects 3 to 5 million people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 05.09.2010 surfers hit the waves in munich 's first summer of legal river surfing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's surfing spot is just a few meters away from the city 's busy streets riding waves in the middle of the city ?
a river in munich 's english garden has hosted surfers and curious spectators alike for 30 years .
although long forbidden , experienced surfers can now ride the waves legally . it 's a sight munich residents know well : up to 100 surfers daily hit the waves on a man-made river in the city 's english garden .
there , the icy water flows at a rate of 20 tons per second , and the temperature never gets above 15 degrees celsius -lrb- 60 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
up until this summer , surfing in the english garden was forbidden - at least officially .
" there were times when we really had problems with the police , " said 42-year-old veteran surfer carsten kurmis .
" we lost the joy of surfing because we 'd have to keep one eye on the wave and one eye on the street in case an officer came . "
calls to better enforce the surfing ban increased in 2007 after an australian student drowned while swimming in the river .
swimming is technically still forbidden , but munich 's mayor christian ude personally intervened to make sure qualified surfers could still ride the waves .
now around 200 experienced river riders have registered for access to the city 's so-called eisbach , or " icy brook . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surfer carsten kurmis loves to hit the water all year , day and night on the eisbach year-round munich 's environment secretary joachim lorenz explained just why the city intervened to make the eisbach available to surfers .
" it adds to the image of the city .
we 're a cosmopolitan city that loves sports , and we 're proud to have what is probably the world 's largest urban surfing spot , " lorenz said .
carsten kurmis sees the issue more personally .
he began surfing on a cold november day 24 years ago .
since then , he has surfed nearly every day and sometimes at night - even in winter , when the water temperature drops to around 4 degrees celsius .
" it 's partly the sports aspect , but it 's also a way to shut out the everyday .
for an hour , you can say : i 'm in another world , " kurmis explained .
" you 're only 10 meters -lrb- 33 feet -rrb- away from a major freeway , but you 're in nature and in this completely different setting . "
the waves of the future kurmis is n't the only one who was glad about the city 's move .
a group called surfing in munich spent three years trying to prevent surfers from being blocked from the eisbach .
the group raised awareness about plans to better enforce the surfing ban and collected signatures against it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : offermanns pays tribute to mayor ude 's engagement with a gift " that used to be almost like a secret society with almost no newcomers , but now the circle of people who surf the eisbach has grown , " said surfing in munich speaker petra offermanns .
but with increased interest comes increased responsibility , as the 2007 drowning showed .
munich 's river surfers look out for each other and prevent the inexperienced from getting in over their heads .
" for beginners , it 's simply too dangerous , so the surfers keep anyone who does n't have much practice out of the water , " offermanns said .
her group is also trying to get authorization for two other surfing spots in the city - one for beginners and one for experts - especially now that more and more people are heading to the eisbach in hopes of trying out the waves .
" it used to be that you could surf alone at night , but now there are people there day and night .
when there are 25 to 30 people waiting to surf on both sides , it takes so long to get in the water that it 's not fun , " said offermanns .
until then , surfers will have to endure long lines in munich , but onlookers can look forward to a steady stream of talent .

world water week , which has run since 1991 , will award this year 's stockholm water prize to cholera researcher rita colwell . the 20th annual world water week conference focuses on how to better help the 884 million people worldwide who do not have access to clean drinking water . " driven by demographic change and economic growth , water is increasingly withdrawn , used , reused , treated , and disposed of , " organizers cautioned in their introduction to this year 's conference . " urbanization , agriculture , industry and climate change exert mounting pressure on both the quantity and quality of our water resources , " they added in a statement on the conference website . it is expected that more than 2,500 experts , decision-makers and business innovators will attend the event to discuss the escalating global water crisis . in the build-up to this year 's event , unicef , the united nations children 's fund , has drawn particular attention to the 1.5 million children who die each year from diseases related to contaminated water and poor hygiene . the stockholm water prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to clean water is essential for tackling world poverty , says the siwi the symposium in the swedish capital is put together by the stockholm water institute -lrb- siwi -rrb- , the organization which also awards an annual prize worth $ 150,000 -lrb- 116,000 euros -rrb- to recognize achievements in water science , water management , action or awareness building . the recipient of the 2010 stockholm water prize is the us researcher rita colwell , known for her work on infectious waterborne diseases like cholera . colwell has been praised for her " pioneering research " which identified that the cholera bacteria could survive by attaching to zooplankton in rivers , lakes and oceans .
it was previously thought that cholera could break out only due to release of sewage , but scientists now know that certain changes in the natural environment can also spread the disease . cholera is estimated to cause some 120,000 deaths each year and infects 3 to 5 million people .
siwi said colwell 's work had " helped protect the health and lives of millions . " the water crisis academics and water and sanitation ngos argue that access to water is central to alleviating poverty , improving worldwide health standards and security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 884 million people worldwide do not have access to clean drinking water speaking at the united nations ' high-level interactive dialogue on water last march , deputy secretary-general asha rose-migiro said " access to clean water and adequate sanitation are a pre-requisite for lifting people out of poverty . " the un has been accused of marginalizing water and sanitation issues in its millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- aimed at improving the lives of billions in the developing world . anders berntell from siwi told the inter press news agency that water has not received proper attention , yet is integral to fulfilling mdgs such as reducing extreme poverty and hunger by 50 percent by 2015 . " without water , we can never fight hunger ; without toilets in schools , girls will continue to drop out before finalizing their education ; and without adequate sanitation and hygiene , diseases will continue to spread , " berntell said .
the world water week conference runs until september 11 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 05.09.2010 german government decides to extend lifespan of nuclear plants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's reactors were due to be closed down by 2021 german chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has decided to extend the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants .
opposition parties and environmentalists are firmly against the changes . germany 's coalition government has agreed to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear power stations . " there will be a staggered extension of the lifespans , " press agency reuters reported an unnamed government official as saying on sunday evening . the official said plants would fall into two separate groups , based on the year that they were built , to determine their closure dates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters rallied against nuclear power outside the talks according to the german news agency dpa , the planned changes would mean that newer reactors built after 1980 would stay open for 14 years longer than originally planned under the government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder . older plants would be kept open for an additional eight years .
environment minister norbert roettgen and economy minister rainer bruederle confirmed later on sunday evening that the extension had been agreed upon . the coalition also agreed to an annual 2.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- tax on energy suppliers who use nuclear fuel rods to generate power .
however , the tax will be limited to a six-year period following objections from industry bosses . the negotiations , which lasted 10 hours , came amid a long-running row about extending the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants . hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside the chancellery where german chancellor angela merkel was meeting with fellow coalition leaders guido westerwelle of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of bavaria 's christian social union , along with other parliamentary leaders .
demanding an end to nuclear power , some of the demonstrators carried banners saying , " nuclear power : only the risk is secured . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with differences on nuclear policy within her own party sunday 's meeting focused on granting the country 's nuclear power plants an extra 10 to 15 years of production time and to decide on a levy for the utility companies ' expected additional profits .
schroeder 's government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 .
merkel wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
she has called the extension a " bridge . "
opposition vows to resist plans a government-commissioned report last week said without nuclear power , germany can forget its target of reducing co2 emissions by 80 percent of 1990 levels in 2050 .
the opposition and environmental groups have criticized the report as proof of merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- caving in to the country 's powerful nuclear lobby .
" the german government is reviving one of the biggest social conflicts in germany for no reason , " sigmar gabriel , head of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said on the sidelines of the anti-nuclear power demonstration in berlin on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current closure dates were agreed by the schroeder government surveys show that most germans favour an end to nuclear power generation .
germany has 17 active nuclear reactors , which account for 22.6 percent of the electricity generated in the country .
settling of differences roettgen , from the cdu , said last week he wanted to limit the extension to eight years .
bruederle , from the pro-business fdp , favored an extension of up to 20 years .
the center-right coalition no longer has a majority in the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , so ratification of the proposals would be difficult .
the coalition has hinted at the solution of bypassing the bundesrat entirely , prompting anger from state governments which are represented in the house .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 05.09.2010 one in five germans would vote for banker embroiled in race row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin says he will fight his dismissal from the bundesbank a survey says one in five germans would vote for a party headed by outspoken banker thilo sarrazin , whose controversial book on race and integration has topped german best-seller lists since being published last week . around 20 percent of german voters would back a party set up by thilo sarrazin , the controversial banker who has kicked up a storm with his views on race and immigration , a survey revealed on sunday .
no such party exists ; sarrazin is a member of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and intends to remain there - despite recent moves by the spd to evict him .
however , just over 18 percent of germans polled said they would vote for a party led by sarrazin , according to the survey published in the mass-circulated bild am sonntag newspaper .
sarrazin , a board member in germany 's central bank , sparked a furious debate when he said that muslim immigrants in germany were failing to integrate , had too many children and achieved poor levels of education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' germany does away with itself ' is topping best-seller lists the 65-year-old banker sparked widepread anger by saying the causes were not just social , but genetic .
his book , germany does away with itself , argues that intelligence is largely inherited , and that muslim immigrants were bringing down german standards .
book hugely popular according to the bild survey , sarrazin 's views found the greatest support amongst followers of the radical left party , but also resonated with voters of the current center-right coalition .
" for them , sarrazin is somebody who is finally saying what many are thinking , " said the head of pollsters emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner .
demand has surged for sarrazin 's book , which has topped the bestseller list on bookseller amazon 's german website since its publication a week ago .
book tour dates are sold out across the country .
" the rush is unbelievable , " said marion boesker in the munich literature house , a venue where sarrazin is scheduled to appear .
she added that people were worried that sarrazin 's visit could be cancelled .
" the audience does n't want censorship .
they want to talk about the things that are affecting them , " boesker added .
sarrazin calls criticism ' political show trial ' sarrazin 's spd , meanwhile , has initiated procedures to evict him from the party , while the central bank has asked president christian wulff to approve his dismissal from the bank 's board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans think sarrazin should ' shut up ' sarrazin has threatened to go to court to prevent his dismissal from the bundesbank .
in extracts from an interview with the news weekly focus , released ahead of publication on monday , sarrazin likened the wave of criticism of him against him to a " political show trial . "
he said if german president christian wulff approved his sacking in the next few days , the decision would be overturned by the justice system .
" the president will have to consider carefully whether he wants to see this political show trial to its end , and then see -lrb- his decision -rrb- thrown out by the courts , " sarrazin said .
rules designed to protect the bundesbank 's independence mean the german president 's approval must be sought for the dismissal of a board member - something that has never happened since the institution was founded over 50 years ago .

opposition parties and environmentalists are firmly against the changes . germany 's coalition government has agreed to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear power stations . " there will be a staggered extension of the lifespans , " press agency reuters reported an unnamed government official as saying on sunday evening . the official said plants would fall into two separate groups , based on the year that they were built , to determine their closure dates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters rallied against nuclear power outside the talks according to the german news agency dpa , the planned changes would mean that newer reactors built after 1980 would stay open for 14 years longer than originally planned under the government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder . older plants would be kept open for an additional eight years .
environment minister norbert roettgen and economy minister rainer bruederle confirmed later on sunday evening that the extension had been agreed upon . the coalition also agreed to an annual 2.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- tax on energy suppliers who use nuclear fuel rods to generate power .
however , the tax will be limited to a six-year period following objections from industry bosses . the negotiations , which lasted 10 hours , came amid a long-running row about extending the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants . hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside the chancellery where german chancellor angela merkel was meeting with fellow coalition leaders guido westerwelle of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of bavaria 's christian social union , along with other parliamentary leaders .
demanding an end to nuclear power , some of the demonstrators carried banners saying , " nuclear power : only the risk is secured . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with differences on nuclear policy within her own party sunday 's meeting focused on granting the country 's nuclear power plants an extra 10 to 15 years of production time and to decide on a levy for the utility companies ' expected additional profits .
schroeder 's government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 .
merkel wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
she has called the extension a " bridge . "
opposition vows to resist plans a government-commissioned report last week said without nuclear power , germany can forget its target of reducing co2 emissions by 80 percent of 1990 levels in 2050 .
the opposition and environmental groups have criticized the report as proof of merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- caving in to the country 's powerful nuclear lobby .
" the german government is reviving one of the biggest social conflicts in germany for no reason , " sigmar gabriel , head of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said on the sidelines of the anti-nuclear power demonstration in berlin on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current closure dates were agreed by the schroeder government surveys show that most germans favour an end to nuclear power generation .
germany has 17 active nuclear reactors , which account for 22.6 percent of the electricity generated in the country .
settling of differences roettgen , from the cdu , said last week he wanted to limit the extension to eight years .
bruederle , from the pro-business fdp , favored an extension of up to 20 years .
the center-right coalition no longer has a majority in the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , so ratification of the proposals would be difficult .
the coalition has hinted at the solution of bypassing the bundesrat entirely , prompting anger from state governments which are represented in the house .

no such party exists ; sarrazin is a member of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and intends to remain there - despite recent moves by the spd to evict him .
however , just over 18 percent of germans polled said they would vote for a party led by sarrazin , according to the survey published in the mass-circulated bild am sonntag newspaper .
sarrazin , a board member in germany 's central bank , sparked a furious debate when he said that muslim immigrants in germany were failing to integrate , had too many children and achieved poor levels of education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' germany does away with itself ' is topping best-seller lists the 65-year-old banker sparked widepread anger by saying the causes were not just social , but genetic .
his book , germany does away with itself , argues that intelligence is largely inherited , and that muslim immigrants were bringing down german standards .
book hugely popular according to the bild survey , sarrazin 's views found the greatest support amongst followers of the radical left party , but also resonated with voters of the current center-right coalition .
" for them , sarrazin is somebody who is finally saying what many are thinking , " said the head of pollsters emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner .
demand has surged for sarrazin 's book , which has topped the bestseller list on bookseller amazon 's german website since its publication a week ago .
book tour dates are sold out across the country .
" the rush is unbelievable , " said marion boesker in the munich literature house , a venue where sarrazin is scheduled to appear .
she added that people were worried that sarrazin 's visit could be cancelled .
" the audience does n't want censorship .
they want to talk about the things that are affecting them , " boesker added .
sarrazin calls criticism ' political show trial ' sarrazin 's spd , meanwhile , has initiated procedures to evict him from the party , while the central bank has asked president christian wulff to approve his dismissal from the bank 's board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans think sarrazin should ' shut up ' sarrazin has threatened to go to court to prevent his dismissal from the bundesbank .
in extracts from an interview with the news weekly focus , released ahead of publication on monday , sarrazin likened the wave of criticism of him against him to a " political show trial . "
he said if german president christian wulff approved his sacking in the next few days , the decision would be overturned by the justice system .
" the president will have to consider carefully whether he wants to see this political show trial to its end , and then see -lrb- his decision -rrb- thrown out by the courts , " sarrazin said .
rules designed to protect the bundesbank 's independence mean the german president 's approval must be sought for the dismissal of a board member - something that has never happened since the institution was founded over 50 years ago .

opposition parties and environmentalists are firmly against the changes . germany 's coalition government has agreed to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear power stations . " there will be a staggered extension of the lifespans , " press agency reuters reported an unnamed government official as saying on sunday evening . the official said plants would fall into two separate groups , based on the year that they were built , to determine their closure dates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters rallied against nuclear power outside the talks according to the german news agency dpa , the planned changes would mean that newer reactors built after 1980 would stay open for 14 years longer than originally planned under the government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder . older plants would be kept open for an additional eight years .
environment minister norbert roettgen and economy minister rainer bruederle confirmed later on sunday evening that the extension had been agreed upon . the coalition also agreed to an annual 2.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- tax on energy suppliers who use nuclear fuel rods to generate power .
however , the tax will be limited to a six-year period following objections from industry bosses . the negotiations , which lasted 10 hours , came amid a long-running row about extending the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants . hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside the chancellery where german chancellor angela merkel was meeting with fellow coalition leaders guido westerwelle of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of bavaria 's christian social union , along with other parliamentary leaders .
demanding an end to nuclear power , some of the demonstrators carried banners saying , " nuclear power : only the risk is secured . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with differences on nuclear policy within her own party sunday 's meeting focused on granting the country 's nuclear power plants an extra 10 to 15 years of production time and to decide on a levy for the utility companies ' expected additional profits .
schroeder 's government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 .
merkel wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
she has called the extension a " bridge . "
opposition vows to resist plans a government-commissioned report last week said without nuclear power , germany can forget its target of reducing co2 emissions by 80 percent of 1990 levels in 2050 .
the opposition and environmental groups have criticized the report as proof of merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- caving in to the country 's powerful nuclear lobby .
" the german government is reviving one of the biggest social conflicts in germany for no reason , " sigmar gabriel , head of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said on the sidelines of the anti-nuclear power demonstration in berlin on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current closure dates were agreed by the schroeder government surveys show that most germans favour an end to nuclear power generation .
germany has 17 active nuclear reactors , which account for 22.6 percent of the electricity generated in the country .

bruederle , from the pro-business fdp , favored an extension of up to 20 years .
the center-right coalition no longer has a majority in the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , so ratification of the proposals would be difficult .
the coalition has hinted at the solution of bypassing the bundesrat entirely , prompting anger from state governments which are represented in the house .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with differences on nuclear policy within her own party sunday 's meeting focused on granting the country 's nuclear power plants an extra 10 to 15 years of production time and to decide on a levy for the utility companies ' expected additional profits .
schroeder 's government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 .
merkel wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
she has called the extension a " bridge . "
opposition vows to resist plans a government-commissioned report last week said without nuclear power , germany can forget its target of reducing co2 emissions by 80 percent of 1990 levels in 2050 .
the opposition and environmental groups have criticized the report as proof of merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- caving in to the country 's powerful nuclear lobby .
" the german government is reviving one of the biggest social conflicts in germany for no reason , " sigmar gabriel , head of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said on the sidelines of the anti-nuclear power demonstration in berlin on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current closure dates were agreed by the schroeder government surveys show that most germans favour an end to nuclear power generation .
germany has 17 active nuclear reactors , which account for 22.6 percent of the electricity generated in the country .
settling of differences roettgen , from the cdu , said last week he wanted to limit the extension to eight years .
bruederle , from the pro-business fdp , favored an extension of up to 20 years .
the center-right coalition no longer has a majority in the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , so ratification of the proposals would be difficult .
the coalition has hinted at the solution of bypassing the bundesrat entirely , prompting anger from state governments which are represented in the house .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 05.09.2010 one in five germans would vote for banker embroiled in race row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin says he will fight his dismissal from the bundesbank a survey says one in five germans would vote for a party headed by outspoken banker thilo sarrazin , whose controversial book on race and integration has topped german best-seller lists since being published last week . around 20 percent of german voters would back a party set up by thilo sarrazin , the controversial banker who has kicked up a storm with his views on race and immigration , a survey revealed on sunday .
no such party exists ; sarrazin is a member of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and intends to remain there - despite recent moves by the spd to evict him .
however , just over 18 percent of germans polled said they would vote for a party led by sarrazin , according to the survey published in the mass-circulated bild am sonntag newspaper .
sarrazin , a board member in germany 's central bank , sparked a furious debate when he said that muslim immigrants in germany were failing to integrate , had too many children and achieved poor levels of education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' germany does away with itself ' is topping best-seller lists the 65-year-old banker sparked widepread anger by saying the causes were not just social , but genetic .
his book , germany does away with itself , argues that intelligence is largely inherited , and that muslim immigrants were bringing down german standards .
book hugely popular according to the bild survey , sarrazin 's views found the greatest support amongst followers of the radical left party , but also resonated with voters of the current center-right coalition .
" for them , sarrazin is somebody who is finally saying what many are thinking , " said the head of pollsters emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner .
demand has surged for sarrazin 's book , which has topped the bestseller list on bookseller amazon 's german website since its publication a week ago .
book tour dates are sold out across the country .
" the rush is unbelievable , " said marion boesker in the munich literature house , a venue where sarrazin is scheduled to appear .
she added that people were worried that sarrazin 's visit could be cancelled .
" the audience does n't want censorship .
they want to talk about the things that are affecting them , " boesker added .
sarrazin calls criticism ' political show trial ' sarrazin 's spd , meanwhile , has initiated procedures to evict him from the party , while the central bank has asked president christian wulff to approve his dismissal from the bank 's board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans think sarrazin should ' shut up ' sarrazin has threatened to go to court to prevent his dismissal from the bundesbank .
in extracts from an interview with the news weekly focus , released ahead of publication on monday , sarrazin likened the wave of criticism of him against him to a " political show trial . "
he said if german president christian wulff approved his sacking in the next few days , the decision would be overturned by the justice system .
" the president will have to consider carefully whether he wants to see this political show trial to its end , and then see -lrb- his decision -rrb- thrown out by the courts , " sarrazin said .
rules designed to protect the bundesbank 's independence mean the german president 's approval must be sought for the dismissal of a board member - something that has never happened since the institution was founded over 50 years ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 05.09.2010 one in five germans would vote for banker embroiled in race row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin says he will fight his dismissal from the bundesbank a survey says one in five germans would vote for a party headed by outspoken banker thilo sarrazin , whose controversial book on race and integration has topped german best-seller lists since being published last week . around 20 percent of german voters would back a party set up by thilo sarrazin , the controversial banker who has kicked up a storm with his views on race and immigration , a survey revealed on sunday .
no such party exists ; sarrazin is a member of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and intends to remain there - despite recent moves by the spd to evict him .
however , just over 18 percent of germans polled said they would vote for a party led by sarrazin , according to the survey published in the mass-circulated bild am sonntag newspaper .
sarrazin , a board member in germany 's central bank , sparked a furious debate when he said that muslim immigrants in germany were failing to integrate , had too many children and achieved poor levels of education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' germany does away with itself ' is topping best-seller lists the 65-year-old banker sparked widepread anger by saying the causes were not just social , but genetic .
his book , germany does away with itself , argues that intelligence is largely inherited , and that muslim immigrants were bringing down german standards .
book hugely popular according to the bild survey , sarrazin 's views found the greatest support amongst followers of the radical left party , but also resonated with voters of the current center-right coalition .
" for them , sarrazin is somebody who is finally saying what many are thinking , " said the head of pollsters emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner .
demand has surged for sarrazin 's book , which has topped the bestseller list on bookseller amazon 's german website since its publication a week ago .
book tour dates are sold out across the country .
" the rush is unbelievable , " said marion boesker in the munich literature house , a venue where sarrazin is scheduled to appear .
she added that people were worried that sarrazin 's visit could be cancelled .
" the audience does n't want censorship .
they want to talk about the things that are affecting them , " boesker added .
sarrazin calls criticism ' political show trial ' sarrazin 's spd , meanwhile , has initiated procedures to evict him from the party , while the central bank has asked president christian wulff to approve his dismissal from the bank 's board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans think sarrazin should ' shut up ' sarrazin has threatened to go to court to prevent his dismissal from the bundesbank .
in extracts from an interview with the news weekly focus , released ahead of publication on monday , sarrazin likened the wave of criticism of him against him to a " political show trial . "
he said if german president christian wulff approved his sacking in the next few days , the decision would be overturned by the justice system .
" the president will have to consider carefully whether he wants to see this political show trial to its end , and then see -lrb- his decision -rrb- thrown out by the courts , " sarrazin said .
rules designed to protect the bundesbank 's independence mean the german president 's approval must be sought for the dismissal of a board member - something that has never happened since the institution was founded over 50 years ago .

world water week , which has run since 1991 , will award this year 's stockholm water prize to cholera researcher rita colwell . the 20th annual world water week conference focuses on how to better help the 884 million people worldwide who do not have access to clean drinking water . " driven by demographic change and economic growth , water is increasingly withdrawn , used , reused , treated , and disposed of , " organizers cautioned in their introduction to this year 's conference .

world water week , which has run since 1991 , will award this year 's stockholm water prize to cholera researcher rita colwell . the 20th annual world water week conference focuses on how to better help the 884 million people worldwide who do not have access to clean drinking water . " driven by demographic change and economic growth , water is increasingly withdrawn , used , reused , treated , and disposed of , " organizers cautioned in their introduction to this year 's conference . " urbanization , agriculture , industry and climate change exert mounting pressure on both the quantity and quality of our water resources , " they added in a statement on the conference website . it is expected that more than 2,500 experts , decision-makers and business innovators will attend the event to discuss the escalating global water crisis . in the build-up to this year 's event , unicef , the united nations children 's fund , has drawn particular attention to the 1.5 million children who die each year from diseases related to contaminated water and poor hygiene . the stockholm water prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to clean water is essential for tackling world poverty , says the siwi the symposium in the swedish capital is put together by the stockholm water institute -lrb- siwi -rrb- , the organization which also awards an annual prize worth $ 150,000 -lrb- 116,000 euros -rrb- to recognize achievements in water science , water management , action or awareness building . the recipient of the 2010 stockholm water prize is the us researcher rita colwell , known for her work on infectious waterborne diseases like cholera . colwell has been praised for her " pioneering research " which identified that the cholera bacteria could survive by attaching to zooplankton in rivers , lakes and oceans .
it was previously thought that cholera could break out only due to release of sewage , but scientists now know that certain changes in the natural environment can also spread the disease . cholera is estimated to cause some 120,000 deaths each year and infects 3 to 5 million people .
siwi said colwell 's work had " helped protect the health and lives of millions . " the water crisis academics and water and sanitation ngos argue that access to water is central to alleviating poverty , improving worldwide health standards and security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 884 million people worldwide do not have access to clean drinking water speaking at the united nations ' high-level interactive dialogue on water last march , deputy secretary-general asha rose-migiro said " access to clean water and adequate sanitation are a pre-requisite for lifting people out of poverty . " the un has been accused of marginalizing water and sanitation issues in its millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- aimed at improving the lives of billions in the developing world . anders berntell from siwi told the inter press news agency that water has not received proper attention , yet is integral to fulfilling mdgs such as reducing extreme poverty and hunger by 50 percent by 2015 . " without water , we can never fight hunger ; without toilets in schools , girls will continue to drop out before finalizing their education ; and without adequate sanitation and hygiene , diseases will continue to spread , " berntell said .
the world water week conference runs until september 11 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 05.09.2010 eastern german soccer clubs struggle to stay in the game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lokomotive leipzig a respected team ?
sure , back in the 1970s there 's no lack of soccer talent in the east of germany - but the money is n't there to support it .
this season , for the first time since unification , not a single eastern team has made it into the bundesliga . managers of eastern german football clubs may be forgiven for hankering after the good old days .
under the communist east german government they did n't have to spend their time chasing sponsors , dealing with tax returns or worrying about revenue .
most importantly , though , east german clubs were real contenders back in the day .
fc magdeburg won the european cup winners ' cup in 1974 .
that same year , the east german team defeated west germany during the fifa world cup .
clubs like dynamo dresden or 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig were playing at the top of their game .
twenty years after unification , these same clubs are now languishing in the lower divisions of the league tables .
they 're lucky to attract a crowd of a thousand to watch them play , and with every annual review they fear for their licenses .
not a single club from the east is still playing in the first division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german teams have n't always been bad at soccer there wo n't even be any bundesliga games in reunified berlin next season - after 13 years , hertha bsc , in the old days a west german team , was kicked out of the first division in may .
three other eastern german clubs will be playing alongside hertha in the second division , and there are another five in the third .
hans-georg moldenhauer , president of the north-eastern german football association -lrb- nofv -rrb- admits that " the current situation of professional football in eastern germany is far from satisfactory . "
so how did it come to this sad state of affairs ?
wherever you go , the answer is the same : not enough sponsors , not enough money , and a history of poor management .
the amalgamation of east and west german soccer into one unified german competitive group in 1991 was too much of a challenge for the east german clubs ; they simply were n't able to make the leap from socialism to capitalism in the space of just a few months .
" all of a sudden we got no state subsidies any more , and we had no idea how to run a market-based operation , " said detlef krauspe , the former boss of sachsen leipzig .
the best players , like andreas thom , ulf kirsten , and later michael ballack , moved to the rich clubs in the west .
the former east had no private companies that could have invested money in the teams .
vicious circle there are some such companies today , but most of them are only small or medium-sized businesses with very little money for sports sponsorship .
" the eastern german clubs have lots of small sponsors that do n't provide that much in the way of finance , and do n't offer long-term partnerships , " says nofv president moldenhauer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german clubs generally only make news when fans make trouble the clubs are therefore hardly ever in a position to make major investments .
in order to attract big companies as sponsorship partners - like the deal bayern munich has secured with deutsche telekom - the eastern german clubs would have to be much more successful than they are at present .
they would also have to acquire a more positive image .
the image of eastern german soccer has suffered badly in recent years .
media reports have focused not on victories but increasingly on hooliganism , riots and racist attacks , both inside and outside the stadiums .
georg moldenhauer says it 's unfair .
" this is n't an eastern german problem , and it 's not football 's problem either - it 's a problem for all of society , " he says .
the media generally find stories like these more interesting than devoting themselves to the analysis of fourth-division games .
rb leipzig as a model now , though , eastern german football has a new story to tempt the sports reporters : rb leipzig .
in 2009 austrian drinks manufacturer red bull acquired a license from the club ssv markranstaedt in saxony to compete in top-flight german football .
a new club , rb leipzig , was founded , replacing the ssv in the fifth-division nofv-oberliga sued .
players were bought for the team , as was the license for leipzig central stadium , subsequently renamed the red bull arena .
at the end of its first season rb leipzig finished league champion and was immediately promoted to the regionalliga .
the new management 's goal is for the team to play in the bundesliga first division within 10 years .
since the start of the 2010 season , the red bull arena , the biggest stadium in the territory of the eastern states , has been rb leipzig 's home ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red bull has pumped money into leipzig but the project is far from popular among football fans in leipzig .
there have been huge protests and a lot of hostility from followers of fc sachsen leipzig and 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig .
they 're worried about a decline in traditional fan culture and the commercialization of soccer in the region .
by contrast , though , a large part of the local population approves of red bull 's investment .
nofv president moldenhauer is also happy about it .
" in the past two decades we 've always criticized the fact that the big sponsors just are n't out there , " he says .
" so i 'm pleased that now , for the first time , we have a model for this kind of partnership here in eastern germany . "
moldenhauer believes that what is almost more important is the signal it sends out to regional football : " we badly need clubs here to act as beacons , " he says : to set high standards once again , and have a positive effect on eastern german football .
investing in young talent however , moldenhauer admits that the rb leipzig model is an exception rather than a panacea : " the clubs here must keep working on what they already have going for them , which is the fantastic work they do with young players . "
in the past , eastern clubs were more or less forced to develop young local talent because they could n't afford to buy in players from elsewhere .
in addition to the work done by the clubs , the controversial east german sports schools -lrb- kjs -rrb- have now been transformed into modern football academies , and talented local children have profited from them .
the german football association has also invested - albeit not yet enough - in eastern german football : eight of its 36 elite sports schools are now located in the east .
bildunterschrift : adler left his home team leipzig to play for leverkusen but what happens if a club ca n't persuade its own up-and-coming footballers to stay , simply because it is n't able to offer them much of a future ?
rene adler , the goalkeeper for the german national team , plays not for his home club , vfb leipzig , but for bayer leverkusen - even though he 's often talks about how much leipzig means to him .
georg moldenhauer does n't think this will stop the eastern clubs from rising to the top of the tree once more .
" even if two out of every 10 good players move on , we 'll still have a good quota , " he says .
he points out that this problem does n't just affect eastern germany .
all over the world top players are keen to move to the top clubs .
moldenhauer cites the example of sami khedira : he did n't stay in stuttgart , but allowed himself to be seduced away by real madrid .
cautiously optimistic the nofv president believes that , in recent years , most clubs have improved their structures and have caught up with their western counterparts , particularly where management is concerned .
the lack of big sponsors and the money they bring remains a problem , but there 's not much the clubs can do about that .
in spite of their economic woes , some have been developing very positively for quite a while now - and they are not just the usual suspects .
moldenhauer singles out energie cottbus and erzgebirge aue .
" it 's astonishing what energie cottbus has achieved with the little it has at its disposal , " he says .

while it has been an accepted practice in the united states for a long time , that 's not the case in europe . when germans want to talk about whistle-blowing they quickly run into a linguistic problem : there is no german word for it .
in order to describe a whistle-blower in their own language germans have to resort to a negatively connotated word like informant or paraphrase it some other way .
that 's why germans often simply use the english word to talk about whistle-blowing .
the lack of a proper name for the practice is indicative of the role and acceptance of whistle-blowing in germany .
" in germany there are no laws to protect whistle-blowers or to serve as an incentive for whistle-blowing , " johannes ludwig , a professor at hamburg 's university of applied sciences and a board member of germany 's whistle-blower netzwerk , told deutsche welle .
" in the us there is both . "
the reasons why whistle-blowing plays a much smaller role in germany than in the us are historical and also shaped by mentality , argues ludwig .
the us was founded by people that did n't want to acccept the traditional hierarchical structures in europe .
" and that 's why in the us everything that has to do with the state and government has to work effectively and serve a clear purpose .
the americans have a much looser understanding of government and state and their relation to government and business is much less bureacratic and authority-driven than ours . "
what 's more , argues ludwig , democracy in germany , even compared to other european countries has a relatively short history .
" and that 's why it is understandable that rules or laws about whistle-blowing which actually only serves the purpose to improve things , are not as developed in germany as they are in other countries . "
protecting whistle-blowers since the civil war by comparison , the first legal incentive for whistle-blowing in the us dates back to the civil war .
the false claims act , which was passed by congress in 1863 , was a reaction by the federal government to deal with fraud .
basically it promised a reward to whistle-blowers who could prove that the government was being defrauded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enron scandal led to a further tightening of whistle-blower laws with some minor changes that law is still in effect today and remains an important factor in recognizing fraud , says alexander dyck , a finance professor and whistle-blowing expert at the rotman school of management at the university of toronto .
" if someone brings information to light through whistle-blowing action and the government is being defrauded and the action is successfully pursued than that whistle-blower is entitled to between 15 and 30 percent of the money the government collects as a result of stopping this wrongdoing , " he told deutsche wellle .
tightening whistle-blower protection through sarbanes-oxley more recently , the us government improved protection for whistle-blowers through the so-called sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 as a reaction to the enron and other corporate scandals .
it also opened up the false claims act to private corporations .
" corporations effectively have to have a whistle-blowing policy , have to set up a hotline , whereby if there are employees or others in the firm who think there is some wrongdoing , you can make the phone calls and allegations and that information is then communicated to folks within the firm that then follow up on this , " explains dyck .
the purpose of all those and additional measures that were instituted in march is to provide incentives for whistle-blowers to speak up about wrongdoings they know about and to protect them as much as possible from retribution for doing it .
less stringent laws , more formal channels in europe in europe , not just in germany , many of these mechanisms simply do n't exist yet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major us companies are required to have instituted protections for whistle-blowers " one possible reason for less whistle-blowing in europe is that many of the activities that whistle-blowing might bring to light would n't be illegal in many european countries , says dyck .
" some things of corporate wrongdoing would be illegal in the us , but would not be illegal in europe , so whistle-blowing on them would n't be very effective . "
however , dyck also offers a more positive explanation of why whistle-blowing is less of a phenomenon in europe than in the us : " there are more formal channels in europe for employees who are concerned about wrongdoing to bring that information to light without going through a whistle-blowing channel , " he notes . " the existence of works councils , worker representatives on boards provide another channel for that sort of information to perculate up to the highest level of decision making that would n't require going through a formal whistle-blowing channel . "
while it might take some time until european countries institute an office of the whistle-blower protection program like it exists within the us department of labor , the experts agree that europe needs to provide more incentives for whistle-blowers to speak out if it wants to get serious about improving corporate governance both in the business and governmental sector .

while it has been an accepted practice in the united states for a long time , that 's not the case in europe . when germans want to talk about whistleblowing they quickly run into a linguistic problem : there is no german word for it .
in order to describe a whistleblower in their own language germans have to resort to a negatively connotated word like informant or paraphrase it some other way .
that 's why germans often simply use the english word to talk about whistleblowing .
the lack of a proper name for the practice is indicative of the role and acceptance of whistleblowing in germany .
" in germany there are no laws to protect whistleblowers or to serve as an incentive for whistleblowing , " johannes ludwig , a professor at hamburg 's university of applied sciences and a board member of germany 's whistleblower netzwerk , told deutsche welle .
" in the us there is both . "
the reasons why whistleblowing plays a much smaller role in germany than in the us are historical and also shaped by mentality , argues ludwig .
the us was founded by people that did n't want to acccept the traditional hierarchical structures in europe .
" and that 's why in the us everything that has to do with the state and government has to work effectively and serve a clear purpose .
the americans have a much looser understanding of government and state and their relation to government and business is much less bureacratic and authority-driven than ours . "
what 's more , argues ludwig , democracy in germany , even compared to other european countries has a relatively short history .
" and that 's why it is understandable that rules or laws about whistleblowing which actually only serves the purpose to improve things , are not as developed in germany as they are in other countries . "
protecting whistleblowers since the civil war by comparison , the first legal incentive for whistleblowing in the us dates back to the civil war .
the false claims act , which was passed by congress in 1863 , was a reaction by the federal government to deal with fraud .
basically it promised a reward to whistleblowers who could prove that the government was being defrauded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enron scandal led to a further tightening of whistleblower laws with some minor changes that law is still in effect today and remains an important factor in recognizing fraud , says alexander dyck , a finance professor and whistleblowing expert at the rotman school of management at the university of toronto .
" if someone brings information to light through whistleblowing action and the government is being defrauded and the action is successfully pursued than that whistleblower is entitled to between 15 and 30 percent of the money the government collects as a result of stopping this wrongdoing , " he told deutsche wellle .
tightening whistleblower protection through sarbanes-oxley more recently , the us government improved protection for whistleblowers through the so-called sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 as a reaction to the enron and other corporate scandals .
it also opened up the false claims act to private corporations .
" corporations effectively have to have a whistleblowing policy , have to set up a hotline , whereby if there are employees or others in the firm who think there is some wrongdoing , you can make the phone calls and allegations and that information is then communicated to folks within the firm that then follow up on this , " explains dyck .
the purpose of all those and additional measures that were instituted in march is to provide incentives for whistleblowers to speak up about wrongdoings they know about and to protect them as much as possible from retribution for doing it .
less stringent laws , more formal channels in europe in europe , not just in germany , many of these mechanisms simply do n't exist yet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major us companies are required to have instituted protections for whistleblowers " one possible reason for less whistleblowing in europe is that many of the activities that whistleblowing might bring to light would n't be illegal in many european countries , says dyck .
" some things of corporate wrongdoing would be illegal in the us , but would not be illegal in europe , so whistleblowing on them would n't be very effective . "
however , dyck also offers a more positive explanation of why whistleblowing is less of a phenomenon in europe than in the us : " there are more formal channels in europe for employees who are concerned about wrongdoing to bring that information to light without going through a whistleblowing channel , " he notes . " the existence of works councils , worker representatives on boards provide another channel for that sort of information to perculate up to the highest level of decision making that would n't require going through a formal whistleblowing channel . "
while it might take some time until european countries institute an office of the whistleblower protection program like it exists within the us department of labor , the experts agree that europe needs to provide more incentives for whistleblowers to speak out if it wants to get serious about improving corporate governance both in the business and governmental sector .

sure , back in the 1970s there 's no lack of soccer talent in the east of germany - but the money is n't there to support it .
this season not a single eastern german team is in the top flight , the bundesliga . managers of eastern german football clubs may be forgiven for hankering after the good old days .
under the communist east german government they did n't have to spend their time chasing sponsors , dealing with tax returns or worrying about revenue .
most importantly , though , east german clubs were real contenders back in the day .
fc magdeburg won the european cup winners ' cup in 1974 .
that same year , the east german team defeated west germany during the fifa world cup .
clubs like dynamo dresden or 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig were playing at the top of their game .
twenty years after unification , these same clubs are now languishing in the lower divisions of the league tables .
they 're lucky to attract a crowd of a thousand to watch them play , and with every annual review they fear for their licenses .
not a single club from the east is in germany 's top division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german teams have n't always been bad at soccer there wo n't even be any bundesliga games in reunified berlin this season - after 13 years , hertha bsc , in the old days a west german team , was relegated back in may , following a dismal campaign .
three eastern german clubs will be playing alongside hertha in the second division , and there are another five in the third .
hans-georg moldenhauer , president of the north-eastern german football association -lrb- nofv -rrb- admits that " the current situation of professional football in eastern germany is far from satisfactory . "
so how did it come to this sad state of affairs ?
wherever you go , the answer is the same : not enough sponsors , not enough money , and a history of poor management .
the amalgamation of east and west german soccer into one unified german competitive group in 1991 was too much of a challenge for the east german clubs ; they simply were n't able to make the leap from socialism to capitalism in the space of just a few months .
" all of a sudden we got no state subsidies any more , and we had no idea how to run a market-based operation , " said detlef krauspe , the former boss of sachsen leipzig .
the best players , like andreas thom , ulf kirsten , and later michael ballack , moved to the rich clubs in the west .
the former east had no private companies that could have invested money in the teams .
vicious circle there are some such companies today , but most of them are only small or medium-sized businesses with very little money for sports sponsorship .
" the eastern german clubs have lots of small sponsors that do n't provide that much in the way of finance , and do n't offer long-term partnerships , " says nofv president moldenhauer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german clubs generally only make news when fans make trouble the clubs are therefore hardly ever in a position to make major investments .
in order to attract big companies as sponsorship partners - like the deal bayern munich has secured with deutsche telekom - the eastern german clubs would have to be much more successful than they are at present .
they would also have to acquire a more positive image .
the image of eastern german soccer has suffered badly in recent years .
media reports have focused not on victories but increasingly on hooliganism , riots and racist attacks , both inside and outside the stadiums .
georg moldenhauer says it 's unfair .
" this is n't an eastern german problem , and it 's not football 's problem either - it 's a problem for all of society , " he says .
the media generally find stories like these more interesting than devoting themselves to the analysis of fourth-division games .
rb leipzig as a model now , though , eastern german football has a new story to tempt the sports reporters : rb leipzig .
in 2009 austrian drinks manufacturer red bull acquired a license from the club ssv markranstaedt in saxony to compete in german football .
a new club , rb leipzig , was founded , replacing ssv in the fifth-division nofv-oberliga sued .
players were bought for the team , as was the license for leipzig central stadium , subsequently renamed the red bull arena .
at the end of its first season rb leipzig finished league champion and was immediately promoted to the regionalliga .
the new management 's goal is for the team to play in the bundesliga within 10 years .
since the start of the 2010 season , the red bull arena , the biggest stadium in the territory of the eastern states , has been rb leipzig 's home ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red bull has pumped money into leipzig but the project is far from popular among football fans in leipzig .
there have been huge protests and a lot of hostility from supporters of fc sachsen leipzig and 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig .
they 're worried about a decline in traditional fan culture and the commercialization of soccer in the region .
by contrast , though , a large part of the local population approves of red bull 's investment .
nofv president moldenhauer is also happy about it .
" in the past two decades we 've always criticized the fact that the big sponsors just are n't out there , " he says .
" so i 'm pleased that now , for the first time , we have a model for this kind of partnership here in eastern germany . "
moldenhauer believes that what is almost more important is the signal it sends out to regional football : " we badly need clubs here to act as beacons , " he says : to set high standards once again , and have a positive effect on eastern german football .
investing in young talent however , moldenhauer admits that the rb leipzig model is an exception rather than a panacea : " the clubs here must keep working on what they already have going for them , which is the fantastic work they do with young players . "
in the past , eastern clubs were more or less forced to develop young local talent because they could n't afford to buy in players from elsewhere .

sure , back in the 1970s there 's no lack of soccer talent in the east of germany - but the money is n't there to support it .
this season not a single eastern german team is in the top flight , the bundesliga . managers of eastern german football clubs may be forgiven for hankering after the good old days .
under the communist east german government they did n't have to spend their time chasing sponsors , dealing with tax returns or worrying about revenue .
most importantly , though , east german clubs were real contenders back in the day .
fc magdeburg won the european cup winners ' cup in 1974 .
that same year , the east german team defeated west germany during the fifa world cup .
clubs like dynamo dresden or 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig were playing at the top of their game .
twenty years after unification , these same clubs are now languishing in the lower divisions of the league tables .
they 're lucky to attract a crowd of a thousand to watch them play , and with every annual review they fear for their licenses .
not a single club from the east is in germany 's top division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german teams have n't always been bad at soccer there wo n't even be any bundesliga games in reunified berlin this season - after 13 years , hertha bsc , in the old days a west german team , was relegated back in may , following a dismal campaign .
three eastern german clubs will be playing alongside hertha in the second division , and there are another five in the third .
hans-georg moldenhauer , president of the north-eastern german football association -lrb- nofv -rrb- admits that " the current situation of professional football in eastern germany is far from satisfactory . "
so how did it come to this sad state of affairs ?
wherever you go , the answer is the same : not enough sponsors , not enough money , and a history of poor management .
the amalgamation of east and west german soccer into one unified german competitive group in 1991 was too much of a challenge for the east german clubs ; they simply were n't able to make the leap from socialism to capitalism in the space of just a few months .
" all of a sudden we got no state subsidies any more , and we had no idea how to run a market-based operation , " said detlef krauspe , the former boss of sachsen leipzig .
the best players , like andreas thom , ulf kirsten , and later michael ballack , moved to the rich clubs in the west .
the former east had no private companies that could have invested money in the teams .
vicious circle there are some such companies today , but most of them are only small or medium-sized businesses with very little money for sports sponsorship .
" the eastern german clubs have lots of small sponsors that do n't provide that much in the way of finance , and do n't offer long-term partnerships , " says nofv president moldenhauer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german clubs generally only make news when fans make trouble the clubs are therefore hardly ever in a position to make major investments .
in order to attract big companies as sponsorship partners - like the deal bayern munich has secured with deutsche telekom - the eastern german clubs would have to be much more successful than they are at present .
they would also have to acquire a more positive image .
the image of eastern german soccer has suffered badly in recent years .
media reports have focused not on victories but increasingly on hooliganism , riots and racist attacks , both inside and outside the stadiums .
georg moldenhauer says it 's unfair .
" this is n't an eastern german problem , and it 's not football 's problem either - it 's a problem for all of society , " he says .
the media generally find stories like these more interesting than devoting themselves to the analysis of fourth-division games .
rb leipzig as a model now , though , eastern german football has a new story to tempt the sports reporters : rb leipzig .
in 2009 austrian drinks manufacturer red bull acquired a license from the club ssv markranstaedt in saxony to compete in german football .
a new club , rb leipzig , was founded , replacing ssv in the fifth-division nofv-oberliga sued .
players were bought for the team , as was the license for leipzig central stadium , subsequently renamed the red bull arena .
at the end of its first season rb leipzig finished league champion and was immediately promoted to the regionalliga .
the new management 's goal is for the team to play in the bundesliga within 10 years .
since the start of the 2010 season , the red bull arena , the biggest stadium in the territory of the eastern states , has been rb leipzig 's home ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red bull has pumped money into leipzig but the project is far from popular among football fans in leipzig .
there have been huge protests and a lot of hostility from supporters of fc sachsen leipzig and 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig .
they 're worried about a decline in traditional fan culture and the commercialization of soccer in the region .
by contrast , though , a large part of the local population approves of red bull 's investment .
nofv president moldenhauer is also happy about it .
" in the past two decades we 've always criticized the fact that the big sponsors just are n't out there , " he says .
" so i 'm pleased that now , for the first time , we have a model for this kind of partnership here in eastern germany . "
moldenhauer believes that what is almost more important is the signal it sends out to regional football : " we badly need clubs here to act as beacons , " he says : to set high standards once again , and have a positive effect on eastern german football .
investing in young talent however , moldenhauer admits that the rb leipzig model is an exception rather than a panacea : " the clubs here must keep working on what they already have going for them , which is the fantastic work they do with young players . "
in the past , eastern clubs were more or less forced to develop young local talent because they could n't afford to buy in players from elsewhere .
in addition to the work done by the clubs , the controversial east german sports schools -lrb- kjs -rrb- have now been transformed into modern football academies , and talented local children have profited from them .
the german football association has also invested - albeit not yet enough - in eastern german football : eight of its 36 elite sports schools are now located in the east .

while it has been an accepted practice in the united states for a long time , that 's not the case in europe . when germans want to talk about whistle-blowing they quickly run into a linguistic problem : there is no german word for it .
in order to describe a whistle-blower in their own language germans have to resort to a negatively connotated word like informant or paraphrase it some other way .
that 's why germans often simply use the english word to talk about whistle-blowing .
the lack of a proper name for the practice is indicative of the role and acceptance of whistle-blowing in germany .
" in germany there are no laws to protect whistle-blowers or to serve as an incentive for whistle-blowing , " johannes ludwig , a professor at hamburg 's university of applied sciences and a board member of germany 's whistle-blower netzwerk , told deutsche welle .
" in the us there is both . "
the reasons why whistle-blowing plays a much smaller role in germany than in the us are historical and also shaped by mentality , argues ludwig .
the us was founded by people that did n't want to acccept the traditional hierarchical structures in europe .
" and that 's why in the us everything that has to do with the state and government has to work effectively and serve a clear purpose .
the americans have a much looser understanding of government and state and their relation to government and business is much less bureacratic and authority-driven than ours . "
what 's more , argues ludwig , democracy in germany , even compared to other european countries has a relatively short history .
" and that 's why it is understandable that rules or laws about whistle-blowing which actually only serves the purpose to improve things , are not as developed in germany as they are in other countries . "
protecting whistle-blowers since the civil war by comparison , the first legal incentive for whistle-blowing in the us dates back to the civil war .
the false claims act , which was passed by congress in 1863 , was a reaction by the federal government to deal with fraud .
basically it promised a reward to whistle-blowers who could prove that the government was being defrauded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enron scandal led to a further tightening of whistle-blower laws with some minor changes that law is still in effect today and remains an important factor in recognizing fraud , says alexander dyck , a finance professor and whistle-blowing expert at the rotman school of management at the university of toronto .
" if someone brings information to light through whistle-blowing action and the government is being defrauded and the action is successfully pursued than that whistle-blower is entitled to between 15 and 30 percent of the money the government collects as a result of stopping this wrongdoing , " he told deutsche wellle .
tightening whistle-blower protection through sarbanes-oxley more recently , the us government improved protection for whistle-blowers through the so-called sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 as a reaction to the enron and other corporate scandals .
it also opened up the false claims act to private corporations .
" corporations effectively have to have a whistle-blowing policy , have to set up a hotline , whereby if there are employees or others in the firm who think there is some wrongdoing , you can make the phone calls and allegations and that information is then communicated to folks within the firm that then follow up on this , " explains dyck .
the purpose of all those and additional measures that were instituted in march is to provide incentives for whistle-blowers to speak up about wrongdoings they know about and to protect them as much as possible from retribution for doing it .
less stringent laws , more formal channels in europe in europe , not just in germany , many of these mechanisms simply do n't exist yet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major us companies are required to have instituted protections for whistle-blowers " one possible reason for less whistle-blowing in europe is that many of the activities that whistle-blowing might bring to light would n't be illegal in many european countries , says dyck .
" some things of corporate wrongdoing would be illegal in the us , but would not be illegal in europe , so whistle-blowing on them would n't be very effective . "
however , dyck also offers a more positive explanation of why whistle-blowing is less of a phenomenon in europe than in the us : " there are more formal channels in europe for employees who are concerned about wrongdoing to bring that information to light without going through a whistle-blowing channel , " he notes . " the existence of works councils , worker representatives on boards provide another channel for that sort of information to perculate up to the highest level of decision making that would n't require going through a formal whistle-blowing channel . "
while it might take some time until european countries institute an office of the whistle-blower protection program like it exists within the us department of labor , the experts agree that europe needs to provide more incentives for whistle-blowers to speak out if it wants to get serious about improving corporate governance both in the business and governmental sector .

sure , back in the 1970s there 's no lack of soccer talent in the east of germany - but the money is n't there to support it .
this season not a single eastern german team is in the top flight , the bundesliga . managers of eastern german football clubs may be forgiven for hankering after the good old days .
under the communist east german government they did n't have to spend their time chasing sponsors , dealing with tax returns or worrying about revenue .
most importantly , though , east german clubs were real contenders back in the day .
fc magdeburg won the european cup winners ' cup in 1974 .
that same year , the east german team defeated west germany during the fifa world cup .
clubs like dynamo dresden or 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig were playing at the top of their game .
twenty years after unification , these same clubs are now languishing in the lower divisions of the league tables .
they 're lucky to attract a crowd of a thousand to watch them play , and with every annual review they fear for their licenses .
not a single club from the east is in germany 's top division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german teams have n't always been bad at soccer there wo n't even be any bundesliga games in reunified berlin this season - after 13 years , hertha bsc , in the old days a west german team , was relegated back in may , following a dismal campaign .
three eastern german clubs will be playing alongside hertha in the second division , and there are another five in the third .
hans-georg moldenhauer , president of the north-eastern german football association -lrb- nofv -rrb- admits that " the current situation of professional football in eastern germany is far from satisfactory . "
so how did it come to this sad state of affairs ?
wherever you go , the answer is the same : not enough sponsors , not enough money , and a history of poor management .
the amalgamation of east and west german soccer into one unified german competitive group in 1991 was too much of a challenge for the east german clubs ; they simply were n't able to make the leap from socialism to capitalism in the space of just a few months .
" all of a sudden we got no state subsidies any more , and we had no idea how to run a market-based operation , " said detlef krauspe , the former boss of sachsen leipzig .
the best players , like andreas thom , ulf kirsten , and later michael ballack , moved to the rich clubs in the west .
the former east had no private companies that could have invested money in the teams .
vicious circle there are some such companies today , but most of them are only small or medium-sized businesses with very little money for sports sponsorship .
" the eastern german clubs have lots of small sponsors that do n't provide that much in the way of finance , and do n't offer long-term partnerships , " says nofv president moldenhauer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german clubs generally only make news when fans make trouble the clubs are therefore hardly ever in a position to make major investments .
in order to attract big companies as sponsorship partners - like the deal bayern munich has secured with deutsche telekom - the eastern german clubs would have to be much more successful than they are at present .
they would also have to acquire a more positive image .
the image of eastern german soccer has suffered badly in recent years .
media reports have focused not on victories but increasingly on hooliganism , riots and racist attacks , both inside and outside the stadiums .
georg moldenhauer says it 's unfair .
" this is n't an eastern german problem , and it 's not football 's problem either - it 's a problem for all of society , " he says .
the media generally find stories like these more interesting than devoting themselves to the analysis of fourth-division games .
rb leipzig as a model now , though , eastern german football has a new story to tempt the sports reporters : rb leipzig .
in 2009 austrian drinks manufacturer red bull acquired a license from the club ssv markranstaedt in saxony to compete in german football .
a new club , rb leipzig , was founded , replacing ssv in the fifth-division nofv-oberliga sued .
players were bought for the team , as was the license for leipzig central stadium , subsequently renamed the red bull arena .
at the end of its first season rb leipzig finished league champion and was immediately promoted to the regionalliga .
the new management 's goal is for the team to play in the bundesliga within 10 years .
since the start of the 2010 season , the red bull arena , the biggest stadium in the territory of the eastern states , has been rb leipzig 's home ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red bull has pumped money into leipzig but the project is far from popular among football fans in leipzig .
there have been huge protests and a lot of hostility from supporters of fc sachsen leipzig and 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig .
they 're worried about a decline in traditional fan culture and the commercialization of soccer in the region .
by contrast , though , a large part of the local population approves of red bull 's investment .
nofv president moldenhauer is also happy about it .
" in the past two decades we 've always criticized the fact that the big sponsors just are n't out there , " he says .
" so i 'm pleased that now , for the first time , we have a model for this kind of partnership here in eastern germany . "
moldenhauer believes that what is almost more important is the signal it sends out to regional football : " we badly need clubs here to act as beacons , " he says : to set high standards once again , and have a positive effect on eastern german football .
investing in young talent however , moldenhauer admits that the rb leipzig model is an exception rather than a panacea : " the clubs here must keep working on what they already have going for them , which is the fantastic work they do with young players . "
in the past , eastern clubs were more or less forced to develop young local talent because they could n't afford to buy in players from elsewhere .
in addition to the work done by the clubs , the controversial east german sports schools -lrb- kjs -rrb- have now been transformed into modern football academies , and talented local children have profited from them .
the german football association has also invested - albeit not yet enough - in eastern german football : eight of its 36 elite sports schools are now located in the east .
bildunterschrift : adler left his home team leipzig to play for leverkusen but what happens if a club ca n't persuade its own up-and-coming footballers to stay , simply because it is n't able to offer them much of a future ?
german national team goalkeeper rene adler plays not for his home club , vfb leipzig , but for bayer leverkusen - even though he 's often talks about how much leipzig means to him .
georg moldenhauer does n't think this will stop the eastern clubs from rising to the top of the tree once more .
" even if two out of every 10 good players move on , we 'll still have a good quota , " he says .
he points out that this problem does n't just affect eastern germany .
all over the world top players are keen to move to the top clubs .
moldenhauer cites the example of sami khedira : he did n't stay in stuttgart , but allowed himself to be seduced away by real madrid .
cautiously optimistic the nofv president believes that , in recent years , most clubs have improved their structures and have caught up with their western counterparts , particularly where management is concerned .
the lack of big sponsors and the money they bring remains a problem , but there 's not much the clubs can do about that .
in spite of their economic woes , some have been developing very positively for quite a while now - and they are not just the usual suspects .
moldenhauer singles out energie cottbus and erzgebirge aue .
" it 's astonishing what energie cottbus has achieved with the little it has at its disposal , " he says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 05.09.2010 german government decides to extend lifespan of nuclear plants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's reactors were due to be closed down by 2021 german chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has decided to extend the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants .
opposition parties and environmentalists are firmly against the changes . germany 's coalition government has agreed to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear power stations . " there will be a staggered extension of the lifespans , " press agency reuters reported an unnamed government official as saying on sunday evening . the official said plants would fall into two separate groups , based on the year that they were built , to determine their closure dates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters rallied against nuclear power outside the talks according to the german news agency dpa , the planned changes would mean that newer reactors built after 1980 would stay open for 14 years longer than originally planned under the government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder . older plants would be kept open for an additional eight years .
environment minister norbert roettgen and economy minister rainer bruederle confirmed later on sunday evening that the extension had been agreed upon . the coalition also agreed to an annual 2.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- tax on energy suppliers who use nuclear fuel rods to generate power .
however , the tax will be limited to a six-year period following objections from industry bosses . the negotiations , which lasted 10 hours , came amid a long-running row about extending the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants . hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside the chancellery where german chancellor angela merkel was meeting with fellow coalition leaders guido westerwelle of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of bavaria 's christian social union , along with other parliamentary leaders .
demanding an end to nuclear power , some of the demonstrators carried banners saying , " nuclear power : only the risk is secured . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with differences on nuclear policy within her own party sunday 's meeting focused on granting the country 's nuclear power plants an extra 10 to 15 years of production time and to decide on a levy for the utility companies ' expected additional profits .
schroeder 's government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 .
merkel wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
she has called the extension a " bridge . "
opposition vows to resist plans a government-commissioned report last week said without nuclear power , germany can forget its target of reducing co2 emissions by 80 percent of 1990 levels in 2050 .
the opposition and environmental groups have criticized the report as proof of merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- caving in to the country 's powerful nuclear lobby .
" the german government is reviving one of the biggest social conflicts in germany for no reason , " sigmar gabriel , head of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said on the sidelines of the anti-nuclear power demonstration in berlin on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current closure dates were agreed by the schroeder government surveys show that most germans favour an end to nuclear power generation .
germany has 17 active nuclear reactors , which account for 22.6 percent of the electricity generated in the country .
settling of differences roettgen , from the cdu , said last week he wanted to limit the extension to eight years .
bruederle , from the pro-business fdp , favored an extension of up to 20 years .
the center-right coalition no longer has a majority in the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , so ratification of the proposals would be difficult .
the coalition has hinted at the solution of bypassing the bundesrat entirely , prompting anger from state governments which are represented in the house .

no such party exists ; sarrazin is a member of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and intends to remain there - despite recent moves by the spd to evict him .
however , just over 18 percent of germans polled said they would vote for a party led by sarrazin , according to the survey published in the mass-circulated bild am sonntag newspaper .
sarrazin , a board member in germany 's central bank , sparked a furious debate when he said that muslim immigrants in germany were failing to integrate , had too many children and achieved poor levels of education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' germany does away with itself ' is topping best-seller lists the 65-year-old banker sparked widepread anger by saying the causes were not just social , but genetic .
his book , germany does away with itself , argues that intelligence is largely inherited , and that muslim immigrants were bringing down german standards .
book hugely popular according to the bild survey , sarrazin 's views found the greatest support amongst followers of the radical left party , but also resonated with voters of the current center-right coalition .
" for them , sarrazin is somebody who is finally saying what many are thinking , " said the head of pollsters emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner .
demand has surged for sarrazin 's book , which has topped the bestseller list on bookseller amazon 's german website since its publication a week ago .

she added that people were worried that sarrazin 's visit could be cancelled .
" the audience does n't want censorship .
they want to talk about the things that are affecting them , " boesker added .

" the president will have to consider carefully whether he wants to see this political show trial to its end , and then see -lrb- his decision -rrb- thrown out by the courts , " sarrazin said .
rules designed to protect the bundesbank 's independence mean the german president 's approval must be sought for the dismissal of a board member - something that has never happened since the institution was founded over 50 years ago .

no such party exists ; sarrazin is a member of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and intends to remain there - despite recent moves by the spd to evict him .
however , just over 18 percent of germans polled said they would vote for a party led by sarrazin , according to the survey published in the mass-circulated bild am sonntag newspaper .
sarrazin , a board member in germany 's central bank , sparked a furious debate when he said that muslim immigrants in germany were failing to integrate , had too many children and achieved poor levels of education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' germany does away with itself ' is topping best-seller lists the 65-year-old banker sparked widepread anger by saying the causes were not just social , but genetic .
his book , germany does away with itself , argues that intelligence is largely inherited , and that muslim immigrants were bringing down german standards .
book hugely popular according to the bild survey , sarrazin 's views found the greatest support amongst followers of the radical left party , but also resonated with voters of the current center-right coalition .
" for them , sarrazin is somebody who is finally saying what many are thinking , " said the head of pollsters emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner .
demand has surged for sarrazin 's book , which has topped the bestseller list on bookseller amazon 's german website since its publication a week ago .
book tour dates are sold out across the country .
" the rush is unbelievable , " said marion boesker in the munich literature house , a venue where sarrazin is scheduled to appear .
she added that people were worried that sarrazin 's visit could be cancelled .
" the audience does n't want censorship .
they want to talk about the things that are affecting them , " boesker added .
sarrazin calls criticism ' political show trial ' sarrazin 's spd , meanwhile , has initiated procedures to evict him from the party , while the central bank has asked president christian wulff to approve his dismissal from the bank 's board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans think sarrazin should ' shut up ' sarrazin has threatened to go to court to prevent his dismissal from the bundesbank .
in extracts from an interview with the news weekly focus , released ahead of publication on monday , sarrazin likened the wave of criticism of him against him to a " political show trial . "
he said if german president christian wulff approved his sacking in the next few days , the decision would be overturned by the justice system .
" the president will have to consider carefully whether he wants to see this political show trial to its end , and then see -lrb- his decision -rrb- thrown out by the courts , " sarrazin said .
rules designed to protect the bundesbank 's independence mean the german president 's approval must be sought for the dismissal of a board member - something that has never happened since the institution was founded over 50 years ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 05.09.2010 german government decides to extend lifespan of nuclear plants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's reactors were due to be closed down by 2021 german chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has decided to extend the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants .
opposition parties and environmentalists are firmly against the changes . germany 's coalition government has agreed to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear power stations . " there will be a staggered extension of the lifespans , " press agency reuters reported an unnamed government official as saying on sunday evening . the official said plants would fall into two separate groups , based on the year that they were built , to determine their closure dates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters rallied against nuclear power outside the talks according to the german news agency dpa , the planned changes would mean that newer reactors built after 1980 would stay open for 14 years longer than originally planned under the government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder . older plants would be kept open for an additional eight years .
environment minister norbert roettgen and economy minister rainer bruederle confirmed later on sunday evening that the extension had been agreed upon . the coalition also agreed to an annual 2.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- tax on energy suppliers who use nuclear fuel rods to generate power .
however , the tax will be limited to a six-year period following objections from industry bosses . the negotiations , which lasted 10 hours , came amid a long-running row about extending the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants . hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside the chancellery where german chancellor angela merkel was meeting with fellow coalition leaders guido westerwelle of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of bavaria 's christian social union , along with other parliamentary leaders .
demanding an end to nuclear power , some of the demonstrators carried banners saying , " nuclear power : only the risk is secured . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with differences on nuclear policy within her own party sunday 's meeting focused on granting the country 's nuclear power plants an extra 10 to 15 years of production time and to decide on a levy for the utility companies ' expected additional profits .
schroeder 's government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 .
merkel wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
she has called the extension a " bridge . "
opposition vows to resist plans a government-commissioned report last week said without nuclear power , germany can forget its target of reducing co2 emissions by 80 percent of 1990 levels in 2050 .
the opposition and environmental groups have criticized the report as proof of merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- caving in to the country 's powerful nuclear lobby .
" the german government is reviving one of the biggest social conflicts in germany for no reason , " sigmar gabriel , head of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said on the sidelines of the anti-nuclear power demonstration in berlin on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current closure dates were agreed by the schroeder government surveys show that most germans favour an end to nuclear power generation .
germany has 17 active nuclear reactors , which account for 22.6 percent of the electricity generated in the country .
settling of differences roettgen , from the cdu , said last week he wanted to limit the extension to eight years .
bruederle , from the pro-business fdp , favored an extension of up to 20 years .
the center-right coalition no longer has a majority in the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , so ratification of the proposals would be difficult .
the coalition has hinted at the solution of bypassing the bundesrat entirely , prompting anger from state governments which are represented in the house .

world water week , which has run since 1991 , will award this year 's stockholm water prize to cholera researcher rita colwell . the 20th annual world water week conference focuses on how to better help the 884 million people worldwide who do not have access to clean drinking water . " driven by demographic change and economic growth , water is increasingly withdrawn , used , reused , treated , and disposed of , " organizers cautioned in their introduction to this year 's conference . " urbanization , agriculture , industry and climate change exert mounting pressure on both the quantity and quality of our water resources , " they added in a statement on the conference website . it is expected that more than 2,500 experts , decision-makers and business innovators will attend the event to discuss the escalating global water crisis . in the build-up to this year 's event , unicef , the united nations children 's fund , has drawn particular attention to the 1.5 million children who die each year from diseases related to contaminated water and poor hygiene . the stockholm water prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to clean water is essential for tackling world poverty , says the siwi the symposium in the swedish capital is put together by the stockholm water institute -lrb- siwi -rrb- , the organization which also awards an annual prize worth $ 150,000 -lrb- 116,000 euros -rrb- to recognize achievements in water science , water management , action or awareness building . the recipient of the 2010 stockholm water prize is the us researcher rita colwell , known for her work on infectious waterborne diseases like cholera . colwell has been praised for her " pioneering research " which identified that the cholera bacteria could survive by attaching to zooplankton in rivers , lakes and oceans .
it was previously thought that cholera could break out only due to release of sewage , but scientists now know that certain changes in the natural environment can also spread the disease . cholera is estimated to cause some 120,000 deaths each year and infects 3 to 5 million people .
siwi said colwell 's work had " helped protect the health and lives of millions . " the water crisis academics and water and sanitation ngos argue that access to water is central to alleviating poverty , improving worldwide health standards and security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 884 million people worldwide do not have access to clean drinking water speaking at the united nations ' high-level interactive dialogue on water last march , deputy secretary-general asha rose-migiro said " access to clean water and adequate sanitation are a pre-requisite for lifting people out of poverty . " the un has been accused of marginalizing water and sanitation issues in its millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- aimed at improving the lives of billions in the developing world . anders berntell from siwi told the inter press news agency that water has not received proper attention , yet is integral to fulfilling mdgs such as reducing extreme poverty and hunger by 50 percent by 2015 . " without water , we can never fight hunger ; without toilets in schools , girls will continue to drop out before finalizing their education ; and without adequate sanitation and hygiene , diseases will continue to spread , " berntell said .
the world water week conference runs until september 11 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 05.09.2010 german government decides to extend lifespan of nuclear plants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's reactors were due to be closed down by 2021 german chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has decided to extend the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants .
opposition parties and environmentalists are firmly against the changes . germany 's coalition government has agreed to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear power stations . " there will be a staggered extension of the lifespans , " press agency reuters reported an unnamed government official as saying on sunday evening . the official said plants would fall into two separate groups , based on the year that they were built , to determine their closure dates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters rallied against nuclear power outside the talks according to the german news agency dpa , the planned changes would mean that newer reactors built after 1980 would stay open for 14 years longer than originally planned under the government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder . older plants would be kept open for an additional eight years .
environment minister norbert roettgen and economy minister rainer bruederle confirmed later on sunday evening that the extension had been agreed upon . the coalition also agreed to an annual 2.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- tax on energy suppliers who use nuclear fuel rods to generate power .
however , the tax will be limited to a six-year period following objections from industry bosses . the negotiations , which lasted 10 hours , came amid a long-running row about extending the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants . hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside the chancellery where german chancellor angela merkel was meeting with fellow coalition leaders guido westerwelle of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of bavaria 's christian social union , along with other parliamentary leaders .
demanding an end to nuclear power , some of the demonstrators carried banners saying , " nuclear power : only the risk is secured . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with differences on nuclear policy within her own party sunday 's meeting focused on granting the country 's nuclear power plants an extra 10 to 15 years of production time and to decide on a levy for the utility companies ' expected additional profits .
schroeder 's government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 .
merkel wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
she has called the extension a " bridge . "
opposition vows to resist plans a government-commissioned report last week said without nuclear power , germany can forget its target of reducing co2 emissions by 80 percent of 1990 levels in 2050 .
the opposition and environmental groups have criticized the report as proof of merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- caving in to the country 's powerful nuclear lobby .
" the german government is reviving one of the biggest social conflicts in germany for no reason , " sigmar gabriel , head of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said on the sidelines of the anti-nuclear power demonstration in berlin on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current closure dates were agreed by the schroeder government surveys show that most germans favour an end to nuclear power generation .
germany has 17 active nuclear reactors , which account for 22.6 percent of the electricity generated in the country .
settling of differences roettgen , from the cdu , said last week he wanted to limit the extension to eight years .
bruederle , from the pro-business fdp , favored an extension of up to 20 years .
the center-right coalition no longer has a majority in the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , so ratification of the proposals would be difficult .
the coalition has hinted at the solution of bypassing the bundesrat entirely , prompting anger from state governments which are represented in the house .

world water week , which has run since 1991 , will award this year 's stockholm water prize to cholera researcher rita colwell . the 20th annual world water week conference focuses on how to better help the 884 million people worldwide who do not have access to clean drinking water . " driven by demographic change and economic growth , water is increasingly withdrawn , used , reused , treated , and disposed of , " organizers cautioned in their introduction to this year 's conference . " urbanization , agriculture , industry and climate change exert mounting pressure on both the quantity and quality of our water resources , " they added in a statement on the conference website . it is expected that more than 2,500 experts , decision-makers and business innovators will attend the event to discuss the escalating global water crisis . in the build-up to this year 's event , unicef , the united nations children 's fund , has drawn particular attention to the 1.5 million children who die each year from diseases related to contaminated water and poor hygiene . the stockholm water prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to clean water is essential for tackling world poverty , says the siwi the symposium in the swedish capital is put together by the stockholm water institute -lrb- siwi -rrb- , the organization which also awards an annual prize worth $ 150,000 -lrb- 116,000 euros -rrb- to recognize achievements in water science , water management , action or awareness building . the recipient of the 2010 stockholm water prize is the us researcher rita colwell , known for her work on infectious waterborne diseases like cholera . colwell has been praised for her " pioneering research " which identified that the cholera bacteria could survive by attaching to zooplankton in rivers , lakes and oceans .
it was previously thought that cholera could break out only due to release of sewage , but scientists now know that certain changes in the natural environment can also spread the disease . cholera is estimated to cause some 120,000 deaths each year and infects 3 to 5 million people .
siwi said colwell 's work had " helped protect the health and lives of millions . " the water crisis academics and water and sanitation ngos argue that access to water is central to alleviating poverty , improving worldwide health standards and security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 884 million people worldwide do not have access to clean drinking water speaking at the united nations ' high-level interactive dialogue on water last march , deputy secretary-general asha rose-migiro said " access to clean water and adequate sanitation are a pre-requisite for lifting people out of poverty . " the un has been accused of marginalizing water and sanitation issues in its millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- aimed at improving the lives of billions in the developing world . anders berntell from siwi told the inter press news agency that water has not received proper attention , yet is integral to fulfilling mdgs such as reducing extreme poverty and hunger by 50 percent by 2015 . " without water , we can never fight hunger ; without toilets in schools , girls will continue to drop out before finalizing their education ; and without adequate sanitation and hygiene , diseases will continue to spread , " berntell said .
the world water week conference runs until september 11 .

opposition parties and environmentalists are firmly against the changes . germany 's coalition government has agreed to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear power stations . " there will be a staggered extension of the lifespans , " press agency reuters reported an unnamed government official as saying on sunday evening . the official said plants would fall into two separate groups , based on the year that they were built , to determine their closure dates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters rallied against nuclear power outside the talks according to the german news agency dpa , the planned changes would mean that newer reactors built after 1980 would stay open for 14 years longer than originally planned under the government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder . older plants would be kept open for an additional eight years .
environment minister norbert roettgen and economy minister rainer bruederle confirmed later on sunday evening that the extension had been agreed upon . the coalition also agreed to an annual 2.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- tax on energy suppliers who use nuclear fuel rods to generate power .
however , the tax will be limited to a six-year period following objections from industry bosses . the negotiations , which lasted 10 hours , came amid a long-running row about extending the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants . hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside the chancellery where german chancellor angela merkel was meeting with fellow coalition leaders guido westerwelle of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of bavaria 's christian social union , along with other parliamentary leaders .
demanding an end to nuclear power , some of the demonstrators carried banners saying , " nuclear power : only the risk is secured . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with differences on nuclear policy within her own party sunday 's meeting focused on granting the country 's nuclear power plants an extra 10 to 15 years of production time and to decide on a levy for the utility companies ' expected additional profits .
schroeder 's government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 .
merkel wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
she has called the extension a " bridge . "
opposition vows to resist plans a government-commissioned report last week said without nuclear power , germany can forget its target of reducing co2 emissions by 80 percent of 1990 levels in 2050 .
the opposition and environmental groups have criticized the report as proof of merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- caving in to the country 's powerful nuclear lobby .
" the german government is reviving one of the biggest social conflicts in germany for no reason , " sigmar gabriel , head of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said on the sidelines of the anti-nuclear power demonstration in berlin on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current closure dates were agreed by the schroeder government surveys show that most germans favour an end to nuclear power generation .
germany has 17 active nuclear reactors , which account for 22.6 percent of the electricity generated in the country .
settling of differences roettgen , from the cdu , said last week he wanted to limit the extension to eight years .
bruederle , from the pro-business fdp , favored an extension of up to 20 years .
the center-right coalition no longer has a majority in the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , so ratification of the proposals would be difficult .
the coalition has hinted at the solution of bypassing the bundesrat entirely , prompting anger from state governments which are represented in the house .

world water week , which has run since 1991 , will award this year 's stockholm water prize to cholera researcher rita colwell . the 20th annual world water week conference focuses on how to better help the 884 million people worldwide who do not have access to clean drinking water . " driven by demographic change and economic growth , water is increasingly withdrawn , used , reused , treated , and disposed of , " organizers cautioned in their introduction to this year 's conference . " urbanization , agriculture , industry and climate change exert mounting pressure on both the quantity and quality of our water resources , " they added in a statement on the conference website . it is expected that more than 2,500 experts , decision-makers and business innovators will attend the event to discuss the escalating global water crisis . in the build-up to this year 's event , unicef , the united nations children 's fund , has drawn particular attention to the 1.5 million children who die each year from diseases related to contaminated water and poor hygiene . the stockholm water prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to clean water is essential for tackling world poverty , says the siwi the symposium in the swedish capital is put together by the stockholm water institute -lrb- siwi -rrb- , the organization which also awards an annual prize worth $ 150,000 -lrb- 116,000 euros -rrb- to recognize achievements in water science , water management , action or awareness building . the recipient of the 2010 stockholm water prize is the us researcher rita colwell , known for her work on infectious waterborne diseases like cholera . colwell has been praised for her " pioneering research " which identified that the cholera bacteria could survive by attaching to zooplankton in rivers , lakes and oceans .
it was previously thought that cholera could break out only due to release of sewage , but scientists now know that certain changes in the natural environment can also spread the disease . cholera is estimated to cause some 120,000 deaths each year and infects 3 to 5 million people .
siwi said colwell 's work had " helped protect the health and lives of millions . " the water crisis academics and water and sanitation ngos argue that access to water is central to alleviating poverty , improving worldwide health standards and security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 884 million people worldwide do not have access to clean drinking water speaking at the united nations ' high-level interactive dialogue on water last march , deputy secretary-general asha rose-migiro said " access to clean water and adequate sanitation are a pre-requisite for lifting people out of poverty . " the un has been accused of marginalizing water and sanitation issues in its millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- aimed at improving the lives of billions in the developing world . anders berntell from siwi told the inter press news agency that water has not received proper attention , yet is integral to fulfilling mdgs such as reducing extreme poverty and hunger by 50 percent by 2015 . " without water , we can never fight hunger ; without toilets in schools , girls will continue to drop out before finalizing their education ; and without adequate sanitation and hygiene , diseases will continue to spread , " berntell said .
the world water week conference runs until september 11 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 05.09.2010 german government decides to extend lifespan of nuclear plants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's reactors were due to be closed down by 2021 german chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has decided to extend the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants .
opposition parties and environmentalists are firmly against the changes . germany 's coalition government has agreed to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear power stations . " there will be a staggered extension of the lifespans , " press agency reuters reported an unnamed government official as saying on sunday evening . the official said plants would fall into two separate groups , based on the year that they were built , to determine their closure dates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters rallied against nuclear power outside the talks according to the german news agency dpa , the planned changes would mean that newer reactors built after 1980 would stay open for 14 years longer than originally planned under the government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder . older plants would be kept open for an additional eight years .
environment minister norbert roettgen and economy minister rainer bruederle confirmed later on sunday evening that the extension had been agreed upon . the coalition also agreed to an annual 2.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- tax on energy suppliers who use nuclear fuel rods to generate power .
however , the tax will be limited to a six-year period following objections from industry bosses . the negotiations , which lasted 10 hours , came amid a long-running row about extending the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants . hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside the chancellery where german chancellor angela merkel was meeting with fellow coalition leaders guido westerwelle of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of bavaria 's christian social union , along with other parliamentary leaders .
demanding an end to nuclear power , some of the demonstrators carried banners saying , " nuclear power : only the risk is secured . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with differences on nuclear policy within her own party sunday 's meeting focused on granting the country 's nuclear power plants an extra 10 to 15 years of production time and to decide on a levy for the utility companies ' expected additional profits .
schroeder 's government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 .
merkel wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
she has called the extension a " bridge . "
opposition vows to resist plans a government-commissioned report last week said without nuclear power , germany can forget its target of reducing co2 emissions by 80 percent of 1990 levels in 2050 .
the opposition and environmental groups have criticized the report as proof of merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- caving in to the country 's powerful nuclear lobby .
" the german government is reviving one of the biggest social conflicts in germany for no reason , " sigmar gabriel , head of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said on the sidelines of the anti-nuclear power demonstration in berlin on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current closure dates were agreed by the schroeder government surveys show that most germans favour an end to nuclear power generation .
germany has 17 active nuclear reactors , which account for 22.6 percent of the electricity generated in the country .
settling of differences roettgen , from the cdu , said last week he wanted to limit the extension to eight years .
bruederle , from the pro-business fdp , favored an extension of up to 20 years .
the center-right coalition no longer has a majority in the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , so ratification of the proposals would be difficult .
the coalition has hinted at the solution of bypassing the bundesrat entirely , prompting anger from state governments which are represented in the house .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 05.09.2010 eastern german soccer clubs struggle to stay in the game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lokomotive leipzig a respected team ?
sure , back in the 1970s there 's no lack of soccer talent in the east of germany - but the money is n't there to support it .
this season not a single eastern german team is in the top flight , the bundesliga . managers of eastern german football clubs may be forgiven for hankering after the good old days .
under the communist east german government they did n't have to spend their time chasing sponsors , dealing with tax returns or worrying about revenue .
most importantly , though , east german clubs were real contenders back in the day .
fc magdeburg won the european cup winners ' cup in 1974 .
that same year , the east german team defeated west germany during the fifa world cup .
clubs like dynamo dresden or 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig were playing at the top of their game .
twenty years after unification , these same clubs are now languishing in the lower divisions of the league tables .
they 're lucky to attract a crowd of a thousand to watch them play , and with every annual review they fear for their licenses .
not a single club from the east is in germany 's top division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german teams have n't always been bad at soccer there wo n't even be any bundesliga games in reunified berlin this season - after 13 years , hertha bsc , in the old days a west german team , was relegated back in may , following a dismal campaign .
three eastern german clubs will be playing alongside hertha in the second division , and there are another five in the third .
hans-georg moldenhauer , president of the north-eastern german football association -lrb- nofv -rrb- admits that " the current situation of professional football in eastern germany is far from satisfactory . "
so how did it come to this sad state of affairs ?
wherever you go , the answer is the same : not enough sponsors , not enough money , and a history of poor management .
the amalgamation of east and west german soccer into one unified german competitive group in 1991 was too much of a challenge for the east german clubs ; they simply were n't able to make the leap from socialism to capitalism in the space of just a few months .
" all of a sudden we got no state subsidies any more , and we had no idea how to run a market-based operation , " said detlef krauspe , the former boss of sachsen leipzig .
the best players , like andreas thom , ulf kirsten , and later michael ballack , moved to the rich clubs in the west .
the former east had no private companies that could have invested money in the teams .
vicious circle there are some such companies today , but most of them are only small or medium-sized businesses with very little money for sports sponsorship .
" the eastern german clubs have lots of small sponsors that do n't provide that much in the way of finance , and do n't offer long-term partnerships , " says nofv president moldenhauer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german clubs generally only make news when fans make trouble the clubs are therefore hardly ever in a position to make major investments .
in order to attract big companies as sponsorship partners - like the deal bayern munich has secured with deutsche telekom - the eastern german clubs would have to be much more successful than they are at present .
they would also have to acquire a more positive image .
the image of eastern german soccer has suffered badly in recent years .
media reports have focused not on victories but increasingly on hooliganism , riots and racist attacks , both inside and outside the stadiums .
georg moldenhauer says it 's unfair .
" this is n't an eastern german problem , and it 's not football 's problem either - it 's a problem for all of society , " he says .
the media generally find stories like these more interesting than devoting themselves to the analysis of fourth-division games .
rb leipzig as a model now , though , eastern german football has a new story to tempt the sports reporters : rb leipzig .
in 2009 austrian drinks manufacturer red bull acquired a license from the club ssv markranstaedt in saxony to compete in german football .
a new club , rb leipzig , was founded , replacing ssv in the fifth-division nofv-oberliga sued .
players were bought for the team , as was the license for leipzig central stadium , subsequently renamed the red bull arena .
at the end of its first season rb leipzig finished league champion and was immediately promoted to the regionalliga .
the new management 's goal is for the team to play in the bundesliga within 10 years .
since the start of the 2010 season , the red bull arena , the biggest stadium in the territory of the eastern states , has been rb leipzig 's home ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red bull has pumped money into leipzig but the project is far from popular among football fans in leipzig .
there have been huge protests and a lot of hostility from supporters of fc sachsen leipzig and 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig .
they 're worried about a decline in traditional fan culture and the commercialization of soccer in the region .
by contrast , though , a large part of the local population approves of red bull 's investment .
nofv president moldenhauer is also happy about it .
" in the past two decades we 've always criticized the fact that the big sponsors just are n't out there , " he says .
" so i 'm pleased that now , for the first time , we have a model for this kind of partnership here in eastern germany . "
moldenhauer believes that what is almost more important is the signal it sends out to regional football : " we badly need clubs here to act as beacons , " he says : to set high standards once again , and have a positive effect on eastern german football .
investing in young talent however , moldenhauer admits that the rb leipzig model is an exception rather than a panacea : " the clubs here must keep working on what they already have going for them , which is the fantastic work they do with young players . "
in the past , eastern clubs were more or less forced to develop young local talent because they could n't afford to buy in players from elsewhere .
in addition to the work done by the clubs , the controversial east german sports schools -lrb- kjs -rrb- have now been transformed into modern football academies , and talented local children have profited from them .
the german football association has also invested - albeit not yet enough - in eastern german football : eight of its 36 elite sports schools are now located in the east .
bildunterschrift : adler left his home team leipzig to play for leverkusen but what happens if a club ca n't persuade its own up-and-coming footballers to stay , simply because it is n't able to offer them much of a future ?
german national team goalkeeper rene adler plays not for his home club , vfb leipzig , but for bayer leverkusen - even though he 's often talks about how much leipzig means to him .
georg moldenhauer does n't think this will stop the eastern clubs from rising to the top of the tree once more .
" even if two out of every 10 good players move on , we 'll still have a good quota , " he says .
he points out that this problem does n't just affect eastern germany .
all over the world top players are keen to move to the top clubs .
moldenhauer cites the example of sami khedira : he did n't stay in stuttgart , but allowed himself to be seduced away by real madrid .
cautiously optimistic the nofv president believes that , in recent years , most clubs have improved their structures and have caught up with their western counterparts , particularly where management is concerned .
the lack of big sponsors and the money they bring remains a problem , but there 's not much the clubs can do about that .
in spite of their economic woes , some have been developing very positively for quite a while now - and they are not just the usual suspects .
moldenhauer singles out energie cottbus and erzgebirge aue .
" it 's astonishing what energie cottbus has achieved with the little it has at its disposal , " he says .

while it has been an accepted practice in the united states for a long time , that 's not the case in europe . when germans want to talk about whistle-blowing they quickly run into a linguistic problem : there is no german word for it .
in order to describe a whistle-blower in their own language germans have to resort to a negatively connotated word like informant or paraphrase it some other way .
that 's why germans often simply use the english word to talk about whistle-blowing .
the lack of a proper name for the practice is indicative of the role and acceptance of whistle-blowing in germany .
" in germany there are no laws to protect whistle-blowers or to serve as an incentive for whistle-blowing , " johannes ludwig , a professor at hamburg 's university of applied sciences and a board member of germany 's whistle-blower netzwerk , told deutsche welle .
" in the us there is both . "
the reasons why whistle-blowing plays a much smaller role in germany than in the us are historical and also shaped by mentality , argues ludwig .
the us was founded by people that did n't want to acccept the traditional hierarchical structures in europe .
" and that 's why in the us everything that has to do with the state and government has to work effectively and serve a clear purpose .
the americans have a much looser understanding of government and state and their relation to government and business is much less bureacratic and authority-driven than ours . "
what 's more , argues ludwig , democracy in germany , even compared to other european countries has a relatively short history .
" and that 's why it is understandable that rules or laws about whistle-blowing which actually only serves the purpose to improve things , are not as developed in germany as they are in other countries . "
protecting whistle-blowers since the civil war by comparison , the first legal incentive for whistle-blowing in the us dates back to the civil war .
the false claims act , which was passed by congress in 1863 , was a reaction by the federal government to deal with fraud .
basically it promised a reward to whistle-blowers who could prove that the government was being defrauded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enron scandal led to a further tightening of whistle-blower laws with some minor changes that law is still in effect today and remains an important factor in recognizing fraud , says alexander dyck , a finance professor and whistle-blowing expert at the rotman school of management at the university of toronto .
" if someone brings information to light through whistle-blowing action and the government is being defrauded and the action is successfully pursued than that whistle-blower is entitled to between 15 and 30 percent of the money the government collects as a result of stopping this wrongdoing , " he told deutsche wellle .
tightening whistle-blower protection through sarbanes-oxley more recently , the us government improved protection for whistle-blowers through the so-called sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 as a reaction to the enron and other corporate scandals .
it also opened up the false claims act to private corporations .
" corporations effectively have to have a whistle-blowing policy , have to set up a hotline , whereby if there are employees or others in the firm who think there is some wrongdoing , you can make the phone calls and allegations and that information is then communicated to folks within the firm that then follow up on this , " explains dyck .
the purpose of all those and additional measures that were instituted in march is to provide incentives for whistle-blowers to speak up about wrongdoings they know about and to protect them as much as possible from retribution for doing it .
less stringent laws , more formal channels in europe in europe , not just in germany , many of these mechanisms simply do n't exist yet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major us companies are required to have instituted protections for whistle-blowers " one possible reason for less whistle-blowing in europe is that many of the activities that whistle-blowing might bring to light would n't be illegal in many european countries , says dyck .
" some things of corporate wrongdoing would be illegal in the us , but would not be illegal in europe , so whistle-blowing on them would n't be very effective . "
however , dyck also offers a more positive explanation of why whistle-blowing is less of a phenomenon in europe than in the us : " there are more formal channels in europe for employees who are concerned about wrongdoing to bring that information to light without going through a whistle-blowing channel , " he notes . " the existence of works councils , worker representatives on boards provide another channel for that sort of information to perculate up to the highest level of decision making that would n't require going through a formal whistle-blowing channel . "
while it might take some time until european countries institute an office of the whistle-blower protection program like it exists within the us department of labor , the experts agree that europe needs to provide more incentives for whistle-blowers to speak out if it wants to get serious about improving corporate governance both in the business and governmental sector .

while it has been an accepted practice in the united states for a long time , that 's not the case in europe . when germans want to talk about whistle-blowing they quickly run into a linguistic problem : there is no german word for it .
in order to describe a whistle-blower in their own language germans have to resort to a negatively connotated word like informant or paraphrase it some other way .
that 's why germans often simply use the english word to talk about whistle-blowing .
the lack of a proper name for the practice is indicative of the role and acceptance of whistle-blowing in germany .
" in germany there are no laws to protect whistle-blowers or to serve as an incentive for whistle-blowing , " johannes ludwig , a professor at hamburg 's university of applied sciences and a board member of germany 's whistle-blower netzwerk , told deutsche welle .
" in the us there is both . "
the reasons why whistle-blowing plays a much smaller role in germany than in the us are historical and also shaped by mentality , argues ludwig .
the us was founded by people that did n't want to acccept the traditional hierarchical structures in europe .
" and that 's why in the us everything that has to do with the state and government has to work effectively and serve a clear purpose .
the americans have a much looser understanding of government and state and their relation to government and business is much less bureacratic and authority-driven than ours . "
what 's more , argues ludwig , democracy in germany , even compared to other european countries has a relatively short history .
" and that 's why it is understandable that rules or laws about whistle-blowing which actually only serves the purpose to improve things , are not as developed in germany as they are in other countries . "
protecting whistle-blowers since the civil war by comparison , the first legal incentive for whistle-blowing in the us dates back to the civil war .
the false claims act , which was passed by congress in 1863 , was a reaction by the federal government to deal with fraud .
basically it promised a reward to whistle-blowers who could prove that the government was being defrauded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enron scandal led to a further tightening of whistle-blower laws with some minor changes that law is still in effect today and remains an important factor in recognizing fraud , says alexander dyck , a finance professor and whistle-blowing expert at the rotman school of management at the university of toronto .
" if someone brings information to light through whistle-blowing action and the government is being defrauded and the action is successfully pursued than that whistle-blower is entitled to between 15 and 30 percent of the money the government collects as a result of stopping this wrongdoing , " he told deutsche wellle .
tightening whistle-blower protection through sarbanes-oxley more recently , the us government improved protection for whistle-blowers through the so-called sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 as a reaction to the enron and other corporate scandals .
it also opened up the false claims act to private corporations .
" corporations effectively have to have a whistle-blowing policy , have to set up a hotline , whereby if there are employees or others in the firm who think there is some wrongdoing , you can make the phone calls and allegations and that information is then communicated to folks within the firm that then follow up on this , " explains dyck .
the purpose of all those and additional measures that were instituted in march is to provide incentives for whistle-blowers to speak up about wrongdoings they know about and to protect them as much as possible from retribution for doing it .
less stringent laws , more formal channels in europe in europe , not just in germany , many of these mechanisms simply do n't exist yet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major us companies are required to have instituted protections for whistle-blowers " one possible reason for less whistle-blowing in europe is that many of the activities that whistle-blowing might bring to light would n't be illegal in many european countries , says dyck .
" some things of corporate wrongdoing would be illegal in the us , but would not be illegal in europe , so whistle-blowing on them would n't be very effective . "
however , dyck also offers a more positive explanation of why whistle-blowing is less of a phenomenon in europe than in the us : " there are more formal channels in europe for employees who are concerned about wrongdoing to bring that information to light without going through a whistle-blowing channel , " he notes . " the existence of works councils , worker representatives on boards provide another channel for that sort of information to perculate up to the highest level of decision making that would n't require going through a formal whistle-blowing channel . "
while it might take some time until european countries institute an office of the whistle-blower protection program like it exists within the us department of labor , the experts agree that europe needs to provide more incentives for whistle-blowers to speak out if it wants to get serious about improving corporate governance both in the business and governmental sector .

" this is a big problem and we can talk about it openly , without arousing suspicions of xenophobia , " merkel said in the interview published on sunday , september 5 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is more work to do on subject of immigration , says merkel but merkel warned against automatically linking certain religions with violence . " this is misleading , " she said .
" violence among young people is often a sign that they see no perspective for themselves .
all that helps is education , education , education . " " our state is making many offers , but the main responsibility lies with the parents , and can not be taken on by schools or the state , " merkel added . merkel said it was crucial to maintain law and order in violent city districts with high migrant populations .
she said one solution would be to hire more civil servants with a foreign background . " it would surely help if we had more migrants in the police , youth welfare offices and other authorities , " she said . sarrazin debate her comments came after germany 's central bank voted on thursday to sack its controversial member thilo sarrazin , who sparked outrage and debate with claims in his new book that muslim immigrants are lowering german intelligence and harming society more than they contributed to it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin 's book has caused an uproar in germany sarrazin , a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- received partial backing from party leader sigmar gabriel , who said there was an element of truth in his book , entitled " germany abolishes itself . "
" i think we are experiencing much of what he is describing in -lrb- the book -rrb- .
there is no question , " gabriel said .
he did not , however , share sarrazin 's thesis that muslim integration problems resulted from genetic predispositions .
the spd has initiated procedures to evict sarrazin from the party , while the central bank has asked president christian wulff to approve his dismissal from the bank 's board .
the german government 's official in charge of integration , maria boehmer , acknowledged that there were problems in conveying immigration policy .
" the gap between the population and politics concerns me , " boehmer told focus magazine .
reaction to the thilo sarrazin case shows " that we have to take the offensive and talk about problems and successes of -lrb- our -rrb- integration policy " .
legal challenge sarrazin has threatened to go to court to prevent his dismissal from the bundesbank .
in extracts from an interview with the news weekly focus , released ahead of monday 's publication , sarrazin likened a wave of criticism of him to a " political show trial . "
he said if german president christian wulff approved his sacking in the next few days , the decision would be overturned by the justice system .
" the president will have to consider carefully whether he wants to see this political show trial to its end , and then see -lrb- his decision -rrb- thrown out by the courts , " sarrazin said .
rules designed to protect the bundesbank 's independence mean the german president 's approval must be sought for the dismissal of a board member - something that has never happened since it the institution founded in 1957 . author : nigel tandy -lrb- reuters / dpa -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 05.09.2010 one in five germans would vote for banker embroiled in race row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin says he will fight his dismissal from the bundesbank a survey says one in five germans would vote for a party headed by outspoken banker thilo sarrazin , whose controversial book on race and integration has topped german best-seller lists since being published last week . around 20 percent of german voters would back a party set up by thilo sarrazin , the controversial banker who has kicked up a storm with his views on race and immigration , a survey revealed on sunday .
no such party exists ; sarrazin is a member of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and intends to remain there - despite recent moves by the spd to evict him .
however , just over 18 percent of germans polled said they would vote for a party led by sarrazin , according to the survey published in the mass-circulated bild am sonntag newspaper .
sarrazin , a board member in germany 's central bank , sparked a furious debate when he said that muslim immigrants in germany were failing to integrate , had too many children and achieved poor levels of education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' germany does away with itself ' is topping best-seller lists the 65-year-old banker sparked widepread anger by saying the causes were not just social , but genetic .
his book , germany does away with itself , argues that intelligence is largely inherited , and that muslim immigrants were bringing down german standards .
book hugely popular according to the bild survey , sarrazin 's views found the greatest support amongst followers of the radical left party , but also resonated with voters of the current center-right coalition .
" for them , sarrazin is somebody who is finally saying what many are thinking , " said the head of pollsters emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner .
demand has surged for sarrazin 's book , which has topped the bestseller list on bookseller amazon 's german website since its publication a week ago .
book tour dates are sold out across the country .
" the rush is unbelievable , " said marion boesker in the munich literature house , a venue where sarrazin is scheduled to appear .
she added that people were worried that sarrazin 's visit could be cancelled .
" the audience does n't want censorship .
they want to talk about the things that are affecting them , " boesker added .
sarrazin calls criticism ' political show trial ' sarrazin 's spd , meanwhile , has initiated procedures to evict him from the party , while the central bank has asked president christian wulff to approve his dismissal from the bank 's board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans think sarrazin should ' shut up ' sarrazin has threatened to go to court to prevent his dismissal from the bundesbank .
in extracts from an interview with the news weekly focus , released ahead of publication on monday , sarrazin likened the wave of criticism of him against him to a " political show trial . "
he said if german president christian wulff approved his sacking in the next few days , the decision would be overturned by the justice system .
" the president will have to consider carefully whether he wants to see this political show trial to its end , and then see -lrb- his decision -rrb- thrown out by the courts , " sarrazin said .
rules designed to protect the bundesbank 's independence mean the german president 's approval must be sought for the dismissal of a board member - something that has never happened since the institution was founded over 50 years ago .

it was previously thought that cholera could break out only due to release of sewage , but scientists now know that certain changes in the natural environment can also spread the disease . cholera is estimated to cause some 120,000 deaths each year and infects 3 to 5 million people .

" urbanization , agriculture , industry and climate change exert mounting pressure on both the quantity and quality of our water resources , " they added in a statement on the conference website . it is expected that more than 2,500 experts , decision-makers and business innovators will attend the event to discuss the escalating global water crisis . in the build-up to this year 's event , unicef , the united nations children 's fund , has drawn particular attention to the 1.5 million children who die each year from diseases related to contaminated water and poor hygiene . the stockholm water prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to clean water is essential for tackling world poverty , says the siwi the symposium in the swedish capital is put together by the stockholm water institute -lrb- siwi -rrb- , the organization which also awards an annual prize worth $ 150,000 -lrb- 116,000 euros -rrb- to recognize achievements in water science , water management , action or awareness building . the recipient of the 2010 stockholm water prize is the us researcher rita colwell , known for her work on infectious waterborne diseases like cholera . colwell has been praised for her " pioneering research " which identified that the cholera bacteria could survive by attaching to zooplankton in rivers , lakes and oceans .
it was previously thought that cholera could break out only due to release of sewage , but scientists now know that certain changes in the natural environment can also spread the disease . cholera is estimated to cause some 120,000 deaths each year and infects 3 to 5 million people .
siwi said colwell 's work had " helped protect the health and lives of millions . " the water crisis academics and water and sanitation ngos argue that access to water is central to alleviating poverty , improving worldwide health standards and security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 884 million people worldwide do not have access to clean drinking water speaking at the united nations ' high-level interactive dialogue on water last march , deputy secretary-general asha rose-migiro said " access to clean water and adequate sanitation are a pre-requisite for lifting people out of poverty . " the un has been accused of marginalizing water and sanitation issues in its millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- aimed at improving the lives of billions in the developing world . anders berntell from siwi told the inter press news agency that water has not received proper attention , yet is integral to fulfilling mdgs such as reducing extreme poverty and hunger by 50 percent by 2015 . " without water , we can never fight hunger ; without toilets in schools , girls will continue to drop out before finalizing their education ; and without adequate sanitation and hygiene , diseases will continue to spread , " berntell said .
the world water week conference runs until september 11 .

no such party exists ; sarrazin is a member of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and intends to remain there - despite recent moves by the spd to evict him .
however , just over 18 percent of germans polled said they would vote for a party led by sarrazin , according to the survey published in the mass-circulated bild am sonntag newspaper .
sarrazin , a board member in germany 's central bank , sparked a furious debate when he said that muslim immigrants in germany were failing to integrate , had too many children and achieved poor levels of education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' germany does away with itself ' is topping best-seller lists the 65-year-old banker sparked widepread anger by saying the causes were not just social , but genetic .
his book , germany does away with itself , argues that intelligence is largely inherited , and that muslim immigrants were bringing down german standards .
book hugely popular according to the bild survey , sarrazin 's views found the greatest support amongst followers of the radical left party , but also resonated with voters of the current center-right coalition .
" for them , sarrazin is somebody who is finally saying what many are thinking , " said the head of pollsters emnid , klaus-peter schoeppner .
demand has surged for sarrazin 's book , which has topped the bestseller list on bookseller amazon 's german website since its publication a week ago .
book tour dates are sold out across the country .
" the rush is unbelievable , " said marion boesker in the munich literature house , a venue where sarrazin is scheduled to appear .
she added that people were worried that sarrazin 's visit could be cancelled .
" the audience does n't want censorship .
they want to talk about the things that are affecting them , " boesker added .
sarrazin calls criticism ' political show trial ' sarrazin 's spd , meanwhile , has initiated procedures to evict him from the party , while the central bank has asked president christian wulff to approve his dismissal from the bank 's board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans think sarrazin should ' shut up ' sarrazin has threatened to go to court to prevent his dismissal from the bundesbank .
in extracts from an interview with the news weekly focus , released ahead of publication on monday , sarrazin likened the wave of criticism of him against him to a " political show trial . "
he said if german president christian wulff approved his sacking in the next few days , the decision would be overturned by the justice system .
" the president will have to consider carefully whether he wants to see this political show trial to its end , and then see -lrb- his decision -rrb- thrown out by the courts , " sarrazin said .

opposition parties and environmentalists are firmly against the changes . germany 's coalition government has agreed to extend the lifetime of the country 's nuclear power stations . " there will be a staggered extension of the lifespans , " press agency reuters reported an unnamed government official as saying on sunday evening . the official said plants would fall into two separate groups , based on the year that they were built , to determine their closure dates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters rallied against nuclear power outside the talks according to the german news agency dpa , the planned changes would mean that newer reactors built after 1980 would stay open for 14 years longer than originally planned under the government of former chancellor gerhard schroeder . older plants would be kept open for an additional eight years .
environment minister norbert roettgen and economy minister rainer bruederle confirmed later on sunday evening that the extension had been agreed upon . the coalition also agreed to an annual 2.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 3 billion -rrb- tax on energy suppliers who use nuclear fuel rods to generate power .
however , the tax will be limited to a six-year period following objections from industry bosses . the negotiations , which lasted 10 hours , came amid a long-running row about extending the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power plants . hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside the chancellery where german chancellor angela merkel was meeting with fellow coalition leaders guido westerwelle of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and horst seehofer of bavaria 's christian social union , along with other parliamentary leaders .
demanding an end to nuclear power , some of the demonstrators carried banners saying , " nuclear power : only the risk is secured . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has to deal with differences on nuclear policy within her own party sunday 's meeting focused on granting the country 's nuclear power plants an extra 10 to 15 years of production time and to decide on a levy for the utility companies ' expected additional profits .
schroeder 's government decided in 2000 to shut down all nuclear plants by 2021 .
merkel wants to extend that deadline by 10 or 15 years as a stop-gap measure until renewable energy sources are more developed .
she has called the extension a " bridge . "
opposition vows to resist plans a government-commissioned report last week said without nuclear power , germany can forget its target of reducing co2 emissions by 80 percent of 1990 levels in 2050 .
the opposition and environmental groups have criticized the report as proof of merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- caving in to the country 's powerful nuclear lobby .
" the german government is reviving one of the biggest social conflicts in germany for no reason , " sigmar gabriel , head of the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said on the sidelines of the anti-nuclear power demonstration in berlin on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current closure dates were agreed by the schroeder government surveys show that most germans favour an end to nuclear power generation .
germany has 17 active nuclear reactors , which account for 22.6 percent of the electricity generated in the country .
settling of differences roettgen , from the cdu , said last week he wanted to limit the extension to eight years .
bruederle , from the pro-business fdp , favored an extension of up to 20 years .
the center-right coalition no longer has a majority in the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , so ratification of the proposals would be difficult .
the coalition has hinted at the solution of bypassing the bundesrat entirely , prompting anger from state governments which are represented in the house .

while it has been an accepted practice in the united states for a long time , that 's not the case in europe . when germans want to talk about whistle-blowing they quickly run into a linguistic problem : there is no german word for it .
in order to describe a whistle-blower in their own language germans have to resort to a negatively connotated word like informant or paraphrase it some other way .
that 's why germans often simply use the english word to talk about whistle-blowing .
the lack of a proper name for the practice is indicative of the role and acceptance of whistle-blowing in germany .
" in germany there are no laws to protect whistle-blowers or to serve as an incentive for whistle-blowing , " johannes ludwig , a professor at hamburg 's university of applied sciences and a board member of germany 's whistle-blower netzwerk , told deutsche welle .
" in the us there is both . "
the reasons why whistle-blowing plays a much smaller role in germany than in the us are historical and also shaped by mentality , argues ludwig .
the us was founded by people that did n't want to acccept the traditional hierarchical structures in europe .
" and that 's why in the us everything that has to do with the state and government has to work effectively and serve a clear purpose .
the americans have a much looser understanding of government and state and their relation to government and business is much less bureacratic and authority-driven than ours . "
what 's more , argues ludwig , democracy in germany , even compared to other european countries has a relatively short history .
" and that 's why it is understandable that rules or laws about whistle-blowing which actually only serves the purpose to improve things , are not as developed in germany as they are in other countries . "
protecting whistle-blowers since the civil war by comparison , the first legal incentive for whistle-blowing in the us dates back to the civil war .
the false claims act , which was passed by congress in 1863 , was a reaction by the federal government to deal with fraud .
basically it promised a reward to whistle-blowers who could prove that the government was being defrauded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enron scandal led to a further tightening of whistle-blower laws with some minor changes that law is still in effect today and remains an important factor in recognizing fraud , says alexander dyck , a finance professor and whistle-blowing expert at the rotman school of management at the university of toronto .
" if someone brings information to light through whistle-blowing action and the government is being defrauded and the action is successfully pursued than that whistle-blower is entitled to between 15 and 30 percent of the money the government collects as a result of stopping this wrongdoing , " he told deutsche wellle .
tightening whistle-blower protection through sarbanes-oxley more recently , the us government improved protection for whistle-blowers through the so-called sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 as a reaction to the enron and other corporate scandals .
it also opened up the false claims act to private corporations .
" corporations effectively have to have a whistle-blowing policy , have to set up a hotline , whereby if there are employees or others in the firm who think there is some wrongdoing , you can make the phone calls and allegations and that information is then communicated to folks within the firm that then follow up on this , " explains dyck .
the purpose of all those and additional measures that were instituted in march is to provide incentives for whistle-blowers to speak up about wrongdoings they know about and to protect them as much as possible from retribution for doing it .
less stringent laws , more formal channels in europe in europe , not just in germany , many of these mechanisms simply do n't exist yet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major us companies are required to have instituted protections for whistle-blowers " one possible reason for less whistle-blowing in europe is that many of the activities that whistle-blowing might bring to light would n't be illegal in many european countries , says dyck .
" some things of corporate wrongdoing would be illegal in the us , but would not be illegal in europe , so whistle-blowing on them would n't be very effective . "
however , dyck also offers a more positive explanation of why whistle-blowing is less of a phenomenon in europe than in the us : " there are more formal channels in europe for employees who are concerned about wrongdoing to bring that information to light without going through a whistle-blowing channel , " he notes . " the existence of works councils , worker representatives on boards provide another channel for that sort of information to perculate up to the highest level of decision making that would n't require going through a formal whistle-blowing channel . "
while it might take some time until european countries institute an office of the whistle-blower protection program like it exists within the us department of labor , the experts agree that europe needs to provide more incentives for whistle-blowers to speak out if it wants to get serious about improving corporate governance both in the business and governmental sector .

while it has been an accepted practice in the united states for a long time , that 's not the case in europe . when germans want to talk about whistle-blowing they quickly run into a linguistic problem : there is no german word for it .
in order to describe a whistle-blower in their own language germans have to resort to a negatively connotated word like informant or paraphrase it some other way .

" in germany there are no laws to protect whistle-blowers or to serve as an incentive for whistle-blowing , " johannes ludwig , a professor at hamburg 's university of applied sciences and a board member of germany 's whistle-blower netzwerk , told deutsche welle .

the reasons why whistle-blowing plays a much smaller role in germany than in the us are historical and also shaped by mentality , argues ludwig .
the us was founded by people that did n't want to acccept the traditional hierarchical structures in europe .
" and that 's why in the us everything that has to do with the state and government has to work effectively and serve a clear purpose .
the americans have a much looser understanding of government and state and their relation to government and business is much less bureacratic and authority-driven than ours . "
what 's more , argues ludwig , democracy in germany , even compared to other european countries has a relatively short history .
" and that 's why it is understandable that rules or laws about whistle-blowing which actually only serves the purpose to improve things , are not as developed in germany as they are in other countries . "

" corporations effectively have to have a whistle-blowing policy , have to set up a hotline , whereby if there are employees or others in the firm who think there is some wrongdoing , you can make the phone calls and allegations and that information is then communicated to folks within the firm that then follow up on this , " explains dyck .

sure , back in the 1970s there 's no lack of soccer talent in the east of germany - but the money is n't there to support it .
this season not a single eastern german team is in the top flight , the bundesliga . managers of eastern german football clubs may be forgiven for hankering after the good old days .
under the communist east german government they did n't have to spend their time chasing sponsors , dealing with tax returns or worrying about revenue .
most importantly , though , east german clubs were real contenders back in the day .
fc magdeburg won the european cup winners ' cup in 1974 .
that same year , the east german team defeated west germany during the fifa world cup .
clubs like dynamo dresden or 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig were playing at the top of their game .
twenty years after unification , these same clubs are now languishing in the lower divisions of the league tables .
they 're lucky to attract a crowd of a thousand to watch them play , and with every annual review they fear for their licenses .
not a single club from the east is in germany 's top division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german teams have n't always been bad at soccer there wo n't even be any bundesliga games in reunified berlin this season - after 13 years , hertha bsc , in the old days a west german team , was relegated back in may , following a dismal campaign .
three eastern german clubs will be playing alongside hertha in the second division , and there are another five in the third .
hans-georg moldenhauer , president of the north-eastern german football association -lrb- nofv -rrb- admits that " the current situation of professional football in eastern germany is far from satisfactory . "
so how did it come to this sad state of affairs ?
wherever you go , the answer is the same : not enough sponsors , not enough money , and a history of poor management .
the amalgamation of east and west german soccer into one unified german competitive group in 1991 was too much of a challenge for the east german clubs ; they simply were n't able to make the leap from socialism to capitalism in the space of just a few months .
" all of a sudden we got no state subsidies any more , and we had no idea how to run a market-based operation , " said detlef krauspe , the former boss of sachsen leipzig .
the best players , like andreas thom , ulf kirsten , and later michael ballack , moved to the rich clubs in the west .
the former east had no private companies that could have invested money in the teams .
vicious circle there are some such companies today , but most of them are only small or medium-sized businesses with very little money for sports sponsorship .
" the eastern german clubs have lots of small sponsors that do n't provide that much in the way of finance , and do n't offer long-term partnerships , " says nofv president moldenhauer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german clubs generally only make news when fans make trouble the clubs are therefore hardly ever in a position to make major investments .
in order to attract big companies as sponsorship partners - like the deal bayern munich has secured with deutsche telekom - the eastern german clubs would have to be much more successful than they are at present .
they would also have to acquire a more positive image .
the image of eastern german soccer has suffered badly in recent years .
media reports have focused not on victories but increasingly on hooliganism , riots and racist attacks , both inside and outside the stadiums .
georg moldenhauer says it 's unfair .
" this is n't an eastern german problem , and it 's not football 's problem either - it 's a problem for all of society , " he says .
the media generally find stories like these more interesting than devoting themselves to the analysis of fourth-division games .
rb leipzig as a model now , though , eastern german football has a new story to tempt the sports reporters : rb leipzig .
in 2009 austrian drinks manufacturer red bull acquired a license from the club ssv markranstaedt in saxony to compete in german football .
a new club , rb leipzig , was founded , replacing ssv in the fifth-division nofv-oberliga sued .
players were bought for the team , as was the license for leipzig central stadium , subsequently renamed the red bull arena .
at the end of its first season rb leipzig finished league champion and was immediately promoted to the regionalliga .
the new management 's goal is for the team to play in the bundesliga within 10 years .
since the start of the 2010 season , the red bull arena , the biggest stadium in the territory of the eastern states , has been rb leipzig 's home ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red bull has pumped money into leipzig but the project is far from popular among football fans in leipzig .
there have been huge protests and a lot of hostility from supporters of fc sachsen leipzig and 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig .
they 're worried about a decline in traditional fan culture and the commercialization of soccer in the region .
by contrast , though , a large part of the local population approves of red bull 's investment .
nofv president moldenhauer is also happy about it .
" in the past two decades we 've always criticized the fact that the big sponsors just are n't out there , " he says .
" so i 'm pleased that now , for the first time , we have a model for this kind of partnership here in eastern germany . "
moldenhauer believes that what is almost more important is the signal it sends out to regional football : " we badly need clubs here to act as beacons , " he says : to set high standards once again , and have a positive effect on eastern german football .
investing in young talent however , moldenhauer admits that the rb leipzig model is an exception rather than a panacea : " the clubs here must keep working on what they already have going for them , which is the fantastic work they do with young players . "

sure , back in the 1970s there 's no lack of soccer talent in the east of germany - but the money is n't there to support it .
this season not a single eastern german team is in the top flight , the bundesliga . managers of eastern german football clubs may be forgiven for hankering after the good old days .
under the communist east german government they did n't have to spend their time chasing sponsors , dealing with tax returns or worrying about revenue .
most importantly , though , east german clubs were real contenders back in the day .
fc magdeburg won the european cup winners ' cup in 1974 .
that same year , the east german team defeated west germany during the fifa world cup .
clubs like dynamo dresden or 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig were playing at the top of their game .
twenty years after unification , these same clubs are now languishing in the lower divisions of the league tables .
they 're lucky to attract a crowd of a thousand to watch them play , and with every annual review they fear for their licenses .
not a single club from the east is in germany 's top division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german teams have n't always been bad at soccer there wo n't even be any bundesliga games in reunified berlin this season - after 13 years , hertha bsc , in the old days a west german team , was relegated back in may , following a dismal campaign .
three eastern german clubs will be playing alongside hertha in the second division , and there are another five in the third .
hans-georg moldenhauer , president of the north-eastern german football association -lrb- nofv -rrb- admits that " the current situation of professional football in eastern germany is far from satisfactory . "
so how did it come to this sad state of affairs ?
wherever you go , the answer is the same : not enough sponsors , not enough money , and a history of poor management .
the amalgamation of east and west german soccer into one unified german competitive group in 1991 was too much of a challenge for the east german clubs ; they simply were n't able to make the leap from socialism to capitalism in the space of just a few months .
" all of a sudden we got no state subsidies any more , and we had no idea how to run a market-based operation , " said detlef krauspe , the former boss of sachsen leipzig .
the best players , like andreas thom , ulf kirsten , and later michael ballack , moved to the rich clubs in the west .
the former east had no private companies that could have invested money in the teams .
vicious circle there are some such companies today , but most of them are only small or medium-sized businesses with very little money for sports sponsorship .
" the eastern german clubs have lots of small sponsors that do n't provide that much in the way of finance , and do n't offer long-term partnerships , " says nofv president moldenhauer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german clubs generally only make news when fans make trouble the clubs are therefore hardly ever in a position to make major investments .
in order to attract big companies as sponsorship partners - like the deal bayern munich has secured with deutsche telekom - the eastern german clubs would have to be much more successful than they are at present .
they would also have to acquire a more positive image .
the image of eastern german soccer has suffered badly in recent years .
media reports have focused not on victories but increasingly on hooliganism , riots and racist attacks , both inside and outside the stadiums .
georg moldenhauer says it 's unfair .
" this is n't an eastern german problem , and it 's not football 's problem either - it 's a problem for all of society , " he says .
the media generally find stories like these more interesting than devoting themselves to the analysis of fourth-division games .
rb leipzig as a model now , though , eastern german football has a new story to tempt the sports reporters : rb leipzig .
in 2009 austrian drinks manufacturer red bull acquired a license from the club ssv markranstaedt in saxony to compete in german football .
a new club , rb leipzig , was founded , replacing ssv in the fifth-division nofv-oberliga sued .
players were bought for the team , as was the license for leipzig central stadium , subsequently renamed the red bull arena .
at the end of its first season rb leipzig finished league champion and was immediately promoted to the regionalliga .
the new management 's goal is for the team to play in the bundesliga within 10 years .
since the start of the 2010 season , the red bull arena , the biggest stadium in the territory of the eastern states , has been rb leipzig 's home ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red bull has pumped money into leipzig but the project is far from popular among football fans in leipzig .
there have been huge protests and a lot of hostility from supporters of fc sachsen leipzig and 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig .
they 're worried about a decline in traditional fan culture and the commercialization of soccer in the region .
by contrast , though , a large part of the local population approves of red bull 's investment .
nofv president moldenhauer is also happy about it .
" in the past two decades we 've always criticized the fact that the big sponsors just are n't out there , " he says .
" so i 'm pleased that now , for the first time , we have a model for this kind of partnership here in eastern germany . "
moldenhauer believes that what is almost more important is the signal it sends out to regional football : " we badly need clubs here to act as beacons , " he says : to set high standards once again , and have a positive effect on eastern german football .
investing in young talent however , moldenhauer admits that the rb leipzig model is an exception rather than a panacea : " the clubs here must keep working on what they already have going for them , which is the fantastic work they do with young players . "
in the past , eastern clubs were more or less forced to develop young local talent because they could n't afford to buy in players from elsewhere .

while it has been an accepted practice in the united states for a long time , that 's not the case in europe . when germans want to talk about whistle-blowing they quickly run into a linguistic problem : there is no german word for it .
in order to describe a whistle-blower in their own language germans have to resort to a negatively connotated word like informant or paraphrase it some other way .
that 's why germans often simply use the english word to talk about whistle-blowing .
the lack of a proper name for the practice is indicative of the role and acceptance of whistle-blowing in germany .
" in germany there are no laws to protect whistle-blowers or to serve as an incentive for whistle-blowing , " johannes ludwig , a professor at hamburg 's university of applied sciences and a board member of germany 's whistle-blower netzwerk , told deutsche welle .
" in the us there is both . "
the reasons why whistle-blowing plays a much smaller role in germany than in the us are historical and also shaped by mentality , argues ludwig .
the us was founded by people that did n't want to acccept the traditional hierarchical structures in europe .
" and that 's why in the us everything that has to do with the state and government has to work effectively and serve a clear purpose .
the americans have a much looser understanding of government and state and their relation to government and business is much less bureacratic and authority-driven than ours . "
what 's more , argues ludwig , democracy in germany , even compared to other european countries has a relatively short history .
" and that 's why it is understandable that rules or laws about whistle-blowing which actually only serves the purpose to improve things , are not as developed in germany as they are in other countries . "
protecting whistle-blowers since the civil war by comparison , the first legal incentive for whistle-blowing in the us dates back to the civil war .
the false claims act , which was passed by congress in 1863 , was a reaction by the federal government to deal with fraud .
basically it promised a reward to whistle-blowers who could prove that the government was being defrauded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enron scandal led to a further tightening of whistle-blower laws with some minor changes that law is still in effect today and remains an important factor in recognizing fraud , says alexander dyck , a finance professor and whistle-blowing expert at the rotman school of management at the university of toronto .
" if someone brings information to light through whistle-blowing action and the government is being defrauded and the action is successfully pursued than that whistle-blower is entitled to between 15 and 30 percent of the money the government collects as a result of stopping this wrongdoing , " he told deutsche wellle .
tightening whistle-blower protection through sarbanes-oxley more recently , the us government improved protection for whistle-blowers through the so-called sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 as a reaction to the enron and other corporate scandals .
it also opened up the false claims act to private corporations .
" corporations effectively have to have a whistle-blowing policy , have to set up a hotline , whereby if there are employees or others in the firm who think there is some wrongdoing , you can make the phone calls and allegations and that information is then communicated to folks within the firm that then follow up on this , " explains dyck .
the purpose of all those and additional measures that were instituted in march is to provide incentives for whistle-blowers to speak up about wrongdoings they know about and to protect them as much as possible from retribution for doing it .
less stringent laws , more formal channels in europe in europe , not just in germany , many of these mechanisms simply do n't exist yet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major us companies are required to have instituted protections for whistle-blowers " one possible reason for less whistle-blowing in europe is that many of the activities that whistle-blowing might bring to light would n't be illegal in many european countries , says dyck .
" some things of corporate wrongdoing would be illegal in the us , but would not be illegal in europe , so whistle-blowing on them would n't be very effective . "
however , dyck also offers a more positive explanation of why whistle-blowing is less of a phenomenon in europe than in the us : " there are more formal channels in europe for employees who are concerned about wrongdoing to bring that information to light without going through a whistle-blowing channel , " he notes . " the existence of works councils , worker representatives on boards provide another channel for that sort of information to perculate up to the highest level of decision making that would n't require going through a formal whistle-blowing channel . "
while it might take some time until european countries institute an office of the whistle-blower protection program like it exists within the us department of labor , the experts agree that europe needs to provide more incentives for whistle-blowers to speak out if it wants to get serious about improving corporate governance both in the business and governmental sector .

sure , back in the 1970s there 's no lack of soccer talent in the east of germany - but the money is n't there to support it .
this season not a single eastern german team is in the top flight , the bundesliga . managers of eastern german football clubs may be forgiven for hankering after the good old days .
under the communist east german government they did n't have to spend their time chasing sponsors , dealing with tax returns or worrying about revenue .
most importantly , though , east german clubs were real contenders back in the day .
fc magdeburg won the european cup winners ' cup in 1974 .
that same year , the east german team defeated west germany during the fifa world cup .
clubs like dynamo dresden or 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig were playing at the top of their game .
twenty years after unification , these same clubs are now languishing in the lower divisions of the league tables .
they 're lucky to attract a crowd of a thousand to watch them play , and with every annual review they fear for their licenses .
not a single club from the east is in germany 's top division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german teams have n't always been bad at soccer there wo n't even be any bundesliga games in reunified berlin this season - after 13 years , hertha bsc , in the old days a west german team , was relegated back in may , following a dismal campaign .
three eastern german clubs will be playing alongside hertha in the second division , and there are another five in the third .
hans-georg moldenhauer , president of the north-eastern german football association -lrb- nofv -rrb- admits that " the current situation of professional football in eastern germany is far from satisfactory . "
so how did it come to this sad state of affairs ?
wherever you go , the answer is the same : not enough sponsors , not enough money , and a history of poor management .
the amalgamation of east and west german soccer into one unified german competitive group in 1991 was too much of a challenge for the east german clubs ; they simply were n't able to make the leap from socialism to capitalism in the space of just a few months .
" all of a sudden we got no state subsidies any more , and we had no idea how to run a market-based operation , " said detlef krauspe , the former boss of sachsen leipzig .
the best players , like andreas thom , ulf kirsten , and later michael ballack , moved to the rich clubs in the west .
the former east had no private companies that could have invested money in the teams .
vicious circle there are some such companies today , but most of them are only small or medium-sized businesses with very little money for sports sponsorship .
" the eastern german clubs have lots of small sponsors that do n't provide that much in the way of finance , and do n't offer long-term partnerships , " says nofv president moldenhauer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german clubs generally only make news when fans make trouble the clubs are therefore hardly ever in a position to make major investments .
in order to attract big companies as sponsorship partners - like the deal bayern munich has secured with deutsche telekom - the eastern german clubs would have to be much more successful than they are at present .
they would also have to acquire a more positive image .
the image of eastern german soccer has suffered badly in recent years .
media reports have focused not on victories but increasingly on hooliganism , riots and racist attacks , both inside and outside the stadiums .
georg moldenhauer says it 's unfair .
" this is n't an eastern german problem , and it 's not football 's problem either - it 's a problem for all of society , " he says .
the media generally find stories like these more interesting than devoting themselves to the analysis of fourth-division games .
rb leipzig as a model now , though , eastern german football has a new story to tempt the sports reporters : rb leipzig .
in 2009 austrian drinks manufacturer red bull acquired a license from the club ssv markranstaedt in saxony to compete in german football .
a new club , rb leipzig , was founded , replacing ssv in the fifth-division nofv-oberliga sued .
players were bought for the team , as was the license for leipzig central stadium , subsequently renamed the red bull arena .
at the end of its first season rb leipzig finished league champion and was immediately promoted to the regionalliga .
the new management 's goal is for the team to play in the bundesliga within 10 years .
since the start of the 2010 season , the red bull arena , the biggest stadium in the territory of the eastern states , has been rb leipzig 's home ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red bull has pumped money into leipzig but the project is far from popular among football fans in leipzig .
there have been huge protests and a lot of hostility from supporters of fc sachsen leipzig and 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig .
they 're worried about a decline in traditional fan culture and the commercialization of soccer in the region .
by contrast , though , a large part of the local population approves of red bull 's investment .
nofv president moldenhauer is also happy about it .
" in the past two decades we 've always criticized the fact that the big sponsors just are n't out there , " he says .
" so i 'm pleased that now , for the first time , we have a model for this kind of partnership here in eastern germany . "
moldenhauer believes that what is almost more important is the signal it sends out to regional football : " we badly need clubs here to act as beacons , " he says : to set high standards once again , and have a positive effect on eastern german football .
investing in young talent however , moldenhauer admits that the rb leipzig model is an exception rather than a panacea : " the clubs here must keep working on what they already have going for them , which is the fantastic work they do with young players . "
in the past , eastern clubs were more or less forced to develop young local talent because they could n't afford to buy in players from elsewhere .
in addition to the work done by the clubs , the controversial east german sports schools -lrb- kjs -rrb- have now been transformed into modern football academies , and talented local children have profited from them .
the german football association has also invested - albeit not yet enough - in eastern german football : eight of its 36 elite sports schools are now located in the east .
bildunterschrift : adler left his home team leipzig to play for leverkusen but what happens if a club ca n't persuade its own up-and-coming footballers to stay , simply because it is n't able to offer them much of a future ?
german national team goalkeeper rene adler plays not for his home club , vfb leipzig , but for bayer leverkusen - even though he 's often talks about how much leipzig means to him .
georg moldenhauer does n't think this will stop the eastern clubs from rising to the top of the tree once more .
" even if two out of every 10 good players move on , we 'll still have a good quota , " he says .
he points out that this problem does n't just affect eastern germany .
all over the world top players are keen to move to the top clubs .
moldenhauer cites the example of sami khedira : he did n't stay in stuttgart , but allowed himself to be seduced away by real madrid .
cautiously optimistic the nofv president believes that , in recent years , most clubs have improved their structures and have caught up with their western counterparts , particularly where management is concerned .
the lack of big sponsors and the money they bring remains a problem , but there 's not much the clubs can do about that .
in spite of their economic woes , some have been developing very positively for quite a while now - and they are not just the usual suspects .
moldenhauer singles out energie cottbus and erzgebirge aue .

while it has been an accepted practice in the united states for a long time , that 's not the case in europe . when germans want to talk about whistle-blowing they quickly run into a linguistic problem : there is no german word for it .
in order to describe a whistle-blower in their own language germans have to resort to a negatively connotated word like informant or paraphrase it some other way .
that 's why germans often simply use the english word to talk about whistle-blowing .
the lack of a proper name for the practice is indicative of the role and acceptance of whistle-blowing in germany .
" in germany there are no laws to protect whistle-blowers or to serve as an incentive for whistle-blowing , " johannes ludwig , a professor at hamburg 's university of applied sciences and a board member of germany 's whistle-blower netzwerk , told deutsche welle .
" in the us there is both . "
the reasons why whistle-blowing plays a much smaller role in germany than in the us are historical and also shaped by mentality , argues ludwig .
the us was founded by people that did n't want to acccept the traditional hierarchical structures in europe .
" and that 's why in the us everything that has to do with the state and government has to work effectively and serve a clear purpose .
the americans have a much looser understanding of government and state and their relation to government and business is much less bureacratic and authority-driven than ours . "
what 's more , argues ludwig , democracy in germany , even compared to other european countries has a relatively short history .
" and that 's why it is understandable that rules or laws about whistle-blowing which actually only serves the purpose to improve things , are not as developed in germany as they are in other countries . "
protecting whistle-blowers since the civil war by comparison , the first legal incentive for whistle-blowing in the us dates back to the civil war .
the false claims act , which was passed by congress in 1863 , was a reaction by the federal government to deal with fraud .
basically it promised a reward to whistle-blowers who could prove that the government was being defrauded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enron scandal led to a further tightening of whistle-blower laws with some minor changes that law is still in effect today and remains an important factor in recognizing fraud , says alexander dyck , a finance professor and whistle-blowing expert at the rotman school of management at the university of toronto .
" if someone brings information to light through whistle-blowing action and the government is being defrauded and the action is successfully pursued than that whistle-blower is entitled to between 15 and 30 percent of the money the government collects as a result of stopping this wrongdoing , " he told deutsche wellle .
tightening whistle-blower protection through sarbanes-oxley more recently , the us government improved protection for whistle-blowers through the so-called sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 as a reaction to the enron and other corporate scandals .
it also opened up the false claims act to private corporations .
" corporations effectively have to have a whistle-blowing policy , have to set up a hotline , whereby if there are employees or others in the firm who think there is some wrongdoing , you can make the phone calls and allegations and that information is then communicated to folks within the firm that then follow up on this , " explains dyck .
the purpose of all those and additional measures that were instituted in march is to provide incentives for whistle-blowers to speak up about wrongdoings they know about and to protect them as much as possible from retribution for doing it .
less stringent laws , more formal channels in europe in europe , not just in germany , many of these mechanisms simply do n't exist yet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major us companies are required to have instituted protections for whistle-blowers " one possible reason for less whistle-blowing in europe is that many of the activities that whistle-blowing might bring to light would n't be illegal in many european countries , says dyck .
" some things of corporate wrongdoing would be illegal in the us , but would not be illegal in europe , so whistle-blowing on them would n't be very effective . "
however , dyck also offers a more positive explanation of why whistle-blowing is less of a phenomenon in europe than in the us : " there are more formal channels in europe for employees who are concerned about wrongdoing to bring that information to light without going through a whistle-blowing channel , " he notes . " the existence of works councils , worker representatives on boards provide another channel for that sort of information to perculate up to the highest level of decision making that would n't require going through a formal whistle-blowing channel . "
while it might take some time until european countries institute an office of the whistle-blower protection program like it exists within the us department of labor , the experts agree that europe needs to provide more incentives for whistle-blowers to speak out if it wants to get serious about improving corporate governance both in the business and governmental sector .

while it has been an accepted practice in the united states for a long time , that 's not the case in europe . when germans want to talk about whistle-blowing they quickly run into a linguistic problem : there is no german word for it .
in order to describe a whistle-blower in their own language germans have to resort to a negatively connotated word like informant or paraphrase it some other way .
that 's why germans often simply use the english word to talk about whistle-blowing .
the lack of a proper name for the practice is indicative of the role and acceptance of whistle-blowing in germany .
" in germany there are no laws to protect whistle-blowers or to serve as an incentive for whistle-blowing , " johannes ludwig , a professor at hamburg 's university of applied sciences and a board member of germany 's whistle-blower netzwerk , told deutsche welle .
" in the us there is both . "
the reasons why whistle-blowing plays a much smaller role in germany than in the us are historical and also shaped by mentality , argues ludwig .
the us was founded by people that did n't want to acccept the traditional hierarchical structures in europe .
" and that 's why in the us everything that has to do with the state and government has to work effectively and serve a clear purpose .
the americans have a much looser understanding of government and state and their relation to government and business is much less bureacratic and authority-driven than ours . "
what 's more , argues ludwig , democracy in germany , even compared to other european countries has a relatively short history .
" and that 's why it is understandable that rules or laws about whistle-blowing which actually only serves the purpose to improve things , are not as developed in germany as they are in other countries . "
protecting whistle-blowers since the civil war by comparison , the first legal incentive for whistle-blowing in the us dates back to the civil war .
the false claims act , which was passed by congress in 1863 , was a reaction by the federal government to deal with fraud .
basically it promised a reward to whistle-blowers who could prove that the government was being defrauded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enron scandal led to a further tightening of whistle-blower laws with some minor changes that law is still in effect today and remains an important factor in recognizing fraud , says alexander dyck , a finance professor and whistle-blowing expert at the rotman school of management at the university of toronto .
" if someone brings information to light through whistle-blowing action and the government is being defrauded and the action is successfully pursued than that whistle-blower is entitled to between 15 and 30 percent of the money the government collects as a result of stopping this wrongdoing , " he told deutsche wellle .
tightening whistle-blower protection through sarbanes-oxley more recently , the us government improved protection for whistle-blowers through the so-called sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 as a reaction to the enron and other corporate scandals .
it also opened up the false claims act to private corporations .
" corporations effectively have to have a whistle-blowing policy , have to set up a hotline , whereby if there are employees or others in the firm who think there is some wrongdoing , you can make the phone calls and allegations and that information is then communicated to folks within the firm that then follow up on this , " explains dyck .
the purpose of all those and additional measures that were instituted in march is to provide incentives for whistle-blowers to speak up about wrongdoings they know about and to protect them as much as possible from retribution for doing it .
less stringent laws , more formal channels in europe in europe , not just in germany , many of these mechanisms simply do n't exist yet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major us companies are required to have instituted protections for whistle-blowers " one possible reason for less whistle-blowing in europe is that many of the activities that whistle-blowing might bring to light would n't be illegal in many european countries , says dyck .
" some things of corporate wrongdoing would be illegal in the us , but would not be illegal in europe , so whistle-blowing on them would n't be very effective . "
however , dyck also offers a more positive explanation of why whistle-blowing is less of a phenomenon in europe than in the us : " there are more formal channels in europe for employees who are concerned about wrongdoing to bring that information to light without going through a whistle-blowing channel , " he notes . " the existence of works councils , worker representatives on boards provide another channel for that sort of information to perculate up to the highest level of decision making that would n't require going through a formal whistle-blowing channel . "
while it might take some time until european countries institute an office of the whistle-blower protection program like it exists within the us department of labor , the experts agree that europe needs to provide more incentives for whistle-blowers to speak out if it wants to get serious about improving corporate governance both in the business and governmental sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 05.09.2010 eastern german soccer clubs struggle to stay in the game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lokomotive leipzig a respected team ?
sure , back in the 1970s there 's no lack of soccer talent in the east of germany - but the money is n't there to support it .
this season not a single eastern german team is in the top flight , the bundesliga . managers of eastern german football clubs may be forgiven for hankering after the good old days .
under the communist east german government they did n't have to spend their time chasing sponsors , dealing with tax returns or worrying about revenue .
most importantly , though , east german clubs were real contenders back in the day .
fc magdeburg won the european cup winners ' cup in 1974 .
that same year , the east german team defeated west germany during the fifa world cup .
clubs like dynamo dresden or 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig were playing at the top of their game .
twenty years after unification , these same clubs are now languishing in the lower divisions of the league tables .
they 're lucky to attract a crowd of a thousand to watch them play , and with every annual review they fear for their licenses .
not a single club from the east is in germany 's top division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german teams have n't always been bad at soccer there wo n't even be any bundesliga games in reunified berlin this season - after 13 years , hertha bsc , in the old days a west german team , was relegated back in may , following a dismal campaign .
three eastern german clubs will be playing alongside hertha in the second division , and there are another five in the third .
hans-georg moldenhauer , president of the north-eastern german football association -lrb- nofv -rrb- admits that " the current situation of professional football in eastern germany is far from satisfactory . "
so how did it come to this sad state of affairs ?
wherever you go , the answer is the same : not enough sponsors , not enough money , and a history of poor management .
the amalgamation of east and west german soccer into one unified german competitive group in 1991 was too much of a challenge for the east german clubs ; they simply were n't able to make the leap from socialism to capitalism in the space of just a few months .
" all of a sudden we got no state subsidies any more , and we had no idea how to run a market-based operation , " said detlef krauspe , the former boss of sachsen leipzig .
the best players , like andreas thom , ulf kirsten , and later michael ballack , moved to the rich clubs in the west .
the former east had no private companies that could have invested money in the teams .
vicious circle there are some such companies today , but most of them are only small or medium-sized businesses with very little money for sports sponsorship .
" the eastern german clubs have lots of small sponsors that do n't provide that much in the way of finance , and do n't offer long-term partnerships , " says nofv president moldenhauer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german clubs generally only make news when fans make trouble the clubs are therefore hardly ever in a position to make major investments .
in order to attract big companies as sponsorship partners - like the deal bayern munich has secured with deutsche telekom - the eastern german clubs would have to be much more successful than they are at present .
they would also have to acquire a more positive image .
the image of eastern german soccer has suffered badly in recent years .
media reports have focused not on victories but increasingly on hooliganism , riots and racist attacks , both inside and outside the stadiums .
georg moldenhauer says it 's unfair .
" this is n't an eastern german problem , and it 's not football 's problem either - it 's a problem for all of society , " he says .
the media generally find stories like these more interesting than devoting themselves to the analysis of fourth-division games .
rb leipzig as a model now , though , eastern german football has a new story to tempt the sports reporters : rb leipzig .
in 2009 austrian drinks manufacturer red bull acquired a license from the club ssv markranstaedt in saxony to compete in german football .
a new club , rb leipzig , was founded , replacing ssv in the fifth-division nofv-oberliga sued .
players were bought for the team , as was the license for leipzig central stadium , subsequently renamed the red bull arena .
at the end of its first season rb leipzig finished league champion and was immediately promoted to the regionalliga .
the new management 's goal is for the team to play in the bundesliga within 10 years .
since the start of the 2010 season , the red bull arena , the biggest stadium in the territory of the eastern states , has been rb leipzig 's home ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red bull has pumped money into leipzig but the project is far from popular among football fans in leipzig .
there have been huge protests and a lot of hostility from supporters of fc sachsen leipzig and 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig .
they 're worried about a decline in traditional fan culture and the commercialization of soccer in the region .
by contrast , though , a large part of the local population approves of red bull 's investment .
nofv president moldenhauer is also happy about it .
" in the past two decades we 've always criticized the fact that the big sponsors just are n't out there , " he says .
" so i 'm pleased that now , for the first time , we have a model for this kind of partnership here in eastern germany . "
moldenhauer believes that what is almost more important is the signal it sends out to regional football : " we badly need clubs here to act as beacons , " he says : to set high standards once again , and have a positive effect on eastern german football .
investing in young talent however , moldenhauer admits that the rb leipzig model is an exception rather than a panacea : " the clubs here must keep working on what they already have going for them , which is the fantastic work they do with young players . "
in the past , eastern clubs were more or less forced to develop young local talent because they could n't afford to buy in players from elsewhere .
in addition to the work done by the clubs , the controversial east german sports schools -lrb- kjs -rrb- have now been transformed into modern football academies , and talented local children have profited from them .
the german football association has also invested - albeit not yet enough - in eastern german football : eight of its 36 elite sports schools are now located in the east .
bildunterschrift : adler left his home team leipzig to play for leverkusen but what happens if a club ca n't persuade its own up-and-coming footballers to stay , simply because it is n't able to offer them much of a future ?
german national team goalkeeper rene adler plays not for his home club , vfb leipzig , but for bayer leverkusen - even though he 's often talks about how much leipzig means to him .
georg moldenhauer does n't think this will stop the eastern clubs from rising to the top of the tree once more .
" even if two out of every 10 good players move on , we 'll still have a good quota , " he says .
he points out that this problem does n't just affect eastern germany .
all over the world top players are keen to move to the top clubs .
moldenhauer cites the example of sami khedira : he did n't stay in stuttgart , but allowed himself to be seduced away by real madrid .
cautiously optimistic the nofv president believes that , in recent years , most clubs have improved their structures and have caught up with their western counterparts , particularly where management is concerned .
the lack of big sponsors and the money they bring remains a problem , but there 's not much the clubs can do about that .
in spite of their economic woes , some have been developing very positively for quite a while now - and they are not just the usual suspects .
moldenhauer singles out energie cottbus and erzgebirge aue .
" it 's astonishing what energie cottbus has achieved with the little it has at its disposal , " he says .

while it has been an accepted practice in the united states for a long time , that 's not the case in europe . when germans want to talk about whistle-blowing they quickly run into a linguistic problem : there is no german word for it .
in order to describe a whistle-blower in their own language germans have to resort to a negatively connotated word like informant or paraphrase it some other way .
that 's why germans often simply use the english word to talk about whistle-blowing .
the lack of a proper name for the practice is indicative of the role and acceptance of whistle-blowing in germany .
" in germany there are no laws to protect whistle-blowers or to serve as an incentive for whistle-blowing , " johannes ludwig , a professor at hamburg 's university of applied sciences and a board member of germany 's whistle-blower netzwerk , told deutsche welle .
" in the us there is both . "
the reasons why whistle-blowing plays a much smaller role in germany than in the us are historical and also shaped by mentality , argues ludwig .
the us was founded by people that did n't want to acccept the traditional hierarchical structures in europe .
" and that 's why in the us everything that has to do with the state and government has to work effectively and serve a clear purpose .
the americans have a much looser understanding of government and state and their relation to government and business is much less bureacratic and authority-driven than ours . "
what 's more , argues ludwig , democracy in germany , even compared to other european countries has a relatively short history .
" and that 's why it is understandable that rules or laws about whistle-blowing which actually only serves the purpose to improve things , are not as developed in germany as they are in other countries . "
protecting whistle-blowers since the civil war by comparison , the first legal incentive for whistle-blowing in the us dates back to the civil war .
the false claims act , which was passed by congress in 1863 , was a reaction by the federal government to deal with fraud .
basically it promised a reward to whistle-blowers who could prove that the government was being defrauded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enron scandal led to a further tightening of whistle-blower laws with some minor changes that law is still in effect today and remains an important factor in recognizing fraud , says alexander dyck , a finance professor and whistle-blowing expert at the rotman school of management at the university of toronto .
" if someone brings information to light through whistle-blowing action and the government is being defrauded and the action is successfully pursued than that whistle-blower is entitled to between 15 and 30 percent of the money the government collects as a result of stopping this wrongdoing , " he told deutsche wellle .
tightening whistle-blower protection through sarbanes-oxley more recently , the us government improved protection for whistle-blowers through the so-called sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 as a reaction to the enron and other corporate scandals .
it also opened up the false claims act to private corporations .
" corporations effectively have to have a whistle-blowing policy , have to set up a hotline , whereby if there are employees or others in the firm who think there is some wrongdoing , you can make the phone calls and allegations and that information is then communicated to folks within the firm that then follow up on this , " explains dyck .
the purpose of all those and additional measures that were instituted in march is to provide incentives for whistle-blowers to speak up about wrongdoings they know about and to protect them as much as possible from retribution for doing it .
less stringent laws , more formal channels in europe in europe , not just in germany , many of these mechanisms simply do n't exist yet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major us companies are required to have instituted protections for whistle-blowers " one possible reason for less whistle-blowing in europe is that many of the activities that whistle-blowing might bring to light would n't be illegal in many european countries , says dyck .
" some things of corporate wrongdoing would be illegal in the us , but would not be illegal in europe , so whistle-blowing on them would n't be very effective . "
however , dyck also offers a more positive explanation of why whistle-blowing is less of a phenomenon in europe than in the us : " there are more formal channels in europe for employees who are concerned about wrongdoing to bring that information to light without going through a whistle-blowing channel , " he notes . " the existence of works councils , worker representatives on boards provide another channel for that sort of information to perculate up to the highest level of decision making that would n't require going through a formal whistle-blowing channel . "
while it might take some time until european countries institute an office of the whistle-blower protection program like it exists within the us department of labor , the experts agree that europe needs to provide more incentives for whistle-blowers to speak out if it wants to get serious about improving corporate governance both in the business and governmental sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 05.09.2010 eastern german soccer clubs struggle to stay in the game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lokomotive leipzig a respected team ?
sure , back in the 1970s there 's no lack of soccer talent in the east of germany - but the money is n't there to support it .
this season not a single eastern german team is in the top flight , the bundesliga . managers of eastern german football clubs may be forgiven for hankering after the good old days .
under the communist east german government they did n't have to spend their time chasing sponsors , dealing with tax returns or worrying about revenue .
most importantly , though , east german clubs were real contenders back in the day .
fc magdeburg won the european cup winners ' cup in 1974 .
that same year , the east german team defeated west germany during the fifa world cup .
clubs like dynamo dresden or 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig were playing at the top of their game .
twenty years after unification , these same clubs are now languishing in the lower divisions of the league tables .
they 're lucky to attract a crowd of a thousand to watch them play , and with every annual review they fear for their licenses .
not a single club from the east is in germany 's top division .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german teams have n't always been bad at soccer there wo n't even be any bundesliga games in reunified berlin this season - after 13 years , hertha bsc , in the old days a west german team , was relegated back in may , following a dismal campaign .
three eastern german clubs will be playing alongside hertha in the second division , and there are another five in the third .
hans-georg moldenhauer , president of the north-eastern german football association -lrb- nofv -rrb- admits that " the current situation of professional football in eastern germany is far from satisfactory . "
so how did it come to this sad state of affairs ?
wherever you go , the answer is the same : not enough sponsors , not enough money , and a history of poor management .
the amalgamation of east and west german soccer into one unified german competitive group in 1991 was too much of a challenge for the east german clubs ; they simply were n't able to make the leap from socialism to capitalism in the space of just a few months .
" all of a sudden we got no state subsidies any more , and we had no idea how to run a market-based operation , " said detlef krauspe , the former boss of sachsen leipzig .
the best players , like andreas thom , ulf kirsten , and later michael ballack , moved to the rich clubs in the west .
the former east had no private companies that could have invested money in the teams .
vicious circle there are some such companies today , but most of them are only small or medium-sized businesses with very little money for sports sponsorship .
" the eastern german clubs have lots of small sponsors that do n't provide that much in the way of finance , and do n't offer long-term partnerships , " says nofv president moldenhauer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german clubs generally only make news when fans make trouble the clubs are therefore hardly ever in a position to make major investments .
in order to attract big companies as sponsorship partners - like the deal bayern munich has secured with deutsche telekom - the eastern german clubs would have to be much more successful than they are at present .
they would also have to acquire a more positive image .
the image of eastern german soccer has suffered badly in recent years .
media reports have focused not on victories but increasingly on hooliganism , riots and racist attacks , both inside and outside the stadiums .
georg moldenhauer says it 's unfair .
" this is n't an eastern german problem , and it 's not football 's problem either - it 's a problem for all of society , " he says .
the media generally find stories like these more interesting than devoting themselves to the analysis of fourth-division games .
rb leipzig as a model now , though , eastern german football has a new story to tempt the sports reporters : rb leipzig .
in 2009 austrian drinks manufacturer red bull acquired a license from the club ssv markranstaedt in saxony to compete in german football .
a new club , rb leipzig , was founded , replacing ssv in the fifth-division nofv-oberliga sued .
players were bought for the team , as was the license for leipzig central stadium , subsequently renamed the red bull arena .
at the end of its first season rb leipzig finished league champion and was immediately promoted to the regionalliga .
the new management 's goal is for the team to play in the bundesliga within 10 years .
since the start of the 2010 season , the red bull arena , the biggest stadium in the territory of the eastern states , has been rb leipzig 's home ground .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red bull has pumped money into leipzig but the project is far from popular among football fans in leipzig .
there have been huge protests and a lot of hostility from supporters of fc sachsen leipzig and 1 .
fc lokomotive leipzig .
they 're worried about a decline in traditional fan culture and the commercialization of soccer in the region .
by contrast , though , a large part of the local population approves of red bull 's investment .
nofv president moldenhauer is also happy about it .
" in the past two decades we 've always criticized the fact that the big sponsors just are n't out there , " he says .
" so i 'm pleased that now , for the first time , we have a model for this kind of partnership here in eastern germany . "
moldenhauer believes that what is almost more important is the signal it sends out to regional football : " we badly need clubs here to act as beacons , " he says : to set high standards once again , and have a positive effect on eastern german football .
investing in young talent however , moldenhauer admits that the rb leipzig model is an exception rather than a panacea : " the clubs here must keep working on what they already have going for them , which is the fantastic work they do with young players . "
in the past , eastern clubs were more or less forced to develop young local talent because they could n't afford to buy in players from elsewhere .
in addition to the work done by the clubs , the controversial east german sports schools -lrb- kjs -rrb- have now been transformed into modern football academies , and talented local children have profited from them .
the german football association has also invested - albeit not yet enough - in eastern german football : eight of its 36 elite sports schools are now located in the east .
bildunterschrift : adler left his home team leipzig to play for leverkusen but what happens if a club ca n't persuade its own up-and-coming footballers to stay , simply because it is n't able to offer them much of a future ?
german national team goalkeeper rene adler plays not for his home club , vfb leipzig , but for bayer leverkusen - even though he 's often talks about how much leipzig means to him .
georg moldenhauer does n't think this will stop the eastern clubs from rising to the top of the tree once more .
" even if two out of every 10 good players move on , we 'll still have a good quota , " he says .
he points out that this problem does n't just affect eastern germany .
all over the world top players are keen to move to the top clubs .
moldenhauer cites the example of sami khedira : he did n't stay in stuttgart , but allowed himself to be seduced away by real madrid .
cautiously optimistic the nofv president believes that , in recent years , most clubs have improved their structures and have caught up with their western counterparts , particularly where management is concerned .
the lack of big sponsors and the money they bring remains a problem , but there 's not much the clubs can do about that .
in spite of their economic woes , some have been developing very positively for quite a while now - and they are not just the usual suspects .
