" the generous and indissoluble love of a man and a woman is the effective context and foundation of human life , " he said in at a mass in the basilica , attended by some 6,500 faithful including king juan carlos and queen sofia and watched on screen by thousands more at la monumental bullring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands followed the mass at la monumental bullring " for this reason the church resists every form of denial of human life and gives its support to everything that would promote the natural order in the sphere of the institution of the family , " the pope added . the sagrada familia , a spectacular cathedral designed by catalan architect antoni gaudi , has been under construction for 128 years and is not expected to be completed before 2025 .
gaudi was a devout catholic who benedict said " kept the torch of his faith alight " and " lived in dignity and absolute austerity . " the dedication of the church as a basilica " is an event of great importance , at a time in which man claims to be able to build his life without god , " the pope said . gay ' kiss-in ' benedict xvi rode down the streets in his bullet-proof glass-encased " popemobile , " some 200 gay rights activists protested by kissing for five minutes . " we are here to demonstrate against the pope 's visit and call for a change in the mentality of the catholic institution which still opposes our right to different ways of loving , " said sergi diaz , one of the protesters .
the catholic church teaches that homosexual acts are " intrinsically disordered . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay couples kissed to protest the pope 's stance on homosexuality the socialist government of prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has legalized same-sex marriage and liberalized divorce and abortion laws , moves the catholic church has condemned . zapatero did not attend either of the masses the pope celebrated during his two-day visit , but met him at barcelona airport as the pope departed .
benedict gave his final address of the visit at the airport , expressing hope that an increasingly secular spain , and europe as a whole , could reconnect with its christian tradition . " may this faith find new vigor on this continent and become a source of inspiration , " the pope said , before departing for rome . on saturday , benedict referred to a " strong and aggressive anti-clericism " that he said had resurged in the country since the spanish civil war in the 1930s . the catholic church was a dominant force in spanish politics throughout the fascist dictatorship of general francisco franco , which ended after his death in 1975 . author : andrew bowen -lrb- ap , afp , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the violence escalated , demonstrators were also reported to have set an armed police vehicle on fire . water cannon , pepper spray and truncheons were used to remove protestors who were intent upon occupying the tracks , police said .
with protests continuing into sunday night , authorities brought the train to a halt until monday morning . " i can confirm there were arrests and people injured , but i am not able to say how many , " a police spokesperson said .
he added that the activists appeared to be " members of the anarchist scene , who threw flares and fired tear gas at police .

two other activists tied themselves off a 75-meter-high bridge near the town of morschen , hanging in the train 's path and delaying the train by about two hours .
about 50 other people blocked the tracks nearby , police said . the train was carrying 123 tons of radioactive waste from a reprocessing plant in france to a temporary storage facility in gorleben , where at least 25,000 protestors demonstrated on saturday . more than a thousand activists on sunday also occupied the street where the waste was due to be trucked through to storage .

gianfranco fini said he might pull his supporters out of the government . a former key ally to italian prime minister silvio berlusconi on sunday urged the embattled leader to step down and facilitate discussions for a new government .
" if berlusconi wants to show his love for the country ... the right thing to do is for him to resign , trigger a crisis and start a new phase in which the center-right program and agenda is quickly re-discussed and we take stock of the whole situation , " said gianfranco fini , who co-founded berlusconi 's people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- party but broke away to form his own political grouping last july .
" we need a new agenda , a new program .
the center-right that existed when the pdl was founded does not exist any more , " he said at a conference of his new political movement .
fini said that if the prime minister did not step aside , members of his rival party would resign from the current government .
one minister , one deputy minister and two undersecretaries are members of fini 's party .
around 40 lawmakers from the lower and upper houses of parliament have gone over to fini 's side since july .

investigators in the southern city of malmo gave few details of the apprehension , but said the man is accused of murdering one and attempting to kill seven others since october 2009 .
investigators said the man was swedish , held a gun license and had no criminal record .
the victims were nearly all of immigrant background and were targeted at locations such as bus stops , in their cars and even through the window of a gymnasium .
in october 2009 , a 20-year-old woman was killed in such an attack , shot as she sat in her car .
her male companion was serious injured .
the suspect has reportedly denied all allegations made against him .
witnesses told the sydsvenskan newspaper that the man did not resist when he was arrested by members of a heavily armed police unit at his home in malmo 's city center on saturday night .
neighbors described the suspect as a " quiet loner . "
sniper attacks on immigrants are not new to sweden .
in late 1991 , stockholm and neighboring uppsala saw a similar case in which 11 people were killed by a perpetrator dubbed " the laser man , " due to the laser sight on his rifle .
he is now serving a life sentence .

the minister has expressed serious concern about fresh terror attacks against the west . german interior minister thomas de maiziere said he will outline a five-point air freight security plan when he meets counterparts from across the eu on monday . the minister , who also expressed serious concern that new terrorist attacks were being prepared against europe and the united states , is calling for tough controls on packages travelling by air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere believes national measures are not enough " national measures are not very effective , " de maiziere told the german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag .
" that 's why , at my request , the interior ministers are going to discuss this question in brussels on monday .
i am going to present a plan . " de maiziere , who has often played down security worries in the past , told bild that he was particularly concerned by a failed air freight terror plot originating in yemen earlier this month . " there are indications that have to be taken seriously of attacks in europe and the united states , " de maiziere said .

gianfranco fini said he might pull his supporters out of the government . a former key ally to italian prime minister silvio berlusconi on sunday urged the embattled leader to step down and facilitate discussions for a new government .
" if berlusconi wants to show his love for the country ... the right thing to do is for him to resign , trigger a crisis and start a new phase in which the center-right program and agenda is quickly re-discussed and we take stock of the whole situation , " said gianfranco fini , who co-founded berlusconi 's people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- party but broke away to form his own political grouping last july .
" we need a new agenda , a new program .
the center-right that existed when the pdl was founded does not exist any more , " he said at a conference of his new political movement .
fini said that if the prime minister did not step aside , members of his rival party would resign from the current government .
one minister , one deputy minister and two undersecretaries are members of fini 's party .
around 40 lawmakers from the lower and upper houses of parliament have gone over to fini 's side since july .
their defection , if finalized , would rob berlusconi of a governing majority in parliament .
fini urged berlusconi " not to listen to the bad advice of which he has been getting a lot recently " and to start negotiations for a new center-right government that would aim to last until the end of the current legislature in 2013 .
scandal after scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of posters ridiculing berlusconi over the latest scandals have gone up in italy berlusconi has come under increasing pressure over a series of sex and corruption scandals .
in a recent speech , fini referred to the " moral decadence " in italy society and said that " public figures should be examples . "
of late , the italian prime minister has been engulfed in a scandal over his ties to an underage moroccan girl and alleged encounters with a prostitute .
" the government is not governing , " fini said , adding that the ruling coalition " has lost sight of the path to build today a country for tomorrow . "
fini added , however , that he would still take part in a political alliance with berlusconi if the latter made several concessions , including a new program to help the south of the country and boost employment , and a reform of the electoral law .
berlusconi himself was cited by italian news agencies as saying that he had no intention of resigning .

she is one of an estimated 2,200 political prisons whose freedom has been restricted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi remains in detention as her pro-democracy party boycotts the vote speaking to students in mumbai while on a visit to india , us president barack obama condemned the elections even before polls closed . " there are elections that are being held right now in burma that will be anything but free and fair , based on every report that we are seeing , " he said .
" for too long the people of burma have been denied the right to determine their own destiny . " others nations saw the polls as a step in the right direction . " this election is a good start for the country , " israeli ambassador yaron mayer said .
" after the election , myanmar may change gradually . " little hope for change the union solidarity and development party -lrb- usdp -rrb- , the political force behind the ruling military junta , was set for a large win , helped by huge financial and campaign advantages as well as an environment of fear and intimidation .
armed riot police patrolled the streets and stood guard at polling booths , and the government banned all foreign media and tightened censorship . at least six parties had lodged complaints with the electoral commission , saying hundreds of state employees were coerced into voting for the usdp in advance balloting . " there has been widespread fraud and malpractice committed by the usdp in advance voting across the country , " said khin maung swe , leader of the national democratic force , the largest pro-democracy party .
" we democratic parties will have to take appropriate action after the elections . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police restriction was tight as voters cast their ballots it was uncertain how many of the more than 29 million eligible voters would actually turn out for the elections , as suspicious power outages across the country may have been hampering turnout . military keeps tight grip on parliament nearly 40 parties were vying for representation in the bicameral national parliament and 14 regional assemblies .
however high fees for candidates kept all parties but the usdp and the national unity party , another proxy for the military , from even having enough candidates to win many seats .
the usdp and the national unity party make up nearly two-thirds of the candidates on ballots . a quarter of the seats in all chambers are reserved for military appointees , meaning any military-backed party would only need 26 percent of the remaining seats for the junta and its allies to control parliament . the west maintains sanctions on myanmar , while china has largely increased investments in national gas and other natural resources . author : andrew bowen -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the violence escalated , demonstrators were also reported to have set an armed police vehicle on fire . water cannon , pepper spray and truncheons were used to remove protestors who were intent upon occupying the tracks , police said .
with protests continuing into sunday night , authorities brought the train to a halt until monday morning . " i can confirm there were arrests and people injured , but i am not able to say how many , " a police spokesperson said .
he added that the activists appeared to be " members of the anarchist scene , who threw flares and fired tear gas at police . " activists , meanwhile , said at least 12 people were injured in the clashes . continuing clashes the violence follows similar incidents earlier sunday when police officers used truncheons and mace to fight activists brandishing chemical sprays . bildunterschrift : up to 4,000 people tried to reach the railway track through the surrounding forest , authorities said the activists had been attempting to remove gravel from the bed of the train tracks to stop the train , according to a police spokeswoman . the train was slowed to a crawl earlier in the day as dozens of anti-nuclear activists obstructed its path . police said they arrested 16 activists overnight after catching them with utensils to chain themselves to the train tracks .
two other activists tied themselves off a 75-meter-high bridge near the town of morschen , hanging in the train 's path and delaying the train by about two hours .
about 50 other people blocked the tracks nearby , police said . the train was carrying 123 tons of radioactive waste from a reprocessing plant in france to a temporary storage facility in gorleben , where at least 25,000 protestors demonstrated on saturday . more than a thousand activists on sunday also occupied the street where the waste was due to be trucked through to storage .
among the sit-in was green party chief claudia roth . massive crowd waits at storage facility demonstrators over the weekend have been of all ages , many carrying the red and yellow " nuclear power , no thanks " banners used for decades by the anti-nuclear movement in germany . " it 's no fun having to organize rallies like that in these conditions but the government 's policy leaves us with no choice , " said jochen stay , spokesman for the anti-nuclear group ausgestrahlt -lrb- irradiated -rrb- .

the plants were set by an earlier administration to be phased-out by the early 2020s . opinion polls show that most germans were against the parliament 's decision to extend the reactors ' lifetimes . germany gets 23 percent of its energy from nuclear power . the temporary storage site in gorleben also remains controversial , with environmentalists saying it risks becoming a permanent storage location despite being setup as a temporary holding area for the waste . some 1,500 people and 250 groups are reported to have signed a call to undermine the stability of railway tracks on which the waste train will travel by removing stones and soil from under the railway . authorities have also said pamphlets containing information on building firebombs have been circulating for months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear waste is expected to reach gorleben on monday green party parliamentary leader juergen trittin , who is to join the protest , called on saturday for demonstrators to remain peaceful .

among the sit-in was green party chief claudia roth . massive crowd waits at storage facility demonstrators over the weekend have been of all ages , many carrying the red and yellow " nuclear power , no thanks " banners used for decades by the anti-nuclear movement in germany . " it 's no fun having to organize rallies like that in these conditions but the government 's policy leaves us with no choice , " said jochen stay , spokesman for the anti-nuclear group ausgestrahlt -lrb- irradiated -rrb- .
he added that the group 's " most optimistic estimates have been surpassed . " some 16,000 police were reportedly mobilized in the region ahead of the rally in preparation for potential acts of left-wing violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of people drove tractors to demonstrations " we are assuming that some hundreds of violent autonomous protestors intend to misuse the protests for their own purposes , " hans-werner wargel , president of lower saxony 's security service said on saturday . government extends reactor lifespan germany ’ s anti-nuclear campaigners have been outraged by a recent decision by german lawmakers to approve a bill extending the life of the country 's 17 reactors by an average of 12 years .
the plants were set by an earlier administration to be phased-out by the early 2020s . opinion polls show that most germans were against the parliament 's decision to extend the reactors ' lifetimes . germany gets 23 percent of its energy from nuclear power . the temporary storage site in gorleben also remains controversial , with environmentalists saying it risks becoming a permanent storage location despite being setup as a temporary holding area for the waste . some 1,500 people and 250 groups are reported to have signed a call to undermine the stability of railway tracks on which the waste train will travel by removing stones and soil from under the railway . authorities have also said pamphlets containing information on building firebombs have been circulating for months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear waste is expected to reach gorleben on monday green party parliamentary leader juergen trittin , who is to join the protest , called on saturday for demonstrators to remain peaceful . " anything else would be highly damaging for our cause , " trittin told the daily neue osnabruecker zeitung . the waste , originally produced in germany , was stabilized in the french city of la hague by being melted and mixed into glass cylinders , which are stored in so-called castor containers . activists had attempted to block the train on friday as it left the french reprocessing plant , but the nuclear power firm areva changed the train 's route and by dawn it was within 200 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- of the german border . authors : andrew bowen , david levitz , darren mara -lrb- afp , ap , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gianfranco fini said he might pull his supporters out of the government . a former key ally to italian prime minister silvio berlusconi on sunday urged the embattled leader to step down and facilitate discussions for a new government .
" if berlusconi wants to show his love for the country ... the right thing to do is for him to resign , trigger a crisis and start a new phase in which the center-right program and agenda is quickly re-discussed and we take stock of the whole situation , " said gianfranco fini , who co-founded berlusconi 's people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- party but broke away to form his own political grouping last july .
" we need a new agenda , a new program .
the center-right that existed when the pdl was founded does not exist any more , " he said at a conference of his new political movement .
fini said that if the prime minister did not step aside , members of his rival party would resign from the current government .
one minister , one deputy minister and two undersecretaries are members of fini 's party .
around 40 lawmakers from the lower and upper houses of parliament have gone over to fini 's side since july .
their defection , if finalized , would rob berlusconi of a governing majority in parliament .

" the government is not governing , " fini said , adding that the ruling coalition " has lost sight of the path to build today a country for tomorrow . "
fini added , however , that he would still take part in a political alliance with berlusconi if the latter made several concessions , including a new program to help the south of the country and boost employment , and a reform of the electoral law .

she is one of an estimated 2,200 political prisons whose freedom has been restricted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi remains in detention as her pro-democracy party boycotts the vote speaking to students in mumbai while on a visit to india , us president barack obama condemned the elections even before polls closed . " there are elections that are being held right now in burma that will be anything but free and fair , based on every report that we are seeing , " he said .
" for too long the people of burma have been denied the right to determine their own destiny . " others nations saw the polls as a step in the right direction . " this election is a good start for the country , " israeli ambassador yaron mayer said .
" after the election , myanmar may change gradually . " little hope for change the union solidarity and development party -lrb- usdp -rrb- , the political force behind the ruling military junta , was set for a large win , helped by huge financial and campaign advantages as well as an environment of fear and intimidation .
armed riot police patrolled the streets and stood guard at polling booths , and the government banned all foreign media and tightened censorship . at least six parties had lodged complaints with the electoral commission , saying hundreds of state employees were coerced into voting for the usdp in advance balloting . " there has been widespread fraud and malpractice committed by the usdp in advance voting across the country , " said khin maung swe , leader of the national democratic force , the largest pro-democracy party .
" we democratic parties will have to take appropriate action after the elections . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police restriction was tight as voters cast their ballots it was uncertain how many of the more than 29 million eligible voters would actually turn out for the elections , as suspicious power outages across the country may have been hampering turnout . military keeps tight grip on parliament nearly 40 parties were vying for representation in the bicameral national parliament and 14 regional assemblies .
however high fees for candidates kept all parties but the usdp and the national unity party , another proxy for the military , from even having enough candidates to win many seats .
the usdp and the national unity party make up nearly two-thirds of the candidates on ballots . a quarter of the seats in all chambers are reserved for military appointees , meaning any military-backed party would only need 26 percent of the remaining seats for the junta and its allies to control parliament . the west maintains sanctions on myanmar , while china has largely increased investments in national gas and other natural resources . author : andrew bowen -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the violence escalated , demonstrators were also reported to have set an armed police vehicle on fire . water cannon , pepper spray and truncheons were used to remove protestors who were intent upon occupying the tracks , police said .
with protests continuing into sunday night , authorities brought the train to a halt until monday morning . " i can confirm there were arrests and people injured , but i am not able to say how many , " a police spokesperson said .
he added that the activists appeared to be " members of the anarchist scene , who threw flares and fired tear gas at police . " activists , meanwhile , said at least 12 people were injured in the clashes . continuing clashes the violence follows similar incidents earlier sunday when police officers used truncheons and mace to fight activists brandishing chemical sprays . bildunterschrift : up to 4,000 people tried to reach the railway track through the surrounding forest , authorities said the activists had been attempting to remove gravel from the bed of the train tracks to stop the train , according to a police spokeswoman . the train was slowed to a crawl earlier in the day as dozens of anti-nuclear activists obstructed its path . police said they arrested 16 activists overnight after catching them with utensils to chain themselves to the train tracks .
two other activists tied themselves off a 75-meter-high bridge near the town of morschen , hanging in the train 's path and delaying the train by about two hours .
about 50 other people blocked the tracks nearby , police said . the train was carrying 123 tons of radioactive waste from a reprocessing plant in france to a temporary storage facility in gorleben , where at least 25,000 protestors demonstrated on saturday . more than a thousand activists on sunday also occupied the street where the waste was due to be trucked through to storage .

she is one of an estimated 2,200 political prisons whose freedom has been restricted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi remains in detention as her pro-democracy party boycotts the vote speaking to students in mumbai while on a visit to india , us president barack obama condemned the elections even before polls closed . " there are elections that are being held right now in burma that will be anything but free and fair , based on every report that we are seeing , " he said .
" for too long the people of burma have been denied the right to determine their own destiny . " others nations saw the polls as a step in the right direction . " this election is a good start for the country , " israeli ambassador yaron mayer said .
" after the election , myanmar may change gradually . " little hope for change the union solidarity and development party -lrb- usdp -rrb- , the political force behind the ruling military junta , was set for a large win , helped by huge financial and campaign advantages as well as an environment of fear and intimidation .
armed riot police patrolled the streets and stood guard at polling booths , and the government banned all foreign media and tightened censorship . at least six parties had lodged complaints with the electoral commission , saying hundreds of state employees were coerced into voting for the usdp in advance balloting . " there has been widespread fraud and malpractice committed by the usdp in advance voting across the country , " said khin maung swe , leader of the national democratic force , the largest pro-democracy party .
" we democratic parties will have to take appropriate action after the elections . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police restriction was tight as voters cast their ballots it was uncertain how many of the more than 29 million eligible voters would actually turn out for the elections , as suspicious power outages across the country may have been hampering turnout . military keeps tight grip on parliament nearly 40 parties were vying for representation in the bicameral national parliament and 14 regional assemblies .
however high fees for candidates kept all parties but the usdp and the national unity party , another proxy for the military , from even having enough candidates to win many seats .

as the violence escalated , demonstrators were also reported to have set an armed police vehicle on fire . water cannon , pepper spray and truncheons were used to remove protestors who were intent upon occupying the tracks , police said .
with protests continuing into sunday night , authorities brought the train to a halt until monday morning . " i can confirm there were arrests and people injured , but i am not able to say how many , " a police spokesperson said .
he added that the activists appeared to be " members of the anarchist scene , who threw flares and fired tear gas at police . " activists , meanwhile , said at least 12 people were injured in the clashes . continuing clashes the violence follows similar incidents earlier sunday when police officers used truncheons and mace to fight activists brandishing chemical sprays . bildunterschrift : up to 4,000 people tried to reach the railway track through the surrounding forest , authorities said the activists had been attempting to remove gravel from the bed of the train tracks to stop the train , according to a police spokeswoman . the train was slowed to a crawl earlier in the day as dozens of anti-nuclear activists obstructed its path . police said they arrested 16 activists overnight after catching them with utensils to chain themselves to the train tracks .
two other activists tied themselves off a 75-meter-high bridge near the town of morschen , hanging in the train 's path and delaying the train by about two hours .
about 50 other people blocked the tracks nearby , police said . the train was carrying 123 tons of radioactive waste from a reprocessing plant in france to a temporary storage facility in gorleben , where at least 25,000 protestors demonstrated on saturday . more than a thousand activists on sunday also occupied the street where the waste was due to be trucked through to storage .
among the sit-in was green party chief claudia roth . massive crowd waits at storage facility demonstrators over the weekend have been of all ages , many carrying the red and yellow " nuclear power , no thanks " banners used for decades by the anti-nuclear movement in germany . " it 's no fun having to organize rallies like that in these conditions but the government 's policy leaves us with no choice , " said jochen stay , spokesman for the anti-nuclear group ausgestrahlt -lrb- irradiated -rrb- .
he added that the group 's " most optimistic estimates have been surpassed . " some 16,000 police were reportedly mobilized in the region ahead of the rally in preparation for potential acts of left-wing violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of people drove tractors to demonstrations " we are assuming that some hundreds of violent autonomous protestors intend to misuse the protests for their own purposes , " hans-werner wargel , president of lower saxony 's security service said on saturday . government extends reactor lifespan germany ’ s anti-nuclear campaigners have been outraged by a recent decision by german lawmakers to approve a bill extending the life of the country 's 17 reactors by an average of 12 years .
the plants were set by an earlier administration to be phased-out by the early 2020s . opinion polls show that most germans were against the parliament 's decision to extend the reactors ' lifetimes . germany gets 23 percent of its energy from nuclear power . the temporary storage site in gorleben also remains controversial , with environmentalists saying it risks becoming a permanent storage location despite being setup as a temporary holding area for the waste . some 1,500 people and 250 groups are reported to have signed a call to undermine the stability of railway tracks on which the waste train will travel by removing stones and soil from under the railway . authorities have also said pamphlets containing information on building firebombs have been circulating for months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear waste is expected to reach gorleben on monday green party parliamentary leader juergen trittin , who is to join the protest , called on saturday for demonstrators to remain peaceful . " anything else would be highly damaging for our cause , " trittin told the daily neue osnabruecker zeitung . the waste , originally produced in germany , was stabilized in the french city of la hague by being melted and mixed into glass cylinders , which are stored in so-called castor containers . activists had attempted to block the train on friday as it left the french reprocessing plant , but the nuclear power firm areva changed the train 's route and by dawn it was within 200 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- of the german border . authors : andrew bowen , david levitz , darren mara -lrb- afp , ap , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she is one of an estimated 2,200 political prisons whose freedom has been restricted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi remains in detention as her pro-democracy party boycotts the vote speaking to students in mumbai while on a visit to india , us president barack obama condemned the elections even before polls closed . " there are elections that are being held right now in burma that will be anything but free and fair , based on every report that we are seeing , " he said .
" for too long the people of burma have been denied the right to determine their own destiny . " others nations saw the polls as a step in the right direction . " this election is a good start for the country , " israeli ambassador yaron mayer said .
" after the election , myanmar may change gradually . " little hope for change the union solidarity and development party -lrb- usdp -rrb- , the political force behind the ruling military junta , was set for a large win , helped by huge financial and campaign advantages as well as an environment of fear and intimidation .
armed riot police patrolled the streets and stood guard at polling booths , and the government banned all foreign media and tightened censorship . at least six parties had lodged complaints with the electoral commission , saying hundreds of state employees were coerced into voting for the usdp in advance balloting . " there has been widespread fraud and malpractice committed by the usdp in advance voting across the country , " said khin maung swe , leader of the national democratic force , the largest pro-democracy party .
" we democratic parties will have to take appropriate action after the elections . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police restriction was tight as voters cast their ballots it was uncertain how many of the more than 29 million eligible voters would actually turn out for the elections , as suspicious power outages across the country may have been hampering turnout . military keeps tight grip on parliament nearly 40 parties were vying for representation in the bicameral national parliament and 14 regional assemblies .
however high fees for candidates kept all parties but the usdp and the national unity party , another proxy for the military , from even having enough candidates to win many seats .
the usdp and the national unity party make up nearly two-thirds of the candidates on ballots . a quarter of the seats in all chambers are reserved for military appointees , meaning any military-backed party would only need 26 percent of the remaining seats for the junta and its allies to control parliament . the west maintains sanctions on myanmar , while china has largely increased investments in national gas and other natural resources . author : andrew bowen -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the violence escalated , demonstrators were also reported to have set an armed police vehicle on fire . water cannon , pepper spray and truncheons were used to remove protestors who were intent upon occupying the tracks , police said .
with protests continuing into sunday night , authorities brought the train to a halt until monday morning . " i can confirm there were arrests and people injured , but i am not able to say how many , " a police spokesperson said .
he added that the activists appeared to be " members of the anarchist scene , who threw flares and fired tear gas at police . " activists , meanwhile , said at least 12 people were injured in the clashes . continuing clashes the violence follows similar incidents earlier sunday when police officers used truncheons and mace to fight activists brandishing chemical sprays . bildunterschrift : up to 4,000 people tried to reach the railway track through the surrounding forest , authorities said the activists had been attempting to remove gravel from the bed of the train tracks to stop the train , according to a police spokeswoman . the train was slowed to a crawl earlier in the day as dozens of anti-nuclear activists obstructed its path . police said they arrested 16 activists overnight after catching them with utensils to chain themselves to the train tracks .
two other activists tied themselves off a 75-meter-high bridge near the town of morschen , hanging in the train 's path and delaying the train by about two hours .
about 50 other people blocked the tracks nearby , police said . the train was carrying 123 tons of radioactive waste from a reprocessing plant in france to a temporary storage facility in gorleben , where at least 25,000 protestors demonstrated on saturday . more than a thousand activists on sunday also occupied the street where the waste was due to be trucked through to storage .
among the sit-in was green party chief claudia roth . massive crowd waits at storage facility demonstrators over the weekend have been of all ages , many carrying the red and yellow " nuclear power , no thanks " banners used for decades by the anti-nuclear movement in germany . " it 's no fun having to organize rallies like that in these conditions but the government 's policy leaves us with no choice , " said jochen stay , spokesman for the anti-nuclear group ausgestrahlt -lrb- irradiated -rrb- .
he added that the group 's " most optimistic estimates have been surpassed . " some 16,000 police were reportedly mobilized in the region ahead of the rally in preparation for potential acts of left-wing violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of people drove tractors to demonstrations " we are assuming that some hundreds of violent autonomous protestors intend to misuse the protests for their own purposes , " hans-werner wargel , president of lower saxony 's security service said on saturday . government extends reactor lifespan germany ’ s anti-nuclear campaigners have been outraged by a recent decision by german lawmakers to approve a bill extending the life of the country 's 17 reactors by an average of 12 years .
the plants were set by an earlier administration to be phased-out by the early 2020s . opinion polls show that most germans were against the parliament 's decision to extend the reactors ' lifetimes . germany gets 23 percent of its energy from nuclear power . the temporary storage site in gorleben also remains controversial , with environmentalists saying it risks becoming a permanent storage location despite being setup as a temporary holding area for the waste . some 1,500 people and 250 groups are reported to have signed a call to undermine the stability of railway tracks on which the waste train will travel by removing stones and soil from under the railway . authorities have also said pamphlets containing information on building firebombs have been circulating for months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear waste is expected to reach gorleben on monday green party parliamentary leader juergen trittin , who is to join the protest , called on saturday for demonstrators to remain peaceful . " anything else would be highly damaging for our cause , " trittin told the daily neue osnabruecker zeitung . the waste , originally produced in germany , was stabilized in the french city of la hague by being melted and mixed into glass cylinders , which are stored in so-called castor containers . activists had attempted to block the train on friday as it left the french reprocessing plant , but the nuclear power firm areva changed the train 's route and by dawn it was within 200 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- of the german border . authors : andrew bowen , david levitz , darren mara -lrb- afp , ap , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the minister has expressed serious concern about fresh terror attacks against the west . german interior minister thomas de maiziere said he will outline a five-point air freight security plan when he meets counterparts from across the eu on monday . the minister , who also expressed serious concern that new terrorist attacks were being prepared against europe and the united states , is calling for tough controls on packages travelling by air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere believes national measures are not enough " national measures are not very effective , " de maiziere told the german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag .
" that 's why , at my request , the interior ministers are going to discuss this question in brussels on monday .
i am going to present a plan . " de maiziere , who has often played down security worries in the past , told bild that he was particularly concerned by a failed air freight terror plot originating in yemen earlier this month . " there are indications that have to be taken seriously of attacks in europe and the united states , " de maiziere said .
" events have prompted me to express my concerns publicly for the first time . " perhaps the most contentious part of the de maiziere plan is a proposal to trawl databases of freight companies for information about suspicious packages , looking for suspicious shipments . the minister cited the example of the failed air freight terror plot earlier this month , where explosives were found in air freight cargo heading for the united states . de maiziere said the fact that printer cartridges were being sent from yemen to a jewish synagogue in chicago was " unusual " adding that such consignments " must be checked . " blacklist of unsafe airports also featured in the plans is a proposal to improve monitoring of freight sent from countries judged to be unsafe as well as a blacklist of airports where security is found wanting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorist groups are operating out of yemen as well as the yemen bomb plot , concern about bombs being sent in parcels was raised last week militants by the discovery of explosive packages sent by greek political extremists to embassies and the offices of national leaders including chancellor angela merkel . meanwhile on saturday , a senior member of germany 's aviation authority was reported by the news magazine focus as saying that colleagues had warned of security lapses in air freight as early as 2006 .
he added that little had been done to address the matter . " to this day the personnel and material resources are not enough to be able to recognize the risk of an attack in time , " the official said . author : richard connor -lrb- afp , ap , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the violence escalated , demonstrators were also reported to have set an armed police vehicle on fire . water cannon , pepper spray and truncheons were used to remove protestors who were intent upon occupying the tracks , police said .
with protests continuing into sunday night , authorities brought the train to a halt until monday morning . " i can confirm there were arrests and people injured , but i am not able to say how many , " a police spokesperson said .
he added that the activists appeared to be " members of the anarchist scene , who threw flares and fired tear gas at police . " activists , meanwhile , said at least 12 people were injured in the clashes . continuing clashes the violence follows similar incidents earlier sunday when police officers used truncheons and mace to fight activists brandishing chemical sprays . bildunterschrift : up to 4,000 people tried to reach the railway track through the surrounding forest , authorities said the activists had been attempting to remove gravel from the bed of the train tracks to stop the train , according to a police spokeswoman . the train was slowed to a crawl earlier in the day as dozens of anti-nuclear activists obstructed its path . police said they arrested 16 activists overnight after catching them with utensils to chain themselves to the train tracks .
two other activists tied themselves off a 75-meter-high bridge near the town of morschen , hanging in the train 's path and delaying the train by about two hours .
about 50 other people blocked the tracks nearby , police said . the train was carrying 123 tons of radioactive waste from a reprocessing plant in france to a temporary storage facility in gorleben , where at least 25,000 protestors demonstrated on saturday . more than a thousand activists on sunday also occupied the street where the waste was due to be trucked through to storage .
among the sit-in was green party chief claudia roth . massive crowd waits at storage facility demonstrators over the weekend have been of all ages , many carrying the red and yellow " nuclear power , no thanks " banners used for decades by the anti-nuclear movement in germany . " it 's no fun having to organize rallies like that in these conditions but the government 's policy leaves us with no choice , " said jochen stay , spokesman for the anti-nuclear group ausgestrahlt -lrb- irradiated -rrb- .
he added that the group 's " most optimistic estimates have been surpassed . " some 16,000 police were reportedly mobilized in the region ahead of the rally in preparation for potential acts of left-wing violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of people drove tractors to demonstrations " we are assuming that some hundreds of violent autonomous protestors intend to misuse the protests for their own purposes , " hans-werner wargel , president of lower saxony 's security service said on saturday . government extends reactor lifespan germany ’ s anti-nuclear campaigners have been outraged by a recent decision by german lawmakers to approve a bill extending the life of the country 's 17 reactors by an average of 12 years .
the plants were set by an earlier administration to be phased-out by the early 2020s . opinion polls show that most germans were against the parliament 's decision to extend the reactors ' lifetimes . germany gets 23 percent of its energy from nuclear power . the temporary storage site in gorleben also remains controversial , with environmentalists saying it risks becoming a permanent storage location despite being setup as a temporary holding area for the waste . some 1,500 people and 250 groups are reported to have signed a call to undermine the stability of railway tracks on which the waste train will travel by removing stones and soil from under the railway . authorities have also said pamphlets containing information on building firebombs have been circulating for months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear waste is expected to reach gorleben on monday green party parliamentary leader juergen trittin , who is to join the protest , called on saturday for demonstrators to remain peaceful . " anything else would be highly damaging for our cause , " trittin told the daily neue osnabruecker zeitung . the waste , originally produced in germany , was stabilized in the french city of la hague by being melted and mixed into glass cylinders , which are stored in so-called castor containers . activists had attempted to block the train on friday as it left the french reprocessing plant , but the nuclear power firm areva changed the train 's route and by dawn it was within 200 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- of the german border . authors : andrew bowen , david levitz , darren mara -lrb- afp , ap , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the minister has expressed serious concern about fresh terror attacks against the west . german interior minister thomas de maiziere said he will outline a five-point air freight security plan when he meets counterparts from across the eu on monday . the minister , who also expressed serious concern that new terrorist attacks were being prepared against europe and the united states , is calling for tough controls on packages travelling by air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere believes national measures are not enough " national measures are not very effective , " de maiziere told the german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag .
" that 's why , at my request , the interior ministers are going to discuss this question in brussels on monday .
i am going to present a plan . " de maiziere , who has often played down security worries in the past , told bild that he was particularly concerned by a failed air freight terror plot originating in yemen earlier this month . " there are indications that have to be taken seriously of attacks in europe and the united states , " de maiziere said .
" events have prompted me to express my concerns publicly for the first time . " perhaps the most contentious part of the de maiziere plan is a proposal to trawl databases of freight companies for information about suspicious packages , looking for suspicious shipments . the minister cited the example of the failed air freight terror plot earlier this month , where explosives were found in air freight cargo heading for the united states . de maiziere said the fact that printer cartridges were being sent from yemen to a jewish synagogue in chicago was " unusual " adding that such consignments " must be checked . " blacklist of unsafe airports also featured in the plans is a proposal to improve monitoring of freight sent from countries judged to be unsafe as well as a blacklist of airports where security is found wanting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorist groups are operating out of yemen as well as the yemen bomb plot , concern about bombs being sent in parcels was raised last week militants by the discovery of explosive packages sent by greek political extremists to embassies and the offices of national leaders including chancellor angela merkel . meanwhile on saturday , a senior member of germany 's aviation authority was reported by the news magazine focus as saying that colleagues had warned of security lapses in air freight as early as 2006 .
he added that little had been done to address the matter . " to this day the personnel and material resources are not enough to be able to recognize the risk of an attack in time , " the official said . author : richard connor -lrb- afp , ap , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the generous and indissoluble love of a man and a woman is the effective context and foundation of human life , " he said in at a mass in the basilica , attended by some 6,500 faithful including king juan carlos and queen sofia and watched on screen by thousands more at la monumental bullring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands followed the mass at la monumental bullring " for this reason the church resists every form of denial of human life and gives its support to everything that would promote the natural order in the sphere of the institution of the family , " the pope added . the sagrada familia , a spectacular cathedral designed by catalan architect antoni gaudi , has been under construction for 128 years and is not expected to be completed before 2025 .
gaudi was a devout catholic who benedict said " kept the torch of his faith alight " and " lived in dignity and absolute austerity . " the dedication of the church as a basilica " is an event of great importance , at a time in which man claims to be able to build his life without god , " the pope said . gay ' kiss-in ' benedict xvi rode down the streets in his bullet-proof glass-encased " popemobile , " some 200 gay rights activists protested by kissing for five minutes . " we are here to demonstrate against the pope 's visit and call for a change in the mentality of the catholic institution which still opposes our right to different ways of loving , " said sergi diaz , one of the protesters .

benedict gave his final address of the visit at the airport , expressing hope that an increasingly secular spain , and europe as a whole , could reconnect with its christian tradition . " may this faith find new vigor on this continent and become a source of inspiration , " the pope said , before departing for rome . on saturday , benedict referred to a " strong and aggressive anti-clericism " that he said had resurged in the country since the spanish civil war in the 1930s . the catholic church was a dominant force in spanish politics throughout the fascist dictatorship of general francisco franco , which ended after his death in 1975 . author : andrew bowen -lrb- ap , afp , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gianfranco fini said he might pull his supporters out of the government . a former key ally to italian prime minister silvio berlusconi on sunday urged the embattled leader to step down and facilitate discussions for a new government .
" if berlusconi wants to show his love for the country ... the right thing to do is for him to resign , trigger a crisis and start a new phase in which the center-right program and agenda is quickly re-discussed and we take stock of the whole situation , " said gianfranco fini , who co-founded berlusconi 's people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- party but broke away to form his own political grouping last july .
" we need a new agenda , a new program .
the center-right that existed when the pdl was founded does not exist any more , " he said at a conference of his new political movement .
fini said that if the prime minister did not step aside , members of his rival party would resign from the current government .
one minister , one deputy minister and two undersecretaries are members of fini 's party .
around 40 lawmakers from the lower and upper houses of parliament have gone over to fini 's side since july .
their defection , if finalized , would rob berlusconi of a governing majority in parliament .
fini urged berlusconi " not to listen to the bad advice of which he has been getting a lot recently " and to start negotiations for a new center-right government that would aim to last until the end of the current legislature in 2013 .

gianfranco fini said he might pull his supporters out of the government . a former key ally to italian prime minister silvio berlusconi on sunday urged the embattled leader to step down and facilitate discussions for a new government .
" if berlusconi wants to show his love for the country ... the right thing to do is for him to resign , trigger a crisis and start a new phase in which the center-right program and agenda is quickly re-discussed and we take stock of the whole situation , " said gianfranco fini , who co-founded berlusconi 's people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- party but broke away to form his own political grouping last july .
" we need a new agenda , a new program .
the center-right that existed when the pdl was founded does not exist any more , " he said at a conference of his new political movement .
fini said that if the prime minister did not step aside , members of his rival party would resign from the current government .
one minister , one deputy minister and two undersecretaries are members of fini 's party .
around 40 lawmakers from the lower and upper houses of parliament have gone over to fini 's side since july .
their defection , if finalized , would rob berlusconi of a governing majority in parliament .
fini urged berlusconi " not to listen to the bad advice of which he has been getting a lot recently " and to start negotiations for a new center-right government that would aim to last until the end of the current legislature in 2013 .

as the violence escalated , demonstrators were also reported to have set an armed police vehicle on fire . water cannon , pepper spray and truncheons were used to remove protestors who were intent upon occupying the tracks , police said .
with protests continuing into sunday night , authorities brought the train to a halt until monday morning . " i can confirm there were arrests and people injured , but i am not able to say how many , " a police spokesperson said .
he added that the activists appeared to be " members of the anarchist scene , who threw flares and fired tear gas at police . " activists , meanwhile , said at least 12 people were injured in the clashes . continuing clashes the violence follows similar incidents earlier sunday when police officers used truncheons and mace to fight activists brandishing chemical sprays . bildunterschrift : up to 4,000 people tried to reach the railway track through the surrounding forest , authorities said the activists had been attempting to remove gravel from the bed of the train tracks to stop the train , according to a police spokeswoman . the train was slowed to a crawl earlier in the day as dozens of anti-nuclear activists obstructed its path . police said they arrested 16 activists overnight after catching them with utensils to chain themselves to the train tracks .
two other activists tied themselves off a 75-meter-high bridge near the town of morschen , hanging in the train 's path and delaying the train by about two hours .
about 50 other people blocked the tracks nearby , police said . the train was carrying 123 tons of radioactive waste from a reprocessing plant in france to a temporary storage facility in gorleben , where at least 25,000 protestors demonstrated on saturday . more than a thousand activists on sunday also occupied the street where the waste was due to be trucked through to storage .
among the sit-in was green party chief claudia roth . massive crowd waits at storage facility demonstrators over the weekend have been of all ages , many carrying the red and yellow " nuclear power , no thanks " banners used for decades by the anti-nuclear movement in germany . " it 's no fun having to organize rallies like that in these conditions but the government 's policy leaves us with no choice , " said jochen stay , spokesman for the anti-nuclear group ausgestrahlt -lrb- irradiated -rrb- .
he added that the group 's " most optimistic estimates have been surpassed . " some 16,000 police were reportedly mobilized in the region ahead of the rally in preparation for potential acts of left-wing violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of people drove tractors to demonstrations " we are assuming that some hundreds of violent autonomous protestors intend to misuse the protests for their own purposes , " hans-werner wargel , president of lower saxony 's security service said on saturday . government extends reactor lifespan germany ’ s anti-nuclear campaigners have been outraged by a recent decision by german lawmakers to approve a bill extending the life of the country 's 17 reactors by an average of 12 years .
the plants were set by an earlier administration to be phased-out by the early 2020s . opinion polls show that most germans were against the parliament 's decision to extend the reactors ' lifetimes . germany gets 23 percent of its energy from nuclear power . the temporary storage site in gorleben also remains controversial , with environmentalists saying it risks becoming a permanent storage location despite being setup as a temporary holding area for the waste . some 1,500 people and 250 groups are reported to have signed a call to undermine the stability of railway tracks on which the waste train will travel by removing stones and soil from under the railway . authorities have also said pamphlets containing information on building firebombs have been circulating for months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear waste is expected to reach gorleben on monday green party parliamentary leader juergen trittin , who is to join the protest , called on saturday for demonstrators to remain peaceful . " anything else would be highly damaging for our cause , " trittin told the daily neue osnabruecker zeitung . the waste , originally produced in germany , was stabilized in the french city of la hague by being melted and mixed into glass cylinders , which are stored in so-called castor containers . activists had attempted to block the train on friday as it left the french reprocessing plant , but the nuclear power firm areva changed the train 's route and by dawn it was within 200 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- of the german border . authors : andrew bowen , david levitz , darren mara -lrb- afp , ap , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she is one of an estimated 2,200 political prisons whose freedom has been restricted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi remains in detention as her pro-democracy party boycotts the vote speaking to students in mumbai while on a visit to india , us president barack obama condemned the elections even before polls closed . " there are elections that are being held right now in burma that will be anything but free and fair , based on every report that we are seeing , " he said .
" for too long the people of burma have been denied the right to determine their own destiny . " others nations saw the polls as a step in the right direction . " this election is a good start for the country , " israeli ambassador yaron mayer said .
" after the election , myanmar may change gradually . " little hope for change the union solidarity and development party -lrb- usdp -rrb- , the political force behind the ruling military junta , was set for a large win , helped by huge financial and campaign advantages as well as an environment of fear and intimidation .
armed riot police patrolled the streets and stood guard at polling booths , and the government banned all foreign media and tightened censorship . at least six parties had lodged complaints with the electoral commission , saying hundreds of state employees were coerced into voting for the usdp in advance balloting . " there has been widespread fraud and malpractice committed by the usdp in advance voting across the country , " said khin maung swe , leader of the national democratic force , the largest pro-democracy party .
" we democratic parties will have to take appropriate action after the elections . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police restriction was tight as voters cast their ballots it was uncertain how many of the more than 29 million eligible voters would actually turn out for the elections , as suspicious power outages across the country may have been hampering turnout . military keeps tight grip on parliament nearly 40 parties were vying for representation in the bicameral national parliament and 14 regional assemblies .
however high fees for candidates kept all parties but the usdp and the national unity party , another proxy for the military , from even having enough candidates to win many seats .
the usdp and the national unity party make up nearly two-thirds of the candidates on ballots . a quarter of the seats in all chambers are reserved for military appointees , meaning any military-backed party would only need 26 percent of the remaining seats for the junta and its allies to control parliament . the west maintains sanctions on myanmar , while china has largely increased investments in national gas and other natural resources . author : andrew bowen -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the violence escalated , demonstrators were also reported to have set an armed police vehicle on fire . water cannon , pepper spray and truncheons were used to remove protestors who were intent upon occupying the tracks , police said .
with protests continuing into sunday night , authorities brought the train to a halt until monday morning . " i can confirm there were arrests and people injured , but i am not able to say how many , " a police spokesperson said .
he added that the activists appeared to be " members of the anarchist scene , who threw flares and fired tear gas at police . " activists , meanwhile , said at least 12 people were injured in the clashes . continuing clashes the violence follows similar incidents earlier sunday when police officers used truncheons and mace to fight activists brandishing chemical sprays . bildunterschrift : up to 4,000 people tried to reach the railway track through the surrounding forest , authorities said the activists had been attempting to remove gravel from the bed of the train tracks to stop the train , according to a police spokeswoman . the train was slowed to a crawl earlier in the day as dozens of anti-nuclear activists obstructed its path . police said they arrested 16 activists overnight after catching them with utensils to chain themselves to the train tracks .
two other activists tied themselves off a 75-meter-high bridge near the town of morschen , hanging in the train 's path and delaying the train by about two hours .
about 50 other people blocked the tracks nearby , police said . the train was carrying 123 tons of radioactive waste from a reprocessing plant in france to a temporary storage facility in gorleben , where at least 25,000 protestors demonstrated on saturday . more than a thousand activists on sunday also occupied the street where the waste was due to be trucked through to storage .
among the sit-in was green party chief claudia roth . massive crowd waits at storage facility demonstrators over the weekend have been of all ages , many carrying the red and yellow " nuclear power , no thanks " banners used for decades by the anti-nuclear movement in germany . " it 's no fun having to organize rallies like that in these conditions but the government 's policy leaves us with no choice , " said jochen stay , spokesman for the anti-nuclear group ausgestrahlt -lrb- irradiated -rrb- .
he added that the group 's " most optimistic estimates have been surpassed . " some 16,000 police were reportedly mobilized in the region ahead of the rally in preparation for potential acts of left-wing violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of people drove tractors to demonstrations " we are assuming that some hundreds of violent autonomous protestors intend to misuse the protests for their own purposes , " hans-werner wargel , president of lower saxony 's security service said on saturday . government extends reactor lifespan germany ’ s anti-nuclear campaigners have been outraged by a recent decision by german lawmakers to approve a bill extending the life of the country 's 17 reactors by an average of 12 years .
the plants were set by an earlier administration to be phased-out by the early 2020s . opinion polls show that most germans were against the parliament 's decision to extend the reactors ' lifetimes . germany gets 23 percent of its energy from nuclear power . the temporary storage site in gorleben also remains controversial , with environmentalists saying it risks becoming a permanent storage location despite being setup as a temporary holding area for the waste . some 1,500 people and 250 groups are reported to have signed a call to undermine the stability of railway tracks on which the waste train will travel by removing stones and soil from under the railway . authorities have also said pamphlets containing information on building firebombs have been circulating for months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear waste is expected to reach gorleben on monday green party parliamentary leader juergen trittin , who is to join the protest , called on saturday for demonstrators to remain peaceful . " anything else would be highly damaging for our cause , " trittin told the daily neue osnabruecker zeitung . the waste , originally produced in germany , was stabilized in the french city of la hague by being melted and mixed into glass cylinders , which are stored in so-called castor containers . activists had attempted to block the train on friday as it left the french reprocessing plant , but the nuclear power firm areva changed the train 's route and by dawn it was within 200 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- of the german border . authors : andrew bowen , david levitz , darren mara -lrb- afp , ap , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she is one of an estimated 2,200 political prisons whose freedom has been restricted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi remains in detention as her pro-democracy party boycotts the vote speaking to students in mumbai while on a visit to india , us president barack obama condemned the elections even before polls closed . " there are elections that are being held right now in burma that will be anything but free and fair , based on every report that we are seeing , " he said .
" for too long the people of burma have been denied the right to determine their own destiny . " others nations saw the polls as a step in the right direction . " this election is a good start for the country , " israeli ambassador yaron mayer said .
" after the election , myanmar may change gradually . " little hope for change the union solidarity and development party -lrb- usdp -rrb- , the political force behind the ruling military junta , was set for a large win , helped by huge financial and campaign advantages as well as an environment of fear and intimidation .
armed riot police patrolled the streets and stood guard at polling booths , and the government banned all foreign media and tightened censorship . at least six parties had lodged complaints with the electoral commission , saying hundreds of state employees were coerced into voting for the usdp in advance balloting . " there has been widespread fraud and malpractice committed by the usdp in advance voting across the country , " said khin maung swe , leader of the national democratic force , the largest pro-democracy party .
" we democratic parties will have to take appropriate action after the elections . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police restriction was tight as voters cast their ballots it was uncertain how many of the more than 29 million eligible voters would actually turn out for the elections , as suspicious power outages across the country may have been hampering turnout . military keeps tight grip on parliament nearly 40 parties were vying for representation in the bicameral national parliament and 14 regional assemblies .
however high fees for candidates kept all parties but the usdp and the national unity party , another proxy for the military , from even having enough candidates to win many seats .
the usdp and the national unity party make up nearly two-thirds of the candidates on ballots . a quarter of the seats in all chambers are reserved for military appointees , meaning any military-backed party would only need 26 percent of the remaining seats for the junta and its allies to control parliament . the west maintains sanctions on myanmar , while china has largely increased investments in national gas and other natural resources . author : andrew bowen -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the minister has expressed serious concern about fresh terror attacks against the west . german interior minister thomas de maiziere said he will outline a five-point air freight security plan when he meets counterparts from across the eu on monday . the minister , who also expressed serious concern that new terrorist attacks were being prepared against europe and the united states , is calling for tough controls on packages travelling by air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere believes national measures are not enough " national measures are not very effective , " de maiziere told the german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag .
" that 's why , at my request , the interior ministers are going to discuss this question in brussels on monday .
i am going to present a plan . " de maiziere , who has often played down security worries in the past , told bild that he was particularly concerned by a failed air freight terror plot originating in yemen earlier this month . " there are indications that have to be taken seriously of attacks in europe and the united states , " de maiziere said .
" events have prompted me to express my concerns publicly for the first time . " perhaps the most contentious part of the de maiziere plan is a proposal to trawl databases of freight companies for information about suspicious packages , looking for suspicious shipments . the minister cited the example of the failed air freight terror plot earlier this month , where explosives were found in air freight cargo heading for the united states . de maiziere said the fact that printer cartridges were being sent from yemen to a jewish synagogue in chicago was " unusual " adding that such consignments " must be checked . " blacklist of unsafe airports also featured in the plans is a proposal to improve monitoring of freight sent from countries judged to be unsafe as well as a blacklist of airports where security is found wanting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorist groups are operating out of yemen as well as the yemen bomb plot , concern about bombs being sent in parcels was raised last week militants by the discovery of explosive packages sent by greek political extremists to embassies and the offices of national leaders including chancellor angela merkel . meanwhile on saturday , a senior member of germany 's aviation authority was reported by the news magazine focus as saying that colleagues had warned of security lapses in air freight as early as 2006 .
he added that little had been done to address the matter . " to this day the personnel and material resources are not enough to be able to recognize the risk of an attack in time , " the official said . author : richard connor -lrb- afp , ap , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the violence escalated , demonstrators were also reported to have set an armed police vehicle on fire . water cannon , pepper spray and truncheons were used to remove protestors who were intent upon occupying the tracks , police said .
with protests continuing into sunday night , authorities brought the train to a halt until monday morning . " i can confirm there were arrests and people injured , but i am not able to say how many , " a police spokesperson said .
he added that the activists appeared to be " members of the anarchist scene , who threw flares and fired tear gas at police . " activists , meanwhile , said at least 12 people were injured in the clashes . continuing clashes the violence follows similar incidents earlier sunday when police officers used truncheons and mace to fight activists brandishing chemical sprays . bildunterschrift : up to 4,000 people tried to reach the railway track through the surrounding forest , authorities said the activists had been attempting to remove gravel from the bed of the train tracks to stop the train , according to a police spokeswoman . the train was slowed to a crawl earlier in the day as dozens of anti-nuclear activists obstructed its path . police said they arrested 16 activists overnight after catching them with utensils to chain themselves to the train tracks .
two other activists tied themselves off a 75-meter-high bridge near the town of morschen , hanging in the train 's path and delaying the train by about two hours .
about 50 other people blocked the tracks nearby , police said . the train was carrying 123 tons of radioactive waste from a reprocessing plant in france to a temporary storage facility in gorleben , where at least 25,000 protestors demonstrated on saturday . more than a thousand activists on sunday also occupied the street where the waste was due to be trucked through to storage .
among the sit-in was green party chief claudia roth . massive crowd waits at storage facility demonstrators over the weekend have been of all ages , many carrying the red and yellow " nuclear power , no thanks " banners used for decades by the anti-nuclear movement in germany . " it 's no fun having to organize rallies like that in these conditions but the government 's policy leaves us with no choice , " said jochen stay , spokesman for the anti-nuclear group ausgestrahlt -lrb- irradiated -rrb- .
he added that the group 's " most optimistic estimates have been surpassed . " some 16,000 police were reportedly mobilized in the region ahead of the rally in preparation for potential acts of left-wing violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of people drove tractors to demonstrations " we are assuming that some hundreds of violent autonomous protestors intend to misuse the protests for their own purposes , " hans-werner wargel , president of lower saxony 's security service said on saturday . government extends reactor lifespan germany ’ s anti-nuclear campaigners have been outraged by a recent decision by german lawmakers to approve a bill extending the life of the country 's 17 reactors by an average of 12 years .
the plants were set by an earlier administration to be phased-out by the early 2020s . opinion polls show that most germans were against the parliament 's decision to extend the reactors ' lifetimes . germany gets 23 percent of its energy from nuclear power . the temporary storage site in gorleben also remains controversial , with environmentalists saying it risks becoming a permanent storage location despite being setup as a temporary holding area for the waste . some 1,500 people and 250 groups are reported to have signed a call to undermine the stability of railway tracks on which the waste train will travel by removing stones and soil from under the railway . authorities have also said pamphlets containing information on building firebombs have been circulating for months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear waste is expected to reach gorleben on monday green party parliamentary leader juergen trittin , who is to join the protest , called on saturday for demonstrators to remain peaceful . " anything else would be highly damaging for our cause , " trittin told the daily neue osnabruecker zeitung . the waste , originally produced in germany , was stabilized in the french city of la hague by being melted and mixed into glass cylinders , which are stored in so-called castor containers . activists had attempted to block the train on friday as it left the french reprocessing plant , but the nuclear power firm areva changed the train 's route and by dawn it was within 200 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- of the german border . authors : andrew bowen , david levitz , darren mara -lrb- afp , ap , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gianfranco fini said he might pull his supporters out of the government . a former key ally to italian prime minister silvio berlusconi on sunday urged the embattled leader to step down and facilitate discussions for a new government .
" if berlusconi wants to show his love for the country ... the right thing to do is for him to resign , trigger a crisis and start a new phase in which the center-right program and agenda is quickly re-discussed and we take stock of the whole situation , " said gianfranco fini , who co-founded berlusconi 's people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- party but broke away to form his own political grouping last july .
" we need a new agenda , a new program .
the center-right that existed when the pdl was founded does not exist any more , " he said at a conference of his new political movement .
fini said that if the prime minister did not step aside , members of his rival party would resign from the current government .
one minister , one deputy minister and two undersecretaries are members of fini 's party .
around 40 lawmakers from the lower and upper houses of parliament have gone over to fini 's side since july .
their defection , if finalized , would rob berlusconi of a governing majority in parliament .
fini urged berlusconi " not to listen to the bad advice of which he has been getting a lot recently " and to start negotiations for a new center-right government that would aim to last until the end of the current legislature in 2013 .

in a recent speech , fini referred to the " moral decadence " in italy society and said that " public figures should be examples . "
of late , the italian prime minister has been engulfed in a scandal over his ties to an underage moroccan girl and alleged encounters with a prostitute .
" the government is not governing , " fini said , adding that the ruling coalition " has lost sight of the path to build today a country for tomorrow . "
fini added , however , that he would still take part in a political alliance with berlusconi if the latter made several concessions , including a new program to help the south of the country and boost employment , and a reform of the electoral law .
berlusconi himself was cited by italian news agencies as saying that he had no intention of resigning .

" for too long the people of burma have been denied the right to determine their own destiny . " others nations saw the polls as a step in the right direction . " this election is a good start for the country , " israeli ambassador yaron mayer said .
" after the election , myanmar may change gradually . " little hope for change the union solidarity and development party -lrb- usdp -rrb- , the political force behind the ruling military junta , was set for a large win , helped by huge financial and campaign advantages as well as an environment of fear and intimidation .
armed riot police patrolled the streets and stood guard at polling booths , and the government banned all foreign media and tightened censorship . at least six parties had lodged complaints with the electoral commission , saying hundreds of state employees were coerced into voting for the usdp in advance balloting . " there has been widespread fraud and malpractice committed by the usdp in advance voting across the country , " said khin maung swe , leader of the national democratic force , the largest pro-democracy party .
" we democratic parties will have to take appropriate action after the elections . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police restriction was tight as voters cast their ballots it was uncertain how many of the more than 29 million eligible voters would actually turn out for the elections , as suspicious power outages across the country may have been hampering turnout . military keeps tight grip on parliament nearly 40 parties were vying for representation in the bicameral national parliament and 14 regional assemblies .
however high fees for candidates kept all parties but the usdp and the national unity party , another proxy for the military , from even having enough candidates to win many seats .
the usdp and the national unity party make up nearly two-thirds of the candidates on ballots . a quarter of the seats in all chambers are reserved for military appointees , meaning any military-backed party would only need 26 percent of the remaining seats for the junta and its allies to control parliament . the west maintains sanctions on myanmar , while china has largely increased investments in national gas and other natural resources . author : andrew bowen -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gianfranco fini said he might pull his supporters out of the government . a former key ally to italian prime minister silvio berlusconi on sunday urged the embattled leader to step down and facilitate discussions for a new government .
" if berlusconi wants to show his love for the country ... the right thing to do is for him to resign , trigger a crisis and start a new phase in which the center-right program and agenda is quickly re-discussed and we take stock of the whole situation , " said gianfranco fini , who co-founded berlusconi 's people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- party but broke away to form his own political grouping last july .
" we need a new agenda , a new program .
the center-right that existed when the pdl was founded does not exist any more , " he said at a conference of his new political movement .
fini said that if the prime minister did not step aside , members of his rival party would resign from the current government .
one minister , one deputy minister and two undersecretaries are members of fini 's party .
around 40 lawmakers from the lower and upper houses of parliament have gone over to fini 's side since july .
their defection , if finalized , would rob berlusconi of a governing majority in parliament .
fini urged berlusconi " not to listen to the bad advice of which he has been getting a lot recently " and to start negotiations for a new center-right government that would aim to last until the end of the current legislature in 2013 .
scandal after scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of posters ridiculing berlusconi over the latest scandals have gone up in italy berlusconi has come under increasing pressure over a series of sex and corruption scandals .
in a recent speech , fini referred to the " moral decadence " in italy society and said that " public figures should be examples . "
of late , the italian prime minister has been engulfed in a scandal over his ties to an underage moroccan girl and alleged encounters with a prostitute .
" the government is not governing , " fini said , adding that the ruling coalition " has lost sight of the path to build today a country for tomorrow . "
fini added , however , that he would still take part in a political alliance with berlusconi if the latter made several concessions , including a new program to help the south of the country and boost employment , and a reform of the electoral law .

as the violence escalated , demonstrators were also reported to have set an armed police vehicle on fire . water cannon , pepper spray and truncheons were used to remove protestors who were intent upon occupying the tracks , police said .
with protests continuing into sunday night , authorities brought the train to a halt until monday morning . " i can confirm there were arrests and people injured , but i am not able to say how many , " a police spokesperson said .
he added that the activists appeared to be " members of the anarchist scene , who threw flares and fired tear gas at police . " activists , meanwhile , said at least 12 people were injured in the clashes . continuing clashes the violence follows similar incidents earlier sunday when police officers used truncheons and mace to fight activists brandishing chemical sprays . bildunterschrift : up to 4,000 people tried to reach the railway track through the surrounding forest , authorities said the activists had been attempting to remove gravel from the bed of the train tracks to stop the train , according to a police spokeswoman . the train was slowed to a crawl earlier in the day as dozens of anti-nuclear activists obstructed its path . police said they arrested 16 activists overnight after catching them with utensils to chain themselves to the train tracks .
two other activists tied themselves off a 75-meter-high bridge near the town of morschen , hanging in the train 's path and delaying the train by about two hours .
about 50 other people blocked the tracks nearby , police said . the train was carrying 123 tons of radioactive waste from a reprocessing plant in france to a temporary storage facility in gorleben , where at least 25,000 protestors demonstrated on saturday . more than a thousand activists on sunday also occupied the street where the waste was due to be trucked through to storage .
among the sit-in was green party chief claudia roth . massive crowd waits at storage facility demonstrators over the weekend have been of all ages , many carrying the red and yellow " nuclear power , no thanks " banners used for decades by the anti-nuclear movement in germany . " it 's no fun having to organize rallies like that in these conditions but the government 's policy leaves us with no choice , " said jochen stay , spokesman for the anti-nuclear group ausgestrahlt -lrb- irradiated -rrb- .

the plants were set by an earlier administration to be phased-out by the early 2020s . opinion polls show that most germans were against the parliament 's decision to extend the reactors ' lifetimes . germany gets 23 percent of its energy from nuclear power . the temporary storage site in gorleben also remains controversial , with environmentalists saying it risks becoming a permanent storage location despite being setup as a temporary holding area for the waste . some 1,500 people and 250 groups are reported to have signed a call to undermine the stability of railway tracks on which the waste train will travel by removing stones and soil from under the railway . authorities have also said pamphlets containing information on building firebombs have been circulating for months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear waste is expected to reach gorleben on monday green party parliamentary leader juergen trittin , who is to join the protest , called on saturday for demonstrators to remain peaceful .

gianfranco fini said he might pull his supporters out of the government . a former key ally to italian prime minister silvio berlusconi on sunday urged the embattled leader to step down and facilitate discussions for a new government .
" if berlusconi wants to show his love for the country ... the right thing to do is for him to resign , trigger a crisis and start a new phase in which the center-right program and agenda is quickly re-discussed and we take stock of the whole situation , " said gianfranco fini , who co-founded berlusconi 's people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- party but broke away to form his own political grouping last july .
" we need a new agenda , a new program .
the center-right that existed when the pdl was founded does not exist any more , " he said at a conference of his new political movement .
fini said that if the prime minister did not step aside , members of his rival party would resign from the current government .
one minister , one deputy minister and two undersecretaries are members of fini 's party .
around 40 lawmakers from the lower and upper houses of parliament have gone over to fini 's side since july .
their defection , if finalized , would rob berlusconi of a governing majority in parliament .
fini urged berlusconi " not to listen to the bad advice of which he has been getting a lot recently " and to start negotiations for a new center-right government that would aim to last until the end of the current legislature in 2013 .

in a recent speech , fini referred to the " moral decadence " in italy society and said that " public figures should be examples . "
of late , the italian prime minister has been engulfed in a scandal over his ties to an underage moroccan girl and alleged encounters with a prostitute .
" the government is not governing , " fini said , adding that the ruling coalition " has lost sight of the path to build today a country for tomorrow . "
fini added , however , that he would still take part in a political alliance with berlusconi if the latter made several concessions , including a new program to help the south of the country and boost employment , and a reform of the electoral law .
berlusconi himself was cited by italian news agencies as saying that he had no intention of resigning .

she is one of an estimated 2,200 political prisons whose freedom has been restricted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi remains in detention as her pro-democracy party boycotts the vote speaking to students in mumbai while on a visit to india , us president barack obama condemned the elections even before polls closed . " there are elections that are being held right now in burma that will be anything but free and fair , based on every report that we are seeing , " he said .
" for too long the people of burma have been denied the right to determine their own destiny . " others nations saw the polls as a step in the right direction . " this election is a good start for the country , " israeli ambassador yaron mayer said .
" after the election , myanmar may change gradually . " little hope for change the union solidarity and development party -lrb- usdp -rrb- , the political force behind the ruling military junta , was set for a large win , helped by huge financial and campaign advantages as well as an environment of fear and intimidation .
armed riot police patrolled the streets and stood guard at polling booths , and the government banned all foreign media and tightened censorship . at least six parties had lodged complaints with the electoral commission , saying hundreds of state employees were coerced into voting for the usdp in advance balloting . " there has been widespread fraud and malpractice committed by the usdp in advance voting across the country , " said khin maung swe , leader of the national democratic force , the largest pro-democracy party .
" we democratic parties will have to take appropriate action after the elections . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police restriction was tight as voters cast their ballots it was uncertain how many of the more than 29 million eligible voters would actually turn out for the elections , as suspicious power outages across the country may have been hampering turnout . military keeps tight grip on parliament nearly 40 parties were vying for representation in the bicameral national parliament and 14 regional assemblies .
however high fees for candidates kept all parties but the usdp and the national unity party , another proxy for the military , from even having enough candidates to win many seats .
the usdp and the national unity party make up nearly two-thirds of the candidates on ballots . a quarter of the seats in all chambers are reserved for military appointees , meaning any military-backed party would only need 26 percent of the remaining seats for the junta and its allies to control parliament . the west maintains sanctions on myanmar , while china has largely increased investments in national gas and other natural resources . author : andrew bowen -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the generous and indissoluble love of a man and a woman is the effective context and foundation of human life , " he said in at a mass in the basilica , attended by some 6,500 faithful including king juan carlos and queen sofia and watched on screen by thousands more at la monumental bullring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands followed the mass at la monumental bullring " for this reason the church resists every form of denial of human life and gives its support to everything that would promote the natural order in the sphere of the institution of the family , " the pope added . the sagrada familia , a spectacular cathedral designed by catalan architect antoni gaudi , has been under construction for 128 years and is not expected to be completed before 2025 .
gaudi was a devout catholic who benedict said " kept the torch of his faith alight " and " lived in dignity and absolute austerity . " the dedication of the church as a basilica " is an event of great importance , at a time in which man claims to be able to build his life without god , " the pope said . gay ' kiss-in ' benedict xvi rode down the streets in his bullet-proof glass-encased " popemobile , " some 200 gay rights activists protested by kissing for five minutes . " we are here to demonstrate against the pope 's visit and call for a change in the mentality of the catholic institution which still opposes our right to different ways of loving , " said sergi diaz , one of the protesters .

benedict gave his final address of the visit at the airport , expressing hope that an increasingly secular spain , and europe as a whole , could reconnect with its christian tradition . " may this faith find new vigor on this continent and become a source of inspiration , " the pope said , before departing for rome . on saturday , benedict referred to a " strong and aggressive anti-clericism " that he said had resurged in the country since the spanish civil war in the 1930s . the catholic church was a dominant force in spanish politics throughout the fascist dictatorship of general francisco franco , which ended after his death in 1975 . author : andrew bowen -lrb- ap , afp , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the violence escalated , demonstrators were also reported to have set an armed police vehicle on fire . water cannon , pepper spray and truncheons were used to remove protestors who were intent upon occupying the tracks , police said .
with protests continuing into sunday night , authorities brought the train to a halt until monday morning . " i can confirm there were arrests and people injured , but i am not able to say how many , " a police spokesperson said .
he added that the activists appeared to be " members of the anarchist scene , who threw flares and fired tear gas at police . " activists , meanwhile , said at least 12 people were injured in the clashes . continuing clashes the violence follows similar incidents earlier sunday when police officers used truncheons and mace to fight activists brandishing chemical sprays . bildunterschrift : up to 4,000 people tried to reach the railway track through the surrounding forest , authorities said the activists had been attempting to remove gravel from the bed of the train tracks to stop the train , according to a police spokeswoman . the train was slowed to a crawl earlier in the day as dozens of anti-nuclear activists obstructed its path . police said they arrested 16 activists overnight after catching them with utensils to chain themselves to the train tracks .
two other activists tied themselves off a 75-meter-high bridge near the town of morschen , hanging in the train 's path and delaying the train by about two hours .
about 50 other people blocked the tracks nearby , police said . the train was carrying 123 tons of radioactive waste from a reprocessing plant in france to a temporary storage facility in gorleben , where at least 25,000 protestors demonstrated on saturday . more than a thousand activists on sunday also occupied the street where the waste was due to be trucked through to storage .
among the sit-in was green party chief claudia roth . massive crowd waits at storage facility demonstrators over the weekend have been of all ages , many carrying the red and yellow " nuclear power , no thanks " banners used for decades by the anti-nuclear movement in germany . " it 's no fun having to organize rallies like that in these conditions but the government 's policy leaves us with no choice , " said jochen stay , spokesman for the anti-nuclear group ausgestrahlt -lrb- irradiated -rrb- .

she is one of an estimated 2,200 political prisons whose freedom has been restricted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi remains in detention as her pro-democracy party boycotts the vote speaking to students in mumbai while on a visit to india , us president barack obama condemned the elections even before polls closed . " there are elections that are being held right now in burma that will be anything but free and fair , based on every report that we are seeing , " he said .
" for too long the people of burma have been denied the right to determine their own destiny . " others nations saw the polls as a step in the right direction . " this election is a good start for the country , " israeli ambassador yaron mayer said .
" after the election , myanmar may change gradually . " little hope for change the union solidarity and development party -lrb- usdp -rrb- , the political force behind the ruling military junta , was set for a large win , helped by huge financial and campaign advantages as well as an environment of fear and intimidation .
armed riot police patrolled the streets and stood guard at polling booths , and the government banned all foreign media and tightened censorship . at least six parties had lodged complaints with the electoral commission , saying hundreds of state employees were coerced into voting for the usdp in advance balloting . " there has been widespread fraud and malpractice committed by the usdp in advance voting across the country , " said khin maung swe , leader of the national democratic force , the largest pro-democracy party .
" we democratic parties will have to take appropriate action after the elections . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police restriction was tight as voters cast their ballots it was uncertain how many of the more than 29 million eligible voters would actually turn out for the elections , as suspicious power outages across the country may have been hampering turnout . military keeps tight grip on parliament nearly 40 parties were vying for representation in the bicameral national parliament and 14 regional assemblies .
however high fees for candidates kept all parties but the usdp and the national unity party , another proxy for the military , from even having enough candidates to win many seats .
the usdp and the national unity party make up nearly two-thirds of the candidates on ballots . a quarter of the seats in all chambers are reserved for military appointees , meaning any military-backed party would only need 26 percent of the remaining seats for the junta and its allies to control parliament . the west maintains sanctions on myanmar , while china has largely increased investments in national gas and other natural resources . author : andrew bowen -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the generous and indissoluble love of a man and a woman is the effective context and foundation of human life , " he said in at a mass in the basilica , attended by some 6,500 faithful including king juan carlos and queen sofia and watched on screen by thousands more at la monumental bullring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands followed the mass at la monumental bullring " for this reason the church resists every form of denial of human life and gives its support to everything that would promote the natural order in the sphere of the institution of the family , " the pope added . the sagrada familia , a spectacular cathedral designed by catalan architect antoni gaudi , has been under construction for 128 years and is not expected to be completed before 2025 .
gaudi was a devout catholic who benedict said " kept the torch of his faith alight " and " lived in dignity and absolute austerity . " the dedication of the church as a basilica " is an event of great importance , at a time in which man claims to be able to build his life without god , " the pope said . gay ' kiss-in ' benedict xvi rode down the streets in his bullet-proof glass-encased " popemobile , " some 200 gay rights activists protested by kissing for five minutes . " we are here to demonstrate against the pope 's visit and call for a change in the mentality of the catholic institution which still opposes our right to different ways of loving , " said sergi diaz , one of the protesters .
the catholic church teaches that homosexual acts are " intrinsically disordered . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay couples kissed to protest the pope 's stance on homosexuality the socialist government of prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has legalized same-sex marriage and liberalized divorce and abortion laws , moves the catholic church has condemned . zapatero did not attend either of the masses the pope celebrated during his two-day visit , but met him at barcelona airport as the pope departed .
benedict gave his final address of the visit at the airport , expressing hope that an increasingly secular spain , and europe as a whole , could reconnect with its christian tradition . " may this faith find new vigor on this continent and become a source of inspiration , " the pope said , before departing for rome . on saturday , benedict referred to a " strong and aggressive anti-clericism " that he said had resurged in the country since the spanish civil war in the 1930s . the catholic church was a dominant force in spanish politics throughout the fascist dictatorship of general francisco franco , which ended after his death in 1975 . author : andrew bowen -lrb- ap , afp , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the generous and indissoluble love of a man and a woman is the effective context and foundation of human life , " he said in at a mass in the basilica , attended by some 6,500 faithful including king juan carlos and queen sofia and watched on screen by thousands more at la monumental bullring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands followed the mass at la monumental bullring " for this reason the church resists every form of denial of human life and gives its support to everything that would promote the natural order in the sphere of the institution of the family , " the pope added . the sagrada familia , a spectacular cathedral designed by catalan architect antoni gaudi , has been under construction for 128 years and is not expected to be completed before 2025 .

she is one of an estimated 2,200 political prisons whose freedom has been restricted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi remains in detention as her pro-democracy party boycotts the vote speaking to students in mumbai while on a visit to india , us president barack obama condemned the elections even before polls closed . " there are elections that are being held right now in burma that will be anything but free and fair , based on every report that we are seeing , " he said .
" for too long the people of burma have been denied the right to determine their own destiny . " others nations saw the polls as a step in the right direction . " this election is a good start for the country , " israeli ambassador yaron mayer said .
" after the election , myanmar may change gradually . " little hope for change the union solidarity and development party -lrb- usdp -rrb- , the political force behind the ruling military junta , was set for a large win , helped by huge financial and campaign advantages as well as an environment of fear and intimidation .
armed riot police patrolled the streets and stood guard at polling booths , and the government banned all foreign media and tightened censorship . at least six parties had lodged complaints with the electoral commission , saying hundreds of state employees were coerced into voting for the usdp in advance balloting . " there has been widespread fraud and malpractice committed by the usdp in advance voting across the country , " said khin maung swe , leader of the national democratic force , the largest pro-democracy party .
" we democratic parties will have to take appropriate action after the elections . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police restriction was tight as voters cast their ballots it was uncertain how many of the more than 29 million eligible voters would actually turn out for the elections , as suspicious power outages across the country may have been hampering turnout . military keeps tight grip on parliament nearly 40 parties were vying for representation in the bicameral national parliament and 14 regional assemblies .
however high fees for candidates kept all parties but the usdp and the national unity party , another proxy for the military , from even having enough candidates to win many seats .
the usdp and the national unity party make up nearly two-thirds of the candidates on ballots . a quarter of the seats in all chambers are reserved for military appointees , meaning any military-backed party would only need 26 percent of the remaining seats for the junta and its allies to control parliament . the west maintains sanctions on myanmar , while china has largely increased investments in national gas and other natural resources . author : andrew bowen -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she is one of an estimated 2,200 political prisons whose freedom has been restricted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi remains in detention as her pro-democracy party boycotts the vote speaking to students in mumbai while on a visit to india , us president barack obama condemned the elections even before polls closed . " there are elections that are being held right now in burma that will be anything but free and fair , based on every report that we are seeing , " he said .
" for too long the people of burma have been denied the right to determine their own destiny . " others nations saw the polls as a step in the right direction . " this election is a good start for the country , " israeli ambassador yaron mayer said .
" after the election , myanmar may change gradually . " little hope for change the union solidarity and development party -lrb- usdp -rrb- , the political force behind the ruling military junta , was set for a large win , helped by huge financial and campaign advantages as well as an environment of fear and intimidation .

" there has been widespread fraud and malpractice committed by the usdp in advance voting across the country , " said khin maung swe , leader of the national democratic force , the largest pro-democracy party .

the usdp and the national unity party make up nearly two-thirds of the candidates on ballots . a quarter of the seats in all chambers are reserved for military appointees , meaning any military-backed party would only need 26 percent of the remaining seats for the junta and its allies to control parliament . the west maintains sanctions on myanmar , while china has largely increased investments in national gas and other natural resources . author : andrew bowen -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
