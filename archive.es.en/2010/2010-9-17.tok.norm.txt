after a bumpy first three rounds , they 'll try to get it together this week . match day four in the bundesliga is upon us , and dw 's team of football freaks are plotting their comeback ... or hoping that when it comes to picks , it 's a case of four is fantastic .
the prediction squad has taken a hit from all the upsets thus far -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but still we rise .
friday , september 18 frankfurt-freiburg freiburg have looked much better this year than last and have shown they can win away .
but after a sputtering start , frankfurt got back on track last week and have enough drive going forward to exploit their opponents ' weakness at the back .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 saturday , september 18 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne will hope to see this mueller - not the celebratory one bayern munich-cologne no secret about the billy goats ' strategy here – pack it in in their own half , frustrate franck ribery and hope for a draw .
with bayern perhaps having tired legs from the champions league , cologne 's plan has a chance of working .
but something tells me thomas mueller has found his rhythm again , and as he showed on wedsnesday , he can manufacture goals from nothing .
prediction : bayern 2-0 werder bremen-mainz this is just the sort of match profligate bremen often lose , and what 's not to like about this year 's plucky , well-organized mainz squad ?
unfortunately for the latter , though , i think the now-confirmed news that wunderkind andre schuerrle is headed to leverkusen next season will prove to be a distraction .
prediction : bremen 3-1 stuttgart-moenchengladbach this is a case of the underachieving taking on the unpredictable .
stuttgart have been a mess this season , especially on defense , and are coming off only two days rest .
gladbach have been up and down but have already tripped up one big club at home .
methinks they split the points .
prediction : 1-1 draw wolfsburg-hanover there 's one team here still looking for its first points , and it 's not hanover .
the 96ers are undefeated , and their two wins , while close , have been deserved .
for the wolves , who are miles ahead talent-wise , this will be a test of whether they have faith in new coach steve mcclaren .
i think the result will be indecisive .
prediction : 2-2 draw .
kaiserslautern-hoffenheim as bayern found out two weeks ago , never underestimate lautern 's home field advantage .
but i like what i 've seen from hoffenheim this season .
they 're more disciplined than in the past and look like they 're on a mission to prove the doubters wrong .
and they simply have too much attacking firepower for the red devils .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 sunday , september 19 st. pauli-hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. pauli fans will hope their outlaw act intimidates their city rivals of the true city derbies in german football , this one is the best .
on paper , pauli are completely overmatched against hamburg .
but that 's on paper .
taking to the field in millerntor stadium with ac / dc 's hell 's bells ringing in your ears is something that can impress even the likes of ruud van nistelrooy .
and somewhere within all that ringing i hear the sound of an upset .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 dortmund-schalke could things get any worse for schalke ?
they 're on a bad losing streak , and now they get a visit their bitterest rivals , who are off to a good start .
but i 'm not writing off schalke just yet , and i think two extra days rest will help them sneak a point .
prediction : 1-1 draw leverkusen-nuremberg leverkusen have lived up to their reputation as one of the bundesliga 's least consistent teams and will have thursday 's europa cup match weighing down their legs .
but i think nuremberg will be thrown off by the loss of their best striker , albert bunjaku , to injury for the rest of the year .
prediction : leverkusen 3-0 last week 's result : 6 points hoffenheim – schalke 2:0 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- dortmund - wolfsburg 2:0 -lrb- dw prediction 2:0 , three points -rrb- hamburg - nuremberg 1:1 -lrb- dw prediction 3:1 , no points -rrb- gladbach - frankfurt 0:4 -lrb- dw prediction 2:1 , no points -rrb- freiburg - stuttgart 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 1:3 , no points -rrb- hanover - leverkusen 2:2 -lrb- dw prediction 2:3 , no points -rrb- bayern munich - bremen 0:0 -lrb- dw prediction 4:2 , no points -rrb- mainz - kaiserlautern 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 2:1 , three points -rrb- cologne - st. pauli 1:0 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- total for the season : 15 three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : jefferson chase editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

another man was arrested about eight hours later .
the police said officers had been searching two businesses and eight homes in the capital since the arrests , but had found no weapons or dangerous materials .
media reports suggested the arrests were likely linked to the papal visit , an issue on which the police would not comment .
the presence of pope benedict xvi in london meant that the british capital was already on high alert before friday 's raids .
" we 're totally calm , the pope is happy , " vatican spokesman federico lombardi said when reporters told him about the arrests .
" we can say that we 're totally confident in the work of the police . "
papal schedule unchanged the pope attended a service at london 's westminster abbey on friday led by archbishop of canterbury rowan williams , the leader of the world 's anglican church .
the two church leaders then met at lambeth palace , the anglican archbishop 's london residence , for historic talks : no pontiff had visited lambeth palace or visited the historic abbey since the foundation of the church of england when king henry viii broke with rome in 1534 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some object to benedict 's handling of the sex scandal benedict also delivered a speech at westminster hall - the historic heart of the houses of parliament - and addressed some 3,000 young catholics at an event in southwest london .
anti-church protests continue the run-up to the visit was clouded by criticism of the catholic church 's handling of a child abuse scandal and a furore over the trip 's cost : 20 million gbp -lrb- 37 million euros -rrb- .
there were protests before benedict 's engagement with young people in twickenham on friday , in the southwest of the british capital , with around 20 demonstrators waving banners with slogans saying , " there is no god - get over it ! " or " the pope is wrong , put a condom on ! "
on his flight to britain , benedict made some of his strongest comments yet on the paedophilia controversy , saying revelations of child abuse by priests that have rocked the catholic church " were a shock to me . "
he added that " the authorities in the church have not been vigilant enough . "
the church " did not act quickly or firmly enough to take the necessary action " to stop the problem , which involved abuse by priests and catholic teachers in ireland , germany , and a number of other countries around europe .
while in london , benedict was expected to meet a group of 10 victims of abuse , either on friday or saturday .
first pope to make ' state visit ' to england on the first day of the pope 's visit , he warned of the risk of " aggressive secularism " in britain and greeted tens of thousands of people at a mass in glasgow and on the streets of edinburgh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen cordially invited the pope to britain herself " the united kingdom strives to be a modern and multicultural society , " benedict xvi said .
" in this challenging enterprise , may it always maintain its respect for those traditional values and cultural expressions that more aggressive forms of secularism no longer value or even tolerate . "
the pontiff also met queen elizabeth ii while in edinburgh : " i am delighted to welcome you to the uk and particularly to scotland on your first visit as pope , " the queen said .
this is the first papal visit to the uk to be classified as a state visit , because it was elizabeth ii who invited the pontiff , not the church .
benedict xvi and the queen focused on the positive aspects of relations between predominantly anglican britain and the roman catholic church , two bodies which the queen said shared " a common christian heritage . "
on sunday , benedict will travel to the central english city of birmingham for the final day of his visit , where he will preside over the beatification of a 19th century cardinal , john henry newman .

another man was arrested about eight hours later .
the police said officers had been searching two businesses and eight homes in the capital since the arrests , but had found no weapons or dangerous materials .
media reports suggested the arrests were likely linked to the papal visit , an issue on which the police would not comment .
the presence of pope benedict xvi in london meant that the british capital was already on high alert before friday 's raids .
" we 're totally calm , the pope is happy , " vatican spokesman federico lombardi said when reporters told him about the arrests .
" we can say that we 're totally confident in the work of the police . "
papal schedule unchanged the pope attended a service at london 's westminster abbey on friday led by archbishop of canterbury rowan williams , the leader of the world 's anglican church .
the two church leaders then met at lambeth palace , the anglican archbishop 's london residence , for historic talks : no pontiff had visited lambeth palace or visited the historic abbey since the foundation of the church of england when king henry viii broke with rome in 1534 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some object to benedict 's handling of the sex scandal benedict also delivered a speech at westminster hall - the historic heart of the houses of parliament - and addressed some 3,000 young catholics at an event in southwest london .
anti-church protests continue the run-up to the visit was clouded by criticism of the catholic church 's handling of a child abuse scandal and a furore over the trip 's cost : 20 million gbp -lrb- 37 million euros -rrb- .
there were protests before benedict 's engagement with young people in twickenham on friday , in the southwest of the british capital , with around 20 demonstrators waving banners with slogans saying , " there is no god - get over it ! " or " the pope is wrong , put a condom on ! "
on his flight to britain , benedict made some of his strongest comments yet on the paedophilia controversy , saying revelations of child abuse by priests that have rocked the catholic church " were a shock to me . "
he added that " the authorities in the church have not been vigilant enough . "
the church " did not act quickly or firmly enough to take the necessary action " to stop the problem , which involved abuse by priests and catholic teachers in ireland , germany , and a number of other countries around europe .
while in london , benedict was expected to meet a group of 10 victims of abuse , either on friday or saturday .
first pope to make ' state visit ' to england on the first day of the pope 's visit , he warned of the risk of " aggressive secularism " in britain and greeted tens of thousands of people at a mass in glasgow and on the streets of edinburgh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen cordially invited the pope to britain herself " the united kingdom strives to be a modern and multicultural society , " benedict xvi said .
" in this challenging enterprise , may it always maintain its respect for those traditional values and cultural expressions that more aggressive forms of secularism no longer value or even tolerate . "
the pontiff also met queen elizabeth ii while in edinburgh : " i am delighted to welcome you to the uk and particularly to scotland on your first visit as pope , " the queen said .
this is the first papal visit to the uk to be classified as a state visit , because it was elizabeth ii who invited the pontiff , not the church .
benedict xvi and the queen focused on the positive aspects of relations between predominantly anglican britain and the roman catholic church , two bodies which the queen said shared " a common christian heritage . "
on sunday , benedict will travel to the central english city of birmingham for the final day of his visit , where he will preside over the beatification of a 19th century cardinal , john henry newman .

when addressing issues of worldwide significance many nations need to be at the table , experts say . the united nations millennium development goals -lrb- mdg -rrb- include pledges to wipe out extreme poverty , achieve universal primary education , promote gender equality , reduce rates of child mortality , fight epidemic diseases , and develop a global partnership for development . the international nature of these global goals leaves individual nations struggling for effective solutions that transcend their borders .
that 's where " global governance " comes in .
it works to create international structures capable of dealing with issues of global significance , and the closer the mdgs come to their deadline of 2015 the clearer multinational cooperation becomes . states ' changing role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power structures are shifting from single states to larger organizations , like the g-20 " the old idea was that nation states need to be as independent as possible to be responsible to their own population , " said dirk messner , director of the german development institute .
" it 's now become clear that we are dealing with global interdependencies and that we have to politically organize them . " such organization is crucial for shared resources such as the climate , the food supply and energy , messner added .
while the united nations enjoys a high degree of respect when it comes to international debate , it suffers under its inability to take quick action in an emergency . " we 've just been through a small revolution that 's been overlooked by a lot of people : we 've seen the shift from a world economy organized by the g-8 to a g-20-organized global governance , which includes several emerging and developing nations that until now did not take part in the global development and political processes , " messner said . path to balanced agreements he added that having more countries at the table deciding on global issues would increase the likelihood that developing nations ' concerns are heard and that an agreement that balances the interests of the industrialized and developing world can be made . germany has shown itself to be interested in a finding a way to balance international interests , according to juergen zattler , the head of the german ministry for economic cooperation and development 's department for european and multinational development policy . " we hope that once the global governance structure is in place we can talk about a variety of topics , " he said .
" that members of the international community get closer together and more capable of taking action and that global deals can be made . " ngos out in the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un may represent a better place to make multilateral decisions while zattler said giving more influence to the g-20 would be a promising step toward successful multinational negotiation on the mdgs and climate change , a shift toward a g-20 dominated landscape still leaves civil non-national organizations in the cold , according to jens martens of the global policy forum europe . " civil groups and non-government organizations have a right to take part in discussions at the united nations , " he said .
" in other bodies , such as the g-20 , this is not the case .
it 's an exclusive club of governments that meets behind closed doors . " instead of creating new organizations designed to quicken decision making by circumventing the un , martens said the world body deserved strengthening - despite its cumbersome nature . " the more parties take part the harder it gets - that 's democracy , " he said .
" but it 's worth the effort to make truly representative decisions and to take into account the interests of the groups that otherwise do n't have a say .
in terms of the millennium goals it 's the interests of the world 's poorest people . " author : heiner kiesel -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 17.09.2010 germany 's forgotten performer valeska gert helped inspire punks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always a non-conformist , gert broke new ground in music and performance more than 30 years after her death , admirers pay tribute to one of germany 's most enigmatic - and overlooked - artists , dancer and actress valeska gert .
she 's said to have laid the foundations for the punk movement . " i saw her on television in 1977 when she was 86 and i thought , she has short hair , a colorful dress , she 's tough and living in the present , she 's a real punk because she does n't care about her image , " said artist and musician wolfgang mueller at the opening night of a new exhibition dedicated to valeska gert . the show in berlin 's hamburger bahnhof coincides with the launch of a mueller 's new biography on the performer .
" when she died in 1978 people took care of her letters and found correspondence from punks who said , we would like to know you and to meet you , " he said . indeed , valeska gert 's appearance on a tv talk show in the late 1970 's re-ignited interest in one of germany 's most enigmatic artistic figures .
her acceptance , at the age of 86 , by the burgeoning punk movement is as much a testament to her brash , no-nonsense energy as it is to her artistic achievements .
since then she has remained a marginal curio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this self-designed costume , pictured in 1931 , foreshadows 60 's fashions gert was born gertrud valesca samosch to a jewish family in berlin in 1892 .
showing no interest in academia , gert began taking dance lessons at the age of nine , and by 1915 was studying acting with alexander moissi .
her leanings toward the performing arts , combined with the detrimental effects of world war i on her father 's finances , led her to seek employment and she soon made appearances at the munich kammerspiele , the deutsches theater and the berliner tribuene . radical experiments on stage as the 1920 's progressed , she also began appearing in silent cinema , performing in " the threepenny opera , " " diary of a lost girl " with iconic flapper louise brooks , and g. w. pabst 's " joyless street . " it was around this time that gert unveiled one of her most enduring performance works .
entitled " pause , " it was an interpretative anti-dance performed between reels in cinemas , designed to draw attention to stillness and serenity . " it was so radical just to go on stage in the cinema stand there and do nothing , " said wolfgang mueller , " she did this in the 20 's where the convention was speed , business , activity and you see this in the films of the 20 's : big cities , traffic , nervosity .
to go out there and do the complete opposite was very , very modern . " by 1933 , with the nazis in power , gert suffered a ban from the german stage due to her jewish heritage .
she moved to london where she continued to perform on stage and appeared in the experimental short film " pett and pot " directed by alberto cavalcanti .
it would be her last film work until her triumphant return to the cinema in the mid-1960 's . trend setting with ' freedom from taste ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare 1969 recording of baby is screened at the pause exhibition by 1938 , in her late 40 's and living in new york but , gert found it virtually impossible to revive her previous career .
she lived on the welfare of a jewish refugee community , washed dishes and posed as a nude model .
in 1941 , she opened the bettlerbar -lrb- beggar 's bar -rrb- , a ramshackle cabaret / restaurant filled with mismatched furniture and staffed by the likes of jackson pollock and tennessee williams , the latter being fired by gert for being " too sloppy . " although licensing requirements forced the new york bar to close , gert introduced the concept to germany upon her return in 1950 .
it has proved perhaps her most enduring legacy ; tumbledown bars furnished with random pieces of flea-market chic and junk store accessories have since become legion in berlin , a fad started by gert which wolfgang mueller terms " freedom from taste . " back in post-war berlin , she once again had to start from scratch .
in the same 1977 television show , the interviewer tactfully suggested that by the dawn of the 1950 's gert was perhaps not so well remembered as before .
with typical self-depricating humor and bluntness typical for berliners , she exclaimed , " not so well remembered ?
i was totally forgotten ! " she opened the hexenkueche -lrb- witch 's kitchen -rrb- cabaret and made a triumphant return to the silver screen with an appearance in the 1965 surrealist drama " juliet of the spirits , " directed by frederico fellini .
she was soon cast in other high profile projects by rainer werner fassbinder 's and volker schloendorff . well outside the box bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the valeska gert exhibition is on display at the hamburger bahnhof until february 2011 while valeska gert has had a small but solid fan base , widespread fame always eluded her and , especially in the intervening years , she has become very much a marginalized character .
" i think she is a bit invisible , " said wolfgang mueller , " she is not known because she always ignored borders .
she was always far away from these boxes that the art scene puts people in . " however , 2010 may well see an upswing in gert 's popularity ; the exhibition dedicated to her work has a generous five-month run , while the martin schmitz publishing house has not only released mueller 's definitive new biography but also a 7 " vinyl recording of her 1969 performance of " baby , " an impersonation of a gurgling child alternating between rage and happiness . historian an paenhuysen , the curator of the new exhibition in berlin , was new to gert 's world before taking on this project ; now she is a devoted fan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 17.09.2010 germany 's forgotten performer valeska gert helped inspire punks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always a non-conformist , gert broke new ground in music and performance more than 30 years after her death , admirers pay tribute to one of germany 's most enigmatic - and overlooked - artists , dancer and actress valeska gert .
she 's said to have laid the foundations for the punk movement . " i saw her on television in 1977 when she was 86 and i thought , she has short hair , a colorful dress , she 's tough and living in the present , she 's a real punk because she does n't care about her image , " said artist and musician wolfgang mueller at the opening night of a new exhibition dedicated to valeska gert . the show in berlin 's hamburger bahnhof coincides with the launch of a mueller 's new biography on the performer .
" when she died in 1978 people took care of her letters and found correspondence from punks who said , we would like to know you and to meet you , " he said . indeed , valeska gert 's appearance on a tv talk show in the late 1970 's re-ignited interest in one of germany 's most enigmatic artistic figures .
her acceptance , at the age of 86 , by the burgeoning punk movement is as much a testament to her brash , no-nonsense energy as it is to her artistic achievements .
since then she has remained a marginal curio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this self-designed costume , pictured in 1931 , foreshadows 60 's fashions gert was born gertrud valesca samosch to a jewish family in berlin in 1892 .
showing no interest in academia , gert began taking dance lessons at the age of nine , and by 1915 was studying acting with alexander moissi .
her leanings toward the performing arts , combined with the detrimental effects of world war i on her father 's finances , led her to seek employment and she soon made appearances at the munich kammerspiele , the deutsches theater and the berliner tribuene . radical experiments on stage as the 1920 's progressed , she also began appearing in silent cinema , performing in " the threepenny opera , " " diary of a lost girl " with iconic flapper louise brooks , and g. w. pabst 's " joyless street . " it was around this time that gert unveiled one of her most enduring performance works .
entitled " pause , " it was an interpretative anti-dance performed between reels in cinemas , designed to draw attention to stillness and serenity . " it was so radical just to go on stage in the cinema stand there and do nothing , " said wolfgang mueller , " she did this in the 20 's where the convention was speed , business , activity and you see this in the films of the 20 's : big cities , traffic , nervosity .
to go out there and do the complete opposite was very , very modern . " by 1933 , with the nazis in power , gert suffered a ban from the german stage due to her jewish heritage .
she moved to london where she continued to perform on stage and appeared in the experimental short film " pett and pot " directed by alberto cavalcanti .
it would be her last film work until her triumphant return to the cinema in the mid-1960 's . trend setting with ' freedom from taste ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare 1969 recording of baby is screened at the pause exhibition by 1938 , in her late 40 's and living in new york but , gert found it virtually impossible to revive her previous career .
she lived on the welfare of a jewish refugee community , washed dishes and posed as a nude model .
in 1941 , she opened the bettlerbar -lrb- beggar 's bar -rrb- , a ramshackle cabaret / restaurant filled with mismatched furniture and staffed by the likes of jackson pollock and tennessee williams , the latter being fired by gert for being " too sloppy . " although licensing requirements forced the new york bar to close , gert introduced the concept to germany upon her return in 1950 .
it has proved perhaps her most enduring legacy ; tumbledown bars furnished with random pieces of flea-market chic and junk store accessories have since become legion in berlin , a fad started by gert which wolfgang mueller terms " freedom from taste . " back in post-war berlin , she once again had to start from scratch .
in the same 1977 television show , the interviewer tactfully suggested that by the dawn of the 1950 's gert was perhaps not so well remembered as before .
with typical self-depricating humor and bluntness typical for berliners , she exclaimed , " not so well remembered ?
i was totally forgotten ! " she opened the hexenkueche -lrb- witch 's kitchen -rrb- cabaret and made a triumphant return to the silver screen with an appearance in the 1965 surrealist drama " juliet of the spirits , " directed by frederico fellini .
she was soon cast in other high profile projects by rainer werner fassbinder 's and volker schloendorff . well outside the box bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the valeska gert exhibition is on display at the hamburger bahnhof until february 2011 while valeska gert has had a small but solid fan base , widespread fame always eluded her and , especially in the intervening years , she has become very much a marginalized character .
" i think she is a bit invisible , " said wolfgang mueller , " she is not known because she always ignored borders .
she was always far away from these boxes that the art scene puts people in . " however , 2010 may well see an upswing in gert 's popularity ; the exhibition dedicated to her work has a generous five-month run , while the martin schmitz publishing house has not only released mueller 's definitive new biography but also a 7 " vinyl recording of her 1969 performance of " baby , " an impersonation of a gurgling child alternating between rage and happiness . historian an paenhuysen , the curator of the new exhibition in berlin , was new to gert 's world before taking on this project ; now she is a devoted fan .
" valeska gert made work that is still very contemporary .
it still works for today , " she said .
" it 's very familiar and at the same time very strange , frightening .
it touches you .
it 's really hard to sum her up .
you ca n't name her or put her in a box . " author : neale lytollis editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when addressing issues of worldwide significance many nations need to be at the table , experts say . the united nations millennium development goals -lrb- mdg -rrb- include pledges to wipe out extreme poverty , achieve universal primary education , promote gender equality , reduce rates of child mortality , fight epidemic diseases , and develop a global partnership for development . the international nature of these global goals leaves individual nations struggling for effective solutions that transcend their borders .
that 's where " global governance " comes in .
it works to create international structures capable of dealing with issues of global significance , and the closer the mdgs come to their deadline of 2015 the clearer multinational cooperation becomes . states ' changing role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power structures are shifting from single states to larger organizations , like the g-20 " the old idea was that nation states need to be as independent as possible to be responsible to their own population , " said dirk messner , director of the german development institute .
" it 's now become clear that we are dealing with global interdependencies and that we have to politically organize them . " such organization is crucial for shared resources such as the climate , the food supply and energy , messner added .
while the united nations enjoys a high degree of respect when it comes to international debate , it suffers under its inability to take quick action in an emergency . " we 've just been through a small revolution that 's been overlooked by a lot of people : we 've seen the shift from a world economy organized by the g-8 to a g-20-organized global governance , which includes several emerging and developing nations that until now did not take part in the global development and political processes , " messner said . path to balanced agreements he added that having more countries at the table deciding on global issues would increase the likelihood that developing nations ' concerns are heard and that an agreement that balances the interests of the industrialized and developing world can be made . germany has shown itself to be interested in a finding a way to balance international interests , according to juergen zattler , the head of the german ministry for economic cooperation and development 's department for european and multinational development policy . " we hope that once the global governance structure is in place we can talk about a variety of topics , " he said .
" that members of the international community get closer together and more capable of taking action and that global deals can be made . " ngos out in the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un may represent a better place to make multilateral decisions while zattler said giving more influence to the g-20 would be a promising step toward successful multinational negotiation on the mdgs and climate change , a shift toward a g-20 dominated landscape still leaves civil non-national organizations in the cold , according to jens martens of the global policy forum europe . " civil groups and non-government organizations have a right to take part in discussions at the united nations , " he said .
" in other bodies , such as the g-20 , this is not the case .
it 's an exclusive club of governments that meets behind closed doors . " instead of creating new organizations designed to quicken decision making by circumventing the un , martens said the world body deserved strengthening - despite its cumbersome nature . " the more parties take part the harder it gets - that 's democracy , " he said .
" but it 's worth the effort to make truly representative decisions and to take into account the interests of the groups that otherwise do n't have a say .
in terms of the millennium goals it 's the interests of the world 's poorest people . " author : heiner kiesel -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

friday , september 18 frankfurt-freiburg freiburg have looked much better this year than last and have shown they can win away .
but after a sputtering start , frankfurt got back on track last week and have enough drive going forward to exploit their opponents ' weakness at the back .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 saturday , september 18 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne will hope to see this mueller - not the celebratory one bayern munich-cologne no secret about the billy goats ' strategy here – pack it in in their own half , frustrate franck ribery and hope for a draw .
with bayern perhaps having tired legs from the champions league , cologne 's plan has a chance of working .
but something tells me thomas mueller has found his rhythm again , and as he showed on wedsnesday , he can manufacture goals from nothing .
prediction : bayern 2-0 werder bremen-mainz this is just the sort of match profligate bremen often lose , and what 's not to like about this year 's plucky , well-organized mainz squad ?
unfortunately for the latter , though , i think the now-confirmed news that wunderkind andre schuerrle is headed to leverkusen next season will prove to be a distraction .
prediction : bremen 3-1 stuttgart-moenchengladbach this is a case of the underachieving taking on the unpredictable .
stuttgart have been a mess this season , especially on defense , and are coming off only two days rest .
gladbach have been up and down but have already tripped up one big club at home .
methinks they split the points .
prediction : 1-1 draw wolfsburg-hanover there 's one team here still looking for its first points , and it 's not hanover .
the 96ers are undefeated , and their two wins , while close , have been deserved .
for the wolves , who are miles ahead talent-wise , this will be a test of whether they have faith in new coach steve mcclaren .
i think the result will be indecisive .
prediction : 2-2 draw .
kaiserslautern-hoffenheim as bayern found out two weeks ago , never underestimate lautern 's home field advantage .
but i like what i 've seen from hoffenheim this season .
they 're more disciplined than in the past and look like they 're on a mission to prove the doubters wrong .
and they simply have too much attacking firepower for the red devils .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 sunday , september 19 st. pauli-hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. pauli fans will hope their outlaw act intimidates their city rivals of the true city derbies in german football , this one is the best .
on paper , pauli are completely overmatched against hamburg .
but that 's on paper .
taking to the field in millerntor stadium with ac / dc 's hell 's bells ringing in your ears is something that can impress even the likes of ruud van nistelrooy .
and somewhere within all that ringing i hear the sound of an upset .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 dortmund-schalke could things get any worse for schalke ?
they 're on a bad losing streak , and now they get a visit their bitterest rivals , who are off to a good start .
but i 'm not writing off schalke just yet , and i think two extra days rest will help them sneak a point .
prediction : 1-1 draw leverkusen-nuremberg leverkusen have lived up to their reputation as one of the bundesliga 's least consistent teams and will have thursday 's europa cup match weighing down their legs .
but i think nuremberg will be thrown off by the loss of their best striker , albert bunjaku , to injury for the rest of the year .

cheers !
with oktoberfest about to kick off in munich , we asked our facebook users about their oktoberfest experiences , the good and the bad .
here 's a selection of their comments . have you ever been to oktoberfest ?
ha , i never went to oktoberfest while i was living in germany .
i am a born and bred berliner .
that explains it i guess .
however , i 've been to numerous oktoberfests in new zealand .
they are put on each year by the new zealand german business association in auckland and they rock , i mean ooompah !
so much fun - this year 's is on this friday . - anja yes !
and it was very memorable .
i went in munich for the 2000 oktoberfest !
we arrived very early and picked a tent and it was packed !
we squeezed in with a table and started drinking , and soon everyone was talking , dancing and singing and they locked the doors .
later , some star guests arrived ; some soccer players and a man with a dog , and the crowd went wild .
i still have the little woven heart trinket i bought . - laura yes .
when i was a student of goethe institut hong kong , i attended the oktoberfest party at the open car park of the marco polo hotel .
the marco polo oktoberfest is now very famous in hong kong .
it 's all about german food , beer , dancing and a swiss band .
but after all the years , it is still unchanged .
i 'll attend too this year , and see if the swiss band will still sing the same songs and play the same games .
but no change could be nice , because it 's a good atmosphere and memories every time . - paskol yeah , i went with my colleagues when i lived in germany last year .
we spent a long time walking around as there were no places to sit but it was a great atmosphere .
in the end we learned that it 's better to book in advance so we sat at odeonsplatz instead and had some beers . - hannah when i was stationed as a soldier in offenbach / main in 1958 , i made friends with a young german and we decided at the last minute to go to the oktoberfest on his motorcycle .
once there we hunted and hunted for a place to spend the night but everything was booked .
we ended up sleeping on big oil cans at a gas station .
had a great time though . - bill yes .
i was there last year with five friends in the second weekend .
it was wonderful and the weather was very good .
we do n't remember the number of beer mugs we drank , but we had a good time .
i suppose we will remember that weekend until our last minute in this world . - francisco horrible experience .
everybody was drunk and the whole thing was pretty boring ...
i prefer cologne 's carnival .
everyone 's drunk there as well , but at least it 's fun : they sing and dress up . - maria-lujan last year i was at the oktoberfest together with other students studying german at the goethe institut in schwaebisch hall .
a camera crew from the deutsche welle team filmed us while we experienced the oktoberfest for the first time .
it was such a fun and amazing experience !
i ended up going back to the wiesn four more times that year and each time i met interesting and fun people .
one of the things i liked best about the oktoberfest is how easy it is to meet people sitting near you and to strike up a conversation with them .
i also especially enjoyed standing on the benches , drinking lots of beer , and singing crazy german songs ! - benjamin compiled by stuart tiffen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the center will be a new way to help computer users escape botnets - groups of malware-infected computers that can be controlled and exploited by a remote third party .
" the main goal is to remove germany from the top 10 ranking of countries from which botnet activities originate , " according to a document about the project published late last year on the organization for economic cooperation and development 's website .
when expanded successfully , botnets can comprise thousands or millions of so-called zombie computers that are under the control of an attacker .
they can be used for infecting further computers , sending spam , conducting criminal activity and launching cyber-attacks .
generally speaking , botnets only affect computers with the microsoft windows operating system .
linux and mac os computers are rarely infected .
according to industry statistics , every seventh german computer connected to the internet is currently part of a botnet , with its user often unaware of the situation .
thomas de maiziere , germany 's interior minister , in a statement , described the problem as " the greatest current danger for the internet . "

the center 's website , www.botfrei.de , contains instructions on how to free an affected computer from a botnet , as well as useful software .
the 2 million euro project is financially supported by the federal ministry of the interior and technically by the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- .
several internet providers , such as deutsche telekom , are also involved .
in the future , the participating internet providers will automatically notify their clients by email or post if their computers are infected with malware .
de maziere is encouraging non-participating providers to join the project , but he also emphasizes that affected internet users need to “ take their share of responsibility ” and take advantage of the assistance offered by the help center .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 17.09.2010 eu threat to impose female quotas gets mixed response in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuck in lower management ?
the eu ’ s commissioner for equal opportunities viviane reding has warned firms in europe to rapidly promote women into top jobs or face a 30 percent quota from next year . a european commission threat to elevate women by fixed quotas into top company jobs coincides with growing admissions in germany that this could be the only remaining option to redress the balance .
despite a pledge made nine years ago by german industry to voluntarily remove the “ glass ceiling ” blocking women , only 2.5 percent of board members of germany 's 200 largest companies are female .
and at the 100 firms with the highest turnover , only four board executives are women .
eu-wide the trend is much the same : the commission says 89 percent of board members of europe 's stock market-listed companies are males .
growing support for quotas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henkel now favors quotas for women hans-olaf henkel , ex-president of the german bdi industry federation , conceded recently that he no longer opposes a quota .
“ the fact that over the years hardly anything has happened shows that we 're not making headway . ”
personnel consultant heiner thorborg , the author of a book on why women do not make it into top jobs , said he too had once been an opponent of quotas .
“ but when i consider that my 12-year-old daughter will have to wait 200 years until something significant happens , then i say : the last modus is the quota , and it has to come ! ”
pressure mounts within bavarian csu even within bavaria 's tradionally conservative party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , women members want change .
bavarian justice minister beate merk told german public radio on thursday that she wants a 40 percent women 's quota on party committees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goodwill is not enough , says bavaria 's justice minister beate merk .
“ we 've seen that all the goodwill and effort has n't helped . ”
female participation in party membership , currently at 18 percent , was dwindling , she added . “ we want a quota .
women voters can only be won over when women can participate in politics and when women have the chance to move into positions of leadership . ”
family minister seeks concensus federal family minister kristina schroeder favors industry 's goodwill as before .
“ what we need are political changes that we 'll best achieve with the support of commerce , not in battle against industry . ”
schroeder 's ministry has initiated the drafting of a voluntary “ code for good management . ”
apart from one woman , its code commission is made up of male executives .
like commissioner reding , business studies professor ulrike detmers points to research findings showing that firms with a balanced male-female mix benefit all round , including gains in profitability : “ goals are reached much more quickly .
meetings run more efficiently .
when the women present are also mothers then one comes straight to the point . ” what 's needed , she says , is “ better childcare , more flexible hours ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's high time to redress the balance , if necessary by force , says viviane reding but some in germany maintain that such progress can not be legislated .
the president of the german chambers of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , hans heinrich driftmann , says that the lack of women in senior positions can be attributed to a number of reasons , including the difficulty of balancing family and work , and women 's tendency to avoid technical and scientific career paths .
" a legal quota ca n't really influence such wide-ranging underlying causes , and for that reason , i would argue against imposing one , " driftmann told the german daily paper die welt .
" i was recruited to my career on the basis of my qualifications , not because of my sex , " said marie-christine ostermann , a 32-year-old executive who also chairs germany 's association of young business leaders .
" had a quota been in place , i would have felt as if i had been reduced to a gender . "
germany falling back in international rankings in overall gender inequality terms , germany has fallen back in recent years , according to the world economic forum 's latest survey .
from being ranked fifth among 128 nations in 2006 , germany has slipped to 12th place .
topping the list are scandinavian nations .
the forum 's scoring is based on 30 indicators , including women 's access to education and chances for economic participation .
in one of several nationwide studies , the german institute for economic research , the diw , found that most women in employment remain confined to lower-paid jobs , and if they do enter senior management , then this tends to happen in service sectors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sattelberg says ' old boys networks ' persist everywhere the luebeck-based survey institute databyte says the presence of women in middle to upper management nationwide is 17 percent , but its survey of 940,000 firms shows marked regional variety . berlin tops with a women 's quota of 19 percent , closely followed by germany 's post-unification eastern states .
the tail-ender is baden-wurttemberg in southwestern germany with below 15 percent .
firm size also plays a role – women play bigger roles in smaller firms , including the retailing and the health sector in eastern germany .
one of the few german companies to self-impose its own women 's quota is deutsche telekom .
its goal is 30 percent by 2015 , but senior telekom employees fear that a decade of appeals and promises has not worked .
" old boys network " still prevails “ i think we have underestimated one thing – the ever-present dna , the ' old boys networks ' that shape company cultures , also in the sense of propagating traditional role models , " telekom 's head of personnel , thomas sattelberg said . professor detmer doubts that germany 's current government will move beyond soliciting goodwill .
“ out of consideration for industry 's interests , i do n't think the federal government will make the hard choices . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 17.09.2010 german government plays down roma ' misunderstanding ' with france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's statements left many germans scratching their heads politicians in berlin have said the mixed messages on roma deportations from nicolas sarkozy and berlin are not a ' strain ' on franco-german relations .
meanwhile , roma leaders in germany say camps are n't an issue here . it was n't really french president nicolas sarkozy 's dismantling of roma camps and large-scale deportations that caused controversy in germany , nor was it his " lively " confrontation with european commission president jose manuel barroso on the issue , it was his assertion that german chancellor angela merkel was planning to introduce a similar policy .
" mrs. merkel told me that germany also intends to start clearing out camps in the coming weeks , " sarkozy told reporters in brussels on thursday evening .
the chancellor 's office in berlin and foreign minister guido westerwelle both swiftly refuted sarkozy 's claims , with westerwelle saying that such a policy " would run contrary to the german constitution . "
however , german leaders are also playing down the significance of this " misunderstanding , " saying the confusion will not hurt germany and france 's cooperation bilaterally , or within the eu .
" you should not over-interpret this as a strain on franco-german relations , " government spokesman steffen seibert said in berlin on friday .
" no camps " in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose says germany and france both discriminate , but to different extents roma leaders in germany said they were confused by sarkozy 's statement , given that most german-based roma are more integrated into society and are less likely to live in makeshift camps .
" for me , it 's very clear that -lrb- german chancellor angela merkel -rrb- said nothing of this nature , primarily because there are n't any camps here in germany - or , at least , none of which i am aware , " the head of the central council for german sinti and roma , romani rose , told the mdr german public broadcaster on friday .
" so , to me , the chancellor 's denial seems entirely credible . "
" sinti and roma live normally like the rest of the population ; they are workers , employees , academics and artists , they 're members of sporting clubs , and , very often , people do n't even know they 're part of an ethnic minority . "
rose said that discrimination remained a major issue in germany , but usually on an individual level .
he referred to a recent survey carried out by the council in which over 80 percent of respondents said they had encountered some form of discrimination in their day-to-day lives .
sinti and roma can encounter discrimination when looking for a job or a flat , in individual legal disputes , and even in their local pub , he explained .
" but none of this is comparable with this sweeping , criminalizing campaign being carried out by the upper echelons of the french government , including the president , " rose said .
" these policies have caused great concern amongst our people here in germany , and all over europe . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose says germany has no camps like this one in a paris suburb if germany has a policy comparable to the french mass deportations , it would be the contentious decision to gradually send some 12,000 former refugees , many of whom are roma , back to their home country of kosovo now that germany deems the situation there stable .
unlike romania and bulgaria , where most french-based roma are being sent , kosovo is not a member of the european union , meaning the issue does not fall within the jurisdiction of the eu commission , france 's most high-profile critic on this issue to date .
rose said he strongly opposed the german policy to repatriate sinti and roma , among others , to kosovo , arguing that april 's decision to begin this process was premature and that the government in pristina was not yet ready to uphold the rights of formerly displaced people .
" it 's still irresponsible to send these people back to kosovo now , " he said .
" the un 's refugee representative in berlin has said that the security situation for roma in kosovo is not yet satisfactory , international human rights groups like amnesty international have said the same thing , as has the central council for german sinti and roma . "
but rose also said that the german government was handling the roughly 12,000 cases differently to france , describing each decision as an " individual example " , whereas france was carrying out a deportation policy " en masse . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 17.09.2010 germany 's forgotten performer valeska gert helped inspire punks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always a non-conformist , gert broke new ground in music and performance more than 30 years after her death , admirers pay tribute to one of germany 's most enigmatic - and overlooked - artists , dancer and actress valeska gert .
she 's said to have laid the foundations for the punk movement . " i saw her on television in 1977 when she was 86 and i thought , she has short hair , a colorful dress , she 's tough and living in the present , she 's a real punk because she does n't care about her image , " said artist and musician wolfgang mueller at the opening night of a new exhibition dedicated to valeska gert . the show in berlin 's hamburger bahnhof coincides with the launch of a mueller 's new biography on the performer .
" when she died in 1978 people took care of her letters and found correspondence from punks who said , we would like to know you and to meet you , " he said . indeed , valeska gert 's appearance on a tv talk show in the late 1970 's re-ignited interest in one of germany 's most enigmatic artistic figures .
her acceptance , at the age of 86 , by the burgeoning punk movement is as much a testament to her brash , no-nonsense energy as it is to her artistic achievements .

to go out there and do the complete opposite was very , very modern . " by 1933 , with the nazis in power , gert suffered a ban from the german stage due to her jewish heritage .
she moved to london where she continued to perform on stage and appeared in the experimental short film " pett and pot " directed by alberto cavalcanti .

she lived on the welfare of a jewish refugee community , washed dishes and posed as a nude model .
in 1941 , she opened the bettlerbar -lrb- beggar 's bar -rrb- , a ramshackle cabaret / restaurant filled with mismatched furniture and staffed by the likes of jackson pollock and tennessee williams , the latter being fired by gert for being " too sloppy . " although licensing requirements forced the new york bar to close , gert introduced the concept to germany upon her return in 1950 .
it has proved perhaps her most enduring legacy ; tumbledown bars furnished with random pieces of flea-market chic and junk store accessories have since become legion in berlin , a fad started by gert which wolfgang mueller terms " freedom from taste . " back in post-war berlin , she once again had to start from scratch .
in the same 1977 television show , the interviewer tactfully suggested that by the dawn of the 1950 's gert was perhaps not so well remembered as before .
with typical self-depricating humor and bluntness typical for berliners , she exclaimed , " not so well remembered ?
i was totally forgotten ! " she opened the hexenkueche -lrb- witch 's kitchen -rrb- cabaret and made a triumphant return to the silver screen with an appearance in the 1965 surrealist drama " juliet of the spirits , " directed by frederico fellini .

" i think she is a bit invisible , " said wolfgang mueller , " she is not known because she always ignored borders .
she was always far away from these boxes that the art scene puts people in .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 17.09.2010 germany 's forgotten performer valeska gert helped inspire punks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always a non-conformist , gert broke new ground in music and performance more than 30 years after her death , admirers pay tribute to one of germany 's most enigmatic - and overlooked - artists , dancer and actress valeska gert .
she 's said to have laid the foundations for the punk movement . " i saw her on television in 1977 when she was 86 and i thought , she has short hair , a colorful dress , she 's tough and living in the present , she 's a real punk because she does n't care about her image , " said artist and musician wolfgang mueller at the opening night of a new exhibition dedicated to valeska gert . the show in berlin 's hamburger bahnhof coincides with the launch of a mueller 's new biography on the performer .
" when she died in 1978 people took care of her letters and found correspondence from punks who said , we would like to know you and to meet you , " he said . indeed , valeska gert 's appearance on a tv talk show in the late 1970 's re-ignited interest in one of germany 's most enigmatic artistic figures .
her acceptance , at the age of 86 , by the burgeoning punk movement is as much a testament to her brash , no-nonsense energy as it is to her artistic achievements .
since then she has remained a marginal curio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this self-designed costume , pictured in 1931 , foreshadows 60 's fashions gert was born gertrud valesca samosch to a jewish family in berlin in 1892 .
showing no interest in academia , gert began taking dance lessons at the age of nine , and by 1915 was studying acting with alexander moissi .
her leanings toward the performing arts , combined with the detrimental effects of world war i on her father 's finances , led her to seek employment and she soon made appearances at the munich kammerspiele , the deutsches theater and the berliner tribuene . radical experiments on stage as the 1920 's progressed , she also began appearing in silent cinema , performing in " the threepenny opera , " " diary of a lost girl " with iconic flapper louise brooks , and g. w. pabst 's " joyless street . " it was around this time that gert unveiled one of her most enduring performance works .
entitled " pause , " it was an interpretative anti-dance performed between reels in cinemas , designed to draw attention to stillness and serenity . " it was so radical just to go on stage in the cinema stand there and do nothing , " said wolfgang mueller , " she did this in the 20 's where the convention was speed , business , activity and you see this in the films of the 20 's : big cities , traffic , nervosity .
to go out there and do the complete opposite was very , very modern . " by 1933 , with the nazis in power , gert suffered a ban from the german stage due to her jewish heritage .
she moved to london where she continued to perform on stage and appeared in the experimental short film " pett and pot " directed by alberto cavalcanti .
it would be her last film work until her triumphant return to the cinema in the mid-1960 's . trend setting with ' freedom from taste ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare 1969 recording of baby is screened at the pause exhibition by 1938 , in her late 40 's and living in new york but , gert found it virtually impossible to revive her previous career .
she lived on the welfare of a jewish refugee community , washed dishes and posed as a nude model .
in 1941 , she opened the bettlerbar -lrb- beggar 's bar -rrb- , a ramshackle cabaret / restaurant filled with mismatched furniture and staffed by the likes of jackson pollock and tennessee williams , the latter being fired by gert for being " too sloppy . " although licensing requirements forced the new york bar to close , gert introduced the concept to germany upon her return in 1950 .
it has proved perhaps her most enduring legacy ; tumbledown bars furnished with random pieces of flea-market chic and junk store accessories have since become legion in berlin , a fad started by gert which wolfgang mueller terms " freedom from taste . " back in post-war berlin , she once again had to start from scratch .
in the same 1977 television show , the interviewer tactfully suggested that by the dawn of the 1950 's gert was perhaps not so well remembered as before .
with typical self-depricating humor and bluntness typical for berliners , she exclaimed , " not so well remembered ?
i was totally forgotten ! " she opened the hexenkueche -lrb- witch 's kitchen -rrb- cabaret and made a triumphant return to the silver screen with an appearance in the 1965 surrealist drama " juliet of the spirits , " directed by frederico fellini .
she was soon cast in other high profile projects by rainer werner fassbinder 's and volker schloendorff . well outside the box bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the valeska gert exhibition is on display at the hamburger bahnhof until february 2011 while valeska gert has had a small but solid fan base , widespread fame always eluded her and , especially in the intervening years , she has become very much a marginalized character .

another man was arrested about eight hours later .
the police said officers had been searching two businesses and eight homes in the capital since the arrests , but had found no weapons or dangerous materials .
media reports suggested the arrests were likely linked to the papal visit , an issue on which the police would not comment .
the presence of pope benedict xvi in london meant that the british capital was already on high alert before friday 's raids .
" we 're totally calm , the pope is happy , " vatican spokesman federico lombardi said when reporters told him about the arrests .
" we can say that we 're totally confident in the work of the police . "
papal schedule unchanged the pope attended a service at london 's westminster abbey on friday led by archbishop of canterbury rowan williams , the leader of the world 's anglican church .
the two church leaders then met at lambeth palace , the anglican archbishop 's london residence , for historic talks : no pontiff had visited lambeth palace or visited the historic abbey since the foundation of the church of england when king henry viii broke with rome in 1534 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 17.09.2010 eu threat to impose female quotas gets mixed response in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuck in lower management ?
the eu ’ s commissioner for equal opportunities viviane reding has warned firms in europe to rapidly promote women into top jobs or face a 30 percent quota from next year . a european commission threat to elevate women by fixed quotas into top company jobs coincides with growing admissions in germany that this could be the only remaining option to redress the balance .
despite a pledge made nine years ago by german industry to voluntarily remove the “ glass ceiling ” blocking women , only 2.5 percent of board members of germany 's 200 largest companies are female .
and at the 100 firms with the highest turnover , only four board executives are women .
eu-wide the trend is much the same : the commission says 89 percent of board members of europe 's stock market-listed companies are males .
growing support for quotas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henkel now favors quotas for women hans-olaf henkel , ex-president of the german bdi industry federation , conceded recently that he no longer opposes a quota .
“ the fact that over the years hardly anything has happened shows that we 're not making headway . ”
personnel consultant heiner thorborg , the author of a book on why women do not make it into top jobs , said he too had once been an opponent of quotas .
“ but when i consider that my 12-year-old daughter will have to wait 200 years until something significant happens , then i say : the last modus is the quota , and it has to come ! ”
pressure mounts within bavarian csu even within bavaria 's tradionally conservative party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , women members want change .
bavarian justice minister beate merk told german public radio on thursday that she wants a 40 percent women 's quota on party committees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goodwill is not enough , says bavaria 's justice minister beate merk .
“ we 've seen that all the goodwill and effort has n't helped . ”
female participation in party membership , currently at 18 percent , was dwindling , she added . “ we want a quota .
women voters can only be won over when women can participate in politics and when women have the chance to move into positions of leadership . ”
family minister seeks concensus federal family minister kristina schroeder favors industry 's goodwill as before .
“ what we need are political changes that we 'll best achieve with the support of commerce , not in battle against industry . ”
schroeder 's ministry has initiated the drafting of a voluntary “ code for good management . ”
apart from one woman , its code commission is made up of male executives .
like commissioner reding , business studies professor ulrike detmers points to research findings showing that firms with a balanced male-female mix benefit all round , including gains in profitability : “ goals are reached much more quickly .
meetings run more efficiently .
when the women present are also mothers then one comes straight to the point . ” what 's needed , she says , is “ better childcare , more flexible hours ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's high time to redress the balance , if necessary by force , says viviane reding but some in germany maintain that such progress can not be legislated .
the president of the german chambers of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , hans heinrich driftmann , says that the lack of women in senior positions can be attributed to a number of reasons , including the difficulty of balancing family and work , and women 's tendency to avoid technical and scientific career paths .
" a legal quota ca n't really influence such wide-ranging underlying causes , and for that reason , i would argue against imposing one , " driftmann told the german daily paper die welt .
" i was recruited to my career on the basis of my qualifications , not because of my sex , " said marie-christine ostermann , a 32-year-old executive who also chairs germany 's association of young business leaders .
" had a quota been in place , i would have felt as if i had been reduced to a gender . "
germany falling back in international rankings in overall gender inequality terms , germany has fallen back in recent years , according to the world economic forum 's latest survey .
from being ranked fifth among 128 nations in 2006 , germany has slipped to 12th place .
topping the list are scandinavian nations .
the forum 's scoring is based on 30 indicators , including women 's access to education and chances for economic participation .
in one of several nationwide studies , the german institute for economic research , the diw , found that most women in employment remain confined to lower-paid jobs , and if they do enter senior management , then this tends to happen in service sectors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sattelberg says ' old boys networks ' persist everywhere the luebeck-based survey institute databyte says the presence of women in middle to upper management nationwide is 17 percent , but its survey of 940,000 firms shows marked regional variety . berlin tops with a women 's quota of 19 percent , closely followed by germany 's post-unification eastern states .
the tail-ender is baden-wurttemberg in southwestern germany with below 15 percent .
firm size also plays a role – women play bigger roles in smaller firms , including the retailing and the health sector in eastern germany .
one of the few german companies to self-impose its own women 's quota is deutsche telekom .
its goal is 30 percent by 2015 , but senior telekom employees fear that a decade of appeals and promises has not worked .
" old boys network " still prevails “ i think we have underestimated one thing – the ever-present dna , the ' old boys networks ' that shape company cultures , also in the sense of propagating traditional role models , " telekom 's head of personnel , thomas sattelberg said . professor detmer doubts that germany 's current government will move beyond soliciting goodwill .
“ out of consideration for industry 's interests , i do n't think the federal government will make the hard choices . ”

“ but when i consider that my 12-year-old daughter will have to wait 200 years until something significant happens , then i say : the last modus is the quota , and it has to come ! ”
pressure mounts within bavarian csu even within bavaria 's tradionally conservative party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , women members want change .
bavarian justice minister beate merk told german public radio on thursday that she wants a 40 percent women 's quota on party committees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goodwill is not enough , says bavaria 's justice minister beate merk .
“ we 've seen that all the goodwill and effort has n't helped . ”
female participation in party membership , currently at 18 percent , was dwindling , she added . “ we want a quota .
women voters can only be won over when women can participate in politics and when women have the chance to move into positions of leadership . ”
family minister seeks concensus federal family minister kristina schroeder favors industry 's goodwill as before .
“ what we need are political changes that we 'll best achieve with the support of commerce , not in battle against industry . ”
schroeder 's ministry has initiated the drafting of a voluntary “ code for good management . ”
apart from one woman , its code commission is made up of male executives .
like commissioner reding , business studies professor ulrike detmers points to research findings showing that firms with a balanced male-female mix benefit all round , including gains in profitability : “ goals are reached much more quickly .
meetings run more efficiently .
when the women present are also mothers then one comes straight to the point . ” what 's needed , she says , is “ better childcare , more flexible hours ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's high time to redress the balance , if necessary by force , says viviane reding but some in germany maintain that such progress can not be legislated .
the president of the german chambers of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , hans heinrich driftmann , says that the lack of women in senior positions can be attributed to a number of reasons , including the difficulty of balancing family and work , and women 's tendency to avoid technical and scientific career paths .
" a legal quota ca n't really influence such wide-ranging underlying causes , and for that reason , i would argue against imposing one , " driftmann told the german daily paper die welt .
" i was recruited to my career on the basis of my qualifications , not because of my sex , " said marie-christine ostermann , a 32-year-old executive who also chairs germany 's association of young business leaders .
" had a quota been in place , i would have felt as if i had been reduced to a gender . "
germany falling back in international rankings in overall gender inequality terms , germany has fallen back in recent years , according to the world economic forum 's latest survey .
from being ranked fifth among 128 nations in 2006 , germany has slipped to 12th place .
topping the list are scandinavian nations .
the forum 's scoring is based on 30 indicators , including women 's access to education and chances for economic participation .
in one of several nationwide studies , the german institute for economic research , the diw , found that most women in employment remain confined to lower-paid jobs , and if they do enter senior management , then this tends to happen in service sectors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sattelberg says ' old boys networks ' persist everywhere the luebeck-based survey institute databyte says the presence of women in middle to upper management nationwide is 17 percent , but its survey of 940,000 firms shows marked regional variety . berlin tops with a women 's quota of 19 percent , closely followed by germany 's post-unification eastern states .
the tail-ender is baden-wurttemberg in southwestern germany with below 15 percent .
firm size also plays a role – women play bigger roles in smaller firms , including the retailing and the health sector in eastern germany .
one of the few german companies to self-impose its own women 's quota is deutsche telekom .
its goal is 30 percent by 2015 , but senior telekom employees fear that a decade of appeals and promises has not worked .
" old boys network " still prevails “ i think we have underestimated one thing – the ever-present dna , the ' old boys networks ' that shape company cultures , also in the sense of propagating traditional role models , " telekom 's head of personnel , thomas sattelberg said . professor detmer doubts that germany 's current government will move beyond soliciting goodwill .
“ out of consideration for industry 's interests , i do n't think the federal government will make the hard choices . ”

the move could pressure german carmakers to ramp up mass production of their own electric vehicles . rwe and china 's byd have teamed to bring electrical cars to germany , beginning with a trial fleet in 2011 .
a mass rollout in germany and several other european markets is planned the following year .
the deal with the chinese company , a battery specialist that has since expanded into car manufacturing , follows a string of agreements with other manufacturers , including france 's renault , japan 's nissan and daimler .
the centrepiece of the agreement is a package deal for electric car enthusiasts , consisting of byd 's electric vehicles and rwe 's fast-charging posts and electricity supplied exclusively from renewable sources .
two models will be initially available and targeted primarily at consumers in cities driving shorter distances .
already on the market the one model is a plug-in hybrid car that combines new electric and conventional internal combustion systems .
on the market in china since early this year , it has a range of between 60 and 100 kilometers when running only on electricity .
the other newer model will be a purely electric vehicle with a battery range of about 300 kilometers and an acceleration of 0 to 100 kilometers per hour within 10 seconds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe plans to charge electric cars with electricity from rewewable energy sources the package will include a fast-charging device from rwe , access to the company 's expanding network of public charging points – now at around 450 – and electricity generated by wind and solar systems .
rwe spokesman peter hoscheidt told deutsche welle that no decision has yet been reached on whether the cars and charging unit can be leased in addition to being purchased or both and what the prices will be .
but he said both options will be likely and prices will be attractive to garner attention .
in berlin , the german energy company is already collaborating with daimler in a field trial .
they 're testing smart cars powered by lithium-ion batteries , which can be charged at home and public supply points .
the collaboration is one of several electric car initiatives running under the german government 's e-mobility program .
seeking standardization through their collaboration , rwe and byd also hope to contribute to standardization efforts in the nascent electric car industry .
standardized components are crucial to kick start mass production .
but the standardization process of a new technology , like electrically powered cars , is often accompanied by power struggles between groups seeking recognition of their own systems as standards in order to collect royalty fees down the road .
bildunterschrift : rwe sees the day coming when " fill it up " is replaced by " charge it up " why the cooperation with a chinese manufacturer now ?
because the chinese , hoscheidt said , promise mass production by 2012 , thus ensuring a sufficient supply of competitively priced vehicles .
" this is by no means an exclusive agreement , " he said .
" we 're seeking partners to push electric cars .
the sooner they can deliver , the better . "
coveted battery technolgy earlier this year , byd and daimler signed an agreement to develop and build electric cars for the chinese market .
the cars will be sold under a jointly owned brand .
daimler plans to take advantage of byd 's battery technology to help boost chinese sales .
byd is china 's sixth-biggest car manufacturer by sales last year .
american billionaire warren buffet owns 10 percent of the company .
but ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a professor at the university of duisburg-essen and an expert on the german auto industry warns about expecting too much too soon from chinese car makers .
" let 's see what comes , " he told deutsche welle .
" we 've seen a few chinese manufacturers come to europe , and they 've failed . "
byd 's car sales have been dropping noticeably in its home market , according to dudenhoeffer .
" there 's plenty of demand in china but other cars are apparently in greater demand , " he said .
nevertheless , dudenhoeffer welcomes the latest attempt to push electric cars in germany .
" there 's a lot more happening in a number of countries like france , " he said , pointing to financial incentives .

the move could pressure german carmakers to ramp up mass production of their own electric vehicles . rwe and china 's byd have teamed to bring electrical cars to germany , beginning with a trial fleet in 2011 .
a mass rollout in germany and several other european markets is planned the following year .
the deal with the chinese company , a battery specialist that has since expanded into car manufacturing , follows a string of agreements with other manufacturers , including france 's renault , japan 's nissan and daimler .
the centrepiece of the agreement is a package deal for electric car enthusiasts , consisting of byd 's electric vehicles and rwe 's fast-charging posts and electricity supplied exclusively from renewable sources .
two models will be initially available and targeted primarily at consumers in cities driving shorter distances .
already on the market the one model is a plug-in hybrid car that combines new electric and conventional internal combustion systems .
on the market in china since early this year , it has a range of between 60 and 100 kilometers when running only on electricity .
the other newer model will be a purely electric vehicle with a battery range of about 300 kilometers and an acceleration of 0 to 100 kilometers per hour within 10 seconds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe plans to charge electric cars with electricity from rewewable energy sources the package will include a fast-charging device from rwe , access to the company 's expanding network of public charging points – now at around 450 – and electricity generated by wind and solar systems .
rwe spokesman peter hoscheidt told deutsche welle that no decision has yet been reached on whether the cars and charging unit can be leased in addition to being purchased or both and what the prices will be .
but he said both options will be likely and prices will be attractive to garner attention .
in berlin , the german energy company is already collaborating with daimler in a field trial .
they 're testing smart cars powered by lithium-ion batteries , which can be charged at home and public supply points .
the collaboration is one of several electric car initiatives running under the german government 's e-mobility program .
seeking standardization through their collaboration , rwe and byd also hope to contribute to standardization efforts in the nascent electric car industry .

but the standardization process of a new technology , like electrically powered cars , is often accompanied by power struggles between groups seeking recognition of their own systems as standards in order to collect royalty fees down the road .

friday , september 18 frankfurt-freiburg freiburg have looked much better this year than last and have shown they can win away .
but after a sputtering start , frankfurt got back on track last week and have enough drive going forward to exploit their opponents ' weakness at the back .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 saturday , september 18 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne will hope to see this mueller - not the celebratory one bayern munich-cologne no secret about the billy goats ' strategy here – pack it in in their own half , frustrate franck ribery and hope for a draw .
with bayern perhaps having tired legs from the champions league , cologne 's plan has a chance of working .
but something tells me thomas mueller has found his rhythm again , and as he showed on wedsnesday , he can manufacture goals from nothing .
prediction : bayern 2-0 werder bremen-mainz this is just the sort of match profligate bremen often lose , and what 's not to like about this year 's plucky , well-organized mainz squad ?
unfortunately for the latter , though , i think the now-confirmed news that wunderkind andre schuerrle is headed to leverkusen next season will prove to be a distraction .
prediction : bremen 3-1 stuttgart-moenchengladbach this is a case of the underachieving taking on the unpredictable .
stuttgart have been a mess this season , especially on defense , and are coming off only two days rest .
gladbach have been up and down but have already tripped up one big club at home .
methinks they split the points .
prediction : 1-1 draw wolfsburg-hanover there 's one team here still looking for its first points , and it 's not hanover .
the 96ers are undefeated , and their two wins , while close , have been deserved .
for the wolves , who are miles ahead talent-wise , this will be a test of whether they have faith in new coach steve mcclaren .
i think the result will be indecisive .
prediction : 2-2 draw .
kaiserslautern-hoffenheim as bayern found out two weeks ago , never underestimate lautern 's home field advantage .
but i like what i 've seen from hoffenheim this season .
they 're more disciplined than in the past and look like they 're on a mission to prove the doubters wrong .
and they simply have too much attacking firepower for the red devils .

but that 's on paper .
taking to the field in millerntor stadium with ac / dc 's hell 's bells ringing in your ears is something that can impress even the likes of ruud van nistelrooy .
and somewhere within all that ringing i hear the sound of an upset .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 dortmund-schalke could things get any worse for schalke ?
they 're on a bad losing streak , and now they get a visit their bitterest rivals , who are off to a good start .
but i 'm not writing off schalke just yet , and i think two extra days rest will help them sneak a point .
prediction : 1-1 draw leverkusen-nuremberg leverkusen have lived up to their reputation as one of the bundesliga 's least consistent teams and will have thursday 's europa cup match weighing down their legs .
but i think nuremberg will be thrown off by the loss of their best striker , albert bunjaku , to injury for the rest of the year .

friday , september 18 frankfurt-freiburg freiburg have looked much better this year than last and have shown they can win away .
but after a sputtering start , frankfurt got back on track last week and have enough drive going forward to exploit their opponents ' weakness at the back .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 saturday , september 18 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne will hope to see this mueller - not the celebratory one bayern munich-cologne no secret about the billy goats ' strategy here – pack it in in their own half , frustrate franck ribery and hope for a draw .
with bayern perhaps having tired legs from the champions league , cologne 's plan has a chance of working .
but something tells me thomas mueller has found his rhythm again , and as he showed on wedsnesday , he can manufacture goals from nothing .
prediction : bayern 2-0 werder bremen-mainz this is just the sort of match profligate bremen often lose , and what 's not to like about this year 's plucky , well-organized mainz squad ?
unfortunately for the latter , though , i think the now-confirmed news that wunderkind andre schuerrle is headed to leverkusen next season will prove to be a distraction .
prediction : bremen 3-1 stuttgart-moenchengladbach this is a case of the underachieving taking on the unpredictable .
stuttgart have been a mess this season , especially on defense , and are coming off only two days rest .
gladbach have been up and down but have already tripped up one big club at home .
methinks they split the points .
prediction : 1-1 draw wolfsburg-hanover there 's one team here still looking for its first points , and it 's not hanover .
the 96ers are undefeated , and their two wins , while close , have been deserved .
for the wolves , who are miles ahead talent-wise , this will be a test of whether they have faith in new coach steve mcclaren .
i think the result will be indecisive .
prediction : 2-2 draw .
kaiserslautern-hoffenheim as bayern found out two weeks ago , never underestimate lautern 's home field advantage .
but i like what i 've seen from hoffenheim this season .
they 're more disciplined than in the past and look like they 're on a mission to prove the doubters wrong .
and they simply have too much attacking firepower for the red devils .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 sunday , september 19 st. pauli-hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. pauli fans will hope their outlaw act intimidates their city rivals of the true city derbies in german football , this one is the best .
on paper , pauli are completely overmatched against hamburg .
but that 's on paper .
taking to the field in millerntor stadium with ac / dc 's hell 's bells ringing in your ears is something that can impress even the likes of ruud van nistelrooy .
and somewhere within all that ringing i hear the sound of an upset .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 dortmund-schalke could things get any worse for schalke ?
they 're on a bad losing streak , and now they get a visit their bitterest rivals , who are off to a good start .
but i 'm not writing off schalke just yet , and i think two extra days rest will help them sneak a point .

cheers !
with oktoberfest about to kick off in munich , we asked our facebook users about their oktoberfest experiences , the good and the bad .
here 's a selection of their comments . have you ever been to oktoberfest ?
ha , i never went to oktoberfest while i was living in germany .
i am a born and bred berliner .
that explains it i guess .
however , i 've been to numerous oktoberfests in new zealand .
they are put on each year by the new zealand german business association in auckland and they rock , i mean ooompah !
so much fun - this year 's is on this friday . - anja yes !
and it was very memorable .
i went in munich for the 2000 oktoberfest !
we arrived very early and picked a tent and it was packed !
we squeezed in with a table and started drinking , and soon everyone was talking , dancing and singing and they locked the doors .
later , some star guests arrived ; some soccer players and a man with a dog , and the crowd went wild .
i still have the little woven heart trinket i bought . - laura yes .
when i was a student of goethe institut hong kong , i attended the oktoberfest party at the open car park of the marco polo hotel .
the marco polo oktoberfest is now very famous in hong kong .
it 's all about german food , beer , dancing and a swiss band .
but after all the years , it is still unchanged .
i 'll attend too this year , and see if the swiss band will still sing the same songs and play the same games .
but no change could be nice , because it 's a good atmosphere and memories every time . - paskol yeah , i went with my colleagues when i lived in germany last year .
we spent a long time walking around as there were no places to sit but it was a great atmosphere .
in the end we learned that it 's better to book in advance so we sat at odeonsplatz instead and had some beers . - hannah when i was stationed as a soldier in offenbach / main in 1958 , i made friends with a young german and we decided at the last minute to go to the oktoberfest on his motorcycle .
once there we hunted and hunted for a place to spend the night but everything was booked .
we ended up sleeping on big oil cans at a gas station .
had a great time though . - bill yes .
i was there last year with five friends in the second weekend .
it was wonderful and the weather was very good .
we do n't remember the number of beer mugs we drank , but we had a good time .
i suppose we will remember that weekend until our last minute in this world . - francisco horrible experience .
everybody was drunk and the whole thing was pretty boring ...
i prefer cologne 's carnival .
everyone 's drunk there as well , but at least it 's fun : they sing and dress up . - maria-lujan last year i was at the oktoberfest together with other students studying german at the goethe institut in schwaebisch hall .
a camera crew from the deutsche welle team filmed us while we experienced the oktoberfest for the first time .
it was such a fun and amazing experience !
i ended up going back to the wiesn four more times that year and each time i met interesting and fun people .
one of the things i liked best about the oktoberfest is how easy it is to meet people sitting near you and to strike up a conversation with them .
i also especially enjoyed standing on the benches , drinking lots of beer , and singing crazy german songs ! - benjamin compiled by stuart tiffen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with oktoberfest about to kick off in munich , we asked our facebook users about their oktoberfest experiences , the good and the bad .
here 's a selection of their comments . have you ever been to oktoberfest ?
ha , i never went to oktoberfest while i was living in germany .
i am a born and bred berliner .
that explains it i guess .
however , i 've been to numerous oktoberfests in new zealand .
they are put on each year by the new zealand german business association in auckland and they rock , i mean ooompah !
so much fun - this year 's is on this friday . - anja yes !
and it was very memorable .
i went in munich for the 2000 oktoberfest !
we arrived very early and picked a tent and it was packed !
we squeezed in with a table and started drinking , and soon everyone was talking , dancing and singing and they locked the doors .
later , some star guests arrived ; some soccer players and a man with a dog , and the crowd went wild .
i still have the little woven heart trinket i bought . - laura yes .
when i was a student of goethe institut hong kong , i attended the oktoberfest party at the open car park of the marco polo hotel .
the marco polo oktoberfest is now very famous in hong kong .
it 's all about german food , beer , dancing and a swiss band .
but after all the years , it is still unchanged .
i 'll attend too this year , and see if the swiss band will still sing the same songs and play the same games .
but no change could be nice , because it 's a good atmosphere and memories every time . - paskol yeah , i went with my colleagues when i lived in germany last year .
we spent a long time walking around as there were no places to sit but it was a great atmosphere .
in the end we learned that it 's better to book in advance so we sat at odeonsplatz instead and had some beers . - hannah when i was stationed as a soldier in offenbach / main in 1958 , i made friends with a young german and we decided at the last minute to go to the oktoberfest on his motorcycle .
once there we hunted and hunted for a place to spend the night but everything was booked .
we ended up sleeping on big oil cans at a gas station .
had a great time though . - bill yes .
i was there last year with five friends in the second weekend .
it was wonderful and the weather was very good .
we do n't remember the number of beer mugs we drank , but we had a good time .
i suppose we will remember that weekend until our last minute in this world . - francisco horrible experience .
everybody was drunk and the whole thing was pretty boring ...
i prefer cologne 's carnival .
everyone 's drunk there as well , but at least it 's fun : they sing and dress up . - maria-lujan last year i was at the oktoberfest together with other students studying german at the goethe institut in schwaebisch hall .
a camera crew from the deutsche welle team filmed us while we experienced the oktoberfest for the first time .
it was such a fun and amazing experience !
i ended up going back to the wiesn four more times that year and each time i met interesting and fun people .
one of the things i liked best about the oktoberfest is how easy it is to meet people sitting near you and to strike up a conversation with them .
i also especially enjoyed standing on the benches , drinking lots of beer , and singing crazy german songs ! - benjamin compiled by stuart tiffen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , roma leaders in germany say camps are n't an issue here . it was n't really french president nicolas sarkozy 's dismantling of roma camps and large-scale deportations that caused controversy in germany , nor was it his " lively " confrontation with european commission president jose manuel barroso on the issue , it was his assertion that german chancellor angela merkel was planning to introduce a similar policy .
" mrs. merkel told me that germany also intends to start clearing out camps in the coming weeks , " sarkozy told reporters in brussels on thursday evening .
the chancellor 's office in berlin and foreign minister guido westerwelle both swiftly refuted sarkozy 's claims , with westerwelle saying that such a policy " would run contrary to the german constitution . "
however , german leaders are also playing down the significance of this " misunderstanding , " saying the confusion will not hurt germany and france 's cooperation bilaterally , or within the eu .
" you should not over-interpret this as a strain on franco-german relations , " government spokesman steffen seibert said in berlin on friday .
" no camps " in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose says germany and france both discriminate , but to different extents roma leaders in germany said they were confused by sarkozy 's statement , given that most german-based roma are more integrated into society and are less likely to live in makeshift camps .
" for me , it 's very clear that -lrb- german chancellor angela merkel -rrb- said nothing of this nature , primarily because there are n't any camps here in germany - or , at least , none of which i am aware , " the head of the central council for german sinti and roma , romani rose , told the mdr german public broadcaster on friday .
" so , to me , the chancellor 's denial seems entirely credible . "
" sinti and roma live normally like the rest of the population ; they are workers , employees , academics and artists , they 're members of sporting clubs , and , very often , people do n't even know they 're part of an ethnic minority . "
rose said that discrimination remained a major issue in germany , but usually on an individual level .
he referred to a recent survey carried out by the council in which over 80 percent of respondents said they had encountered some form of discrimination in their day-to-day lives .
sinti and roma can encounter discrimination when looking for a job or a flat , in individual legal disputes , and even in their local pub , he explained .
" but none of this is comparable with this sweeping , criminalizing campaign being carried out by the upper echelons of the french government , including the president , " rose said .
" these policies have caused great concern amongst our people here in germany , and all over europe . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose says germany has no camps like this one in a paris suburb if germany has a policy comparable to the french mass deportations , it would be the contentious decision to gradually send some 12,000 former refugees , many of whom are roma , back to their home country of kosovo now that germany deems the situation there stable .
unlike romania and bulgaria , where most french-based roma are being sent , kosovo is not a member of the european union , meaning the issue does not fall within the jurisdiction of the eu commission , france 's most high-profile critic on this issue to date .
rose said he strongly opposed the german policy to repatriate sinti and roma , among others , to kosovo , arguing that april 's decision to begin this process was premature and that the government in pristina was not yet ready to uphold the rights of formerly displaced people .
" it 's still irresponsible to send these people back to kosovo now , " he said .
" the un 's refugee representative in berlin has said that the security situation for roma in kosovo is not yet satisfactory , international human rights groups like amnesty international have said the same thing , as has the central council for german sinti and roma . "
but rose also said that the german government was handling the roughly 12,000 cases differently to france , describing each decision as an " individual example " , whereas france was carrying out a deportation policy " en masse . "

he referred to a recent survey carried out by the council in which over 80 percent of respondents said they had encountered some form of discrimination in their day-to-day lives .
sinti and roma can encounter discrimination when looking for a job or a flat , in individual legal disputes , and even in their local pub , he explained .
" but none of this is comparable with this sweeping , criminalizing campaign being carried out by the upper echelons of the french government , including the president , " rose said .
" these policies have caused great concern amongst our people here in germany , and all over europe . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose says germany has no camps like this one in a paris suburb if germany has a policy comparable to the french mass deportations , it would be the contentious decision to gradually send some 12,000 former refugees , many of whom are roma , back to their home country of kosovo now that germany deems the situation there stable .
unlike romania and bulgaria , where most french-based roma are being sent , kosovo is not a member of the european union , meaning the issue does not fall within the jurisdiction of the eu commission , france 's most high-profile critic on this issue to date .
rose said he strongly opposed the german policy to repatriate sinti and roma , among others , to kosovo , arguing that april 's decision to begin this process was premature and that the government in pristina was not yet ready to uphold the rights of formerly displaced people .
" it 's still irresponsible to send these people back to kosovo now , " he said .
" the un 's refugee representative in berlin has said that the security situation for roma in kosovo is not yet satisfactory , international human rights groups like amnesty international have said the same thing , as has the central council for german sinti and roma . "
but rose also said that the german government was handling the roughly 12,000 cases differently to france , describing each decision as an " individual example " , whereas france was carrying out a deportation policy " en masse . "

cheers !
with oktoberfest about to kick off in munich , we asked our facebook users about their oktoberfest experiences , the good and the bad .
here 's a selection of their comments . have you ever been to oktoberfest ?
ha , i never went to oktoberfest while i was living in germany .
i am a born and bred berliner .
that explains it i guess .
however , i 've been to numerous oktoberfests in new zealand .
they are put on each year by the new zealand german business association in auckland and they rock , i mean ooompah !
so much fun - this year 's is on this friday . - anja yes !
and it was very memorable .
i went in munich for the 2000 oktoberfest !
we arrived very early and picked a tent and it was packed !
we squeezed in with a table and started drinking , and soon everyone was talking , dancing and singing and they locked the doors .
later , some star guests arrived ; some soccer players and a man with a dog , and the crowd went wild .
i still have the little woven heart trinket i bought . - laura yes .
when i was a student of goethe institut hong kong , i attended the oktoberfest party at the open car park of the marco polo hotel .
the marco polo oktoberfest is now very famous in hong kong .
it 's all about german food , beer , dancing and a swiss band .
but after all the years , it is still unchanged .
i 'll attend too this year , and see if the swiss band will still sing the same songs and play the same games .
but no change could be nice , because it 's a good atmosphere and memories every time . - paskol yeah , i went with my colleagues when i lived in germany last year .
we spent a long time walking around as there were no places to sit but it was a great atmosphere .
in the end we learned that it 's better to book in advance so we sat at odeonsplatz instead and had some beers . - hannah when i was stationed as a soldier in offenbach / main in 1958 , i made friends with a young german and we decided at the last minute to go to the oktoberfest on his motorcycle .
once there we hunted and hunted for a place to spend the night but everything was booked .
we ended up sleeping on big oil cans at a gas station .
had a great time though . - bill yes .
i was there last year with five friends in the second weekend .
it was wonderful and the weather was very good .
we do n't remember the number of beer mugs we drank , but we had a good time .
i suppose we will remember that weekend until our last minute in this world . - francisco horrible experience .
everybody was drunk and the whole thing was pretty boring ...
i prefer cologne 's carnival .
everyone 's drunk there as well , but at least it 's fun : they sing and dress up . - maria-lujan last year i was at the oktoberfest together with other students studying german at the goethe institut in schwaebisch hall .
a camera crew from the deutsche welle team filmed us while we experienced the oktoberfest for the first time .
it was such a fun and amazing experience !
i ended up going back to the wiesn four more times that year and each time i met interesting and fun people .
one of the things i liked best about the oktoberfest is how easy it is to meet people sitting near you and to strike up a conversation with them .
i also especially enjoyed standing on the benches , drinking lots of beer , and singing crazy german songs ! - benjamin compiled by stuart tiffen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

once there we hunted and hunted for a place to spend the night but everything was booked .
we ended up sleeping on big oil cans at a gas station .
had a great time though . - bill yes .
i was there last year with five friends in the second weekend .
it was wonderful and the weather was very good .
we do n't remember the number of beer mugs we drank , but we had a good time .
i suppose we will remember that weekend until our last minute in this world . - francisco horrible experience .
everybody was drunk and the whole thing was pretty boring ...
i prefer cologne 's carnival .
everyone 's drunk there as well , but at least it 's fun : they sing and dress up . - maria-lujan last year i was at the oktoberfest together with other students studying german at the goethe institut in schwaebisch hall .
a camera crew from the deutsche welle team filmed us while we experienced the oktoberfest for the first time .
it was such a fun and amazing experience !
i ended up going back to the wiesn four more times that year and each time i met interesting and fun people .
one of the things i liked best about the oktoberfest is how easy it is to meet people sitting near you and to strike up a conversation with them .
i also especially enjoyed standing on the benches , drinking lots of beer , and singing crazy german songs ! - benjamin compiled by stuart tiffen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the center will be a new way to help computer users escape botnets - groups of malware-infected computers that can be controlled and exploited by a remote third party .
" the main goal is to remove germany from the top 10 ranking of countries from which botnet activities originate , " according to a document about the project published late last year on the organization for economic cooperation and development 's website .
when expanded successfully , botnets can comprise thousands or millions of so-called zombie computers that are under the control of an attacker .
they can be used for infecting further computers , sending spam , conducting criminal activity and launching cyber-attacks .
generally speaking , botnets only affect computers with the microsoft windows operating system .
linux and mac os computers are rarely infected .
according to industry statistics , every seventh german computer connected to the internet is currently part of a botnet , with its user often unaware of the situation .
thomas de maiziere , germany 's interior minister , in a statement , described the problem as " the greatest current danger for the internet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center will have a budget of two million euros annually various types of assistance the anti-botnet beratungszentrum offers help via email or by phone .
the center 's website , www.botfrei.de , contains instructions on how to free an affected computer from a botnet , as well as useful software .
the 2 million euro project is financially supported by the federal ministry of the interior and technically by the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- .
several internet providers , such as deutsche telekom , are also involved .
in the future , the participating internet providers will automatically notify their clients by email or post if their computers are infected with malware .
de maziere is encouraging non-participating providers to join the project , but he also emphasizes that affected internet users need to “ take their share of responsibility ” and take advantage of the assistance offered by the help center .

the move could pressure german carmakers to ramp up mass production of their own electric vehicles . rwe and china 's byd have teamed to bring electrical cars to germany , beginning with a trial fleet in 2011 .
a mass rollout in germany and several other european markets is planned the following year .
the deal with the chinese company , a battery specialist that has since expanded into car manufacturing , follows a string of agreements with other manufacturers , including france 's renault , japan 's nissan and daimler .
the centrepiece of the agreement is a package deal for electric car enthusiasts , consisting of byd 's electric vehicles and rwe 's fast-charging posts and electricity supplied exclusively from renewable sources .
two models will be initially available and targeted primarily at consumers in cities driving shorter distances .
already on the market the one model is a plug-in hybrid car that combines new electric and conventional internal combustion systems .
on the market in china since early this year , it has a range of between 60 and 100 kilometers when running only on electricity .
the other newer model will be a purely electric vehicle with a battery range of about 300 kilometers and an acceleration of 0 to 100 kilometers per hour within 10 seconds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe plans to charge electric cars with electricity from rewewable energy sources the package will include a fast-charging device from rwe , access to the company 's expanding network of public charging points – now at around 450 – and electricity generated by wind and solar systems .
rwe spokesman peter hoscheidt told deutsche welle that no decision has yet been reached on whether the cars and charging unit can be leased in addition to being purchased or both and what the prices will be .
but he said both options will be likely and prices will be attractive to garner attention .
in berlin , the german energy company is already collaborating with daimler in a field trial .
they 're testing smart cars powered by lithium-ion batteries , which can be charged at home and public supply points .
the collaboration is one of several electric car initiatives running under the german government 's e-mobility program .
seeking standardization through their collaboration , rwe and byd also hope to contribute to standardization efforts in the nascent electric car industry .
standardized components are crucial to kick start mass production .
but the standardization process of a new technology , like electrically powered cars , is often accompanied by power struggles between groups seeking recognition of their own systems as standards in order to collect royalty fees down the road .
bildunterschrift : rwe sees the day coming when " fill it up " is replaced by " charge it up " why the cooperation with a chinese manufacturer now ?
because the chinese , hoscheidt said , promise mass production by 2012 , thus ensuring a sufficient supply of competitively priced vehicles .
" this is by no means an exclusive agreement , " he said .
" we 're seeking partners to push electric cars .
the sooner they can deliver , the better . "
coveted battery technolgy earlier this year , byd and daimler signed an agreement to develop and build electric cars for the chinese market .
the cars will be sold under a jointly owned brand .
daimler plans to take advantage of byd 's battery technology to help boost chinese sales .
byd is china 's sixth-biggest car manufacturer by sales last year .
american billionaire warren buffet owns 10 percent of the company .
but ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a professor at the university of duisburg-essen and an expert on the german auto industry warns about expecting too much too soon from chinese car makers .
" let 's see what comes , " he told deutsche welle .
" we 've seen a few chinese manufacturers come to europe , and they 've failed . "
byd 's car sales have been dropping noticeably in its home market , according to dudenhoeffer .
" there 's plenty of demand in china but other cars are apparently in greater demand , " he said .
nevertheless , dudenhoeffer welcomes the latest attempt to push electric cars in germany .
" there 's a lot more happening in a number of countries like france , " he said , pointing to financial incentives .
" in germany , there 's still just a lot of hot air . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 17.09.2010 eu threat to impose female quotas gets mixed response in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuck in lower management ?
the eu ’ s commissioner for equal opportunities viviane reding has warned firms in europe to rapidly promote women into top jobs or face a 30 percent quota from next year . a european commission threat to elevate women by fixed quotas into top company jobs coincides with growing admissions in germany that this could be the only remaining option to redress the balance .
despite a pledge made nine years ago by german industry to voluntarily remove the “ glass ceiling ” blocking women , only 2.5 percent of board members of germany 's 200 largest companies are female .
and at the 100 firms with the highest turnover , only four board executives are women .
eu-wide the trend is much the same : the commission says 89 percent of board members of europe 's stock market-listed companies are males .
growing support for quotas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henkel now favors quotas for women hans-olaf henkel , ex-president of the german bdi industry federation , conceded recently that he no longer opposes a quota .
“ the fact that over the years hardly anything has happened shows that we 're not making headway . ”
personnel consultant heiner thorborg , the author of a book on why women do not make it into top jobs , said he too had once been an opponent of quotas .
“ but when i consider that my 12-year-old daughter will have to wait 200 years until something significant happens , then i say : the last modus is the quota , and it has to come ! ”
pressure mounts within bavarian csu even within bavaria 's tradionally conservative party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , women members want change .
bavarian justice minister beate merk told german public radio on thursday that she wants a 40 percent women 's quota on party committees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goodwill is not enough , says bavaria 's justice minister beate merk .
“ we 've seen that all the goodwill and effort has n't helped . ”
female participation in party membership , currently at 18 percent , was dwindling , she added . “ we want a quota .
women voters can only be won over when women can participate in politics and when women have the chance to move into positions of leadership . ”
family minister seeks concensus federal family minister kristina schroeder favors industry 's goodwill as before .
“ what we need are political changes that we 'll best achieve with the support of commerce , not in battle against industry . ”
schroeder 's ministry has initiated the drafting of a voluntary “ code for good management . ”
apart from one woman , its code commission is made up of male executives .
like commissioner reding , business studies professor ulrike detmers points to research findings showing that firms with a balanced male-female mix benefit all round , including gains in profitability : “ goals are reached much more quickly .
meetings run more efficiently .
when the women present are also mothers then one comes straight to the point . ” what 's needed , she says , is “ better childcare , more flexible hours ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's high time to redress the balance , if necessary by force , says viviane reding but some in germany maintain that such progress can not be legislated .
the president of the german chambers of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , hans heinrich driftmann , says that the lack of women in senior positions can be attributed to a number of reasons , including the difficulty of balancing family and work , and women 's tendency to avoid technical and scientific career paths .
" a legal quota ca n't really influence such wide-ranging underlying causes , and for that reason , i would argue against imposing one , " driftmann told the german daily paper die welt .
" i was recruited to my career on the basis of my qualifications , not because of my sex , " said marie-christine ostermann , a 32-year-old executive who also chairs germany 's association of young business leaders .
" had a quota been in place , i would have felt as if i had been reduced to a gender . "
germany falling back in international rankings in overall gender inequality terms , germany has fallen back in recent years , according to the world economic forum 's latest survey .
from being ranked fifth among 128 nations in 2006 , germany has slipped to 12th place .
topping the list are scandinavian nations .
the forum 's scoring is based on 30 indicators , including women 's access to education and chances for economic participation .
in one of several nationwide studies , the german institute for economic research , the diw , found that most women in employment remain confined to lower-paid jobs , and if they do enter senior management , then this tends to happen in service sectors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sattelberg says ' old boys networks ' persist everywhere the luebeck-based survey institute databyte says the presence of women in middle to upper management nationwide is 17 percent , but its survey of 940,000 firms shows marked regional variety . berlin tops with a women 's quota of 19 percent , closely followed by germany 's post-unification eastern states .
the tail-ender is baden-wurttemberg in southwestern germany with below 15 percent .
firm size also plays a role – women play bigger roles in smaller firms , including the retailing and the health sector in eastern germany .
one of the few german companies to self-impose its own women 's quota is deutsche telekom .
its goal is 30 percent by 2015 , but senior telekom employees fear that a decade of appeals and promises has not worked .
" old boys network " still prevails “ i think we have underestimated one thing – the ever-present dna , the ' old boys networks ' that shape company cultures , also in the sense of propagating traditional role models , " telekom 's head of personnel , thomas sattelberg said . professor detmer doubts that germany 's current government will move beyond soliciting goodwill .
“ out of consideration for industry 's interests , i do n't think the federal government will make the hard choices . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 17.09.2010 german machine builders are leery of outsourcing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's buemi views quality as competitive edge mechanical engineering is a pillar of the german economy .
while machine builders can save costs in the short term by outsourcing production , in the long term , they can hurt themselves and the national economy . for years , german industry has faced growing international competition .
emerging markets such as china , india and brazil have already become big competitors , and a number of african countries could join the fray someday .
the prospect of lower labor costs has led many german machine builders to move parts or even all of their production abroad to stay competitive .
but some companies , like buemi in gevelsberg near wuppertal , view the outsourcing trend with skepticism .
buemi manufactures precision parts , such as axels , shafts , sockets and studs , for machine tools and trains .
the company is viewed as one of the " hidden champions " of german industry .
its customers include thyssen-krupp , siemens , komatsu and bombardier transportation .
maintaining a standard of living buemi managing director frank mittag has been at the helm of the company for 15 years .
he views germany as a manufacturing nation that relies on a powerful mechanical engineering sector .
and it 's thanks to the country 's competitive manufacturing base that services such as information technology can be easily outsourced .
" but if we rely solely on services , we will not be able to maintain our standard of living , " mittag says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : managing director frank mittag warns about being blinded by short-term cost benefits in a high-wage country like germany , the managing director asserts , there is only one alternative : quality .
that means precision , innovation , reliability and longevity .
competing on price is n't an option for germany .
so while german machine builders can lower operating costs by outsourcing some production , it 's important they retain their core competencies at home , according to mittag .
" if we transfer abroad our innovative production processes and the constructions we need to achieve superior quality and reliability , then we destroy the very competitive edge we need to compete with low-wage countries , " he says , adding that it ’ s also important to have a high-quality supplier network in germany .
long-term costs mittag sees little sense in establishing a supplier network abroad and investing heavily to trim it for quality .
there 's a risk of important know-how seeping out .
moreover , the short-term cost advantage of this strategy would only be achieved with long-term disadvantages .
" the first costs people notice are from purchasing , " mittag says .
" other costs like those for quality assurance or production downtimes , processing and marketing are often overlooked in outsourcing projects . "
once these factors are considered in the equation , unit production costs rise , he adds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other machine builders have become cautious about outsourcing buemi has polled other machine builders that have become more cautious with their international expansion .
many medium-sized companies have established subsidiaries in china , whose operations were quickly replicated by competitors next door .
the damage can be huge .
many attribute the rise of china 's auto industry to german mechanical engineering firms that have established production facilities in the country .
know-how transfer is inevitable in such a global economy , but mittag warns nonetheless that companies outsourcing production in china should need to move cautiously and not be blinded by the short-term cost benefits .
today , germany 's mechanical engineering sector has a 10 to 20 year lead on its competitors in asia , according to mittag .
but to maintain that lead , he says , the sector must continue to strive for top quality , which can only be achieved with skilled employees .
" honesty , decency and conscientiousness , " mittag says , are indispensable because if business is driven only by a near insatiable hunger for higher profits , the quality of work and the products will suffer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 17.09.2010 in further proof that pigs can fly , berlin 's neukoelln is the place to be großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unloved , underprivileged district south of the river spree has become a magnet for berlin scenesters .
dw 's reporter offers a homeboy view of an area usually dismissed as a ghetto . recently , while eating a taco at a joint near where i live in berlin 's neukoelln neighborhood , i overheard a telling conversation .
two young english-speaking women , probably around 20 and obviously recent arrivals to our fair city , were talking about the difficulty of finding a suitably located apartment .
" it sucks being in prenzlauer berg , " sighed one .
" i have to travel 30 minutes to get to a decent bar . "
i nearly blew mole sauce through my nostrils laughing .
eleven years ago , when i permanently moved to berlin , my entire circle of friends lived in the prenzlauer berg and mitte districts in the former east and would draw air circles beside their temples upon learning i 'd chosen to invest in property south of the river spree .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neukoelln is still very international back then , neukoelln existed in the popular imagination only as a kind of forbidden zone for lower-class alcoholics , people who chronically forgot to take their lithium and double-digit turkish families roasting whole lambs in three-room tenement flats .
but times change , and cities with them .
these days , most parts of prenzlauer berg offer all the charm and excitement of a pta meeting , whereas it 's virtually impossible to spit across the street in the northern section neukoelln without hitting an independent fashion designer 's studio or a bar staffed by people who look like occasional members of the arcade fire .
as recently as 2006 , neukoelln attracted the opprobrium of the nation , after teachers at a neighborhood high school wrote to the mayor complaining that it was too dangerous to hold any kind of instruction in .
fast forward to now and hipsters sport t-shirts reading " i 'm a ruetli student . "
gentrification happens elsewhere the first step toward gentrification ?
i 'll never know exactly what the term means , other than a place someone liked being taken over by people whom that person does n't like .
what i do know is that in the past 10 years the value of my apartment has roughly doubled , and i can get reasonably authentic mexican food without having to inflict undue wear and tear on the soles of my adidas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this 1920 's housing estate in neukoelln is a unesco world heritage site walk down weserstrasse , which has become the street of choice for many 20-somethings to get hammered , and most of the bars still feel like they 're being run by students on the very edge of legality .
moreover , i doubt neukoelln could go the prenzlauer berg-mitte route , even if it wanted to .
first of all , it 's much bigger , and over 20 percent of its 300,000-plus inhabitants are foreigners - the vast majority working-class turkish people , and not ex-pat computer programmers from new york or london .
ironically , one reason student-types first begin moving in was because the u8 subway line was an easy connection up to the then-trendy districts in the east .
they 've since discovered that it 's more fun to stay in their own neighborhood to party .
and for the time being , at least , i 'm having fun watching them do it .

another man was arrested about eight hours later .
the police said officers had been searching two businesses and eight homes in the capital since the arrests , but had found no weapons or dangerous materials .
media reports suggested the arrests were likely linked to the papal visit , an issue on which the police would not comment .
the presence of pope benedict xvi in london meant that the british capital was already on high alert before friday 's raids .
" we 're totally calm , the pope is happy , " vatican spokesman federico lombardi said when reporters told him about the arrests .
" we can say that we 're totally confident in the work of the police . "
papal schedule unchanged the pope attended a service at london 's westminster abbey on friday led by archbishop of canterbury rowan williams , the leader of the world 's anglican church .
the two church leaders then met at lambeth palace , the anglican archbishop 's london residence , for historic talks : no pontiff had visited lambeth palace or visited the historic abbey since the foundation of the church of england when king henry viii broke with rome in 1534 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some object to benedict 's handling of the sex scandal benedict also delivered a speech at westminster hall - the historic heart of the houses of parliament - and addressed some 3,000 young catholics at an event in southwest london .
anti-church protests continue the run-up to the visit was clouded by criticism of the catholic church 's handling of a child abuse scandal and a furore over the trip 's cost : 20 million gbp -lrb- 37 million euros -rrb- .
there were protests before benedict 's engagement with young people in twickenham on friday , in the southwest of the british capital , with around 20 demonstrators waving banners with slogans saying , " there is no god - get over it ! " or " the pope is wrong , put a condom on ! "
on his flight to britain , benedict made some of his strongest comments yet on the paedophilia controversy , saying revelations of child abuse by priests that have rocked the catholic church " were a shock to me . "
he added that " the authorities in the church have not been vigilant enough . "
the church " did not act quickly or firmly enough to take the necessary action " to stop the problem , which involved abuse by priests and catholic teachers in ireland , germany , and a number of other countries around europe .
while in london , benedict was expected to meet a group of 10 victims of abuse , either on friday or saturday .
first pope to make ' state visit ' to england on the first day of the pope 's visit , he warned of the risk of " aggressive secularism " in britain and greeted tens of thousands of people at a mass in glasgow and on the streets of edinburgh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen cordially invited the pope to britain herself " the united kingdom strives to be a modern and multicultural society , " benedict xvi said .
" in this challenging enterprise , may it always maintain its respect for those traditional values and cultural expressions that more aggressive forms of secularism no longer value or even tolerate . "
the pontiff also met queen elizabeth ii while in edinburgh : " i am delighted to welcome you to the uk and particularly to scotland on your first visit as pope , " the queen said .
this is the first papal visit to the uk to be classified as a state visit , because it was elizabeth ii who invited the pontiff , not the church .
benedict xvi and the queen focused on the positive aspects of relations between predominantly anglican britain and the roman catholic church , two bodies which the queen said shared " a common christian heritage . "
on sunday , benedict will travel to the central english city of birmingham for the final day of his visit , where he will preside over the beatification of a 19th century cardinal , john henry newman .

there were protests before benedict 's engagement with young people in twickenham on friday , in the southwest of the british capital , with around 20 demonstrators waving banners with slogans saying , " there is no god - get over it ! " or " the pope is wrong , put a condom on ! "
on his flight to britain , benedict made some of his strongest comments yet on the paedophilia controversy , saying revelations of child abuse by priests that have rocked the catholic church " were a shock to me . "
he added that " the authorities in the church have not been vigilant enough . "
the church " did not act quickly or firmly enough to take the necessary action " to stop the problem , which involved abuse by priests and catholic teachers in ireland , germany , and a number of other countries around europe .

the pontiff also met queen elizabeth ii while in edinburgh : " i am delighted to welcome you to the uk and particularly to scotland on your first visit as pope , " the queen said .
this is the first papal visit to the uk to be classified as a state visit , because it was elizabeth ii who invited the pontiff , not the church .

on sunday , benedict will travel to the central english city of birmingham for the final day of his visit , where he will preside over the beatification of a 19th century cardinal , john henry newman .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 17.09.2010 germany 's forgotten performer valeska gert helped inspire punks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always a non-conformist , gert broke new ground in music and performance more than 30 years after her death , admirers pay tribute to one of germany 's most enigmatic - and overlooked - artists , dancer and actress valeska gert .
she 's said to have laid the foundations for the punk movement . " i saw her on television in 1977 when she was 86 and i thought , she has short hair , a colorful dress , she 's tough and living in the present , she 's a real punk because she does n't care about her image , " said artist and musician wolfgang mueller at the opening night of a new exhibition dedicated to valeska gert . the show in berlin 's hamburger bahnhof coincides with the launch of a mueller 's new biography on the performer .
" when she died in 1978 people took care of her letters and found correspondence from punks who said , we would like to know you and to meet you , " he said . indeed , valeska gert 's appearance on a tv talk show in the late 1970 's re-ignited interest in one of germany 's most enigmatic artistic figures .
her acceptance , at the age of 86 , by the burgeoning punk movement is as much a testament to her brash , no-nonsense energy as it is to her artistic achievements .
since then she has remained a marginal curio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this self-designed costume , pictured in 1931 , foreshadows 60 's fashions gert was born gertrud valesca samosch to a jewish family in berlin in 1892 .
showing no interest in academia , gert began taking dance lessons at the age of nine , and by 1915 was studying acting with alexander moissi .
her leanings toward the performing arts , combined with the detrimental effects of world war i on her father 's finances , led her to seek employment and she soon made appearances at the munich kammerspiele , the deutsches theater and the berliner tribuene . radical experiments on stage as the 1920 's progressed , she also began appearing in silent cinema , performing in " the threepenny opera , " " diary of a lost girl " with iconic flapper louise brooks , and g. w. pabst 's " joyless street . " it was around this time that gert unveiled one of her most enduring performance works .
entitled " pause , " it was an interpretative anti-dance performed between reels in cinemas , designed to draw attention to stillness and serenity . " it was so radical just to go on stage in the cinema stand there and do nothing , " said wolfgang mueller , " she did this in the 20 's where the convention was speed , business , activity and you see this in the films of the 20 's : big cities , traffic , nervosity .
to go out there and do the complete opposite was very , very modern . " by 1933 , with the nazis in power , gert suffered a ban from the german stage due to her jewish heritage .
she moved to london where she continued to perform on stage and appeared in the experimental short film " pett and pot " directed by alberto cavalcanti .
it would be her last film work until her triumphant return to the cinema in the mid-1960 's . trend setting with ' freedom from taste ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare 1969 recording of baby is screened at the pause exhibition by 1938 , in her late 40 's and living in new york but , gert found it virtually impossible to revive her previous career .
she lived on the welfare of a jewish refugee community , washed dishes and posed as a nude model .
in 1941 , she opened the bettlerbar -lrb- beggar 's bar -rrb- , a ramshackle cabaret / restaurant filled with mismatched furniture and staffed by the likes of jackson pollock and tennessee williams , the latter being fired by gert for being " too sloppy . " although licensing requirements forced the new york bar to close , gert introduced the concept to germany upon her return in 1950 .
it has proved perhaps her most enduring legacy ; tumbledown bars furnished with random pieces of flea-market chic and junk store accessories have since become legion in berlin , a fad started by gert which wolfgang mueller terms " freedom from taste . " back in post-war berlin , she once again had to start from scratch .
in the same 1977 television show , the interviewer tactfully suggested that by the dawn of the 1950 's gert was perhaps not so well remembered as before .
with typical self-depricating humor and bluntness typical for berliners , she exclaimed , " not so well remembered ?
i was totally forgotten ! " she opened the hexenkueche -lrb- witch 's kitchen -rrb- cabaret and made a triumphant return to the silver screen with an appearance in the 1965 surrealist drama " juliet of the spirits , " directed by frederico fellini .
she was soon cast in other high profile projects by rainer werner fassbinder 's and volker schloendorff . well outside the box bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the valeska gert exhibition is on display at the hamburger bahnhof until february 2011 while valeska gert has had a small but solid fan base , widespread fame always eluded her and , especially in the intervening years , she has become very much a marginalized character .
" i think she is a bit invisible , " said wolfgang mueller , " she is not known because she always ignored borders .
she was always far away from these boxes that the art scene puts people in . " however , 2010 may well see an upswing in gert 's popularity ; the exhibition dedicated to her work has a generous five-month run , while the martin schmitz publishing house has not only released mueller 's definitive new biography but also a 7 " vinyl recording of her 1969 performance of " baby , " an impersonation of a gurgling child alternating between rage and happiness . historian an paenhuysen , the curator of the new exhibition in berlin , was new to gert 's world before taking on this project ; now she is a devoted fan .
" valeska gert made work that is still very contemporary .
it still works for today , " she said .
" it 's very familiar and at the same time very strange , frightening .
it touches you .
it 's really hard to sum her up .

when addressing issues of worldwide significance many nations need to be at the table , experts say . the united nations millennium development goals -lrb- mdg -rrb- include pledges to wipe out extreme poverty , achieve universal primary education , promote gender equality , reduce rates of child mortality , fight epidemic diseases , and develop a global partnership for development . the international nature of these global goals leaves individual nations struggling for effective solutions that transcend their borders .
that 's where " global governance " comes in .
it works to create international structures capable of dealing with issues of global significance , and the closer the mdgs come to their deadline of 2015 the clearer multinational cooperation becomes . states ' changing role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power structures are shifting from single states to larger organizations , like the g-20 " the old idea was that nation states need to be as independent as possible to be responsible to their own population , " said dirk messner , director of the german development institute .
" it 's now become clear that we are dealing with global interdependencies and that we have to politically organize them . " such organization is crucial for shared resources such as the climate , the food supply and energy , messner added .
while the united nations enjoys a high degree of respect when it comes to international debate , it suffers under its inability to take quick action in an emergency . " we 've just been through a small revolution that 's been overlooked by a lot of people : we 've seen the shift from a world economy organized by the g-8 to a g-20-organized global governance , which includes several emerging and developing nations that until now did not take part in the global development and political processes , " messner said . path to balanced agreements he added that having more countries at the table deciding on global issues would increase the likelihood that developing nations ' concerns are heard and that an agreement that balances the interests of the industrialized and developing world can be made . germany has shown itself to be interested in a finding a way to balance international interests , according to juergen zattler , the head of the german ministry for economic cooperation and development 's department for european and multinational development policy . " we hope that once the global governance structure is in place we can talk about a variety of topics , " he said .
" that members of the international community get closer together and more capable of taking action and that global deals can be made . " ngos out in the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un may represent a better place to make multilateral decisions while zattler said giving more influence to the g-20 would be a promising step toward successful multinational negotiation on the mdgs and climate change , a shift toward a g-20 dominated landscape still leaves civil non-national organizations in the cold , according to jens martens of the global policy forum europe . " civil groups and non-government organizations have a right to take part in discussions at the united nations , " he said .
" in other bodies , such as the g-20 , this is not the case .
it 's an exclusive club of governments that meets behind closed doors . " instead of creating new organizations designed to quicken decision making by circumventing the un , martens said the world body deserved strengthening - despite its cumbersome nature . " the more parties take part the harder it gets - that 's democracy , " he said .
" but it 's worth the effort to make truly representative decisions and to take into account the interests of the groups that otherwise do n't have a say .
in terms of the millennium goals it 's the interests of the world 's poorest people . " author : heiner kiesel -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

another man was arrested about eight hours later .
the police said officers had been searching two businesses and eight homes in the capital since the arrests , but had found no weapons or dangerous materials .
media reports suggested the arrests were likely linked to the papal visit , an issue on which the police would not comment .
the presence of pope benedict xvi in london meant that the british capital was already on high alert before friday 's raids .
" we 're totally calm , the pope is happy , " vatican spokesman federico lombardi said when reporters told him about the arrests .
" we can say that we 're totally confident in the work of the police . "
papal schedule unchanged the pope attended a service at london 's westminster abbey on friday led by archbishop of canterbury rowan williams , the leader of the world 's anglican church .
the two church leaders then met at lambeth palace , the anglican archbishop 's london residence , for historic talks : no pontiff had visited lambeth palace or visited the historic abbey since the foundation of the church of england when king henry viii broke with rome in 1534 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some object to benedict 's handling of the sex scandal benedict also delivered a speech at westminster hall - the historic heart of the houses of parliament - and addressed some 3,000 young catholics at an event in southwest london .
anti-church protests continue the run-up to the visit was clouded by criticism of the catholic church 's handling of a child abuse scandal and a furore over the trip 's cost : 20 million gbp -lrb- 37 million euros -rrb- .
there were protests before benedict 's engagement with young people in twickenham on friday , in the southwest of the british capital , with around 20 demonstrators waving banners with slogans saying , " there is no god - get over it ! " or " the pope is wrong , put a condom on ! "
on his flight to britain , benedict made some of his strongest comments yet on the paedophilia controversy , saying revelations of child abuse by priests that have rocked the catholic church " were a shock to me . "
he added that " the authorities in the church have not been vigilant enough . "
the church " did not act quickly or firmly enough to take the necessary action " to stop the problem , which involved abuse by priests and catholic teachers in ireland , germany , and a number of other countries around europe .
while in london , benedict was expected to meet a group of 10 victims of abuse , either on friday or saturday .
first pope to make ' state visit ' to england on the first day of the pope 's visit , he warned of the risk of " aggressive secularism " in britain and greeted tens of thousands of people at a mass in glasgow and on the streets of edinburgh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen cordially invited the pope to britain herself " the united kingdom strives to be a modern and multicultural society , " benedict xvi said .
" in this challenging enterprise , may it always maintain its respect for those traditional values and cultural expressions that more aggressive forms of secularism no longer value or even tolerate . "
the pontiff also met queen elizabeth ii while in edinburgh : " i am delighted to welcome you to the uk and particularly to scotland on your first visit as pope , " the queen said .
this is the first papal visit to the uk to be classified as a state visit , because it was elizabeth ii who invited the pontiff , not the church .
benedict xvi and the queen focused on the positive aspects of relations between predominantly anglican britain and the roman catholic church , two bodies which the queen said shared " a common christian heritage . "
on sunday , benedict will travel to the central english city of birmingham for the final day of his visit , where he will preside over the beatification of a 19th century cardinal , john henry newman .

the center will be a new way to help computer users escape botnets - groups of malware-infected computers that can be controlled and exploited by a remote third party .
" the main goal is to remove germany from the top 10 ranking of countries from which botnet activities originate , " according to a document about the project published late last year on the organization for economic cooperation and development 's website .
when expanded successfully , botnets can comprise thousands or millions of so-called zombie computers that are under the control of an attacker .
they can be used for infecting further computers , sending spam , conducting criminal activity and launching cyber-attacks .
generally speaking , botnets only affect computers with the microsoft windows operating system .
linux and mac os computers are rarely infected .
according to industry statistics , every seventh german computer connected to the internet is currently part of a botnet , with its user often unaware of the situation .
thomas de maiziere , germany 's interior minister , in a statement , described the problem as " the greatest current danger for the internet . "

the center 's website , www.botfrei.de , contains instructions on how to free an affected computer from a botnet , as well as useful software .

cheers !
with oktoberfest about to kick off in munich , we asked our facebook users about their oktoberfest experiences , the good and the bad .
here 's a selection of their comments . have you ever been to oktoberfest ?
ha , i never went to oktoberfest while i was living in germany .
i am a born and bred berliner .
that explains it i guess .
however , i 've been to numerous oktoberfests in new zealand .
they are put on each year by the new zealand german business association in auckland and they rock , i mean ooompah !
so much fun - this year 's is on this friday . - anja yes !
and it was very memorable .
i went in munich for the 2000 oktoberfest !
we arrived very early and picked a tent and it was packed !
we squeezed in with a table and started drinking , and soon everyone was talking , dancing and singing and they locked the doors .
later , some star guests arrived ; some soccer players and a man with a dog , and the crowd went wild .
i still have the little woven heart trinket i bought . - laura yes .
when i was a student of goethe institut hong kong , i attended the oktoberfest party at the open car park of the marco polo hotel .
the marco polo oktoberfest is now very famous in hong kong .
it 's all about german food , beer , dancing and a swiss band .
but after all the years , it is still unchanged .
i 'll attend too this year , and see if the swiss band will still sing the same songs and play the same games .
but no change could be nice , because it 's a good atmosphere and memories every time . - paskol yeah , i went with my colleagues when i lived in germany last year .
we spent a long time walking around as there were no places to sit but it was a great atmosphere .
in the end we learned that it 's better to book in advance so we sat at odeonsplatz instead and had some beers . - hannah when i was stationed as a soldier in offenbach / main in 1958 , i made friends with a young german and we decided at the last minute to go to the oktoberfest on his motorcycle .
once there we hunted and hunted for a place to spend the night but everything was booked .
we ended up sleeping on big oil cans at a gas station .
had a great time though . - bill yes .
i was there last year with five friends in the second weekend .
it was wonderful and the weather was very good .
we do n't remember the number of beer mugs we drank , but we had a good time .
i suppose we will remember that weekend until our last minute in this world . - francisco horrible experience .
everybody was drunk and the whole thing was pretty boring ...
i prefer cologne 's carnival .
everyone 's drunk there as well , but at least it 's fun : they sing and dress up . - maria-lujan last year i was at the oktoberfest together with other students studying german at the goethe institut in schwaebisch hall .
a camera crew from the deutsche welle team filmed us while we experienced the oktoberfest for the first time .
it was such a fun and amazing experience !
i ended up going back to the wiesn four more times that year and each time i met interesting and fun people .
one of the things i liked best about the oktoberfest is how easy it is to meet people sitting near you and to strike up a conversation with them .
i also especially enjoyed standing on the benches , drinking lots of beer , and singing crazy german songs ! - benjamin compiled by stuart tiffen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

cheers !
with oktoberfest about to kick off in munich , we asked our facebook users about their oktoberfest experiences , the good and the bad .
here 's a selection of their comments . have you ever been to oktoberfest ?
ha , i never went to oktoberfest while i was living in germany .
i am a born and bred berliner .
that explains it i guess .
however , i 've been to numerous oktoberfests in new zealand .
they are put on each year by the new zealand german business association in auckland and they rock , i mean ooompah !
so much fun - this year 's is on this friday . - anja yes !
and it was very memorable .
i went in munich for the 2000 oktoberfest !
we arrived very early and picked a tent and it was packed !
we squeezed in with a table and started drinking , and soon everyone was talking , dancing and singing and they locked the doors .
later , some star guests arrived ; some soccer players and a man with a dog , and the crowd went wild .
i still have the little woven heart trinket i bought . - laura yes .
when i was a student of goethe institut hong kong , i attended the oktoberfest party at the open car park of the marco polo hotel .
the marco polo oktoberfest is now very famous in hong kong .
it 's all about german food , beer , dancing and a swiss band .
but after all the years , it is still unchanged .
i 'll attend too this year , and see if the swiss band will still sing the same songs and play the same games .
but no change could be nice , because it 's a good atmosphere and memories every time . - paskol yeah , i went with my colleagues when i lived in germany last year .
we spent a long time walking around as there were no places to sit but it was a great atmosphere .
in the end we learned that it 's better to book in advance so we sat at odeonsplatz instead and had some beers . - hannah when i was stationed as a soldier in offenbach / main in 1958 , i made friends with a young german and we decided at the last minute to go to the oktoberfest on his motorcycle .
once there we hunted and hunted for a place to spend the night but everything was booked .
we ended up sleeping on big oil cans at a gas station .
had a great time though . - bill yes .
i was there last year with five friends in the second weekend .
it was wonderful and the weather was very good .
we do n't remember the number of beer mugs we drank , but we had a good time .
i suppose we will remember that weekend until our last minute in this world . - francisco horrible experience .
everybody was drunk and the whole thing was pretty boring ...
i prefer cologne 's carnival .
everyone 's drunk there as well , but at least it 's fun : they sing and dress up . - maria-lujan last year i was at the oktoberfest together with other students studying german at the goethe institut in schwaebisch hall .
a camera crew from the deutsche welle team filmed us while we experienced the oktoberfest for the first time .
it was such a fun and amazing experience !
i ended up going back to the wiesn four more times that year and each time i met interesting and fun people .
one of the things i liked best about the oktoberfest is how easy it is to meet people sitting near you and to strike up a conversation with them .
i also especially enjoyed standing on the benches , drinking lots of beer , and singing crazy german songs ! - benjamin compiled by stuart tiffen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 17.09.2010 germany 's forgotten performer valeska gert helped inspire punks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always a non-conformist , gert broke new ground in music and performance more than 30 years after her death , admirers pay tribute to one of germany 's most enigmatic - and overlooked - artists , dancer and actress valeska gert .
she 's said to have laid the foundations for the punk movement . " i saw her on television in 1977 when she was 86 and i thought , she has short hair , a colorful dress , she 's tough and living in the present , she 's a real punk because she does n't care about her image , " said artist and musician wolfgang mueller at the opening night of a new exhibition dedicated to valeska gert . the show in berlin 's hamburger bahnhof coincides with the launch of a mueller 's new biography on the performer .
" when she died in 1978 people took care of her letters and found correspondence from punks who said , we would like to know you and to meet you , " he said . indeed , valeska gert 's appearance on a tv talk show in the late 1970 's re-ignited interest in one of germany 's most enigmatic artistic figures .
her acceptance , at the age of 86 , by the burgeoning punk movement is as much a testament to her brash , no-nonsense energy as it is to her artistic achievements .
since then she has remained a marginal curio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this self-designed costume , pictured in 1931 , foreshadows 60 's fashions gert was born gertrud valesca samosch to a jewish family in berlin in 1892 .
showing no interest in academia , gert began taking dance lessons at the age of nine , and by 1915 was studying acting with alexander moissi .
her leanings toward the performing arts , combined with the detrimental effects of world war i on her father 's finances , led her to seek employment and she soon made appearances at the munich kammerspiele , the deutsches theater and the berliner tribuene . radical experiments on stage as the 1920 's progressed , she also began appearing in silent cinema , performing in " the threepenny opera , " " diary of a lost girl " with iconic flapper louise brooks , and g. w. pabst 's " joyless street . " it was around this time that gert unveiled one of her most enduring performance works .
entitled " pause , " it was an interpretative anti-dance performed between reels in cinemas , designed to draw attention to stillness and serenity . " it was so radical just to go on stage in the cinema stand there and do nothing , " said wolfgang mueller , " she did this in the 20 's where the convention was speed , business , activity and you see this in the films of the 20 's : big cities , traffic , nervosity .
to go out there and do the complete opposite was very , very modern . " by 1933 , with the nazis in power , gert suffered a ban from the german stage due to her jewish heritage .
she moved to london where she continued to perform on stage and appeared in the experimental short film " pett and pot " directed by alberto cavalcanti .
it would be her last film work until her triumphant return to the cinema in the mid-1960 's . trend setting with ' freedom from taste ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare 1969 recording of baby is screened at the pause exhibition by 1938 , in her late 40 's and living in new york but , gert found it virtually impossible to revive her previous career .
she lived on the welfare of a jewish refugee community , washed dishes and posed as a nude model .
in 1941 , she opened the bettlerbar -lrb- beggar 's bar -rrb- , a ramshackle cabaret / restaurant filled with mismatched furniture and staffed by the likes of jackson pollock and tennessee williams , the latter being fired by gert for being " too sloppy . " although licensing requirements forced the new york bar to close , gert introduced the concept to germany upon her return in 1950 .
it has proved perhaps her most enduring legacy ; tumbledown bars furnished with random pieces of flea-market chic and junk store accessories have since become legion in berlin , a fad started by gert which wolfgang mueller terms " freedom from taste . " back in post-war berlin , she once again had to start from scratch .
in the same 1977 television show , the interviewer tactfully suggested that by the dawn of the 1950 's gert was perhaps not so well remembered as before .
with typical self-depricating humor and bluntness typical for berliners , she exclaimed , " not so well remembered ?
i was totally forgotten ! " she opened the hexenkueche -lrb- witch 's kitchen -rrb- cabaret and made a triumphant return to the silver screen with an appearance in the 1965 surrealist drama " juliet of the spirits , " directed by frederico fellini .
she was soon cast in other high profile projects by rainer werner fassbinder 's and volker schloendorff . well outside the box bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the valeska gert exhibition is on display at the hamburger bahnhof until february 2011 while valeska gert has had a small but solid fan base , widespread fame always eluded her and , especially in the intervening years , she has become very much a marginalized character .
" i think she is a bit invisible , " said wolfgang mueller , " she is not known because she always ignored borders .
she was always far away from these boxes that the art scene puts people in . " however , 2010 may well see an upswing in gert 's popularity ; the exhibition dedicated to her work has a generous five-month run , while the martin schmitz publishing house has not only released mueller 's definitive new biography but also a 7 " vinyl recording of her 1969 performance of " baby , " an impersonation of a gurgling child alternating between rage and happiness . historian an paenhuysen , the curator of the new exhibition in berlin , was new to gert 's world before taking on this project ; now she is a devoted fan .
" valeska gert made work that is still very contemporary .
it still works for today , " she said .

a mass rollout in germany and several other european markets is planned the following year .
the deal with the chinese company , a battery specialist that has since expanded into car manufacturing , follows a string of agreements with other manufacturers , including france 's renault , japan 's nissan and daimler .
the centrepiece of the agreement is a package deal for electric car enthusiasts , consisting of byd 's electric vehicles and rwe 's fast-charging posts and electricity supplied exclusively from renewable sources .
two models will be initially available and targeted primarily at consumers in cities driving shorter distances .
already on the market the one model is a plug-in hybrid car that combines new electric and conventional internal combustion systems .
on the market in china since early this year , it has a range of between 60 and 100 kilometers when running only on electricity .
the other newer model will be a purely electric vehicle with a battery range of about 300 kilometers and an acceleration of 0 to 100 kilometers per hour within 10 seconds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe plans to charge electric cars with electricity from rewewable energy sources the package will include a fast-charging device from rwe , access to the company 's expanding network of public charging points – now at around 450 – and electricity generated by wind and solar systems .
rwe spokesman peter hoscheidt told deutsche welle that no decision has yet been reached on whether the cars and charging unit can be leased in addition to being purchased or both and what the prices will be .
but he said both options will be likely and prices will be attractive to garner attention .
in berlin , the german energy company is already collaborating with daimler in a field trial .
they 're testing smart cars powered by lithium-ion batteries , which can be charged at home and public supply points .
the collaboration is one of several electric car initiatives running under the german government 's e-mobility program .
seeking standardization through their collaboration , rwe and byd also hope to contribute to standardization efforts in the nascent electric car industry .
standardized components are crucial to kick start mass production .
but the standardization process of a new technology , like electrically powered cars , is often accompanied by power struggles between groups seeking recognition of their own systems as standards in order to collect royalty fees down the road .
bildunterschrift : rwe sees the day coming when " fill it up " is replaced by " charge it up " why the cooperation with a chinese manufacturer now ?
because the chinese , hoscheidt said , promise mass production by 2012 , thus ensuring a sufficient supply of competitively priced vehicles .
" this is by no means an exclusive agreement , " he said .
" we 're seeking partners to push electric cars .
the sooner they can deliver , the better . "
coveted battery technolgy earlier this year , byd and daimler signed an agreement to develop and build electric cars for the chinese market .
the cars will be sold under a jointly owned brand .
daimler plans to take advantage of byd 's battery technology to help boost chinese sales .
byd is china 's sixth-biggest car manufacturer by sales last year .
american billionaire warren buffet owns 10 percent of the company .
but ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a professor at the university of duisburg-essen and an expert on the german auto industry warns about expecting too much too soon from chinese car makers .
" let 's see what comes , " he told deutsche welle .
" we 've seen a few chinese manufacturers come to europe , and they 've failed . "
byd 's car sales have been dropping noticeably in its home market , according to dudenhoeffer .
" there 's plenty of demand in china but other cars are apparently in greater demand , " he said .
nevertheless , dudenhoeffer welcomes the latest attempt to push electric cars in germany .
" there 's a lot more happening in a number of countries like france , " he said , pointing to financial incentives .
" in germany , there 's still just a lot of hot air . "

the eu ’ s commissioner for equal opportunities viviane reding has warned firms in europe to rapidly promote women into top jobs or face a 30 percent quota from next year . a european commission threat to elevate women by fixed quotas into top company jobs coincides with growing admissions in germany that this could be the only remaining option to redress the balance .
despite a pledge made nine years ago by german industry to voluntarily remove the “ glass ceiling ” blocking women , only 2.5 percent of board members of germany 's 200 largest companies are female .
and at the 100 firms with the highest turnover , only four board executives are women .
eu-wide the trend is much the same : the commission says 89 percent of board members of europe 's stock market-listed companies are males .
growing support for quotas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henkel now favors quotas for women hans-olaf henkel , ex-president of the german bdi industry federation , conceded recently that he no longer opposes a quota .
“ the fact that over the years hardly anything has happened shows that we 're not making headway . ”
personnel consultant heiner thorborg , the author of a book on why women do not make it into top jobs , said he too had once been an opponent of quotas .
“ but when i consider that my 12-year-old daughter will have to wait 200 years until something significant happens , then i say : the last modus is the quota , and it has to come ! ”
pressure mounts within bavarian csu even within bavaria 's tradionally conservative party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , women members want change .
bavarian justice minister beate merk told german public radio on thursday that she wants a 40 percent women 's quota on party committees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goodwill is not enough , says bavaria 's justice minister beate merk .
“ we 've seen that all the goodwill and effort has n't helped . ”
female participation in party membership , currently at 18 percent , was dwindling , she added . “ we want a quota .
women voters can only be won over when women can participate in politics and when women have the chance to move into positions of leadership . ”
family minister seeks concensus federal family minister kristina schroeder favors industry 's goodwill as before .
“ what we need are political changes that we 'll best achieve with the support of commerce , not in battle against industry . ”
schroeder 's ministry has initiated the drafting of a voluntary “ code for good management . ”
apart from one woman , its code commission is made up of male executives .
like commissioner reding , business studies professor ulrike detmers points to research findings showing that firms with a balanced male-female mix benefit all round , including gains in profitability : “ goals are reached much more quickly .
meetings run more efficiently .
when the women present are also mothers then one comes straight to the point . ” what 's needed , she says , is “ better childcare , more flexible hours ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's high time to redress the balance , if necessary by force , says viviane reding but some in germany maintain that such progress can not be legislated .
the president of the german chambers of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , hans heinrich driftmann , says that the lack of women in senior positions can be attributed to a number of reasons , including the difficulty of balancing family and work , and women 's tendency to avoid technical and scientific career paths .
" a legal quota ca n't really influence such wide-ranging underlying causes , and for that reason , i would argue against imposing one , " driftmann told the german daily paper die welt .
" i was recruited to my career on the basis of my qualifications , not because of my sex , " said marie-christine ostermann , a 32-year-old executive who also chairs germany 's association of young business leaders .
" had a quota been in place , i would have felt as if i had been reduced to a gender . "
germany falling back in international rankings in overall gender inequality terms , germany has fallen back in recent years , according to the world economic forum 's latest survey .
from being ranked fifth among 128 nations in 2006 , germany has slipped to 12th place .
topping the list are scandinavian nations .
the forum 's scoring is based on 30 indicators , including women 's access to education and chances for economic participation .
in one of several nationwide studies , the german institute for economic research , the diw , found that most women in employment remain confined to lower-paid jobs , and if they do enter senior management , then this tends to happen in service sectors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sattelberg says ' old boys networks ' persist everywhere the luebeck-based survey institute databyte says the presence of women in middle to upper management nationwide is 17 percent , but its survey of 940,000 firms shows marked regional variety . berlin tops with a women 's quota of 19 percent , closely followed by germany 's post-unification eastern states .
the tail-ender is baden-wurttemberg in southwestern germany with below 15 percent .
firm size also plays a role – women play bigger roles in smaller firms , including the retailing and the health sector in eastern germany .
one of the few german companies to self-impose its own women 's quota is deutsche telekom .
its goal is 30 percent by 2015 , but senior telekom employees fear that a decade of appeals and promises has not worked .
" old boys network " still prevails “ i think we have underestimated one thing – the ever-present dna , the ' old boys networks ' that shape company cultures , also in the sense of propagating traditional role models , " telekom 's head of personnel , thomas sattelberg said . professor detmer doubts that germany 's current government will move beyond soliciting goodwill .
“ out of consideration for industry 's interests , i do n't think the federal government will make the hard choices . ”

schroeder 's ministry has initiated the drafting of a voluntary “ code for good management . ”
apart from one woman , its code commission is made up of male executives .
like commissioner reding , business studies professor ulrike detmers points to research findings showing that firms with a balanced male-female mix benefit all round , including gains in profitability : “ goals are reached much more quickly .

the president of the german chambers of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , hans heinrich driftmann , says that the lack of women in senior positions can be attributed to a number of reasons , including the difficulty of balancing family and work , and women 's tendency to avoid technical and scientific career paths .
" a legal quota ca n't really influence such wide-ranging underlying causes , and for that reason , i would argue against imposing one , " driftmann told the german daily paper die welt .
" i was recruited to my career on the basis of my qualifications , not because of my sex , " said marie-christine ostermann , a 32-year-old executive who also chairs germany 's association of young business leaders .
" had a quota been in place , i would have felt as if i had been reduced to a gender . "

topping the list are scandinavian nations .
the forum 's scoring is based on 30 indicators , including women 's access to education and chances for economic participation .
in one of several nationwide studies , the german institute for economic research , the diw , found that most women in employment remain confined to lower-paid jobs , and if they do enter senior management , then this tends to happen in service sectors .

the eu ’ s commissioner for equal opportunities viviane reding has warned firms in europe to rapidly promote women into top jobs or face a 30 percent quota from next year . a european commission threat to elevate women by fixed quotas into top company jobs coincides with growing admissions in germany that this could be the only remaining option to redress the balance .
despite a pledge made nine years ago by german industry to voluntarily remove the “ glass ceiling ” blocking women , only 2.5 percent of board members of germany 's 200 largest companies are female .
and at the 100 firms with the highest turnover , only four board executives are women .
eu-wide the trend is much the same : the commission says 89 percent of board members of europe 's stock market-listed companies are males .
growing support for quotas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henkel now favors quotas for women hans-olaf henkel , ex-president of the german bdi industry federation , conceded recently that he no longer opposes a quota .
“ the fact that over the years hardly anything has happened shows that we 're not making headway . ”
personnel consultant heiner thorborg , the author of a book on why women do not make it into top jobs , said he too had once been an opponent of quotas .
“ but when i consider that my 12-year-old daughter will have to wait 200 years until something significant happens , then i say : the last modus is the quota , and it has to come ! ”
pressure mounts within bavarian csu even within bavaria 's tradionally conservative party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , women members want change .
bavarian justice minister beate merk told german public radio on thursday that she wants a 40 percent women 's quota on party committees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goodwill is not enough , says bavaria 's justice minister beate merk .
“ we 've seen that all the goodwill and effort has n't helped . ”
female participation in party membership , currently at 18 percent , was dwindling , she added . “ we want a quota .
women voters can only be won over when women can participate in politics and when women have the chance to move into positions of leadership . ”

friday , september 18 frankfurt-freiburg freiburg have looked much better this year than last and have shown they can win away .
but after a sputtering start , frankfurt got back on track last week and have enough drive going forward to exploit their opponents ' weakness at the back .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 saturday , september 18 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne will hope to see this mueller - not the celebratory one bayern munich-cologne no secret about the billy goats ' strategy here – pack it in in their own half , frustrate franck ribery and hope for a draw .
with bayern perhaps having tired legs from the champions league , cologne 's plan has a chance of working .
but something tells me thomas mueller has found his rhythm again , and as he showed on wedsnesday , he can manufacture goals from nothing .
prediction : bayern 2-0 werder bremen-mainz this is just the sort of match profligate bremen often lose , and what 's not to like about this year 's plucky , well-organized mainz squad ?
unfortunately for the latter , though , i think the now-confirmed news that wunderkind andre schuerrle is headed to leverkusen next season will prove to be a distraction .
prediction : bremen 3-1 stuttgart-moenchengladbach this is a case of the underachieving taking on the unpredictable .
stuttgart have been a mess this season , especially on defense , and are coming off only two days rest .
gladbach have been up and down but have already tripped up one big club at home .
methinks they split the points .
prediction : 1-1 draw wolfsburg-hanover there 's one team here still looking for its first points , and it 's not hanover .
the 96ers are undefeated , and their two wins , while close , have been deserved .
for the wolves , who are miles ahead talent-wise , this will be a test of whether they have faith in new coach steve mcclaren .
i think the result will be indecisive .
prediction : 2-2 draw .
kaiserslautern-hoffenheim as bayern found out two weeks ago , never underestimate lautern 's home field advantage .
but i like what i 've seen from hoffenheim this season .
they 're more disciplined than in the past and look like they 're on a mission to prove the doubters wrong .
and they simply have too much attacking firepower for the red devils .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 sunday , september 19 st. pauli-hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. pauli fans will hope their outlaw act intimidates their city rivals of the true city derbies in german football , this one is the best .
on paper , pauli are completely overmatched against hamburg .
but that 's on paper .
taking to the field in millerntor stadium with ac / dc 's hell 's bells ringing in your ears is something that can impress even the likes of ruud van nistelrooy .
and somewhere within all that ringing i hear the sound of an upset .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 dortmund-schalke could things get any worse for schalke ?
they 're on a bad losing streak , and now they get a visit their bitterest rivals , who are off to a good start .
but i 'm not writing off schalke just yet , and i think two extra days rest will help them sneak a point .
prediction : 1-1 draw leverkusen-nuremberg leverkusen have lived up to their reputation as one of the bundesliga 's least consistent teams and will have thursday 's europa cup match weighing down their legs .
but i think nuremberg will be thrown off by the loss of their best striker , albert bunjaku , to injury for the rest of the year .

prediction : bayern 2-0 werder bremen-mainz this is just the sort of match profligate bremen often lose , and what 's not to like about this year 's plucky , well-organized mainz squad ?
unfortunately for the latter , though , i think the now-confirmed news that wunderkind andre schuerrle is headed to leverkusen next season will prove to be a distraction .
prediction : bremen 3-1 stuttgart-moenchengladbach this is a case of the underachieving taking on the unpredictable .
stuttgart have been a mess this season , especially on defense , and are coming off only two days rest .
gladbach have been up and down but have already tripped up one big club at home .
methinks they split the points .
prediction : 1-1 draw wolfsburg-hanover there 's one team here still looking for its first points , and it 's not hanover .
the 96ers are undefeated , and their two wins , while close , have been deserved .
for the wolves , who are miles ahead talent-wise , this will be a test of whether they have faith in new coach steve mcclaren .
i think the result will be indecisive .
prediction : 2-2 draw .
kaiserslautern-hoffenheim as bayern found out two weeks ago , never underestimate lautern 's home field advantage .
but i like what i 've seen from hoffenheim this season .
they 're more disciplined than in the past and look like they 're on a mission to prove the doubters wrong .
and they simply have too much attacking firepower for the red devils .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 sunday , september 19 st. pauli-hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. pauli fans will hope their outlaw act intimidates their city rivals of the true city derbies in german football , this one is the best .
on paper , pauli are completely overmatched against hamburg .
but that 's on paper .
taking to the field in millerntor stadium with ac / dc 's hell 's bells ringing in your ears is something that can impress even the likes of ruud van nistelrooy .
and somewhere within all that ringing i hear the sound of an upset .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 dortmund-schalke could things get any worse for schalke ?
they 're on a bad losing streak , and now they get a visit their bitterest rivals , who are off to a good start .
but i 'm not writing off schalke just yet , and i think two extra days rest will help them sneak a point .
prediction : 1-1 draw leverkusen-nuremberg leverkusen have lived up to their reputation as one of the bundesliga 's least consistent teams and will have thursday 's europa cup match weighing down their legs .
but i think nuremberg will be thrown off by the loss of their best striker , albert bunjaku , to injury for the rest of the year .

dw 's reporter offers a homeboy view of an area usually dismissed as a ghetto . recently , while eating a taco at a joint near where i live in berlin 's neukoelln neighborhood , i overheard a telling conversation .

as recently as 2006 , neukoelln attracted the opprobrium of the nation , after teachers at a neighborhood high school wrote to the mayor complaining that it was too dangerous to hold any kind of instruction in .

gentrification happens elsewhere the first step toward gentrification ?
i 'll never know exactly what the term means , other than a place someone liked being taken over by people whom that person does n't like .

dw 's reporter offers a homeboy view of an area usually dismissed as a ghetto . recently , while eating a taco at a joint near where i live in berlin 's neukoelln neighborhood , i overheard a telling conversation .
two young english-speaking women , probably around 20 and obviously recent arrivals to our fair city , were talking about the difficulty of finding a suitably located apartment .
" it sucks being in prenzlauer berg , " sighed one .
" i have to travel 30 minutes to get to a decent bar . "
i nearly blew mole sauce through my nostrils laughing .
eleven years ago , when i permanently moved to berlin , my entire circle of friends lived in the prenzlauer berg and mitte districts in the former east and would draw air circles beside their temples upon learning i 'd chosen to invest in property south of the river spree .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neukoelln is still very international back then , neukoelln existed in the popular imagination only as a kind of forbidden zone for lower-class alcoholics , people who chronically forgot to take their lithium and double-digit turkish families roasting whole lambs in three-room tenement flats .
but times change , and cities with them .
these days , most parts of prenzlauer berg offer all the charm and excitement of a pta meeting , whereas it 's virtually impossible to spit across the street in the northern section neukoelln without hitting an independent fashion designer 's studio or a bar staffed by people who look like occasional members of the arcade fire .
as recently as 2006 , neukoelln attracted the opprobrium of the nation , after teachers at a neighborhood high school wrote to the mayor complaining that it was too dangerous to hold any kind of instruction in .
fast forward to now and hipsters sport t-shirts reading " i 'm a ruetli student . "
gentrification happens elsewhere the first step toward gentrification ?
i 'll never know exactly what the term means , other than a place someone liked being taken over by people whom that person does n't like .
what i do know is that in the past 10 years the value of my apartment has roughly doubled , and i can get reasonably authentic mexican food without having to inflict undue wear and tear on the soles of my adidas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this 1920 's housing estate in neukoelln is a unesco world heritage site walk down weserstrasse , which has become the street of choice for many 20-somethings to get hammered , and most of the bars still feel like they 're being run by students on the very edge of legality .
moreover , i doubt neukoelln could go the prenzlauer berg-mitte route , even if it wanted to .
first of all , it 's much bigger , and over 20 percent of its 300,000-plus inhabitants are foreigners - the vast majority working-class turkish people , and not ex-pat computer programmers from new york or london .
ironically , one reason student-types first begin moving in was because the u8 subway line was an easy connection up to the then-trendy districts in the east .
they 've since discovered that it 's more fun to stay in their own neighborhood to party .
and for the time being , at least , i 'm having fun watching them do it .

friday , september 18 frankfurt-freiburg freiburg have looked much better this year than last and have shown they can win away .
but after a sputtering start , frankfurt got back on track last week and have enough drive going forward to exploit their opponents ' weakness at the back .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 saturday , september 18 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne will hope to see this mueller - not the celebratory one bayern munich-cologne no secret about the billy goats ' strategy here – pack it in in their own half , frustrate franck ribery and hope for a draw .
with bayern perhaps having tired legs from the champions league , cologne 's plan has a chance of working .
but something tells me thomas mueller has found his rhythm again , and as he showed on wedsnesday , he can manufacture goals from nothing .
prediction : bayern 2-0 werder bremen-mainz this is just the sort of match profligate bremen often lose , and what 's not to like about this year 's plucky , well-organized mainz squad ?
unfortunately for the latter , though , i think the now-confirmed news that wunderkind andre schuerrle is headed to leverkusen next season will prove to be a distraction .
prediction : bremen 3-1 stuttgart-moenchengladbach this is a case of the underachieving taking on the unpredictable .
stuttgart have been a mess this season , especially on defense , and are coming off only two days rest .
gladbach have been up and down but have already tripped up one big club at home .
methinks they split the points .
prediction : 1-1 draw wolfsburg-hanover there 's one team here still looking for its first points , and it 's not hanover .
the 96ers are undefeated , and their two wins , while close , have been deserved .
for the wolves , who are miles ahead talent-wise , this will be a test of whether they have faith in new coach steve mcclaren .
i think the result will be indecisive .
prediction : 2-2 draw .
kaiserslautern-hoffenheim as bayern found out two weeks ago , never underestimate lautern 's home field advantage .
but i like what i 've seen from hoffenheim this season .
they 're more disciplined than in the past and look like they 're on a mission to prove the doubters wrong .
and they simply have too much attacking firepower for the red devils .

on paper , pauli are completely overmatched against hamburg .
but that 's on paper .
taking to the field in millerntor stadium with ac / dc 's hell 's bells ringing in your ears is something that can impress even the likes of ruud van nistelrooy .
and somewhere within all that ringing i hear the sound of an upset .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 dortmund-schalke could things get any worse for schalke ?
they 're on a bad losing streak , and now they get a visit their bitterest rivals , who are off to a good start .
but i 'm not writing off schalke just yet , and i think two extra days rest will help them sneak a point .
prediction : 1-1 draw leverkusen-nuremberg leverkusen have lived up to their reputation as one of the bundesliga 's least consistent teams and will have thursday 's europa cup match weighing down their legs .
but i think nuremberg will be thrown off by the loss of their best striker , albert bunjaku , to injury for the rest of the year .

russia , which had issued the warrant for zakayev , had a close eye on whether poland would arrest him . polish police said friday they had arrested akhmed zakayev , a leading chechen separatist in exile , who is wanted by russia for alleged terrorism . police spokesman mriusz sokolowski said poland was responding to an international arrest warrant and had no option but to detain him . " he was arrested by plainclothes police as he was leaving a building , " sokolowski told tvn24 television . " because there was an international arrest warrant , police were under an obligation to detain him and to take him to prosecutors . "
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov expressed confidence earlier on thursday that poland would arrest and extradite zakayev .
" we drew the attention of our polish partners to this problem .
they took our appeal seriously , " he said .
poland has welcomed chechens zakayev arrived in poland on thursday to attend the two-day world chechen congress , a gathering of exiles from the conflict-torn region .
in poland , zakayev spoke about his nation 's role in reminding the world about the importance of human rights .
" i would like to express my deepest conviction that it is impossible to achieve real freedom and defend the rights of individuals when the rights and freedoms of whole nations are violated , " he said .
" the events of the past decade in the chechen republic have served as a test for all human rights activists and human rights organizations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechnya still bears the scars of war while the violence continues since his war years , zakayev has come to represent a moderate wing of the separatist movement .
russia is still fighting against an islamist insurgency in the caucasus in chechnya and in neighboring dagestan and ingushetia .
poland has become the prime destination for refugees fleeing the violence in chechnya over the last two decades .
successive polish governments have declared their solidarity with the people of the caucasus and in the 1990s poland opened the first official chechen information center in europe .
more recently , the late polish president lech kaczynski went out of his way to show support for georgia in its disputes with russia by making controversial trips to war-torn regions .
inconvenient timing zakayev 's visit - and the ensuing pressure from russia - comes at a sensitive time for poland . it was lech kaczynski 's death in a plane crash in russia earlier this year that began to thaw the traditionally chilly relationship between warsaw and moscow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many chechen refugees have ended up in poland , but some have found life difficult there asked whether the world chechen congress could affect poland 's relations with russia , prime minister donald tusk said that , without compromising its ideals , his cabinet will also look after polish interests .
but those taking part in the world chechen congress also have more practical problems on their minds .
as muslims , they are culturally alienated in roman catholic poland .
thousands are suspended in limbo - with no jobs , no available housing and no prospect of moving on to another eu country .

another man was arrested about eight hours later .
the police said officers had been searching two businesses and eight homes in the capital since the arrests , but had found no weapons or dangerous materials .
media reports suggested the arrests were likely linked to the papal visit , an issue on which the police would not comment .
the presence of pope benedict xvi in london meant that the british capital was already on high alert before friday 's raids .

" we can say that we 're totally confident in the work of the police . "

on his flight to britain , benedict made some of his strongest comments yet on the paedophilia controversy , saying revelations of child abuse by priests that have rocked the catholic church " were a shock to me . "
he added that " the authorities in the church have not been vigilant enough . "
the church " did not act quickly or firmly enough to take the necessary action " to stop the problem , which involved abuse by priests and catholic teachers in ireland , germany , and a number of other countries around europe .

steinbach had accused auschwitz survivor and former polish foreign minister wladyslaw bartoszewski of having a " bad character . " german chancellor angela merkel was quick to defend bartoszewki but stopped short of mentioning steinbach by name .
" as for the comments regarding mr. bartoszewski , the fact is that i deeply respect him as a person and i also believe that he has done much for german-polish friendship , " merkel said at an eu summit in brussels on thursday . bartoszewski , currently poland ’ s special envoy for german relations , reacted calmly to the comments , saying he had never spoken to mrs. steinbach in his life .
leaders across the political spectrum have also been swift to criticise steinbach .
green party leader claudia roth accused her of poisoning german-polish relations , and the social democrats and the greens said they were ending their cooperation with the cdu politician on the human rights committee of the bundestag . volker beck , parliamentary secretary of the greens parliamentary group , demanded the cdu leadership relieve steinbach of her position as a human rights group spokesperson . steinbach is the head of germany ’ s league of expellees , an organization representing ethnic germans forced to leave their homes in what is now poland at the end of world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wladyslaw bartoszewski : underground activist and two-time polish foreign minister no regrets but in an interview with zdf television , steinbach , who was born in poland to german parents , said she had no regrets about the substance of her comments - with the possible exception of her tone . " i should have , perhaps , been a little more friendly when speaking openly against an 88 year-old man - sure , i 'll admit that .
but of course there have been many cases over many years that have led to my feeling this way , " steinbach said .
steinbach cited the failure of the auschwitz survivor to respond to her letters as the main reason for her poor opinion of him . green party deputy chair baebel hoehn was outraged . " this is a man who was in a concentration camp , who said afterward , ' i will be open to the west ' , a man who sat in jail under communism , and afterwards said , ' i will try to do everything for german-polish friendship , " ' said hoehn . " when you say , ' this man has a bad character , ' then i think you have disqualified yourself , " the leader of the parliamentary group said , adding she found it ' shabby ' of steinbach to suggest people read her book to find out her reasons . inflammatory wwii comments it 's not the first time steinbach has put her foot in her mouth .
earlier in september she announced she would resign from the cdu ’ s executive board after backing two members of her federation who had publicly implied poland shared the blame for starting world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach represents about 12.5 million expellees and their descendents the former cdu general secretary heinrich geissler said on zdf television that any attempt to shift the blame for wwii on to the mobilization of poland - a rationale for invasion used by hitler - was incompatible with the party 's principles .
" to speak of the mobilization of poland six months before that september is not only misguided , but is basically , for someone who is a member of the cdu , unacceptable .
it 's shameful ; it 's a scandal . "
some of steinbach 's colleagues on the board for displaced people have also moved to distance themselves from her .
board member stefan meier told the newspaper passauer neue presse that steinbach 's comments were " anything but helpful .

cheers !
with oktoberfest about to kick off in munich , we asked our facebook users about their oktoberfest experiences , the good and the bad .
here 's a selection of their comments . have you ever been to oktoberfest ?
ha , i never went to oktoberfest while i was living in germany .
i am a born and bred berliner .
that explains it i guess .
however , i 've been to numerous oktoberfests in new zealand .
they are put on each year by the new zealand german business association in auckland and they rock , i mean ooompah !
so much fun - this year 's is on this friday . - anja yes !
and it was very memorable .
i went in munich for the 2000 oktoberfest !
we arrived very early and picked a tent and it was packed !
we squeezed in with a table and started drinking , and soon everyone was talking , dancing and singing and they locked the doors .
later , some star guests arrived ; some soccer players and a man with a dog , and the crowd went wild .
i still have the little woven heart trinket i bought . - laura yes .
when i was a student of goethe institut hong kong , i attended the oktoberfest party at the open car park of the marco polo hotel .
the marco polo oktoberfest is now very famous in hong kong .
it 's all about german food , beer , dancing and a swiss band .
but after all the years , it is still unchanged .
i 'll attend too this year , and see if the swiss band will still sing the same songs and play the same games .
but no change could be nice , because it 's a good atmosphere and memories every time . - paskol yeah , i went with my colleagues when i lived in germany last year .
we spent a long time walking around as there were no places to sit but it was a great atmosphere .
in the end we learned that it 's better to book in advance so we sat at odeonsplatz instead and had some beers . - hannah when i was stationed as a soldier in offenbach / main in 1958 , i made friends with a young german and we decided at the last minute to go to the oktoberfest on his motorcycle .
once there we hunted and hunted for a place to spend the night but everything was booked .
we ended up sleeping on big oil cans at a gas station .
had a great time though . - bill yes .
i was there last year with five friends in the second weekend .
it was wonderful and the weather was very good .
we do n't remember the number of beer mugs we drank , but we had a good time .
i suppose we will remember that weekend until our last minute in this world . - francisco horrible experience .
everybody was drunk and the whole thing was pretty boring ...
i prefer cologne 's carnival .
everyone 's drunk there as well , but at least it 's fun : they sing and dress up . - maria-lujan last year i was at the oktoberfest together with other students studying german at the goethe institut in schwaebisch hall .
a camera crew from the deutsche welle team filmed us while we experienced the oktoberfest for the first time .
it was such a fun and amazing experience !
i ended up going back to the wiesn four more times that year and each time i met interesting and fun people .
one of the things i liked best about the oktoberfest is how easy it is to meet people sitting near you and to strike up a conversation with them .
i also especially enjoyed standing on the benches , drinking lots of beer , and singing crazy german songs ! - benjamin compiled by stuart tiffen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

another man was arrested about eight hours later .
the police said officers had been searching two businesses and eight homes in the capital since the arrests , but had found no weapons or dangerous materials .
media reports suggested the arrests were likely linked to the papal visit , an issue on which the police would not comment .
the presence of pope benedict xvi in london meant that the british capital was already on high alert before friday 's raids .
" we 're totally calm , the pope is happy , " vatican spokesman federico lombardi said when reporters told him about the arrests .
" we can say that we 're totally confident in the work of the police . "
papal schedule unchanged the pope attended a service at london 's westminster abbey on friday led by archbishop of canterbury rowan williams , the leader of the world 's anglican church .
the two church leaders then met at lambeth palace , the anglican archbishop 's london residence , for historic talks : no pontiff had visited lambeth palace or visited the historic abbey since the foundation of the church of england when king henry viii broke with rome in 1534 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some object to benedict 's handling of the sex scandal benedict also delivered a speech at westminster hall - the historic heart of the houses of parliament - and addressed some 3,000 young catholics at an event in southwest london .
anti-church protests continue the run-up to the visit was clouded by criticism of the catholic church 's handling of a child abuse scandal and a furore over the trip 's cost : 20 million gbp -lrb- 37 million euros -rrb- .
there were protests before benedict 's engagement with young people in twickenham on friday , in the southwest of the british capital , with around 20 demonstrators waving banners with slogans saying , " there is no god - get over it ! " or " the pope is wrong , put a condom on ! "
on his flight to britain , benedict made some of his strongest comments yet on the paedophilia controversy , saying revelations of child abuse by priests that have rocked the catholic church " were a shock to me . "
he added that " the authorities in the church have not been vigilant enough . "
the church " did not act quickly or firmly enough to take the necessary action " to stop the problem , which involved abuse by priests and catholic teachers in ireland , germany , and a number of other countries around europe .
while in london , benedict was expected to meet a group of 10 victims of abuse , either on friday or saturday .
first pope to make ' state visit ' to england on the first day of the pope 's visit , he warned of the risk of " aggressive secularism " in britain and greeted tens of thousands of people at a mass in glasgow and on the streets of edinburgh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen cordially invited the pope to britain herself " the united kingdom strives to be a modern and multicultural society , " benedict xvi said .
" in this challenging enterprise , may it always maintain its respect for those traditional values and cultural expressions that more aggressive forms of secularism no longer value or even tolerate . "
the pontiff also met queen elizabeth ii while in edinburgh : " i am delighted to welcome you to the uk and particularly to scotland on your first visit as pope , " the queen said .
this is the first papal visit to the uk to be classified as a state visit , because it was elizabeth ii who invited the pontiff , not the church .
benedict xvi and the queen focused on the positive aspects of relations between predominantly anglican britain and the roman catholic church , two bodies which the queen said shared " a common christian heritage . "
on sunday , benedict will travel to the central english city of birmingham for the final day of his visit , where he will preside over the beatification of a 19th century cardinal , john henry newman .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 17.09.2010 german government plays down roma ' misunderstanding ' with france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's statements left many germans scratching their heads politicians in berlin have said the mixed messages on roma deportations from nicolas sarkozy and berlin are not a ' strain ' on franco-german relations .
meanwhile , roma leaders in germany say camps are n't an issue here . it was n't really french president nicolas sarkozy 's dismantling of roma camps and large-scale deportations that caused controversy in germany , nor was it his " lively " confrontation with european commission president jose manuel barroso on the issue , it was his assertion that german chancellor angela merkel was planning to introduce a similar policy .
" mrs. merkel told me that germany also intends to start clearing out camps in the coming weeks , " sarkozy told reporters in brussels on thursday evening .
the chancellor 's office in berlin and foreign minister guido westerwelle both swiftly refuted sarkozy 's claims , with westerwelle saying that such a policy " would run contrary to the german constitution . "
however , german leaders are also playing down the significance of this " misunderstanding , " saying the confusion will not hurt germany and france 's cooperation bilaterally , or within the eu .
" you should not over-interpret this as a strain on franco-german relations , " government spokesman steffen seibert said in berlin on friday .
" no camps " in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose says germany and france both discriminate , but to different extents roma leaders in germany said they were confused by sarkozy 's statement , given that most german-based roma are more integrated into society and are less likely to live in makeshift camps .
" for me , it 's very clear that -lrb- german chancellor angela merkel -rrb- said nothing of this nature , primarily because there are n't any camps here in germany - or , at least , none of which i am aware , " the head of the central council for german sinti and roma , romani rose , told the mdr german public broadcaster on friday .
" so , to me , the chancellor 's denial seems entirely credible . "
" sinti and roma live normally like the rest of the population ; they are workers , employees , academics and artists , they 're members of sporting clubs , and , very often , people do n't even know they 're part of an ethnic minority . "
rose said that discrimination remained a major issue in germany , but usually on an individual level .
he referred to a recent survey carried out by the council in which over 80 percent of respondents said they had encountered some form of discrimination in their day-to-day lives .
sinti and roma can encounter discrimination when looking for a job or a flat , in individual legal disputes , and even in their local pub , he explained .
" but none of this is comparable with this sweeping , criminalizing campaign being carried out by the upper echelons of the french government , including the president , " rose said .
" these policies have caused great concern amongst our people here in germany , and all over europe . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose says germany has no camps like this one in a paris suburb if germany has a policy comparable to the french mass deportations , it would be the contentious decision to gradually send some 12,000 former refugees , many of whom are roma , back to their home country of kosovo now that germany deems the situation there stable .
unlike romania and bulgaria , where most french-based roma are being sent , kosovo is not a member of the european union , meaning the issue does not fall within the jurisdiction of the eu commission , france 's most high-profile critic on this issue to date .
rose said he strongly opposed the german policy to repatriate sinti and roma , among others , to kosovo , arguing that april 's decision to begin this process was premature and that the government in pristina was not yet ready to uphold the rights of formerly displaced people .
" it 's still irresponsible to send these people back to kosovo now , " he said .
" the un 's refugee representative in berlin has said that the security situation for roma in kosovo is not yet satisfactory , international human rights groups like amnesty international have said the same thing , as has the central council for german sinti and roma . "
but rose also said that the german government was handling the roughly 12,000 cases differently to france , describing each decision as an " individual example " , whereas france was carrying out a deportation policy " en masse . "

meanwhile , roma leaders in germany say camps are n't an issue here . it was n't really french president nicolas sarkozy 's dismantling of roma camps and large-scale deportations that caused controversy in germany , nor was it his " lively " confrontation with european commission president jose manuel barroso on the issue , it was his assertion that german chancellor angela merkel was planning to introduce a similar policy .
" mrs. merkel told me that germany also intends to start clearing out camps in the coming weeks , " sarkozy told reporters in brussels on thursday evening .
the chancellor 's office in berlin and foreign minister guido westerwelle both swiftly refuted sarkozy 's claims , with westerwelle saying that such a policy " would run contrary to the german constitution . "
however , german leaders are also playing down the significance of this " misunderstanding , " saying the confusion will not hurt germany and france 's cooperation bilaterally , or within the eu .
" you should not over-interpret this as a strain on franco-german relations , " government spokesman steffen seibert said in berlin on friday .
" no camps " in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose says germany and france both discriminate , but to different extents roma leaders in germany said they were confused by sarkozy 's statement , given that most german-based roma are more integrated into society and are less likely to live in makeshift camps .
" for me , it 's very clear that -lrb- german chancellor angela merkel -rrb- said nothing of this nature , primarily because there are n't any camps here in germany - or , at least , none of which i am aware , " the head of the central council for german sinti and roma , romani rose , told the mdr german public broadcaster on friday .
" so , to me , the chancellor 's denial seems entirely credible . "
" sinti and roma live normally like the rest of the population ; they are workers , employees , academics and artists , they 're members of sporting clubs , and , very often , people do n't even know they 're part of an ethnic minority . "
rose said that discrimination remained a major issue in germany , but usually on an individual level .
he referred to a recent survey carried out by the council in which over 80 percent of respondents said they had encountered some form of discrimination in their day-to-day lives .
sinti and roma can encounter discrimination when looking for a job or a flat , in individual legal disputes , and even in their local pub , he explained .
" but none of this is comparable with this sweeping , criminalizing campaign being carried out by the upper echelons of the french government , including the president , " rose said .
" these policies have caused great concern amongst our people here in germany , and all over europe . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose says germany has no camps like this one in a paris suburb if germany has a policy comparable to the french mass deportations , it would be the contentious decision to gradually send some 12,000 former refugees , many of whom are roma , back to their home country of kosovo now that germany deems the situation there stable .
unlike romania and bulgaria , where most french-based roma are being sent , kosovo is not a member of the european union , meaning the issue does not fall within the jurisdiction of the eu commission , france 's most high-profile critic on this issue to date .
rose said he strongly opposed the german policy to repatriate sinti and roma , among others , to kosovo , arguing that april 's decision to begin this process was premature and that the government in pristina was not yet ready to uphold the rights of formerly displaced people .
" it 's still irresponsible to send these people back to kosovo now , " he said .
" the un 's refugee representative in berlin has said that the security situation for roma in kosovo is not yet satisfactory , international human rights groups like amnesty international have said the same thing , as has the central council for german sinti and roma . "
but rose also said that the german government was handling the roughly 12,000 cases differently to france , describing each decision as an " individual example " , whereas france was carrying out a deportation policy " en masse . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 17.09.2010 eu threat to impose female quotas gets mixed response in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuck in lower management ?
the eu ’ s commissioner for equal opportunities viviane reding has warned firms in europe to rapidly promote women into top jobs or face a 30 percent quota from next year . a european commission threat to elevate women by fixed quotas into top company jobs coincides with growing admissions in germany that this could be the only remaining option to redress the balance .
despite a pledge made nine years ago by german industry to voluntarily remove the “ glass ceiling ” blocking women , only 2.5 percent of board members of germany 's 200 largest companies are female .
and at the 100 firms with the highest turnover , only four board executives are women .
eu-wide the trend is much the same : the commission says 89 percent of board members of europe 's stock market-listed companies are males .
growing support for quotas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henkel now favors quotas for women hans-olaf henkel , ex-president of the german bdi industry federation , conceded recently that he no longer opposes a quota .
“ the fact that over the years hardly anything has happened shows that we 're not making headway . ”
personnel consultant heiner thorborg , the author of a book on why women do not make it into top jobs , said he too had once been an opponent of quotas .
“ but when i consider that my 12-year-old daughter will have to wait 200 years until something significant happens , then i say : the last modus is the quota , and it has to come ! ”
pressure mounts within bavarian csu even within bavaria 's tradionally conservative party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , women members want change .
bavarian justice minister beate merk told german public radio on thursday that she wants a 40 percent women 's quota on party committees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goodwill is not enough , says bavaria 's justice minister beate merk .
“ we 've seen that all the goodwill and effort has n't helped . ”
female participation in party membership , currently at 18 percent , was dwindling , she added . “ we want a quota .
women voters can only be won over when women can participate in politics and when women have the chance to move into positions of leadership . ”
family minister seeks concensus federal family minister kristina schroeder favors industry 's goodwill as before .
“ what we need are political changes that we 'll best achieve with the support of commerce , not in battle against industry . ”
schroeder 's ministry has initiated the drafting of a voluntary “ code for good management . ”
apart from one woman , its code commission is made up of male executives .
like commissioner reding , business studies professor ulrike detmers points to research findings showing that firms with a balanced male-female mix benefit all round , including gains in profitability : “ goals are reached much more quickly .
meetings run more efficiently .
when the women present are also mothers then one comes straight to the point . ” what 's needed , she says , is “ better childcare , more flexible hours ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's high time to redress the balance , if necessary by force , says viviane reding but some in germany maintain that such progress can not be legislated .
the president of the german chambers of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , hans heinrich driftmann , says that the lack of women in senior positions can be attributed to a number of reasons , including the difficulty of balancing family and work , and women 's tendency to avoid technical and scientific career paths .
" a legal quota ca n't really influence such wide-ranging underlying causes , and for that reason , i would argue against imposing one , " driftmann told the german daily paper die welt .
" i was recruited to my career on the basis of my qualifications , not because of my sex , " said marie-christine ostermann , a 32-year-old executive who also chairs germany 's association of young business leaders .
" had a quota been in place , i would have felt as if i had been reduced to a gender . "
germany falling back in international rankings in overall gender inequality terms , germany has fallen back in recent years , according to the world economic forum 's latest survey .
from being ranked fifth among 128 nations in 2006 , germany has slipped to 12th place .
topping the list are scandinavian nations .
the forum 's scoring is based on 30 indicators , including women 's access to education and chances for economic participation .
in one of several nationwide studies , the german institute for economic research , the diw , found that most women in employment remain confined to lower-paid jobs , and if they do enter senior management , then this tends to happen in service sectors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sattelberg says ' old boys networks ' persist everywhere the luebeck-based survey institute databyte says the presence of women in middle to upper management nationwide is 17 percent , but its survey of 940,000 firms shows marked regional variety . berlin tops with a women 's quota of 19 percent , closely followed by germany 's post-unification eastern states .
the tail-ender is baden-wurttemberg in southwestern germany with below 15 percent .
firm size also plays a role – women play bigger roles in smaller firms , including the retailing and the health sector in eastern germany .
one of the few german companies to self-impose its own women 's quota is deutsche telekom .
its goal is 30 percent by 2015 , but senior telekom employees fear that a decade of appeals and promises has not worked .
" old boys network " still prevails “ i think we have underestimated one thing – the ever-present dna , the ' old boys networks ' that shape company cultures , also in the sense of propagating traditional role models , " telekom 's head of personnel , thomas sattelberg said . professor detmer doubts that germany 's current government will move beyond soliciting goodwill .
“ out of consideration for industry 's interests , i do n't think the federal government will make the hard choices . ”

cheers !
with oktoberfest about to kick off in munich , we asked our facebook users about their oktoberfest experiences , the good and the bad .
here 's a selection of their comments . have you ever been to oktoberfest ?
ha , i never went to oktoberfest while i was living in germany .
i am a born and bred berliner .
that explains it i guess .
however , i 've been to numerous oktoberfests in new zealand .
they are put on each year by the new zealand german business association in auckland and they rock , i mean ooompah !
so much fun - this year 's is on this friday . - anja yes !
and it was very memorable .
i went in munich for the 2000 oktoberfest !
we arrived very early and picked a tent and it was packed !
we squeezed in with a table and started drinking , and soon everyone was talking , dancing and singing and they locked the doors .
later , some star guests arrived ; some soccer players and a man with a dog , and the crowd went wild .
i still have the little woven heart trinket i bought . - laura yes .
when i was a student of goethe institut hong kong , i attended the oktoberfest party at the open car park of the marco polo hotel .
the marco polo oktoberfest is now very famous in hong kong .
it 's all about german food , beer , dancing and a swiss band .
but after all the years , it is still unchanged .
i 'll attend too this year , and see if the swiss band will still sing the same songs and play the same games .
but no change could be nice , because it 's a good atmosphere and memories every time . - paskol yeah , i went with my colleagues when i lived in germany last year .
we spent a long time walking around as there were no places to sit but it was a great atmosphere .
in the end we learned that it 's better to book in advance so we sat at odeonsplatz instead and had some beers . - hannah when i was stationed as a soldier in offenbach / main in 1958 , i made friends with a young german and we decided at the last minute to go to the oktoberfest on his motorcycle .
once there we hunted and hunted for a place to spend the night but everything was booked .
we ended up sleeping on big oil cans at a gas station .
had a great time though . - bill yes .
i was there last year with five friends in the second weekend .
it was wonderful and the weather was very good .
we do n't remember the number of beer mugs we drank , but we had a good time .
i suppose we will remember that weekend until our last minute in this world . - francisco horrible experience .
everybody was drunk and the whole thing was pretty boring ...
i prefer cologne 's carnival .
everyone 's drunk there as well , but at least it 's fun : they sing and dress up . - maria-lujan last year i was at the oktoberfest together with other students studying german at the goethe institut in schwaebisch hall .
a camera crew from the deutsche welle team filmed us while we experienced the oktoberfest for the first time .
it was such a fun and amazing experience !
i ended up going back to the wiesn four more times that year and each time i met interesting and fun people .
one of the things i liked best about the oktoberfest is how easy it is to meet people sitting near you and to strike up a conversation with them .
i also especially enjoyed standing on the benches , drinking lots of beer , and singing crazy german songs ! - benjamin compiled by stuart tiffen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the center will be a new way to help computer users escape botnets - groups of malware-infected computers that can be controlled and exploited by a remote third party .
" the main goal is to remove germany from the top 10 ranking of countries from which botnet activities originate , " according to a document about the project published late last year on the organization for economic cooperation and development 's website .
when expanded successfully , botnets can comprise thousands or millions of so-called zombie computers that are under the control of an attacker .
they can be used for infecting further computers , sending spam , conducting criminal activity and launching cyber-attacks .

the move could pressure german carmakers to ramp up mass production of their own electric vehicles . rwe and china 's byd have teamed to bring electrical cars to germany , beginning with a trial fleet in 2011 .
a mass rollout in germany and several other european markets is planned the following year .
the deal with the chinese company , a battery specialist that has since expanded into car manufacturing , follows a string of agreements with other manufacturers , including france 's renault , japan 's nissan and daimler .
the centrepiece of the agreement is a package deal for electric car enthusiasts , consisting of byd 's electric vehicles and rwe 's fast-charging posts and electricity supplied exclusively from renewable sources .
two models will be initially available and targeted primarily at consumers in cities driving shorter distances .
already on the market the one model is a plug-in hybrid car that combines new electric and conventional internal combustion systems .
on the market in china since early this year , it has a range of between 60 and 100 kilometers when running only on electricity .
the other newer model will be a purely electric vehicle with a battery range of about 300 kilometers and an acceleration of 0 to 100 kilometers per hour within 10 seconds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe plans to charge electric cars with electricity from rewewable energy sources the package will include a fast-charging device from rwe , access to the company 's expanding network of public charging points – now at around 450 – and electricity generated by wind and solar systems .
rwe spokesman peter hoscheidt told deutsche welle that no decision has yet been reached on whether the cars and charging unit can be leased in addition to being purchased or both and what the prices will be .
but he said both options will be likely and prices will be attractive to garner attention .
in berlin , the german energy company is already collaborating with daimler in a field trial .
they 're testing smart cars powered by lithium-ion batteries , which can be charged at home and public supply points .
the collaboration is one of several electric car initiatives running under the german government 's e-mobility program .
seeking standardization through their collaboration , rwe and byd also hope to contribute to standardization efforts in the nascent electric car industry .
standardized components are crucial to kick start mass production .
but the standardization process of a new technology , like electrically powered cars , is often accompanied by power struggles between groups seeking recognition of their own systems as standards in order to collect royalty fees down the road .
bildunterschrift : rwe sees the day coming when " fill it up " is replaced by " charge it up " why the cooperation with a chinese manufacturer now ?
because the chinese , hoscheidt said , promise mass production by 2012 , thus ensuring a sufficient supply of competitively priced vehicles .
" this is by no means an exclusive agreement , " he said .
" we 're seeking partners to push electric cars .
the sooner they can deliver , the better . "
coveted battery technolgy earlier this year , byd and daimler signed an agreement to develop and build electric cars for the chinese market .
the cars will be sold under a jointly owned brand .
daimler plans to take advantage of byd 's battery technology to help boost chinese sales .
byd is china 's sixth-biggest car manufacturer by sales last year .
american billionaire warren buffet owns 10 percent of the company .
but ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a professor at the university of duisburg-essen and an expert on the german auto industry warns about expecting too much too soon from chinese car makers .
" let 's see what comes , " he told deutsche welle .
" we 've seen a few chinese manufacturers come to europe , and they 've failed . "
byd 's car sales have been dropping noticeably in its home market , according to dudenhoeffer .
" there 's plenty of demand in china but other cars are apparently in greater demand , " he said .
nevertheless , dudenhoeffer welcomes the latest attempt to push electric cars in germany .
" there 's a lot more happening in a number of countries like france , " he said , pointing to financial incentives .
" in germany , there 's still just a lot of hot air . "

daimler plans to take advantage of byd 's battery technology to help boost chinese sales .
byd is china 's sixth-biggest car manufacturer by sales last year .
american billionaire warren buffet owns 10 percent of the company .
but ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a professor at the university of duisburg-essen and an expert on the german auto industry warns about expecting too much too soon from chinese car makers .
" let 's see what comes , " he told deutsche welle .
" we 've seen a few chinese manufacturers come to europe , and they 've failed . "
byd 's car sales have been dropping noticeably in its home market , according to dudenhoeffer .
" there 's plenty of demand in china but other cars are apparently in greater demand , " he said .
nevertheless , dudenhoeffer welcomes the latest attempt to push electric cars in germany .
" there 's a lot more happening in a number of countries like france , " he said , pointing to financial incentives .
" in germany , there 's still just a lot of hot air . "

the center will be a new way to help computer users escape botnets - groups of malware-infected computers that can be controlled and exploited by a remote third party .
" the main goal is to remove germany from the top 10 ranking of countries from which botnet activities originate , " according to a document about the project published late last year on the organization for economic cooperation and development 's website .
when expanded successfully , botnets can comprise thousands or millions of so-called zombie computers that are under the control of an attacker .
they can be used for infecting further computers , sending spam , conducting criminal activity and launching cyber-attacks .
generally speaking , botnets only affect computers with the microsoft windows operating system .
linux and mac os computers are rarely infected .
according to industry statistics , every seventh german computer connected to the internet is currently part of a botnet , with its user often unaware of the situation .
thomas de maiziere , germany 's interior minister , in a statement , described the problem as " the greatest current danger for the internet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center will have a budget of two million euros annually various types of assistance the anti-botnet beratungszentrum offers help via email or by phone .
the center 's website , www.botfrei.de , contains instructions on how to free an affected computer from a botnet , as well as useful software .
the 2 million euro project is financially supported by the federal ministry of the interior and technically by the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- .
several internet providers , such as deutsche telekom , are also involved .
in the future , the participating internet providers will automatically notify their clients by email or post if their computers are infected with malware .
de maziere is encouraging non-participating providers to join the project , but he also emphasizes that affected internet users need to “ take their share of responsibility ” and take advantage of the assistance offered by the help center .

cheers !
with oktoberfest about to kick off in munich , we asked our facebook users about their oktoberfest experiences , the good and the bad .
here 's a selection of their comments . have you ever been to oktoberfest ?
ha , i never went to oktoberfest while i was living in germany .
i am a born and bred berliner .
that explains it i guess .
however , i 've been to numerous oktoberfests in new zealand .
they are put on each year by the new zealand german business association in auckland and they rock , i mean ooompah !
so much fun - this year 's is on this friday . - anja yes !
and it was very memorable .
i went in munich for the 2000 oktoberfest !
we arrived very early and picked a tent and it was packed !
we squeezed in with a table and started drinking , and soon everyone was talking , dancing and singing and they locked the doors .
later , some star guests arrived ; some soccer players and a man with a dog , and the crowd went wild .
i still have the little woven heart trinket i bought . - laura yes .
when i was a student of goethe institut hong kong , i attended the oktoberfest party at the open car park of the marco polo hotel .
the marco polo oktoberfest is now very famous in hong kong .
it 's all about german food , beer , dancing and a swiss band .
but after all the years , it is still unchanged .
i 'll attend too this year , and see if the swiss band will still sing the same songs and play the same games .
but no change could be nice , because it 's a good atmosphere and memories every time . - paskol yeah , i went with my colleagues when i lived in germany last year .
we spent a long time walking around as there were no places to sit but it was a great atmosphere .
in the end we learned that it 's better to book in advance so we sat at odeonsplatz instead and had some beers . - hannah when i was stationed as a soldier in offenbach / main in 1958 , i made friends with a young german and we decided at the last minute to go to the oktoberfest on his motorcycle .
once there we hunted and hunted for a place to spend the night but everything was booked .
we ended up sleeping on big oil cans at a gas station .
had a great time though . - bill yes .
i was there last year with five friends in the second weekend .
it was wonderful and the weather was very good .
we do n't remember the number of beer mugs we drank , but we had a good time .
i suppose we will remember that weekend until our last minute in this world . - francisco horrible experience .
everybody was drunk and the whole thing was pretty boring ...
i prefer cologne 's carnival .
everyone 's drunk there as well , but at least it 's fun : they sing and dress up . - maria-lujan last year i was at the oktoberfest together with other students studying german at the goethe institut in schwaebisch hall .
a camera crew from the deutsche welle team filmed us while we experienced the oktoberfest for the first time .
it was such a fun and amazing experience !
i ended up going back to the wiesn four more times that year and each time i met interesting and fun people .
one of the things i liked best about the oktoberfest is how easy it is to meet people sitting near you and to strike up a conversation with them .
i also especially enjoyed standing on the benches , drinking lots of beer , and singing crazy german songs ! - benjamin compiled by stuart tiffen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after a bumpy first three rounds , they 'll try to get it together this week . match day four in the bundesliga is upon us , and dw 's team of football freaks are plotting their comeback ... or hoping that when it comes to picks , it 's a case of four is fantastic .
the prediction squad has taken a hit from all the upsets thus far -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but still we rise .
friday , september 18 frankfurt-freiburg freiburg have looked much better this year than last and have shown they can win away .
but after a sputtering start , frankfurt got back on track last week and have enough drive going forward to exploit their opponents ' weakness at the back .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 saturday , september 18 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne will hope to see this mueller - not the celebratory one bayern munich-cologne no secret about the billy goats ' strategy here – pack it in in their own half , frustrate franck ribery and hope for a draw .
with bayern perhaps having tired legs from the champions league , cologne 's plan has a chance of working .
but something tells me thomas mueller has found his rhythm again , and as he showed on wedsnesday , he can manufacture goals from nothing .
prediction : bayern 2-0 werder bremen-mainz this is just the sort of match profligate bremen often lose , and what 's not to like about this year 's plucky , well-organized mainz squad ?
unfortunately for the latter , though , i think the now-confirmed news that wunderkind andre schuerrle is headed to leverkusen next season will prove to be a distraction .
prediction : bremen 3-1 stuttgart-moenchengladbach this is a case of the underachieving taking on the unpredictable .
stuttgart have been a mess this season , especially on defense , and are coming off only two days rest .
gladbach have been up and down but have already tripped up one big club at home .
methinks they split the points .
prediction : 1-1 draw wolfsburg-hanover there 's one team here still looking for its first points , and it 's not hanover .
the 96ers are undefeated , and their two wins , while close , have been deserved .
for the wolves , who are miles ahead talent-wise , this will be a test of whether they have faith in new coach steve mcclaren .
i think the result will be indecisive .
prediction : 2-2 draw .
kaiserslautern-hoffenheim as bayern found out two weeks ago , never underestimate lautern 's home field advantage .
but i like what i 've seen from hoffenheim this season .
they 're more disciplined than in the past and look like they 're on a mission to prove the doubters wrong .
and they simply have too much attacking firepower for the red devils .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 sunday , september 19 st. pauli-hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. pauli fans will hope their outlaw act intimidates their city rivals of the true city derbies in german football , this one is the best .
on paper , pauli are completely overmatched against hamburg .
but that 's on paper .
taking to the field in millerntor stadium with ac / dc 's hell 's bells ringing in your ears is something that can impress even the likes of ruud van nistelrooy .
and somewhere within all that ringing i hear the sound of an upset .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 dortmund-schalke could things get any worse for schalke ?
they 're on a bad losing streak , and now they get a visit their bitterest rivals , who are off to a good start .
but i 'm not writing off schalke just yet , and i think two extra days rest will help them sneak a point .
prediction : 1-1 draw leverkusen-nuremberg leverkusen have lived up to their reputation as one of the bundesliga 's least consistent teams and will have thursday 's europa cup match weighing down their legs .
but i think nuremberg will be thrown off by the loss of their best striker , albert bunjaku , to injury for the rest of the year .

the center will be a new way to help computer users escape botnets - groups of malware-infected computers that can be controlled and exploited by a remote third party .
" the main goal is to remove germany from the top 10 ranking of countries from which botnet activities originate , " according to a document about the project published late last year on the organization for economic cooperation and development 's website .
when expanded successfully , botnets can comprise thousands or millions of so-called zombie computers that are under the control of an attacker .
they can be used for infecting further computers , sending spam , conducting criminal activity and launching cyber-attacks .
generally speaking , botnets only affect computers with the microsoft windows operating system .
linux and mac os computers are rarely infected .
according to industry statistics , every seventh german computer connected to the internet is currently part of a botnet , with its user often unaware of the situation .
thomas de maiziere , germany 's interior minister , in a statement , described the problem as " the greatest current danger for the internet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center will have a budget of two million euros annually various types of assistance the anti-botnet beratungszentrum offers help via email or by phone .
the center 's website , www.botfrei.de , contains instructions on how to free an affected computer from a botnet , as well as useful software .
the 2 million euro project is financially supported by the federal ministry of the interior and technically by the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- .
several internet providers , such as deutsche telekom , are also involved .
in the future , the participating internet providers will automatically notify their clients by email or post if their computers are infected with malware .

cheers !
with oktoberfest about to kick off in munich , we asked our facebook users about their oktoberfest experiences , the good and the bad .
here 's a selection of their comments . have you ever been to oktoberfest ?
ha , i never went to oktoberfest while i was living in germany .
i am a born and bred berliner .
that explains it i guess .
however , i 've been to numerous oktoberfests in new zealand .
they are put on each year by the new zealand german business association in auckland and they rock , i mean ooompah !
so much fun - this year 's is on this friday . - anja yes !
and it was very memorable .
i went in munich for the 2000 oktoberfest !
we arrived very early and picked a tent and it was packed !
we squeezed in with a table and started drinking , and soon everyone was talking , dancing and singing and they locked the doors .
later , some star guests arrived ; some soccer players and a man with a dog , and the crowd went wild .
i still have the little woven heart trinket i bought . - laura yes .
when i was a student of goethe institut hong kong , i attended the oktoberfest party at the open car park of the marco polo hotel .
the marco polo oktoberfest is now very famous in hong kong .
it 's all about german food , beer , dancing and a swiss band .
but after all the years , it is still unchanged .
i 'll attend too this year , and see if the swiss band will still sing the same songs and play the same games .
but no change could be nice , because it 's a good atmosphere and memories every time . - paskol yeah , i went with my colleagues when i lived in germany last year .
we spent a long time walking around as there were no places to sit but it was a great atmosphere .
in the end we learned that it 's better to book in advance so we sat at odeonsplatz instead and had some beers . - hannah when i was stationed as a soldier in offenbach / main in 1958 , i made friends with a young german and we decided at the last minute to go to the oktoberfest on his motorcycle .
once there we hunted and hunted for a place to spend the night but everything was booked .
we ended up sleeping on big oil cans at a gas station .
had a great time though . - bill yes .
i was there last year with five friends in the second weekend .
it was wonderful and the weather was very good .
we do n't remember the number of beer mugs we drank , but we had a good time .
i suppose we will remember that weekend until our last minute in this world . - francisco horrible experience .
everybody was drunk and the whole thing was pretty boring ...
i prefer cologne 's carnival .
everyone 's drunk there as well , but at least it 's fun : they sing and dress up . - maria-lujan last year i was at the oktoberfest together with other students studying german at the goethe institut in schwaebisch hall .
a camera crew from the deutsche welle team filmed us while we experienced the oktoberfest for the first time .
it was such a fun and amazing experience !
i ended up going back to the wiesn four more times that year and each time i met interesting and fun people .
one of the things i liked best about the oktoberfest is how easy it is to meet people sitting near you and to strike up a conversation with them .
i also especially enjoyed standing on the benches , drinking lots of beer , and singing crazy german songs ! - benjamin compiled by stuart tiffen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after a bumpy first three rounds , they 'll try to get it together this week . match day four in the bundesliga is upon us , and dw 's team of football freaks are plotting their comeback ... or hoping that when it comes to picks , it 's a case of four is fantastic .
the prediction squad has taken a hit from all the upsets thus far -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but still we rise .
friday , september 18 frankfurt-freiburg freiburg have looked much better this year than last and have shown they can win away .
but after a sputtering start , frankfurt got back on track last week and have enough drive going forward to exploit their opponents ' weakness at the back .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 saturday , september 18 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne will hope to see this mueller - not the celebratory one bayern munich-cologne no secret about the billy goats ' strategy here – pack it in in their own half , frustrate franck ribery and hope for a draw .
with bayern perhaps having tired legs from the champions league , cologne 's plan has a chance of working .
but something tells me thomas mueller has found his rhythm again , and as he showed on wedsnesday , he can manufacture goals from nothing .
prediction : bayern 2-0 werder bremen-mainz this is just the sort of match profligate bremen often lose , and what 's not to like about this year 's plucky , well-organized mainz squad ?
unfortunately for the latter , though , i think the now-confirmed news that wunderkind andre schuerrle is headed to leverkusen next season will prove to be a distraction .
prediction : bremen 3-1 stuttgart-moenchengladbach this is a case of the underachieving taking on the unpredictable .
stuttgart have been a mess this season , especially on defense , and are coming off only two days rest .
gladbach have been up and down but have already tripped up one big club at home .
methinks they split the points .
prediction : 1-1 draw wolfsburg-hanover there 's one team here still looking for its first points , and it 's not hanover .
the 96ers are undefeated , and their two wins , while close , have been deserved .
for the wolves , who are miles ahead talent-wise , this will be a test of whether they have faith in new coach steve mcclaren .
i think the result will be indecisive .
prediction : 2-2 draw .
kaiserslautern-hoffenheim as bayern found out two weeks ago , never underestimate lautern 's home field advantage .
but i like what i 've seen from hoffenheim this season .

they 're on a bad losing streak , and now they get a visit their bitterest rivals , who are off to a good start .

prediction : 1-1 draw leverkusen-nuremberg leverkusen have lived up to their reputation as one of the bundesliga 's least consistent teams and will have thursday 's europa cup match weighing down their legs .

after a bumpy first three rounds , they 'll try to get it together this week . match day four in the bundesliga is upon us , and dw 's team of football freaks are plotting their comeback ... or hoping that when it comes to picks , it 's a case of four is fantastic .
the prediction squad has taken a hit from all the upsets thus far -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but still we rise .
friday , september 18 frankfurt-freiburg freiburg have looked much better this year than last and have shown they can win away .
but after a sputtering start , frankfurt got back on track last week and have enough drive going forward to exploit their opponents ' weakness at the back .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 saturday , september 18 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne will hope to see this mueller - not the celebratory one bayern munich-cologne no secret about the billy goats ' strategy here – pack it in in their own half , frustrate franck ribery and hope for a draw .
with bayern perhaps having tired legs from the champions league , cologne 's plan has a chance of working .
but something tells me thomas mueller has found his rhythm again , and as he showed on wedsnesday , he can manufacture goals from nothing .
prediction : bayern 2-0 werder bremen-mainz this is just the sort of match profligate bremen often lose , and what 's not to like about this year 's plucky , well-organized mainz squad ?
unfortunately for the latter , though , i think the now-confirmed news that wunderkind andre schuerrle is headed to leverkusen next season will prove to be a distraction .
prediction : bremen 3-1 stuttgart-moenchengladbach this is a case of the underachieving taking on the unpredictable .
stuttgart have been a mess this season , especially on defense , and are coming off only two days rest .
gladbach have been up and down but have already tripped up one big club at home .
methinks they split the points .
prediction : 1-1 draw wolfsburg-hanover there 's one team here still looking for its first points , and it 's not hanover .
the 96ers are undefeated , and their two wins , while close , have been deserved .
for the wolves , who are miles ahead talent-wise , this will be a test of whether they have faith in new coach steve mcclaren .
i think the result will be indecisive .
prediction : 2-2 draw .
kaiserslautern-hoffenheim as bayern found out two weeks ago , never underestimate lautern 's home field advantage .
but i like what i 've seen from hoffenheim this season .
they 're more disciplined than in the past and look like they 're on a mission to prove the doubters wrong .
and they simply have too much attacking firepower for the red devils .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 sunday , september 19 st. pauli-hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. pauli fans will hope their outlaw act intimidates their city rivals of the true city derbies in german football , this one is the best .

with oktoberfest about to kick off in munich , we asked our facebook users about their oktoberfest experiences , the good and the bad .
here 's a selection of their comments . have you ever been to oktoberfest ?
ha , i never went to oktoberfest while i was living in germany .
i am a born and bred berliner .
that explains it i guess .
however , i 've been to numerous oktoberfests in new zealand .
they are put on each year by the new zealand german business association in auckland and they rock , i mean ooompah !
so much fun - this year 's is on this friday . - anja yes !
and it was very memorable .
i went in munich for the 2000 oktoberfest !
we arrived very early and picked a tent and it was packed !
we squeezed in with a table and started drinking , and soon everyone was talking , dancing and singing and they locked the doors .
later , some star guests arrived ; some soccer players and a man with a dog , and the crowd went wild .
i still have the little woven heart trinket i bought . - laura yes .
when i was a student of goethe institut hong kong , i attended the oktoberfest party at the open car park of the marco polo hotel .
the marco polo oktoberfest is now very famous in hong kong .
it 's all about german food , beer , dancing and a swiss band .
but after all the years , it is still unchanged .
i 'll attend too this year , and see if the swiss band will still sing the same songs and play the same games .
but no change could be nice , because it 's a good atmosphere and memories every time . - paskol yeah , i went with my colleagues when i lived in germany last year .
we spent a long time walking around as there were no places to sit but it was a great atmosphere .
in the end we learned that it 's better to book in advance so we sat at odeonsplatz instead and had some beers . - hannah when i was stationed as a soldier in offenbach / main in 1958 , i made friends with a young german and we decided at the last minute to go to the oktoberfest on his motorcycle .
once there we hunted and hunted for a place to spend the night but everything was booked .
we ended up sleeping on big oil cans at a gas station .
had a great time though . - bill yes .
i was there last year with five friends in the second weekend .
it was wonderful and the weather was very good .
we do n't remember the number of beer mugs we drank , but we had a good time .
i suppose we will remember that weekend until our last minute in this world . - francisco horrible experience .
everybody was drunk and the whole thing was pretty boring ...
i prefer cologne 's carnival .
everyone 's drunk there as well , but at least it 's fun : they sing and dress up . - maria-lujan last year i was at the oktoberfest together with other students studying german at the goethe institut in schwaebisch hall .
a camera crew from the deutsche welle team filmed us while we experienced the oktoberfest for the first time .
it was such a fun and amazing experience !
i ended up going back to the wiesn four more times that year and each time i met interesting and fun people .
one of the things i liked best about the oktoberfest is how easy it is to meet people sitting near you and to strike up a conversation with them .
i also especially enjoyed standing on the benches , drinking lots of beer , and singing crazy german songs ! - benjamin compiled by stuart tiffen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we arrived very early and picked a tent and it was packed !
we squeezed in with a table and started drinking , and soon everyone was talking , dancing and singing and they locked the doors .
later , some star guests arrived ; some soccer players and a man with a dog , and the crowd went wild .
i still have the little woven heart trinket i bought . - laura yes .
when i was a student of goethe institut hong kong , i attended the oktoberfest party at the open car park of the marco polo hotel .
the marco polo oktoberfest is now very famous in hong kong .
it 's all about german food , beer , dancing and a swiss band .
but after all the years , it is still unchanged .
i 'll attend too this year , and see if the swiss band will still sing the same songs and play the same games .
but no change could be nice , because it 's a good atmosphere and memories every time . - paskol yeah , i went with my colleagues when i lived in germany last year .
we spent a long time walking around as there were no places to sit but it was a great atmosphere .
in the end we learned that it 's better to book in advance so we sat at odeonsplatz instead and had some beers . - hannah when i was stationed as a soldier in offenbach / main in 1958 , i made friends with a young german and we decided at the last minute to go to the oktoberfest on his motorcycle .
once there we hunted and hunted for a place to spend the night but everything was booked .
we ended up sleeping on big oil cans at a gas station .
had a great time though . - bill yes .
i was there last year with five friends in the second weekend .
it was wonderful and the weather was very good .
we do n't remember the number of beer mugs we drank , but we had a good time .
i suppose we will remember that weekend until our last minute in this world . - francisco horrible experience .
everybody was drunk and the whole thing was pretty boring ...
i prefer cologne 's carnival .
everyone 's drunk there as well , but at least it 's fun : they sing and dress up . - maria-lujan last year i was at the oktoberfest together with other students studying german at the goethe institut in schwaebisch hall .
a camera crew from the deutsche welle team filmed us while we experienced the oktoberfest for the first time .
it was such a fun and amazing experience !
i ended up going back to the wiesn four more times that year and each time i met interesting and fun people .
one of the things i liked best about the oktoberfest is how easy it is to meet people sitting near you and to strike up a conversation with them .
i also especially enjoyed standing on the benches , drinking lots of beer , and singing crazy german songs ! - benjamin compiled by stuart tiffen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move could pressure german carmakers to ramp up mass production of their own electric vehicles . rwe and china 's byd have teamed to bring electrical cars to germany , beginning with a trial fleet in 2011 .
a mass rollout in germany and several other european markets is planned the following year .
the deal with the chinese company , a battery specialist that has since expanded into car manufacturing , follows a string of agreements with other manufacturers , including france 's renault , japan 's nissan and daimler .
the centrepiece of the agreement is a package deal for electric car enthusiasts , consisting of byd 's electric vehicles and rwe 's fast-charging posts and electricity supplied exclusively from renewable sources .
two models will be initially available and targeted primarily at consumers in cities driving shorter distances .
already on the market the one model is a plug-in hybrid car that combines new electric and conventional internal combustion systems .
on the market in china since early this year , it has a range of between 60 and 100 kilometers when running only on electricity .
the other newer model will be a purely electric vehicle with a battery range of about 300 kilometers and an acceleration of 0 to 100 kilometers per hour within 10 seconds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe plans to charge electric cars with electricity from rewewable energy sources the package will include a fast-charging device from rwe , access to the company 's expanding network of public charging points – now at around 450 – and electricity generated by wind and solar systems .
rwe spokesman peter hoscheidt told deutsche welle that no decision has yet been reached on whether the cars and charging unit can be leased in addition to being purchased or both and what the prices will be .
but he said both options will be likely and prices will be attractive to garner attention .
in berlin , the german energy company is already collaborating with daimler in a field trial .
they 're testing smart cars powered by lithium-ion batteries , which can be charged at home and public supply points .
the collaboration is one of several electric car initiatives running under the german government 's e-mobility program .
seeking standardization through their collaboration , rwe and byd also hope to contribute to standardization efforts in the nascent electric car industry .
standardized components are crucial to kick start mass production .
but the standardization process of a new technology , like electrically powered cars , is often accompanied by power struggles between groups seeking recognition of their own systems as standards in order to collect royalty fees down the road .
bildunterschrift : rwe sees the day coming when " fill it up " is replaced by " charge it up " why the cooperation with a chinese manufacturer now ?
because the chinese , hoscheidt said , promise mass production by 2012 , thus ensuring a sufficient supply of competitively priced vehicles .
" this is by no means an exclusive agreement , " he said .
" we 're seeking partners to push electric cars .
the sooner they can deliver , the better . "
coveted battery technolgy earlier this year , byd and daimler signed an agreement to develop and build electric cars for the chinese market .
the cars will be sold under a jointly owned brand .
daimler plans to take advantage of byd 's battery technology to help boost chinese sales .
byd is china 's sixth-biggest car manufacturer by sales last year .
american billionaire warren buffet owns 10 percent of the company .
but ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a professor at the university of duisburg-essen and an expert on the german auto industry warns about expecting too much too soon from chinese car makers .
" let 's see what comes , " he told deutsche welle .
" we 've seen a few chinese manufacturers come to europe , and they 've failed . "
byd 's car sales have been dropping noticeably in its home market , according to dudenhoeffer .
" there 's plenty of demand in china but other cars are apparently in greater demand , " he said .
nevertheless , dudenhoeffer welcomes the latest attempt to push electric cars in germany .
" there 's a lot more happening in a number of countries like france , " he said , pointing to financial incentives .
" in germany , there 's still just a lot of hot air . "

the move could pressure german carmakers to ramp up mass production of their own electric vehicles . rwe and china 's byd have teamed to bring electrical cars to germany , beginning with a trial fleet in 2011 .
a mass rollout in germany and several other european markets is planned the following year .
the deal with the chinese company , a battery specialist that has since expanded into car manufacturing , follows a string of agreements with other manufacturers , including france 's renault , japan 's nissan and daimler .
the centrepiece of the agreement is a package deal for electric car enthusiasts , consisting of byd 's electric vehicles and rwe 's fast-charging posts and electricity supplied exclusively from renewable sources .
two models will be initially available and targeted primarily at consumers in cities driving shorter distances .
already on the market the one model is a plug-in hybrid car that combines new electric and conventional internal combustion systems .
on the market in china since early this year , it has a range of between 60 and 100 kilometers when running only on electricity .
the other newer model will be a purely electric vehicle with a battery range of about 300 kilometers and an acceleration of 0 to 100 kilometers per hour within 10 seconds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe plans to charge electric cars with electricity from rewewable energy sources the package will include a fast-charging device from rwe , access to the company 's expanding network of public charging points – now at around 450 – and electricity generated by wind and solar systems .
rwe spokesman peter hoscheidt told deutsche welle that no decision has yet been reached on whether the cars and charging unit can be leased in addition to being purchased or both and what the prices will be .
but he said both options will be likely and prices will be attractive to garner attention .
in berlin , the german energy company is already collaborating with daimler in a field trial .
they 're testing smart cars powered by lithium-ion batteries , which can be charged at home and public supply points .
the collaboration is one of several electric car initiatives running under the german government 's e-mobility program .
seeking standardization through their collaboration , rwe and byd also hope to contribute to standardization efforts in the nascent electric car industry .
standardized components are crucial to kick start mass production .
but the standardization process of a new technology , like electrically powered cars , is often accompanied by power struggles between groups seeking recognition of their own systems as standards in order to collect royalty fees down the road .
bildunterschrift : rwe sees the day coming when " fill it up " is replaced by " charge it up " why the cooperation with a chinese manufacturer now ?
because the chinese , hoscheidt said , promise mass production by 2012 , thus ensuring a sufficient supply of competitively priced vehicles .
" this is by no means an exclusive agreement , " he said .
" we 're seeking partners to push electric cars .
the sooner they can deliver , the better . "
coveted battery technolgy earlier this year , byd and daimler signed an agreement to develop and build electric cars for the chinese market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 17.09.2010 eu threat to impose female quotas gets mixed response in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuck in lower management ?
the eu ’ s commissioner for equal opportunities viviane reding has warned firms in europe to rapidly promote women into top jobs or face a 30 percent quota from next year . a european commission threat to elevate women by fixed quotas into top company jobs coincides with growing admissions in germany that this could be the only remaining option to redress the balance .
despite a pledge made nine years ago by german industry to voluntarily remove the “ glass ceiling ” blocking women , only 2.5 percent of board members of germany 's 200 largest companies are female .
and at the 100 firms with the highest turnover , only four board executives are women .
eu-wide the trend is much the same : the commission says 89 percent of board members of europe 's stock market-listed companies are males .
growing support for quotas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henkel now favors quotas for women hans-olaf henkel , ex-president of the german bdi industry federation , conceded recently that he no longer opposes a quota .
“ the fact that over the years hardly anything has happened shows that we 're not making headway . ”
personnel consultant heiner thorborg , the author of a book on why women do not make it into top jobs , said he too had once been an opponent of quotas .
“ but when i consider that my 12-year-old daughter will have to wait 200 years until something significant happens , then i say : the last modus is the quota , and it has to come ! ”
pressure mounts within bavarian csu even within bavaria 's tradionally conservative party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , women members want change .
bavarian justice minister beate merk told german public radio on thursday that she wants a 40 percent women 's quota on party committees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goodwill is not enough , says bavaria 's justice minister beate merk .
“ we 've seen that all the goodwill and effort has n't helped . ”
female participation in party membership , currently at 18 percent , was dwindling , she added . “ we want a quota .
women voters can only be won over when women can participate in politics and when women have the chance to move into positions of leadership . ”
family minister seeks concensus federal family minister kristina schroeder favors industry 's goodwill as before .
“ what we need are political changes that we 'll best achieve with the support of commerce , not in battle against industry . ”
schroeder 's ministry has initiated the drafting of a voluntary “ code for good management . ”
apart from one woman , its code commission is made up of male executives .
like commissioner reding , business studies professor ulrike detmers points to research findings showing that firms with a balanced male-female mix benefit all round , including gains in profitability : “ goals are reached much more quickly .
meetings run more efficiently .
when the women present are also mothers then one comes straight to the point . ” what 's needed , she says , is “ better childcare , more flexible hours ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's high time to redress the balance , if necessary by force , says viviane reding but some in germany maintain that such progress can not be legislated .
the president of the german chambers of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , hans heinrich driftmann , says that the lack of women in senior positions can be attributed to a number of reasons , including the difficulty of balancing family and work , and women 's tendency to avoid technical and scientific career paths .
" a legal quota ca n't really influence such wide-ranging underlying causes , and for that reason , i would argue against imposing one , " driftmann told the german daily paper die welt .
" i was recruited to my career on the basis of my qualifications , not because of my sex , " said marie-christine ostermann , a 32-year-old executive who also chairs germany 's association of young business leaders .
" had a quota been in place , i would have felt as if i had been reduced to a gender . "
germany falling back in international rankings in overall gender inequality terms , germany has fallen back in recent years , according to the world economic forum 's latest survey .
from being ranked fifth among 128 nations in 2006 , germany has slipped to 12th place .
topping the list are scandinavian nations .
the forum 's scoring is based on 30 indicators , including women 's access to education and chances for economic participation .
in one of several nationwide studies , the german institute for economic research , the diw , found that most women in employment remain confined to lower-paid jobs , and if they do enter senior management , then this tends to happen in service sectors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sattelberg says ' old boys networks ' persist everywhere the luebeck-based survey institute databyte says the presence of women in middle to upper management nationwide is 17 percent , but its survey of 940,000 firms shows marked regional variety . berlin tops with a women 's quota of 19 percent , closely followed by germany 's post-unification eastern states .
the tail-ender is baden-wurttemberg in southwestern germany with below 15 percent .
firm size also plays a role – women play bigger roles in smaller firms , including the retailing and the health sector in eastern germany .
one of the few german companies to self-impose its own women 's quota is deutsche telekom .
its goal is 30 percent by 2015 , but senior telekom employees fear that a decade of appeals and promises has not worked .
" old boys network " still prevails “ i think we have underestimated one thing – the ever-present dna , the ' old boys networks ' that shape company cultures , also in the sense of propagating traditional role models , " telekom 's head of personnel , thomas sattelberg said . professor detmer doubts that germany 's current government will move beyond soliciting goodwill .
“ out of consideration for industry 's interests , i do n't think the federal government will make the hard choices . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 17.09.2010 german government plays down roma ' misunderstanding ' with france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's statements left many germans scratching their heads politicians in berlin have said the mixed messages on roma deportations from nicolas sarkozy and berlin are not a ' strain ' on franco-german relations .
meanwhile , roma leaders in germany say camps are n't an issue here . it was n't really french president nicolas sarkozy 's dismantling of roma camps and large-scale deportations that caused controversy in germany , nor was it his " lively " confrontation with european commission president jose manuel barroso on the issue , it was his assertion that german chancellor angela merkel was planning to introduce a similar policy .
" mrs. merkel told me that germany also intends to start clearing out camps in the coming weeks , " sarkozy told reporters in brussels on thursday evening .
the chancellor 's office in berlin and foreign minister guido westerwelle both swiftly refuted sarkozy 's claims , with westerwelle saying that such a policy " would run contrary to the german constitution . "
however , german leaders are also playing down the significance of this " misunderstanding , " saying the confusion will not hurt germany and france 's cooperation bilaterally , or within the eu .
" you should not over-interpret this as a strain on franco-german relations , " government spokesman steffen seibert said in berlin on friday .
" no camps " in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose says germany and france both discriminate , but to different extents roma leaders in germany said they were confused by sarkozy 's statement , given that most german-based roma are more integrated into society and are less likely to live in makeshift camps .
" for me , it 's very clear that -lrb- german chancellor angela merkel -rrb- said nothing of this nature , primarily because there are n't any camps here in germany - or , at least , none of which i am aware , " the head of the central council for german sinti and roma , romani rose , told the mdr german public broadcaster on friday .
" so , to me , the chancellor 's denial seems entirely credible . "
" sinti and roma live normally like the rest of the population ; they are workers , employees , academics and artists , they 're members of sporting clubs , and , very often , people do n't even know they 're part of an ethnic minority . "
rose said that discrimination remained a major issue in germany , but usually on an individual level .
he referred to a recent survey carried out by the council in which over 80 percent of respondents said they had encountered some form of discrimination in their day-to-day lives .
sinti and roma can encounter discrimination when looking for a job or a flat , in individual legal disputes , and even in their local pub , he explained .
" but none of this is comparable with this sweeping , criminalizing campaign being carried out by the upper echelons of the french government , including the president , " rose said .
" these policies have caused great concern amongst our people here in germany , and all over europe . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose says germany has no camps like this one in a paris suburb if germany has a policy comparable to the french mass deportations , it would be the contentious decision to gradually send some 12,000 former refugees , many of whom are roma , back to their home country of kosovo now that germany deems the situation there stable .
unlike romania and bulgaria , where most french-based roma are being sent , kosovo is not a member of the european union , meaning the issue does not fall within the jurisdiction of the eu commission , france 's most high-profile critic on this issue to date .
rose said he strongly opposed the german policy to repatriate sinti and roma , among others , to kosovo , arguing that april 's decision to begin this process was premature and that the government in pristina was not yet ready to uphold the rights of formerly displaced people .
" it 's still irresponsible to send these people back to kosovo now , " he said .
" the un 's refugee representative in berlin has said that the security situation for roma in kosovo is not yet satisfactory , international human rights groups like amnesty international have said the same thing , as has the central council for german sinti and roma . "
but rose also said that the german government was handling the roughly 12,000 cases differently to france , describing each decision as an " individual example " , whereas france was carrying out a deportation policy " en masse . "

meanwhile , roma leaders in germany say camps are n't an issue here . it was n't really french president nicolas sarkozy 's dismantling of roma camps and large-scale deportations that caused controversy in germany , nor was it his " lively " confrontation with european commission president jose manuel barroso on the issue , it was his assertion that german chancellor angela merkel was planning to introduce a similar policy .
" mrs. merkel told me that germany also intends to start clearing out camps in the coming weeks , " sarkozy told reporters in brussels on thursday evening .
the chancellor 's office in berlin and foreign minister guido westerwelle both swiftly refuted sarkozy 's claims , with westerwelle saying that such a policy " would run contrary to the german constitution . "
however , german leaders are also playing down the significance of this " misunderstanding , " saying the confusion will not hurt germany and france 's cooperation bilaterally , or within the eu .
" you should not over-interpret this as a strain on franco-german relations , " government spokesman steffen seibert said in berlin on friday .
" no camps " in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose says germany and france both discriminate , but to different extents roma leaders in germany said they were confused by sarkozy 's statement , given that most german-based roma are more integrated into society and are less likely to live in makeshift camps .
" for me , it 's very clear that -lrb- german chancellor angela merkel -rrb- said nothing of this nature , primarily because there are n't any camps here in germany - or , at least , none of which i am aware , " the head of the central council for german sinti and roma , romani rose , told the mdr german public broadcaster on friday .
" so , to me , the chancellor 's denial seems entirely credible . "
" sinti and roma live normally like the rest of the population ; they are workers , employees , academics and artists , they 're members of sporting clubs , and , very often , people do n't even know they 're part of an ethnic minority . "
rose said that discrimination remained a major issue in germany , but usually on an individual level .
he referred to a recent survey carried out by the council in which over 80 percent of respondents said they had encountered some form of discrimination in their day-to-day lives .
sinti and roma can encounter discrimination when looking for a job or a flat , in individual legal disputes , and even in their local pub , he explained .
" but none of this is comparable with this sweeping , criminalizing campaign being carried out by the upper echelons of the french government , including the president , " rose said .
" these policies have caused great concern amongst our people here in germany , and all over europe . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose says germany has no camps like this one in a paris suburb if germany has a policy comparable to the french mass deportations , it would be the contentious decision to gradually send some 12,000 former refugees , many of whom are roma , back to their home country of kosovo now that germany deems the situation there stable .
unlike romania and bulgaria , where most french-based roma are being sent , kosovo is not a member of the european union , meaning the issue does not fall within the jurisdiction of the eu commission , france 's most high-profile critic on this issue to date .
rose said he strongly opposed the german policy to repatriate sinti and roma , among others , to kosovo , arguing that april 's decision to begin this process was premature and that the government in pristina was not yet ready to uphold the rights of formerly displaced people .
" it 's still irresponsible to send these people back to kosovo now , " he said .
" the un 's refugee representative in berlin has said that the security situation for roma in kosovo is not yet satisfactory , international human rights groups like amnesty international have said the same thing , as has the central council for german sinti and roma . "
but rose also said that the german government was handling the roughly 12,000 cases differently to france , describing each decision as an " individual example " , whereas france was carrying out a deportation policy " en masse . "

the chancellor 's office in berlin and foreign minister guido westerwelle both swiftly refuted sarkozy 's claims , with westerwelle saying that such a policy " would run contrary to the german constitution . "
however , german leaders are also playing down the significance of this " misunderstanding , " saying the confusion will not hurt germany and france 's cooperation bilaterally , or within the eu .
" you should not over-interpret this as a strain on franco-german relations , " government spokesman steffen seibert said in berlin on friday .
" no camps " in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose says germany and france both discriminate , but to different extents roma leaders in germany said they were confused by sarkozy 's statement , given that most german-based roma are more integrated into society and are less likely to live in makeshift camps .
" for me , it 's very clear that -lrb- german chancellor angela merkel -rrb- said nothing of this nature , primarily because there are n't any camps here in germany - or , at least , none of which i am aware , " the head of the central council for german sinti and roma , romani rose , told the mdr german public broadcaster on friday .
" so , to me , the chancellor 's denial seems entirely credible . "
" sinti and roma live normally like the rest of the population ; they are workers , employees , academics and artists , they 're members of sporting clubs , and , very often , people do n't even know they 're part of an ethnic minority . "
rose said that discrimination remained a major issue in germany , but usually on an individual level .
he referred to a recent survey carried out by the council in which over 80 percent of respondents said they had encountered some form of discrimination in their day-to-day lives .
sinti and roma can encounter discrimination when looking for a job or a flat , in individual legal disputes , and even in their local pub , he explained .
" but none of this is comparable with this sweeping , criminalizing campaign being carried out by the upper echelons of the french government , including the president , " rose said .
" these policies have caused great concern amongst our people here in germany , and all over europe . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose says germany has no camps like this one in a paris suburb if germany has a policy comparable to the french mass deportations , it would be the contentious decision to gradually send some 12,000 former refugees , many of whom are roma , back to their home country of kosovo now that germany deems the situation there stable .
unlike romania and bulgaria , where most french-based roma are being sent , kosovo is not a member of the european union , meaning the issue does not fall within the jurisdiction of the eu commission , france 's most high-profile critic on this issue to date .
rose said he strongly opposed the german policy to repatriate sinti and roma , among others , to kosovo , arguing that april 's decision to begin this process was premature and that the government in pristina was not yet ready to uphold the rights of formerly displaced people .
" it 's still irresponsible to send these people back to kosovo now , " he said .
" the un 's refugee representative in berlin has said that the security situation for roma in kosovo is not yet satisfactory , international human rights groups like amnesty international have said the same thing , as has the central council for german sinti and roma . "
but rose also said that the german government was handling the roughly 12,000 cases differently to france , describing each decision as an " individual example " , whereas france was carrying out a deportation policy " en masse . "

another man was arrested about eight hours later .
the police said officers had been searching two businesses and eight homes in the capital since the arrests , but had found no weapons or dangerous materials .
media reports suggested the arrests were likely linked to the papal visit , an issue on which the police would not comment .
the presence of pope benedict xvi in london meant that the british capital was already on high alert before friday 's raids .
" we 're totally calm , the pope is happy , " vatican spokesman federico lombardi said when reporters told him about the arrests .
" we can say that we 're totally confident in the work of the police . "
papal schedule unchanged the pope attended a service at london 's westminster abbey on friday led by archbishop of canterbury rowan williams , the leader of the world 's anglican church .

there were protests before benedict 's engagement with young people in twickenham on friday , in the southwest of the british capital , with around 20 demonstrators waving banners with slogans saying , " there is no god - get over it ! " or " the pope is wrong , put a condom on ! "
on his flight to britain , benedict made some of his strongest comments yet on the paedophilia controversy , saying revelations of child abuse by priests that have rocked the catholic church " were a shock to me . "
he added that " the authorities in the church have not been vigilant enough . "
the church " did not act quickly or firmly enough to take the necessary action " to stop the problem , which involved abuse by priests and catholic teachers in ireland , germany , and a number of other countries around europe .
while in london , benedict was expected to meet a group of 10 victims of abuse , either on friday or saturday .

the pontiff also met queen elizabeth ii while in edinburgh : " i am delighted to welcome you to the uk and particularly to scotland on your first visit as pope , " the queen said .
this is the first papal visit to the uk to be classified as a state visit , because it was elizabeth ii who invited the pontiff , not the church .
benedict xvi and the queen focused on the positive aspects of relations between predominantly anglican britain and the roman catholic church , two bodies which the queen said shared " a common christian heritage . "
on sunday , benedict will travel to the central english city of birmingham for the final day of his visit , where he will preside over the beatification of a 19th century cardinal , john henry newman .

while the united nations enjoys a high degree of respect when it comes to international debate , it suffers under its inability to take quick action in an emergency . " we 've just been through a small revolution that 's been overlooked by a lot of people : we 've seen the shift from a world economy organized by the g-8 to a g-20-organized global governance , which includes several emerging and developing nations that until now did not take part in the global development and political processes , " messner said . path to balanced agreements he added that having more countries at the table deciding on global issues would increase the likelihood that developing nations ' concerns are heard and that an agreement that balances the interests of the industrialized and developing world can be made . germany has shown itself to be interested in a finding a way to balance international interests , according to juergen zattler , the head of the german ministry for economic cooperation and development 's department for european and multinational development policy .

" civil groups and non-government organizations have a right to take part in discussions at the united nations , " he said .
" in other bodies , such as the g-20 , this is not the case .
it 's an exclusive club of governments that meets behind closed doors .

" the more parties take part the harder it gets - that 's democracy , " he said .
" but it 's worth the effort to make truly representative decisions and to take into account the interests of the groups that otherwise do n't have a say .

russia , which had issued the warrant for zakayev , had a close eye on whether poland would arrest him . polish police said friday they had arrested akhmed zakayev , a leading chechen separatist in exile , who is wanted by russia for alleged terrorism . police spokesman mriusz sokolowski said poland was responding to an international arrest warrant and had no option but to detain him . " he was arrested by plainclothes police as he was leaving a building , " sokolowski told tvn24 television . " because there was an international arrest warrant , police were under an obligation to detain him and to take him to prosecutors . "
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov expressed confidence earlier on thursday that poland would arrest and extradite zakayev .
" we drew the attention of our polish partners to this problem .
they took our appeal seriously , " he said .
poland has welcomed chechens zakayev arrived in poland on thursday to attend the two-day world chechen congress , a gathering of exiles from the conflict-torn region .
in poland , zakayev spoke about his nation 's role in reminding the world about the importance of human rights .
" i would like to express my deepest conviction that it is impossible to achieve real freedom and defend the rights of individuals when the rights and freedoms of whole nations are violated , " he said .
" the events of the past decade in the chechen republic have served as a test for all human rights activists and human rights organizations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechnya still bears the scars of war while the violence continues since his war years , zakayev has come to represent a moderate wing of the separatist movement .
russia is still fighting against an islamist insurgency in the caucasus in chechnya and in neighboring dagestan and ingushetia .
poland has become the prime destination for refugees fleeing the violence in chechnya over the last two decades .
successive polish governments have declared their solidarity with the people of the caucasus and in the 1990s poland opened the first official chechen information center in europe .
more recently , the late polish president lech kaczynski went out of his way to show support for georgia in its disputes with russia by making controversial trips to war-torn regions .
inconvenient timing zakayev 's visit - and the ensuing pressure from russia - comes at a sensitive time for poland . it was lech kaczynski 's death in a plane crash in russia earlier this year that began to thaw the traditionally chilly relationship between warsaw and moscow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many chechen refugees have ended up in poland , but some have found life difficult there asked whether the world chechen congress could affect poland 's relations with russia , prime minister donald tusk said that , without compromising its ideals , his cabinet will also look after polish interests .
but those taking part in the world chechen congress also have more practical problems on their minds .
as muslims , they are culturally alienated in roman catholic poland .
thousands are suspended in limbo - with no jobs , no available housing and no prospect of moving on to another eu country .

friday , september 18 frankfurt-freiburg freiburg have looked much better this year than last and have shown they can win away .
but after a sputtering start , frankfurt got back on track last week and have enough drive going forward to exploit their opponents ' weakness at the back .

with bayern perhaps having tired legs from the champions league , cologne 's plan has a chance of working .
but something tells me thomas mueller has found his rhythm again , and as he showed on wedsnesday , he can manufacture goals from nothing .
prediction : bayern 2-0 werder bremen-mainz this is just the sort of match profligate bremen often lose , and what 's not to like about this year 's plucky , well-organized mainz squad ?
unfortunately for the latter , though , i think the now-confirmed news that wunderkind andre schuerrle is headed to leverkusen next season will prove to be a distraction .

stuttgart have been a mess this season , especially on defense , and are coming off only two days rest .
gladbach have been up and down but have already tripped up one big club at home .
methinks they split the points .
prediction : 1-1 draw wolfsburg-hanover there 's one team here still looking for its first points , and it 's not hanover .
the 96ers are undefeated , and their two wins , while close , have been deserved .
for the wolves , who are miles ahead talent-wise , this will be a test of whether they have faith in new coach steve mcclaren .

another man was arrested about eight hours later .
the police said officers had been searching two businesses and eight homes in the capital since the arrests , but had found no weapons or dangerous materials .
media reports suggested the arrests were likely linked to the papal visit , an issue on which the police would not comment .
the presence of pope benedict xvi in london meant that the british capital was already on high alert before friday 's raids .
" we 're totally calm , the pope is happy , " vatican spokesman federico lombardi said when reporters told him about the arrests .
" we can say that we 're totally confident in the work of the police . "
papal schedule unchanged the pope attended a service at london 's westminster abbey on friday led by archbishop of canterbury rowan williams , the leader of the world 's anglican church .
the two church leaders then met at lambeth palace , the anglican archbishop 's london residence , for historic talks : no pontiff had visited lambeth palace or visited the historic abbey since the foundation of the church of england when king henry viii broke with rome in 1534 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some object to benedict 's handling of the sex scandal benedict also delivered a speech at westminster hall - the historic heart of the houses of parliament - and addressed some 3,000 young catholics at an event in southwest london .
anti-church protests continue the run-up to the visit was clouded by criticism of the catholic church 's handling of a child abuse scandal and a furore over the trip 's cost : 20 million gbp -lrb- 37 million euros -rrb- .
there were protests before benedict 's engagement with young people in twickenham on friday , in the southwest of the british capital , with around 20 demonstrators waving banners with slogans saying , " there is no god - get over it ! " or " the pope is wrong , put a condom on ! "
on his flight to britain , benedict made some of his strongest comments yet on the paedophilia controversy , saying revelations of child abuse by priests that have rocked the catholic church " were a shock to me . "
he added that " the authorities in the church have not been vigilant enough . "
the church " did not act quickly or firmly enough to take the necessary action " to stop the problem , which involved abuse by priests and catholic teachers in ireland , germany , and a number of other countries around europe .
while in london , benedict was expected to meet a group of 10 victims of abuse , either on friday or saturday .
first pope to make ' state visit ' to england on the first day of the pope 's visit , he warned of the risk of " aggressive secularism " in britain and greeted tens of thousands of people at a mass in glasgow and on the streets of edinburgh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen cordially invited the pope to britain herself " the united kingdom strives to be a modern and multicultural society , " benedict xvi said .
" in this challenging enterprise , may it always maintain its respect for those traditional values and cultural expressions that more aggressive forms of secularism no longer value or even tolerate . "
the pontiff also met queen elizabeth ii while in edinburgh : " i am delighted to welcome you to the uk and particularly to scotland on your first visit as pope , " the queen said .
this is the first papal visit to the uk to be classified as a state visit , because it was elizabeth ii who invited the pontiff , not the church .
benedict xvi and the queen focused on the positive aspects of relations between predominantly anglican britain and the roman catholic church , two bodies which the queen said shared " a common christian heritage . "
on sunday , benedict will travel to the central english city of birmingham for the final day of his visit , where he will preside over the beatification of a 19th century cardinal , john henry newman .

another man was arrested about eight hours later .
the police said officers had been searching two businesses and eight homes in the capital since the arrests , but had found no weapons or dangerous materials .
media reports suggested the arrests were likely linked to the papal visit , an issue on which the police would not comment .
the presence of pope benedict xvi in london meant that the british capital was already on high alert before friday 's raids .
" we 're totally calm , the pope is happy , " vatican spokesman federico lombardi said when reporters told him about the arrests .
" we can say that we 're totally confident in the work of the police . "
papal schedule unchanged the pope attended a service at london 's westminster abbey on friday led by archbishop of canterbury rowan williams , the leader of the world 's anglican church .
the two church leaders then met at lambeth palace , the anglican archbishop 's london residence , for historic talks : no pontiff had visited lambeth palace or visited the historic abbey since the foundation of the church of england when king henry viii broke with rome in 1534 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some object to benedict 's handling of the sex scandal benedict also delivered a speech at westminster hall - the historic heart of the houses of parliament - and addressed some 3,000 young catholics at an event in southwest london .
anti-church protests continue the run-up to the visit was clouded by criticism of the catholic church 's handling of a child abuse scandal and a furore over the trip 's cost : 20 million gbp -lrb- 37 million euros -rrb- .
there were protests before benedict 's engagement with young people in twickenham on friday , in the southwest of the british capital , with around 20 demonstrators waving banners with slogans saying , " there is no god - get over it ! " or " the pope is wrong , put a condom on ! "
on his flight to britain , benedict made some of his strongest comments yet on the paedophilia controversy , saying revelations of child abuse by priests that have rocked the catholic church " were a shock to me . "
he added that " the authorities in the church have not been vigilant enough . "
the church " did not act quickly or firmly enough to take the necessary action " to stop the problem , which involved abuse by priests and catholic teachers in ireland , germany , and a number of other countries around europe .
while in london , benedict was expected to meet a group of 10 victims of abuse , either on friday or saturday .
first pope to make ' state visit ' to england on the first day of the pope 's visit , he warned of the risk of " aggressive secularism " in britain and greeted tens of thousands of people at a mass in glasgow and on the streets of edinburgh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen cordially invited the pope to britain herself " the united kingdom strives to be a modern and multicultural society , " benedict xvi said .
" in this challenging enterprise , may it always maintain its respect for those traditional values and cultural expressions that more aggressive forms of secularism no longer value or even tolerate . "
the pontiff also met queen elizabeth ii while in edinburgh : " i am delighted to welcome you to the uk and particularly to scotland on your first visit as pope , " the queen said .
this is the first papal visit to the uk to be classified as a state visit , because it was elizabeth ii who invited the pontiff , not the church .
benedict xvi and the queen focused on the positive aspects of relations between predominantly anglican britain and the roman catholic church , two bodies which the queen said shared " a common christian heritage . "
on sunday , benedict will travel to the central english city of birmingham for the final day of his visit , where he will preside over the beatification of a 19th century cardinal , john henry newman .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 17.09.2010 six arrested in pope security scare in london großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict is on the first papal ' state visit ' to britain british police say they have arrested six terror suspects in central london , amid speculation that the arrests could be linked to the visit of pope benedict xvi , who is in the british capital on day two of his trip . london police confirmed that they arrested five men , suspected of preparing a terrorist attack , in an early morning raid on friday .
another man was arrested about eight hours later .
the police said officers had been searching two businesses and eight homes in the capital since the arrests , but had found no weapons or dangerous materials .
media reports suggested the arrests were likely linked to the papal visit , an issue on which the police would not comment .
the presence of pope benedict xvi in london meant that the british capital was already on high alert before friday 's raids .
" we 're totally calm , the pope is happy , " vatican spokesman federico lombardi said when reporters told him about the arrests .
" we can say that we 're totally confident in the work of the police . "
papal schedule unchanged the pope attended a service at london 's westminster abbey on friday led by archbishop of canterbury rowan williams , the leader of the world 's anglican church .
the two church leaders then met at lambeth palace , the anglican archbishop 's london residence , for historic talks : no pontiff had visited lambeth palace or visited the historic abbey since the foundation of the church of england when king henry viii broke with rome in 1534 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some object to benedict 's handling of the sex scandal benedict also delivered a speech at westminster hall - the historic heart of the houses of parliament - and addressed some 3,000 young catholics at an event in southwest london .
anti-church protests continue the run-up to the visit was clouded by criticism of the catholic church 's handling of a child abuse scandal and a furore over the trip 's cost : 20 million gbp -lrb- 37 million euros -rrb- .
there were protests before benedict 's engagement with young people in twickenham on friday , in the southwest of the british capital , with around 20 demonstrators waving banners with slogans saying , " there is no god - get over it ! " or " the pope is wrong , put a condom on ! "
on his flight to britain , benedict made some of his strongest comments yet on the paedophilia controversy , saying revelations of child abuse by priests that have rocked the catholic church " were a shock to me . "
he added that " the authorities in the church have not been vigilant enough . "
the church " did not act quickly or firmly enough to take the necessary action " to stop the problem , which involved abuse by priests and catholic teachers in ireland , germany , and a number of other countries around europe .
while in london , benedict was expected to meet a group of 10 victims of abuse , either on friday or saturday .
first pope to make ' state visit ' to england on the first day of the pope 's visit , he warned of the risk of " aggressive secularism " in britain and greeted tens of thousands of people at a mass in glasgow and on the streets of edinburgh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen cordially invited the pope to britain herself " the united kingdom strives to be a modern and multicultural society , " benedict xvi said .
" in this challenging enterprise , may it always maintain its respect for those traditional values and cultural expressions that more aggressive forms of secularism no longer value or even tolerate . "
the pontiff also met queen elizabeth ii while in edinburgh : " i am delighted to welcome you to the uk and particularly to scotland on your first visit as pope , " the queen said .
this is the first papal visit to the uk to be classified as a state visit , because it was elizabeth ii who invited the pontiff , not the church .
benedict xvi and the queen focused on the positive aspects of relations between predominantly anglican britain and the roman catholic church , two bodies which the queen said shared " a common christian heritage . "
on sunday , benedict will travel to the central english city of birmingham for the final day of his visit , where he will preside over the beatification of a 19th century cardinal , john henry newman .

cheers !
with oktoberfest about to kick off in munich , we asked our facebook users about their oktoberfest experiences , the good and the bad .
here 's a selection of their comments . have you ever been to oktoberfest ?
ha , i never went to oktoberfest while i was living in germany .
i am a born and bred berliner .
that explains it i guess .
however , i 've been to numerous oktoberfests in new zealand .
they are put on each year by the new zealand german business association in auckland and they rock , i mean ooompah !
so much fun - this year 's is on this friday . - anja yes !
and it was very memorable .
i went in munich for the 2000 oktoberfest !
we arrived very early and picked a tent and it was packed !
we squeezed in with a table and started drinking , and soon everyone was talking , dancing and singing and they locked the doors .
later , some star guests arrived ; some soccer players and a man with a dog , and the crowd went wild .
i still have the little woven heart trinket i bought . - laura yes .
when i was a student of goethe institut hong kong , i attended the oktoberfest party at the open car park of the marco polo hotel .
the marco polo oktoberfest is now very famous in hong kong .
it 's all about german food , beer , dancing and a swiss band .
but after all the years , it is still unchanged .
i 'll attend too this year , and see if the swiss band will still sing the same songs and play the same games .
but no change could be nice , because it 's a good atmosphere and memories every time . - paskol yeah , i went with my colleagues when i lived in germany last year .
we spent a long time walking around as there were no places to sit but it was a great atmosphere .
in the end we learned that it 's better to book in advance so we sat at odeonsplatz instead and had some beers . - hannah when i was stationed as a soldier in offenbach / main in 1958 , i made friends with a young german and we decided at the last minute to go to the oktoberfest on his motorcycle .
once there we hunted and hunted for a place to spend the night but everything was booked .
we ended up sleeping on big oil cans at a gas station .
had a great time though . - bill yes .
i was there last year with five friends in the second weekend .
it was wonderful and the weather was very good .
we do n't remember the number of beer mugs we drank , but we had a good time .
i suppose we will remember that weekend until our last minute in this world . - francisco horrible experience .
everybody was drunk and the whole thing was pretty boring ...
i prefer cologne 's carnival .
everyone 's drunk there as well , but at least it 's fun : they sing and dress up . - maria-lujan last year i was at the oktoberfest together with other students studying german at the goethe institut in schwaebisch hall .
a camera crew from the deutsche welle team filmed us while we experienced the oktoberfest for the first time .
it was such a fun and amazing experience !
i ended up going back to the wiesn four more times that year and each time i met interesting and fun people .
one of the things i liked best about the oktoberfest is how easy it is to meet people sitting near you and to strike up a conversation with them .
i also especially enjoyed standing on the benches , drinking lots of beer , and singing crazy german songs ! - benjamin compiled by stuart tiffen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when addressing issues of worldwide significance many nations need to be at the table , experts say . the united nations millennium development goals -lrb- mdg -rrb- include pledges to wipe out extreme poverty , achieve universal primary education , promote gender equality , reduce rates of child mortality , fight epidemic diseases , and develop a global partnership for development . the international nature of these global goals leaves individual nations struggling for effective solutions that transcend their borders .
that 's where " global governance " comes in .
it works to create international structures capable of dealing with issues of global significance , and the closer the mdgs come to their deadline of 2015 the clearer multinational cooperation becomes . states ' changing role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power structures are shifting from single states to larger organizations , like the g-20 " the old idea was that nation states need to be as independent as possible to be responsible to their own population , " said dirk messner , director of the german development institute .
" it 's now become clear that we are dealing with global interdependencies and that we have to politically organize them . " such organization is crucial for shared resources such as the climate , the food supply and energy , messner added .
while the united nations enjoys a high degree of respect when it comes to international debate , it suffers under its inability to take quick action in an emergency . " we 've just been through a small revolution that 's been overlooked by a lot of people : we 've seen the shift from a world economy organized by the g-8 to a g-20-organized global governance , which includes several emerging and developing nations that until now did not take part in the global development and political processes , " messner said . path to balanced agreements he added that having more countries at the table deciding on global issues would increase the likelihood that developing nations ' concerns are heard and that an agreement that balances the interests of the industrialized and developing world can be made . germany has shown itself to be interested in a finding a way to balance international interests , according to juergen zattler , the head of the german ministry for economic cooperation and development 's department for european and multinational development policy . " we hope that once the global governance structure is in place we can talk about a variety of topics , " he said .
" that members of the international community get closer together and more capable of taking action and that global deals can be made . " ngos out in the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un may represent a better place to make multilateral decisions while zattler said giving more influence to the g-20 would be a promising step toward successful multinational negotiation on the mdgs and climate change , a shift toward a g-20 dominated landscape still leaves civil non-national organizations in the cold , according to jens martens of the global policy forum europe . " civil groups and non-government organizations have a right to take part in discussions at the united nations , " he said .
" in other bodies , such as the g-20 , this is not the case .
it 's an exclusive club of governments that meets behind closed doors . " instead of creating new organizations designed to quicken decision making by circumventing the un , martens said the world body deserved strengthening - despite its cumbersome nature . " the more parties take part the harder it gets - that 's democracy , " he said .
" but it 's worth the effort to make truly representative decisions and to take into account the interests of the groups that otherwise do n't have a say .
in terms of the millennium goals it 's the interests of the world 's poorest people . " author : heiner kiesel -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the center will be a new way to help computer users escape botnets - groups of malware-infected computers that can be controlled and exploited by a remote third party .
" the main goal is to remove germany from the top 10 ranking of countries from which botnet activities originate , " according to a document about the project published late last year on the organization for economic cooperation and development 's website .
when expanded successfully , botnets can comprise thousands or millions of so-called zombie computers that are under the control of an attacker .
they can be used for infecting further computers , sending spam , conducting criminal activity and launching cyber-attacks .
generally speaking , botnets only affect computers with the microsoft windows operating system .
linux and mac os computers are rarely infected .
according to industry statistics , every seventh german computer connected to the internet is currently part of a botnet , with its user often unaware of the situation .
thomas de maiziere , germany 's interior minister , in a statement , described the problem as " the greatest current danger for the internet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center will have a budget of two million euros annually various types of assistance the anti-botnet beratungszentrum offers help via email or by phone .
the center 's website , www.botfrei.de , contains instructions on how to free an affected computer from a botnet , as well as useful software .
the 2 million euro project is financially supported by the federal ministry of the interior and technically by the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- .
several internet providers , such as deutsche telekom , are also involved .
in the future , the participating internet providers will automatically notify their clients by email or post if their computers are infected with malware .
de maziere is encouraging non-participating providers to join the project , but he also emphasizes that affected internet users need to “ take their share of responsibility ” and take advantage of the assistance offered by the help center .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center will have a budget of two million euros annually various types of assistance the anti-botnet beratungszentrum offers help via email or by phone .
the center 's website , www.botfrei.de , contains instructions on how to free an affected computer from a botnet , as well as useful software .
the 2 million euro project is financially supported by the federal ministry of the interior and technically by the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- .
several internet providers , such as deutsche telekom , are also involved .
in the future , the participating internet providers will automatically notify their clients by email or post if their computers are infected with malware .
de maziere is encouraging non-participating providers to join the project , but he also emphasizes that affected internet users need to “ take their share of responsibility ” and take advantage of the assistance offered by the help center .

the move could pressure german carmakers to ramp up mass production of their own electric vehicles . rwe and china 's byd have teamed to bring electrical cars to germany , beginning with a trial fleet in 2011 .
a mass rollout in germany and several other european markets is planned the following year .
the deal with the chinese company , a battery specialist that has since expanded into car manufacturing , follows a string of agreements with other manufacturers , including france 's renault , japan 's nissan and daimler .
the centrepiece of the agreement is a package deal for electric car enthusiasts , consisting of byd 's electric vehicles and rwe 's fast-charging posts and electricity supplied exclusively from renewable sources .
two models will be initially available and targeted primarily at consumers in cities driving shorter distances .
already on the market the one model is a plug-in hybrid car that combines new electric and conventional internal combustion systems .
on the market in china since early this year , it has a range of between 60 and 100 kilometers when running only on electricity .
the other newer model will be a purely electric vehicle with a battery range of about 300 kilometers and an acceleration of 0 to 100 kilometers per hour within 10 seconds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe plans to charge electric cars with electricity from rewewable energy sources the package will include a fast-charging device from rwe , access to the company 's expanding network of public charging points – now at around 450 – and electricity generated by wind and solar systems .
rwe spokesman peter hoscheidt told deutsche welle that no decision has yet been reached on whether the cars and charging unit can be leased in addition to being purchased or both and what the prices will be .
but he said both options will be likely and prices will be attractive to garner attention .
in berlin , the german energy company is already collaborating with daimler in a field trial .
they 're testing smart cars powered by lithium-ion batteries , which can be charged at home and public supply points .
the collaboration is one of several electric car initiatives running under the german government 's e-mobility program .
seeking standardization through their collaboration , rwe and byd also hope to contribute to standardization efforts in the nascent electric car industry .
standardized components are crucial to kick start mass production .
but the standardization process of a new technology , like electrically powered cars , is often accompanied by power struggles between groups seeking recognition of their own systems as standards in order to collect royalty fees down the road .
bildunterschrift : rwe sees the day coming when " fill it up " is replaced by " charge it up " why the cooperation with a chinese manufacturer now ?
because the chinese , hoscheidt said , promise mass production by 2012 , thus ensuring a sufficient supply of competitively priced vehicles .
" this is by no means an exclusive agreement , " he said .
" we 're seeking partners to push electric cars .
the sooner they can deliver , the better . "
coveted battery technolgy earlier this year , byd and daimler signed an agreement to develop and build electric cars for the chinese market .
the cars will be sold under a jointly owned brand .
daimler plans to take advantage of byd 's battery technology to help boost chinese sales .
byd is china 's sixth-biggest car manufacturer by sales last year .
american billionaire warren buffet owns 10 percent of the company .
but ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a professor at the university of duisburg-essen and an expert on the german auto industry warns about expecting too much too soon from chinese car makers .
" let 's see what comes , " he told deutsche welle .
" we 've seen a few chinese manufacturers come to europe , and they 've failed . "
byd 's car sales have been dropping noticeably in its home market , according to dudenhoeffer .
" there 's plenty of demand in china but other cars are apparently in greater demand , " he said .
nevertheless , dudenhoeffer welcomes the latest attempt to push electric cars in germany .
" there 's a lot more happening in a number of countries like france , " he said , pointing to financial incentives .
" in germany , there 's still just a lot of hot air . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 17.09.2010 german government plays down roma ' misunderstanding ' with france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's statements left many germans scratching their heads politicians in berlin have said the mixed messages on roma deportations from nicolas sarkozy and berlin are not a ' strain ' on franco-german relations .
meanwhile , roma leaders in germany say camps are n't an issue here . it was n't really french president nicolas sarkozy 's dismantling of roma camps and large-scale deportations that caused controversy in germany , nor was it his " lively " confrontation with european commission president jose manuel barroso on the issue , it was his assertion that german chancellor angela merkel was planning to introduce a similar policy .
" mrs. merkel told me that germany also intends to start clearing out camps in the coming weeks , " sarkozy told reporters in brussels on thursday evening .
the chancellor 's office in berlin and foreign minister guido westerwelle both swiftly refuted sarkozy 's claims , with westerwelle saying that such a policy " would run contrary to the german constitution . "
however , german leaders are also playing down the significance of this " misunderstanding , " saying the confusion will not hurt germany and france 's cooperation bilaterally , or within the eu .
" you should not over-interpret this as a strain on franco-german relations , " government spokesman steffen seibert said in berlin on friday .
" no camps " in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose says germany and france both discriminate , but to different extents roma leaders in germany said they were confused by sarkozy 's statement , given that most german-based roma are more integrated into society and are less likely to live in makeshift camps .
" for me , it 's very clear that -lrb- german chancellor angela merkel -rrb- said nothing of this nature , primarily because there are n't any camps here in germany - or , at least , none of which i am aware , " the head of the central council for german sinti and roma , romani rose , told the mdr german public broadcaster on friday .
" so , to me , the chancellor 's denial seems entirely credible . "
" sinti and roma live normally like the rest of the population ; they are workers , employees , academics and artists , they 're members of sporting clubs , and , very often , people do n't even know they 're part of an ethnic minority . "
rose said that discrimination remained a major issue in germany , but usually on an individual level .
he referred to a recent survey carried out by the council in which over 80 percent of respondents said they had encountered some form of discrimination in their day-to-day lives .
sinti and roma can encounter discrimination when looking for a job or a flat , in individual legal disputes , and even in their local pub , he explained .
" but none of this is comparable with this sweeping , criminalizing campaign being carried out by the upper echelons of the french government , including the president , " rose said .
" these policies have caused great concern amongst our people here in germany , and all over europe . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose says germany has no camps like this one in a paris suburb if germany has a policy comparable to the french mass deportations , it would be the contentious decision to gradually send some 12,000 former refugees , many of whom are roma , back to their home country of kosovo now that germany deems the situation there stable .
unlike romania and bulgaria , where most french-based roma are being sent , kosovo is not a member of the european union , meaning the issue does not fall within the jurisdiction of the eu commission , france 's most high-profile critic on this issue to date .
rose said he strongly opposed the german policy to repatriate sinti and roma , among others , to kosovo , arguing that april 's decision to begin this process was premature and that the government in pristina was not yet ready to uphold the rights of formerly displaced people .
" it 's still irresponsible to send these people back to kosovo now , " he said .
" the un 's refugee representative in berlin has said that the security situation for roma in kosovo is not yet satisfactory , international human rights groups like amnesty international have said the same thing , as has the central council for german sinti and roma . "
but rose also said that the german government was handling the roughly 12,000 cases differently to france , describing each decision as an " individual example " , whereas france was carrying out a deportation policy " en masse . "

when addressing issues of worldwide significance many nations need to be at the table , experts say . the united nations millennium development goals -lrb- mdg -rrb- include pledges to wipe out extreme poverty , achieve universal primary education , promote gender equality , reduce rates of child mortality , fight epidemic diseases , and develop a global partnership for development . the international nature of these global goals leaves individual nations struggling for effective solutions that transcend their borders .
that 's where " global governance " comes in .
it works to create international structures capable of dealing with issues of global significance , and the closer the mdgs come to their deadline of 2015 the clearer multinational cooperation becomes . states ' changing role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power structures are shifting from single states to larger organizations , like the g-20 " the old idea was that nation states need to be as independent as possible to be responsible to their own population , " said dirk messner , director of the german development institute .
" it 's now become clear that we are dealing with global interdependencies and that we have to politically organize them . " such organization is crucial for shared resources such as the climate , the food supply and energy , messner added .
while the united nations enjoys a high degree of respect when it comes to international debate , it suffers under its inability to take quick action in an emergency . " we 've just been through a small revolution that 's been overlooked by a lot of people : we 've seen the shift from a world economy organized by the g-8 to a g-20-organized global governance , which includes several emerging and developing nations that until now did not take part in the global development and political processes , " messner said . path to balanced agreements he added that having more countries at the table deciding on global issues would increase the likelihood that developing nations ' concerns are heard and that an agreement that balances the interests of the industrialized and developing world can be made . germany has shown itself to be interested in a finding a way to balance international interests , according to juergen zattler , the head of the german ministry for economic cooperation and development 's department for european and multinational development policy . " we hope that once the global governance structure is in place we can talk about a variety of topics , " he said .
" that members of the international community get closer together and more capable of taking action and that global deals can be made . " ngos out in the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un may represent a better place to make multilateral decisions while zattler said giving more influence to the g-20 would be a promising step toward successful multinational negotiation on the mdgs and climate change , a shift toward a g-20 dominated landscape still leaves civil non-national organizations in the cold , according to jens martens of the global policy forum europe . " civil groups and non-government organizations have a right to take part in discussions at the united nations , " he said .
" in other bodies , such as the g-20 , this is not the case .
it 's an exclusive club of governments that meets behind closed doors . " instead of creating new organizations designed to quicken decision making by circumventing the un , martens said the world body deserved strengthening - despite its cumbersome nature . " the more parties take part the harder it gets - that 's democracy , " he said .
" but it 's worth the effort to make truly representative decisions and to take into account the interests of the groups that otherwise do n't have a say .
in terms of the millennium goals it 's the interests of the world 's poorest people . " author : heiner kiesel -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 17.09.2010 dw pundits seek redemption in bundesliga week four picks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crystal balls and tarot having failed us , we 'll give tea leaves a go this season , the dw sports team are predicting the results of all bundesliga matches .
after a bumpy first three rounds , they 'll try to get it together this week . match day four in the bundesliga is upon us , and dw 's team of football freaks are plotting their comeback ... or hoping that when it comes to picks , it 's a case of four is fantastic .
the prediction squad has taken a hit from all the upsets thus far -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but still we rise .
friday , september 18 frankfurt-freiburg freiburg have looked much better this year than last and have shown they can win away .
but after a sputtering start , frankfurt got back on track last week and have enough drive going forward to exploit their opponents ' weakness at the back .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 saturday , september 18 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne will hope to see this mueller - not the celebratory one bayern munich-cologne no secret about the billy goats ' strategy here – pack it in in their own half , frustrate franck ribery and hope for a draw .
with bayern perhaps having tired legs from the champions league , cologne 's plan has a chance of working .
but something tells me thomas mueller has found his rhythm again , and as he showed on wedsnesday , he can manufacture goals from nothing .
prediction : bayern 2-0 werder bremen-mainz this is just the sort of match profligate bremen often lose , and what 's not to like about this year 's plucky , well-organized mainz squad ?
unfortunately for the latter , though , i think the now-confirmed news that wunderkind andre schuerrle is headed to leverkusen next season will prove to be a distraction .
prediction : bremen 3-1 stuttgart-moenchengladbach this is a case of the underachieving taking on the unpredictable .
stuttgart have been a mess this season , especially on defense , and are coming off only two days rest .
gladbach have been up and down but have already tripped up one big club at home .
methinks they split the points .
prediction : 1-1 draw wolfsburg-hanover there 's one team here still looking for its first points , and it 's not hanover .
the 96ers are undefeated , and their two wins , while close , have been deserved .
for the wolves , who are miles ahead talent-wise , this will be a test of whether they have faith in new coach steve mcclaren .
i think the result will be indecisive .
prediction : 2-2 draw .
kaiserslautern-hoffenheim as bayern found out two weeks ago , never underestimate lautern 's home field advantage .
but i like what i 've seen from hoffenheim this season .
they 're more disciplined than in the past and look like they 're on a mission to prove the doubters wrong .
and they simply have too much attacking firepower for the red devils .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 sunday , september 19 st. pauli-hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. pauli fans will hope their outlaw act intimidates their city rivals of the true city derbies in german football , this one is the best .
on paper , pauli are completely overmatched against hamburg .
but that 's on paper .
taking to the field in millerntor stadium with ac / dc 's hell 's bells ringing in your ears is something that can impress even the likes of ruud van nistelrooy .
and somewhere within all that ringing i hear the sound of an upset .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 dortmund-schalke could things get any worse for schalke ?
they 're on a bad losing streak , and now they get a visit their bitterest rivals , who are off to a good start .
but i 'm not writing off schalke just yet , and i think two extra days rest will help them sneak a point .
prediction : 1-1 draw leverkusen-nuremberg leverkusen have lived up to their reputation as one of the bundesliga 's least consistent teams and will have thursday 's europa cup match weighing down their legs .
but i think nuremberg will be thrown off by the loss of their best striker , albert bunjaku , to injury for the rest of the year .
prediction : leverkusen 3-0 last week 's result : 6 points hoffenheim – schalke 2:0 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- dortmund - wolfsburg 2:0 -lrb- dw prediction 2:0 , three points -rrb- hamburg - nuremberg 1:1 -lrb- dw prediction 3:1 , no points -rrb- gladbach - frankfurt 0:4 -lrb- dw prediction 2:1 , no points -rrb- freiburg - stuttgart 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 1:3 , no points -rrb- hanover - leverkusen 2:2 -lrb- dw prediction 2:3 , no points -rrb- bayern munich - bremen 0:0 -lrb- dw prediction 4:2 , no points -rrb- mainz - kaiserlautern 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 2:1 , three points -rrb- cologne - st. pauli 1:0 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- total for the season : 15 three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : jefferson chase editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9799 dw-tv europe live tomorrow today - the science magazine we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

cheers !
with oktoberfest about to kick off in munich , we asked our facebook users about their oktoberfest experiences , the good and the bad .
here 's a selection of their comments . have you ever been to oktoberfest ?
ha , i never went to oktoberfest while i was living in germany .
i am a born and bred berliner .
that explains it i guess .
however , i 've been to numerous oktoberfests in new zealand .
they are put on each year by the new zealand german business association in auckland and they rock , i mean ooompah !
so much fun - this year 's is on this friday . - anja yes !
and it was very memorable .
i went in munich for the 2000 oktoberfest !
we arrived very early and picked a tent and it was packed !
we squeezed in with a table and started drinking , and soon everyone was talking , dancing and singing and they locked the doors .
later , some star guests arrived ; some soccer players and a man with a dog , and the crowd went wild .
i still have the little woven heart trinket i bought . - laura yes .
when i was a student of goethe institut hong kong , i attended the oktoberfest party at the open car park of the marco polo hotel .
the marco polo oktoberfest is now very famous in hong kong .
it 's all about german food , beer , dancing and a swiss band .
but after all the years , it is still unchanged .
i 'll attend too this year , and see if the swiss band will still sing the same songs and play the same games .
but no change could be nice , because it 's a good atmosphere and memories every time . - paskol yeah , i went with my colleagues when i lived in germany last year .
we spent a long time walking around as there were no places to sit but it was a great atmosphere .
in the end we learned that it 's better to book in advance so we sat at odeonsplatz instead and had some beers . - hannah when i was stationed as a soldier in offenbach / main in 1958 , i made friends with a young german and we decided at the last minute to go to the oktoberfest on his motorcycle .
once there we hunted and hunted for a place to spend the night but everything was booked .
we ended up sleeping on big oil cans at a gas station .
had a great time though . - bill yes .
i was there last year with five friends in the second weekend .
it was wonderful and the weather was very good .
we do n't remember the number of beer mugs we drank , but we had a good time .
i suppose we will remember that weekend until our last minute in this world . - francisco horrible experience .
everybody was drunk and the whole thing was pretty boring ...
i prefer cologne 's carnival .
everyone 's drunk there as well , but at least it 's fun : they sing and dress up . - maria-lujan last year i was at the oktoberfest together with other students studying german at the goethe institut in schwaebisch hall .
a camera crew from the deutsche welle team filmed us while we experienced the oktoberfest for the first time .
it was such a fun and amazing experience !
i ended up going back to the wiesn four more times that year and each time i met interesting and fun people .
one of the things i liked best about the oktoberfest is how easy it is to meet people sitting near you and to strike up a conversation with them .
i also especially enjoyed standing on the benches , drinking lots of beer , and singing crazy german songs ! - benjamin compiled by stuart tiffen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i also especially enjoyed standing on the benches , drinking lots of beer , and singing crazy german songs ! - benjamin compiled by stuart tiffen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 17.09.2010 germany 's forgotten performer valeska gert helped inspire punks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always a non-conformist , gert broke new ground in music and performance more than 30 years after her death , admirers pay tribute to one of germany 's most enigmatic - and overlooked - artists , dancer and actress valeska gert .
she 's said to have laid the foundations for the punk movement . " i saw her on television in 1977 when she was 86 and i thought , she has short hair , a colorful dress , she 's tough and living in the present , she 's a real punk because she does n't care about her image , " said artist and musician wolfgang mueller at the opening night of a new exhibition dedicated to valeska gert . the show in berlin 's hamburger bahnhof coincides with the launch of a mueller 's new biography on the performer .
" when she died in 1978 people took care of her letters and found correspondence from punks who said , we would like to know you and to meet you , " he said . indeed , valeska gert 's appearance on a tv talk show in the late 1970 's re-ignited interest in one of germany 's most enigmatic artistic figures .
her acceptance , at the age of 86 , by the burgeoning punk movement is as much a testament to her brash , no-nonsense energy as it is to her artistic achievements .
since then she has remained a marginal curio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this self-designed costume , pictured in 1931 , foreshadows 60 's fashions gert was born gertrud valesca samosch to a jewish family in berlin in 1892 .
showing no interest in academia , gert began taking dance lessons at the age of nine , and by 1915 was studying acting with alexander moissi .
her leanings toward the performing arts , combined with the detrimental effects of world war i on her father 's finances , led her to seek employment and she soon made appearances at the munich kammerspiele , the deutsches theater and the berliner tribuene . radical experiments on stage as the 1920 's progressed , she also began appearing in silent cinema , performing in " the threepenny opera , " " diary of a lost girl " with iconic flapper louise brooks , and g. w. pabst 's " joyless street . " it was around this time that gert unveiled one of her most enduring performance works .
entitled " pause , " it was an interpretative anti-dance performed between reels in cinemas , designed to draw attention to stillness and serenity . " it was so radical just to go on stage in the cinema stand there and do nothing , " said wolfgang mueller , " she did this in the 20 's where the convention was speed , business , activity and you see this in the films of the 20 's : big cities , traffic , nervosity .
to go out there and do the complete opposite was very , very modern . " by 1933 , with the nazis in power , gert suffered a ban from the german stage due to her jewish heritage .
she moved to london where she continued to perform on stage and appeared in the experimental short film " pett and pot " directed by alberto cavalcanti .
it would be her last film work until her triumphant return to the cinema in the mid-1960 's . trend setting with ' freedom from taste ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare 1969 recording of baby is screened at the pause exhibition by 1938 , in her late 40 's and living in new york but , gert found it virtually impossible to revive her previous career .
she lived on the welfare of a jewish refugee community , washed dishes and posed as a nude model .
in 1941 , she opened the bettlerbar -lrb- beggar 's bar -rrb- , a ramshackle cabaret / restaurant filled with mismatched furniture and staffed by the likes of jackson pollock and tennessee williams , the latter being fired by gert for being " too sloppy . " although licensing requirements forced the new york bar to close , gert introduced the concept to germany upon her return in 1950 .
it has proved perhaps her most enduring legacy ; tumbledown bars furnished with random pieces of flea-market chic and junk store accessories have since become legion in berlin , a fad started by gert which wolfgang mueller terms " freedom from taste . " back in post-war berlin , she once again had to start from scratch .
in the same 1977 television show , the interviewer tactfully suggested that by the dawn of the 1950 's gert was perhaps not so well remembered as before .
with typical self-depricating humor and bluntness typical for berliners , she exclaimed , " not so well remembered ?
i was totally forgotten ! " she opened the hexenkueche -lrb- witch 's kitchen -rrb- cabaret and made a triumphant return to the silver screen with an appearance in the 1965 surrealist drama " juliet of the spirits , " directed by frederico fellini .
she was soon cast in other high profile projects by rainer werner fassbinder 's and volker schloendorff . well outside the box bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the valeska gert exhibition is on display at the hamburger bahnhof until february 2011 while valeska gert has had a small but solid fan base , widespread fame always eluded her and , especially in the intervening years , she has become very much a marginalized character .
" i think she is a bit invisible , " said wolfgang mueller , " she is not known because she always ignored borders .
she was always far away from these boxes that the art scene puts people in . " however , 2010 may well see an upswing in gert 's popularity ; the exhibition dedicated to her work has a generous five-month run , while the martin schmitz publishing house has not only released mueller 's definitive new biography but also a 7 " vinyl recording of her 1969 performance of " baby , " an impersonation of a gurgling child alternating between rage and happiness . historian an paenhuysen , the curator of the new exhibition in berlin , was new to gert 's world before taking on this project ; now she is a devoted fan .
" valeska gert made work that is still very contemporary .
it still works for today , " she said .
" it 's very familiar and at the same time very strange , frightening .
it touches you .
it 's really hard to sum her up .
you ca n't name her or put her in a box . " author : gavin blackburn editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 17.09.2010 eu threat to impose female quotas gets mixed response in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuck in lower management ?
the eu ’ s commissioner for equal opportunities viviane reding has warned firms in europe to rapidly promote women into top jobs or face a 30 percent quota from next year . a european commission threat to elevate women by fixed quotas into top company jobs coincides with growing admissions in germany that this could be the only remaining option to redress the balance .
despite a pledge made nine years ago by german industry to voluntarily remove the “ glass ceiling ” blocking women , only 2.5 percent of board members of germany 's 200 largest companies are female .
and at the 100 firms with the highest turnover , only four board executives are women .
eu-wide the trend is much the same : the commission says 89 percent of board members of europe 's stock market-listed companies are males .
growing support for quotas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henkel now favors quotas for women hans-olaf henkel , ex-president of the german bdi industry federation , conceded recently that he no longer opposes a quota .
“ the fact that over the years hardly anything has happened shows that we 're not making headway . ”
personnel consultant heiner thorborg , the author of a book on why women do not make it into top jobs , said he too had once been an opponent of quotas .
“ but when i consider that my 12-year-old daughter will have to wait 200 years until something significant happens , then i say : the last modus is the quota , and it has to come ! ”
pressure mounts within bavarian csu even within bavaria 's tradionally conservative party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , women members want change .
bavarian justice minister beate merk told german public radio on thursday that she wants a 40 percent women 's quota on party committees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goodwill is not enough , says bavaria 's justice minister beate merk .
“ we 've seen that all the goodwill and effort has n't helped . ”
female participation in party membership , currently at 18 percent , was dwindling , she added . “ we want a quota .
women voters can only be won over when women can participate in politics and when women have the chance to move into positions of leadership . ”
family minister seeks concensus federal family minister kristina schroeder favors industry 's goodwill as before .
“ what we need are political changes that we 'll best achieve with the support of commerce , not in battle against industry . ”
schroeder 's ministry has initiated the drafting of a voluntary “ code for good management . ”
apart from one woman , its code commission is made up of male executives .
like commissioner reding , business studies professor ulrike detmers points to research findings showing that firms with a balanced male-female mix benefit all round , including gains in profitability : “ goals are reached much more quickly .
meetings run more efficiently .
when the women present are also mothers then one comes straight to the point . ” what 's needed , she says , is “ better childcare , more flexible hours ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's high time to redress the balance , if necessary by force , says viviane reding but some in germany maintain that such progress can not be legislated .
the president of the german chambers of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , hans heinrich driftmann , says that the lack of women in senior positions can be attributed to a number of reasons , including the difficulty of balancing family and work , and women 's tendency to avoid technical and scientific career paths .
" a legal quota ca n't really influence such wide-ranging underlying causes , and for that reason , i would argue against imposing one , " driftmann told the german daily paper die welt .
" i was recruited to my career on the basis of my qualifications , not because of my sex , " said marie-christine ostermann , a 32-year-old executive who also chairs germany 's association of young business leaders .
" had a quota been in place , i would have felt as if i had been reduced to a gender . "
germany falling back in international rankings in overall gender inequality terms , germany has fallen back in recent years , according to the world economic forum 's latest survey .
from being ranked fifth among 128 nations in 2006 , germany has slipped to 12th place .
topping the list are scandinavian nations .
the forum 's scoring is based on 30 indicators , including women 's access to education and chances for economic participation .
in one of several nationwide studies , the german institute for economic research , the diw , found that most women in employment remain confined to lower-paid jobs , and if they do enter senior management , then this tends to happen in service sectors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sattelberg says ' old boys networks ' persist everywhere the luebeck-based survey institute databyte says the presence of women in middle to upper management nationwide is 17 percent , but its survey of 940,000 firms shows marked regional variety . berlin tops with a women 's quota of 19 percent , closely followed by germany 's post-unification eastern states .
the tail-ender is baden-wurttemberg in southwestern germany with below 15 percent .
firm size also plays a role – women play bigger roles in smaller firms , including the retailing and the health sector in eastern germany .
one of the few german companies to self-impose its own women 's quota is deutsche telekom .
its goal is 30 percent by 2015 , but senior telekom employees fear that a decade of appeals and promises has not worked .
" old boys network " still prevails “ i think we have underestimated one thing – the ever-present dna , the ' old boys networks ' that shape company cultures , also in the sense of propagating traditional role models , " telekom 's head of personnel , thomas sattelberg said . professor detmer doubts that germany 's current government will move beyond soliciting goodwill .
“ out of consideration for industry 's interests , i do n't think the federal government will make the hard choices . ”

her leanings toward the performing arts , combined with the detrimental effects of world war i on her father 's finances , led her to seek employment and she soon made appearances at the munich kammerspiele , the deutsches theater and the berliner tribuene . radical experiments on stage as the 1920 's progressed , she also began appearing in silent cinema , performing in " the threepenny opera , " " diary of a lost girl " with iconic flapper louise brooks , and g. w. pabst 's " joyless street . " it was around this time that gert unveiled one of her most enduring performance works .
entitled " pause , " it was an interpretative anti-dance performed between reels in cinemas , designed to draw attention to stillness and serenity . " it was so radical just to go on stage in the cinema stand there and do nothing , " said wolfgang mueller , " she did this in the 20 's where the convention was speed , business , activity and you see this in the films of the 20 's : big cities , traffic , nervosity .
to go out there and do the complete opposite was very , very modern . " by 1933 , with the nazis in power , gert suffered a ban from the german stage due to her jewish heritage .
she moved to london where she continued to perform on stage and appeared in the experimental short film " pett and pot " directed by alberto cavalcanti .
it would be her last film work until her triumphant return to the cinema in the mid-1960 's . trend setting with ' freedom from taste ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare 1969 recording of baby is screened at the pause exhibition by 1938 , in her late 40 's and living in new york but , gert found it virtually impossible to revive her previous career .
she lived on the welfare of a jewish refugee community , washed dishes and posed as a nude model .
in 1941 , she opened the bettlerbar -lrb- beggar 's bar -rrb- , a ramshackle cabaret / restaurant filled with mismatched furniture and staffed by the likes of jackson pollock and tennessee williams , the latter being fired by gert for being " too sloppy . " although licensing requirements forced the new york bar to close , gert introduced the concept to germany upon her return in 1950 .
it has proved perhaps her most enduring legacy ; tumbledown bars furnished with random pieces of flea-market chic and junk store accessories have since become legion in berlin , a fad started by gert which wolfgang mueller terms " freedom from taste . " back in post-war berlin , she once again had to start from scratch .
in the same 1977 television show , the interviewer tactfully suggested that by the dawn of the 1950 's gert was perhaps not so well remembered as before .
with typical self-depricating humor and bluntness typical for berliners , she exclaimed , " not so well remembered ?
i was totally forgotten ! " she opened the hexenkueche -lrb- witch 's kitchen -rrb- cabaret and made a triumphant return to the silver screen with an appearance in the 1965 surrealist drama " juliet of the spirits , " directed by frederico fellini .
she was soon cast in other high profile projects by rainer werner fassbinder 's and volker schloendorff . well outside the box bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the valeska gert exhibition is on display at the hamburger bahnhof until february 2011 while valeska gert has had a small but solid fan base , widespread fame always eluded her and , especially in the intervening years , she has become very much a marginalized character .
" i think she is a bit invisible , " said wolfgang mueller , " she is not known because she always ignored borders .
she was always far away from these boxes that the art scene puts people in . " however , 2010 may well see an upswing in gert 's popularity ; the exhibition dedicated to her work has a generous five-month run , while the martin schmitz publishing house has not only released mueller 's definitive new biography but also a 7 " vinyl recording of her 1969 performance of " baby , " an impersonation of a gurgling child alternating between rage and happiness . historian an paenhuysen , the curator of the new exhibition in berlin , was new to gert 's world before taking on this project ; now she is a devoted fan .
" valeska gert made work that is still very contemporary .
it still works for today , " she said .
" it 's very familiar and at the same time very strange , frightening .
it touches you .
it 's really hard to sum her up .
you ca n't name her or put her in a box . " author : neale lytollis editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

cheers !
with oktoberfest about to kick off in munich , we asked our facebook users about their oktoberfest experiences , the good and the bad .
here 's a selection of their comments . have you ever been to oktoberfest ?
ha , i never went to oktoberfest while i was living in germany .
i am a born and bred berliner .
that explains it i guess .
however , i 've been to numerous oktoberfests in new zealand .
they are put on each year by the new zealand german business association in auckland and they rock , i mean ooompah !
so much fun - this year 's is on this friday . - anja yes !
and it was very memorable .
i went in munich for the 2000 oktoberfest !
we arrived very early and picked a tent and it was packed !
we squeezed in with a table and started drinking , and soon everyone was talking , dancing and singing and they locked the doors .
later , some star guests arrived ; some soccer players and a man with a dog , and the crowd went wild .
i still have the little woven heart trinket i bought . - laura yes .
when i was a student of goethe institut hong kong , i attended the oktoberfest party at the open car park of the marco polo hotel .
the marco polo oktoberfest is now very famous in hong kong .
it 's all about german food , beer , dancing and a swiss band .
but after all the years , it is still unchanged .
i 'll attend too this year , and see if the swiss band will still sing the same songs and play the same games .
but no change could be nice , because it 's a good atmosphere and memories every time . - paskol yeah , i went with my colleagues when i lived in germany last year .
we spent a long time walking around as there were no places to sit but it was a great atmosphere .
in the end we learned that it 's better to book in advance so we sat at odeonsplatz instead and had some beers . - hannah when i was stationed as a soldier in offenbach / main in 1958 , i made friends with a young german and we decided at the last minute to go to the oktoberfest on his motorcycle .
once there we hunted and hunted for a place to spend the night but everything was booked .
we ended up sleeping on big oil cans at a gas station .
had a great time though . - bill yes .
i was there last year with five friends in the second weekend .
it was wonderful and the weather was very good .
we do n't remember the number of beer mugs we drank , but we had a good time .
i suppose we will remember that weekend until our last minute in this world . - francisco horrible experience .
everybody was drunk and the whole thing was pretty boring ...
i prefer cologne 's carnival .
everyone 's drunk there as well , but at least it 's fun : they sing and dress up . - maria-lujan last year i was at the oktoberfest together with other students studying german at the goethe institut in schwaebisch hall .
a camera crew from the deutsche welle team filmed us while we experienced the oktoberfest for the first time .
it was such a fun and amazing experience !
i ended up going back to the wiesn four more times that year and each time i met interesting and fun people .
one of the things i liked best about the oktoberfest is how easy it is to meet people sitting near you and to strike up a conversation with them .
i also especially enjoyed standing on the benches , drinking lots of beer , and singing crazy german songs ! - benjamin compiled by stuart tiffen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 17.09.2010 new help center offers protection from botnets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german internet industry statistics say that one out of seven internet-connected computers in germany are part of a botnet internet users in germany now have a contact point for receiving help with malicious software that allows multiple computers to be controlled remotely . the anti-botnet beratungszentrum , or the anti-botnet advice center , was launched at an anti-spam conference in wiesbaden , germany this week .
the center will be a new way to help computer users escape botnets - groups of malware-infected computers that can be controlled and exploited by a remote third party .
" the main goal is to remove germany from the top 10 ranking of countries from which botnet activities originate , " according to a document about the project published late last year on the organization for economic cooperation and development 's website .
when expanded successfully , botnets can comprise thousands or millions of so-called zombie computers that are under the control of an attacker .
they can be used for infecting further computers , sending spam , conducting criminal activity and launching cyber-attacks .
generally speaking , botnets only affect computers with the microsoft windows operating system .
linux and mac os computers are rarely infected .
according to industry statistics , every seventh german computer connected to the internet is currently part of a botnet , with its user often unaware of the situation .
thomas de maiziere , germany 's interior minister , in a statement , described the problem as " the greatest current danger for the internet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center will have a budget of two million euros annually various types of assistance the anti-botnet beratungszentrum offers help via email or by phone .
the center 's website , www.botfrei.de , contains instructions on how to free an affected computer from a botnet , as well as useful software .
the 2 million euro project is financially supported by the federal ministry of the interior and technically by the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- .
several internet providers , such as deutsche telekom , are also involved .
in the future , the participating internet providers will automatically notify their clients by email or post if their computers are infected with malware .
de maziere is encouraging non-participating providers to join the project , but he also emphasizes that affected internet users need to “ take their share of responsibility ” and take advantage of the assistance offered by the help center .

after a bumpy first three rounds , they 'll try to get it together this week . match day four in the bundesliga is upon us , and dw 's team of football freaks are plotting their comeback ... or hoping that when it comes to picks , it 's a case of four is fantastic .
the prediction squad has taken a hit from all the upsets thus far -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but still we rise .
friday , september 18 frankfurt-freiburg freiburg have looked much better this year than last and have shown they can win away .
but after a sputtering start , frankfurt got back on track last week and have enough drive going forward to exploit their opponents ' weakness at the back .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 saturday , september 18 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne will hope to see this mueller - not the celebratory one bayern munich-cologne no secret about the billy goats ' strategy here – pack it in in their own half , frustrate franck ribery and hope for a draw .
with bayern perhaps having tired legs from the champions league , cologne 's plan has a chance of working .
but something tells me thomas mueller has found his rhythm again , and as he showed on wedsnesday , he can manufacture goals from nothing .
prediction : bayern 2-0 werder bremen-mainz this is just the sort of match profligate bremen often lose , and what 's not to like about this year 's plucky , well-organized mainz squad ?
unfortunately for the latter , though , i think the now-confirmed news that wunderkind andre schuerrle is headed to leverkusen next season will prove to be a distraction .
prediction : bremen 3-1 stuttgart-moenchengladbach this is a case of the underachieving taking on the unpredictable .
stuttgart have been a mess this season , especially on defense , and are coming off only two days rest .
gladbach have been up and down but have already tripped up one big club at home .
methinks they split the points .
prediction : 1-1 draw wolfsburg-hanover there 's one team here still looking for its first points , and it 's not hanover .
the 96ers are undefeated , and their two wins , while close , have been deserved .
for the wolves , who are miles ahead talent-wise , this will be a test of whether they have faith in new coach steve mcclaren .
i think the result will be indecisive .
prediction : 2-2 draw .
kaiserslautern-hoffenheim as bayern found out two weeks ago , never underestimate lautern 's home field advantage .
but i like what i 've seen from hoffenheim this season .
they 're more disciplined than in the past and look like they 're on a mission to prove the doubters wrong .
and they simply have too much attacking firepower for the red devils .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 sunday , september 19 st. pauli-hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. pauli fans will hope their outlaw act intimidates their city rivals of the true city derbies in german football , this one is the best .
on paper , pauli are completely overmatched against hamburg .
but that 's on paper .
taking to the field in millerntor stadium with ac / dc 's hell 's bells ringing in your ears is something that can impress even the likes of ruud van nistelrooy .
and somewhere within all that ringing i hear the sound of an upset .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 dortmund-schalke could things get any worse for schalke ?
they 're on a bad losing streak , and now they get a visit their bitterest rivals , who are off to a good start .
but i 'm not writing off schalke just yet , and i think two extra days rest will help them sneak a point .
prediction : 1-1 draw leverkusen-nuremberg leverkusen have lived up to their reputation as one of the bundesliga 's least consistent teams and will have thursday 's europa cup match weighing down their legs .
but i think nuremberg will be thrown off by the loss of their best striker , albert bunjaku , to injury for the rest of the year .

after a bumpy first three rounds , they 'll try to get it together this week . match day four in the bundesliga is upon us , and dw 's team of football freaks are plotting their comeback ... or hoping that when it comes to picks , it 's a case of four is fantastic .
the prediction squad has taken a hit from all the upsets thus far -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but still we rise .
friday , september 18 frankfurt-freiburg freiburg have looked much better this year than last and have shown they can win away .
but after a sputtering start , frankfurt got back on track last week and have enough drive going forward to exploit their opponents ' weakness at the back .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 saturday , september 18 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne will hope to see this mueller - not the celebratory one bayern munich-cologne no secret about the billy goats ' strategy here – pack it in in their own half , frustrate franck ribery and hope for a draw .
with bayern perhaps having tired legs from the champions league , cologne 's plan has a chance of working .
but something tells me thomas mueller has found his rhythm again , and as he showed on wedsnesday , he can manufacture goals from nothing .
prediction : bayern 2-0 werder bremen-mainz this is just the sort of match profligate bremen often lose , and what 's not to like about this year 's plucky , well-organized mainz squad ?
unfortunately for the latter , though , i think the now-confirmed news that wunderkind andre schuerrle is headed to leverkusen next season will prove to be a distraction .
prediction : bremen 3-1 stuttgart-moenchengladbach this is a case of the underachieving taking on the unpredictable .
stuttgart have been a mess this season , especially on defense , and are coming off only two days rest .
gladbach have been up and down but have already tripped up one big club at home .
methinks they split the points .
prediction : 1-1 draw wolfsburg-hanover there 's one team here still looking for its first points , and it 's not hanover .
the 96ers are undefeated , and their two wins , while close , have been deserved .
for the wolves , who are miles ahead talent-wise , this will be a test of whether they have faith in new coach steve mcclaren .
i think the result will be indecisive .
prediction : 2-2 draw .
kaiserslautern-hoffenheim as bayern found out two weeks ago , never underestimate lautern 's home field advantage .
but i like what i 've seen from hoffenheim this season .
they 're more disciplined than in the past and look like they 're on a mission to prove the doubters wrong .
and they simply have too much attacking firepower for the red devils .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 sunday , september 19 st. pauli-hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. pauli fans will hope their outlaw act intimidates their city rivals of the true city derbies in german football , this one is the best .
on paper , pauli are completely overmatched against hamburg .
but that 's on paper .
taking to the field in millerntor stadium with ac / dc 's hell 's bells ringing in your ears is something that can impress even the likes of ruud van nistelrooy .
and somewhere within all that ringing i hear the sound of an upset .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 dortmund-schalke could things get any worse for schalke ?
they 're on a bad losing streak , and now they get a visit their bitterest rivals , who are off to a good start .
but i 'm not writing off schalke just yet , and i think two extra days rest will help them sneak a point .
prediction : 1-1 draw leverkusen-nuremberg leverkusen have lived up to their reputation as one of the bundesliga 's least consistent teams and will have thursday 's europa cup match weighing down their legs .
but i think nuremberg will be thrown off by the loss of their best striker , albert bunjaku , to injury for the rest of the year .
prediction : leverkusen 3-0 last week 's result : 6 points hoffenheim – schalke 2:0 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- dortmund - wolfsburg 2:0 -lrb- dw prediction 2:0 , three points -rrb- hamburg - nuremberg 1:1 -lrb- dw prediction 3:1 , no points -rrb- gladbach - frankfurt 0:4 -lrb- dw prediction 2:1 , no points -rrb- freiburg - stuttgart 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 1:3 , no points -rrb- hanover - leverkusen 2:2 -lrb- dw prediction 2:3 , no points -rrb- bayern munich - bremen 0:0 -lrb- dw prediction 4:2 , no points -rrb- mainz - kaiserlautern 2:1 -lrb- dw prediction 2:1 , three points -rrb- cologne - st. pauli 1:0 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- total for the season : 15 three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : jefferson chase editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9799 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

russia , which had issued the warrant for zakayev , had a close eye on whether poland would arrest him . polish police said friday they had arrested akhmed zakayev , a leading chechen separatist in exile , who is wanted by russia for alleged terrorism . police spokesman mriusz sokolowski said poland was responding to an international arrest warrant and had no option but to detain him . " he was arrested by plainclothes police as he was leaving a building , " sokolowski told tvn24 television . " because there was an international arrest warrant , police were under an obligation to detain him and to take him to prosecutors . "
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov expressed confidence earlier on thursday that poland would arrest and extradite zakayev .
" we drew the attention of our polish partners to this problem .
they took our appeal seriously , " he said .
poland has welcomed chechens zakayev arrived in poland on thursday to attend the two-day world chechen congress , a gathering of exiles from the conflict-torn region .
in poland , zakayev spoke about his nation 's role in reminding the world about the importance of human rights .
" i would like to express my deepest conviction that it is impossible to achieve real freedom and defend the rights of individuals when the rights and freedoms of whole nations are violated , " he said .
" the events of the past decade in the chechen republic have served as a test for all human rights activists and human rights organizations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechnya still bears the scars of war while the violence continues since his war years , zakayev has come to represent a moderate wing of the separatist movement .
russia is still fighting against an islamist insurgency in the caucasus in chechnya and in neighboring dagestan and ingushetia .
poland has become the prime destination for refugees fleeing the violence in chechnya over the last two decades .
successive polish governments have declared their solidarity with the people of the caucasus and in the 1990s poland opened the first official chechen information center in europe .
more recently , the late polish president lech kaczynski went out of his way to show support for georgia in its disputes with russia by making controversial trips to war-torn regions .
inconvenient timing zakayev 's visit - and the ensuing pressure from russia - comes at a sensitive time for poland . it was lech kaczynski 's death in a plane crash in russia earlier this year that began to thaw the traditionally chilly relationship between warsaw and moscow .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many chechen refugees have ended up in poland , but some have found life difficult there asked whether the world chechen congress could affect poland 's relations with russia , prime minister donald tusk said that , without compromising its ideals , his cabinet will also look after polish interests .
but those taking part in the world chechen congress also have more practical problems on their minds .
as muslims , they are culturally alienated in roman catholic poland .
thousands are suspended in limbo - with no jobs , no available housing and no prospect of moving on to another eu country .

another man was arrested about eight hours later .
the police said officers had been searching two businesses and eight homes in the capital since the arrests , but had found no weapons or dangerous materials .
media reports suggested the arrests were likely linked to the papal visit , an issue on which the police would not comment .
the presence of pope benedict xvi in london meant that the british capital was already on high alert before friday 's raids .
" we 're totally calm , the pope is happy , " vatican spokesman federico lombardi said when reporters told him about the arrests .
" we can say that we 're totally confident in the work of the police . "
papal schedule unchanged the pope attended a service at london 's westminster abbey on friday led by archbishop of canterbury rowan williams , the leader of the world 's anglican church .
the two church leaders then met at lambeth palace , the anglican archbishop 's london residence , for historic talks : no pontiff had visited lambeth palace or visited the historic abbey since the foundation of the church of england when king henry viii broke with rome in 1534 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some object to benedict 's handling of the sex scandal benedict also delivered a speech at westminster hall - the historic heart of the houses of parliament - and addressed some 3,000 young catholics at an event in southwest london .
anti-church protests continue the run-up to the visit was clouded by criticism of the catholic church 's handling of a child abuse scandal and a furore over the trip 's cost : 20 million gbp -lrb- 37 million euros -rrb- .
there were protests before benedict 's engagement with young people in twickenham on friday , in the southwest of the british capital , with around 20 demonstrators waving banners with slogans saying , " there is no god - get over it ! " or " the pope is wrong , put a condom on ! "
on his flight to britain , benedict made some of his strongest comments yet on the paedophilia controversy , saying revelations of child abuse by priests that have rocked the catholic church " were a shock to me . "
he added that " the authorities in the church have not been vigilant enough . "
the church " did not act quickly or firmly enough to take the necessary action " to stop the problem , which involved abuse by priests and catholic teachers in ireland , germany , and a number of other countries around europe .
while in london , benedict was expected to meet a group of 10 victims of abuse , either on friday or saturday .
first pope to make ' state visit ' to england on the first day of the pope 's visit , he warned of the risk of " aggressive secularism " in britain and greeted tens of thousands of people at a mass in glasgow and on the streets of edinburgh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen cordially invited the pope to britain herself " the united kingdom strives to be a modern and multicultural society , " benedict xvi said .
" in this challenging enterprise , may it always maintain its respect for those traditional values and cultural expressions that more aggressive forms of secularism no longer value or even tolerate . "
the pontiff also met queen elizabeth ii while in edinburgh : " i am delighted to welcome you to the uk and particularly to scotland on your first visit as pope , " the queen said .
this is the first papal visit to the uk to be classified as a state visit , because it was elizabeth ii who invited the pontiff , not the church .
benedict xvi and the queen focused on the positive aspects of relations between predominantly anglican britain and the roman catholic church , two bodies which the queen said shared " a common christian heritage . "
on sunday , benedict will travel to the central english city of birmingham for the final day of his visit , where he will preside over the beatification of a 19th century cardinal , john henry newman .

there were protests before benedict 's engagement with young people in twickenham on friday , in the southwest of the british capital , with around 20 demonstrators waving banners with slogans saying , " there is no god - get over it ! " or " the pope is wrong , put a condom on ! "
on his flight to britain , benedict made some of his strongest comments yet on the paedophilia controversy , saying revelations of child abuse by priests that have rocked the catholic church " were a shock to me . "
he added that " the authorities in the church have not been vigilant enough . "
the church " did not act quickly or firmly enough to take the necessary action " to stop the problem , which involved abuse by priests and catholic teachers in ireland , germany , and a number of other countries around europe .
while in london , benedict was expected to meet a group of 10 victims of abuse , either on friday or saturday .
first pope to make ' state visit ' to england on the first day of the pope 's visit , he warned of the risk of " aggressive secularism " in britain and greeted tens of thousands of people at a mass in glasgow and on the streets of edinburgh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen cordially invited the pope to britain herself " the united kingdom strives to be a modern and multicultural society , " benedict xvi said .
" in this challenging enterprise , may it always maintain its respect for those traditional values and cultural expressions that more aggressive forms of secularism no longer value or even tolerate . "
the pontiff also met queen elizabeth ii while in edinburgh : " i am delighted to welcome you to the uk and particularly to scotland on your first visit as pope , " the queen said .
this is the first papal visit to the uk to be classified as a state visit , because it was elizabeth ii who invited the pontiff , not the church .
benedict xvi and the queen focused on the positive aspects of relations between predominantly anglican britain and the roman catholic church , two bodies which the queen said shared " a common christian heritage . "
on sunday , benedict will travel to the central english city of birmingham for the final day of his visit , where he will preside over the beatification of a 19th century cardinal , john henry newman .

after a bumpy first three rounds , they 'll try to get it together this week . match day four in the bundesliga is upon us , and dw 's team of football freaks are plotting their comeback ... or hoping that when it comes to picks , it 's a case of four is fantastic .
the prediction squad has taken a hit from all the upsets thus far -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but still we rise .
friday , september 18 frankfurt-freiburg freiburg have looked much better this year than last and have shown they can win away .
but after a sputtering start , frankfurt got back on track last week and have enough drive going forward to exploit their opponents ' weakness at the back .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 saturday , september 18 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne will hope to see this mueller - not the celebratory one bayern munich-cologne no secret about the billy goats ' strategy here – pack it in in their own half , frustrate franck ribery and hope for a draw .
with bayern perhaps having tired legs from the champions league , cologne 's plan has a chance of working .
but something tells me thomas mueller has found his rhythm again , and as he showed on wedsnesday , he can manufacture goals from nothing .
prediction : bayern 2-0 werder bremen-mainz this is just the sort of match profligate bremen often lose , and what 's not to like about this year 's plucky , well-organized mainz squad ?
unfortunately for the latter , though , i think the now-confirmed news that wunderkind andre schuerrle is headed to leverkusen next season will prove to be a distraction .
prediction : bremen 3-1 stuttgart-moenchengladbach this is a case of the underachieving taking on the unpredictable .
stuttgart have been a mess this season , especially on defense , and are coming off only two days rest .
gladbach have been up and down but have already tripped up one big club at home .
methinks they split the points .
prediction : 1-1 draw wolfsburg-hanover there 's one team here still looking for its first points , and it 's not hanover .
the 96ers are undefeated , and their two wins , while close , have been deserved .
for the wolves , who are miles ahead talent-wise , this will be a test of whether they have faith in new coach steve mcclaren .
i think the result will be indecisive .
prediction : 2-2 draw .
kaiserslautern-hoffenheim as bayern found out two weeks ago , never underestimate lautern 's home field advantage .
but i like what i 've seen from hoffenheim this season .
they 're more disciplined than in the past and look like they 're on a mission to prove the doubters wrong .
and they simply have too much attacking firepower for the red devils .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 sunday , september 19 st. pauli-hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. pauli fans will hope their outlaw act intimidates their city rivals of the true city derbies in german football , this one is the best .
on paper , pauli are completely overmatched against hamburg .
but that 's on paper .
taking to the field in millerntor stadium with ac / dc 's hell 's bells ringing in your ears is something that can impress even the likes of ruud van nistelrooy .
and somewhere within all that ringing i hear the sound of an upset .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 dortmund-schalke could things get any worse for schalke ?
they 're on a bad losing streak , and now they get a visit their bitterest rivals , who are off to a good start .
but i 'm not writing off schalke just yet , and i think two extra days rest will help them sneak a point .
prediction : 1-1 draw leverkusen-nuremberg leverkusen have lived up to their reputation as one of the bundesliga 's least consistent teams and will have thursday 's europa cup match weighing down their legs .
but i think nuremberg will be thrown off by the loss of their best striker , albert bunjaku , to injury for the rest of the year .

the center will be a new way to help computer users escape botnets - groups of malware-infected computers that can be controlled and exploited by a remote third party .
" the main goal is to remove germany from the top 10 ranking of countries from which botnet activities originate , " according to a document about the project published late last year on the organization for economic cooperation and development 's website .
when expanded successfully , botnets can comprise thousands or millions of so-called zombie computers that are under the control of an attacker .
they can be used for infecting further computers , sending spam , conducting criminal activity and launching cyber-attacks .
generally speaking , botnets only affect computers with the microsoft windows operating system .
linux and mac os computers are rarely infected .
according to industry statistics , every seventh german computer connected to the internet is currently part of a botnet , with its user often unaware of the situation .
thomas de maiziere , germany 's interior minister , in a statement , described the problem as " the greatest current danger for the internet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center will have a budget of two million euros annually various types of assistance the anti-botnet beratungszentrum offers help via email or by phone .
the center 's website , www.botfrei.de , contains instructions on how to free an affected computer from a botnet , as well as useful software .
the 2 million euro project is financially supported by the federal ministry of the interior and technically by the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- .
several internet providers , such as deutsche telekom , are also involved .
in the future , the participating internet providers will automatically notify their clients by email or post if their computers are infected with malware .
de maziere is encouraging non-participating providers to join the project , but he also emphasizes that affected internet users need to “ take their share of responsibility ” and take advantage of the assistance offered by the help center .

another man was arrested about eight hours later .
the police said officers had been searching two businesses and eight homes in the capital since the arrests , but had found no weapons or dangerous materials .
media reports suggested the arrests were likely linked to the papal visit , an issue on which the police would not comment .
the presence of pope benedict xvi in london meant that the british capital was already on high alert before friday 's raids .
" we 're totally calm , the pope is happy , " vatican spokesman federico lombardi said when reporters told him about the arrests .
" we can say that we 're totally confident in the work of the police . "
papal schedule unchanged the pope attended a service at london 's westminster abbey on friday led by archbishop of canterbury rowan williams , the leader of the world 's anglican church .
the two church leaders then met at lambeth palace , the anglican archbishop 's london residence , for historic talks : no pontiff had visited lambeth palace or visited the historic abbey since the foundation of the church of england when king henry viii broke with rome in 1534 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some object to benedict 's handling of the sex scandal benedict also delivered a speech at westminster hall - the historic heart of the houses of parliament - and addressed some 3,000 young catholics at an event in southwest london .
anti-church protests continue the run-up to the visit was clouded by criticism of the catholic church 's handling of a child abuse scandal and a furore over the trip 's cost : 20 million gbp -lrb- 37 million euros -rrb- .
there were protests before benedict 's engagement with young people in twickenham on friday , in the southwest of the british capital , with around 20 demonstrators waving banners with slogans saying , " there is no god - get over it ! " or " the pope is wrong , put a condom on ! "
on his flight to britain , benedict made some of his strongest comments yet on the paedophilia controversy , saying revelations of child abuse by priests that have rocked the catholic church " were a shock to me . "
he added that " the authorities in the church have not been vigilant enough . "
the church " did not act quickly or firmly enough to take the necessary action " to stop the problem , which involved abuse by priests and catholic teachers in ireland , germany , and a number of other countries around europe .
while in london , benedict was expected to meet a group of 10 victims of abuse , either on friday or saturday .
first pope to make ' state visit ' to england on the first day of the pope 's visit , he warned of the risk of " aggressive secularism " in britain and greeted tens of thousands of people at a mass in glasgow and on the streets of edinburgh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen cordially invited the pope to britain herself " the united kingdom strives to be a modern and multicultural society , " benedict xvi said .
" in this challenging enterprise , may it always maintain its respect for those traditional values and cultural expressions that more aggressive forms of secularism no longer value or even tolerate . "
the pontiff also met queen elizabeth ii while in edinburgh : " i am delighted to welcome you to the uk and particularly to scotland on your first visit as pope , " the queen said .
this is the first papal visit to the uk to be classified as a state visit , because it was elizabeth ii who invited the pontiff , not the church .
benedict xvi and the queen focused on the positive aspects of relations between predominantly anglican britain and the roman catholic church , two bodies which the queen said shared " a common christian heritage . "
on sunday , benedict will travel to the central english city of birmingham for the final day of his visit , where he will preside over the beatification of a 19th century cardinal , john henry newman .

meanwhile , roma leaders in germany say camps are n't an issue here . it was n't really french president nicolas sarkozy 's dismantling of roma camps and large-scale deportations that caused controversy in germany , nor was it his " lively " confrontation with european commission president jose manuel barroso on the issue , it was his assertion that german chancellor angela merkel was planning to introduce a similar policy .
" mrs. merkel told me that germany also intends to start clearing out camps in the coming weeks , " sarkozy told reporters in brussels on thursday evening .
the chancellor 's office in berlin and foreign minister guido westerwelle both swiftly refuted sarkozy 's claims , with westerwelle saying that such a policy " would run contrary to the german constitution . "
however , german leaders are also playing down the significance of this " misunderstanding , " saying the confusion will not hurt germany and france 's cooperation bilaterally , or within the eu .
" you should not over-interpret this as a strain on franco-german relations , " government spokesman steffen seibert said in berlin on friday .
" no camps " in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose says germany and france both discriminate , but to different extents roma leaders in germany said they were confused by sarkozy 's statement , given that most german-based roma are more integrated into society and are less likely to live in makeshift camps .
" for me , it 's very clear that -lrb- german chancellor angela merkel -rrb- said nothing of this nature , primarily because there are n't any camps here in germany - or , at least , none of which i am aware , " the head of the central council for german sinti and roma , romani rose , told the mdr german public broadcaster on friday .
" so , to me , the chancellor 's denial seems entirely credible . "
" sinti and roma live normally like the rest of the population ; they are workers , employees , academics and artists , they 're members of sporting clubs , and , very often , people do n't even know they 're part of an ethnic minority . "
rose said that discrimination remained a major issue in germany , but usually on an individual level .
he referred to a recent survey carried out by the council in which over 80 percent of respondents said they had encountered some form of discrimination in their day-to-day lives .
sinti and roma can encounter discrimination when looking for a job or a flat , in individual legal disputes , and even in their local pub , he explained .
" but none of this is comparable with this sweeping , criminalizing campaign being carried out by the upper echelons of the french government , including the president , " rose said .
" these policies have caused great concern amongst our people here in germany , and all over europe . "
the kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rose says germany has no camps like this one in a paris suburb if germany has a policy comparable to the french mass deportations , it would be the contentious decision to gradually send some 12,000 former refugees , many of whom are roma , back to their home country of kosovo now that germany deems the situation there stable .
unlike romania and bulgaria , where most french-based roma are being sent , kosovo is not a member of the european union , meaning the issue does not fall within the jurisdiction of the eu commission , france 's most high-profile critic on this issue to date .
rose said he strongly opposed the german policy to repatriate sinti and roma , among others , to kosovo , arguing that april 's decision to begin this process was premature and that the government in pristina was not yet ready to uphold the rights of formerly displaced people .
" it 's still irresponsible to send these people back to kosovo now , " he said .
" the un 's refugee representative in berlin has said that the security situation for roma in kosovo is not yet satisfactory , international human rights groups like amnesty international have said the same thing , as has the central council for german sinti and roma . "
but rose also said that the german government was handling the roughly 12,000 cases differently to france , describing each decision as an " individual example " , whereas france was carrying out a deportation policy " en masse . "

after a bumpy first three rounds , they 'll try to get it together this week . match day four in the bundesliga is upon us , and dw 's team of football freaks are plotting their comeback ... or hoping that when it comes to picks , it 's a case of four is fantastic .
the prediction squad has taken a hit from all the upsets thus far -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but still we rise .
friday , september 18 frankfurt-freiburg freiburg have looked much better this year than last and have shown they can win away .
but after a sputtering start , frankfurt got back on track last week and have enough drive going forward to exploit their opponents ' weakness at the back .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 saturday , september 18 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne will hope to see this mueller - not the celebratory one bayern munich-cologne no secret about the billy goats ' strategy here – pack it in in their own half , frustrate franck ribery and hope for a draw .
with bayern perhaps having tired legs from the champions league , cologne 's plan has a chance of working .
but something tells me thomas mueller has found his rhythm again , and as he showed on wedsnesday , he can manufacture goals from nothing .
prediction : bayern 2-0 werder bremen-mainz this is just the sort of match profligate bremen often lose , and what 's not to like about this year 's plucky , well-organized mainz squad ?
unfortunately for the latter , though , i think the now-confirmed news that wunderkind andre schuerrle is headed to leverkusen next season will prove to be a distraction .
prediction : bremen 3-1 stuttgart-moenchengladbach this is a case of the underachieving taking on the unpredictable .
stuttgart have been a mess this season , especially on defense , and are coming off only two days rest .
gladbach have been up and down but have already tripped up one big club at home .
methinks they split the points .
prediction : 1-1 draw wolfsburg-hanover there 's one team here still looking for its first points , and it 's not hanover .
the 96ers are undefeated , and their two wins , while close , have been deserved .
for the wolves , who are miles ahead talent-wise , this will be a test of whether they have faith in new coach steve mcclaren .
i think the result will be indecisive .
prediction : 2-2 draw .
kaiserslautern-hoffenheim as bayern found out two weeks ago , never underestimate lautern 's home field advantage .
but i like what i 've seen from hoffenheim this season .
they 're more disciplined than in the past and look like they 're on a mission to prove the doubters wrong .
and they simply have too much attacking firepower for the red devils .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 sunday , september 19 st. pauli-hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. pauli fans will hope their outlaw act intimidates their city rivals of the true city derbies in german football , this one is the best .
on paper , pauli are completely overmatched against hamburg .
but that 's on paper .
taking to the field in millerntor stadium with ac / dc 's hell 's bells ringing in your ears is something that can impress even the likes of ruud van nistelrooy .
and somewhere within all that ringing i hear the sound of an upset .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 dortmund-schalke could things get any worse for schalke ?
they 're on a bad losing streak , and now they get a visit their bitterest rivals , who are off to a good start .
but i 'm not writing off schalke just yet , and i think two extra days rest will help them sneak a point .
prediction : 1-1 draw leverkusen-nuremberg leverkusen have lived up to their reputation as one of the bundesliga 's least consistent teams and will have thursday 's europa cup match weighing down their legs .
but i think nuremberg will be thrown off by the loss of their best striker , albert bunjaku , to injury for the rest of the year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 17.09.2010 german machine builders are leery of outsourcing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's buemi views quality as competitive edge mechanical engineering is a pillar of the german economy .
while machine builders can save costs in the short term by outsourcing production , in the long term , they can hurt themselves and the national economy . for years , german industry has faced growing international competition .
emerging markets such as china , india and brazil have already become big competitors , and a number of african countries could join the fray someday .
the prospect of lower labor costs has led many german machine builders to move parts or even all of their production abroad to stay competitive .
but some companies , like buemi in gevelsberg near wuppertal , view the outsourcing trend with skepticism .
buemi manufactures precision parts , such as axels , shafts , sockets and studs , for machine tools and trains .
the company is viewed as one of the " hidden champions " of german industry .
its customers include thyssen-krupp , siemens , komatsu and bombardier transportation .
maintaining a standard of living buemi managing director frank mittag has been at the helm of the company for 15 years .
he views germany as a manufacturing nation that relies on a powerful mechanical engineering sector .
and it 's thanks to the country 's competitive manufacturing base that services such as information technology can be easily outsourced .
" but if we rely solely on services , we will not be able to maintain our standard of living , " mittag says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : managing director frank mittag warns about being blinded by short-term cost benefits in a high-wage country like germany , the managing director asserts , there is only one alternative : quality .
that means precision , innovation , reliability and longevity .
competing on price is n't an option for germany .
so while german machine builders can lower operating costs by outsourcing some production , it 's important they retain their core competencies at home , according to mittag .
" if we transfer abroad our innovative production processes and the constructions we need to achieve superior quality and reliability , then we destroy the very competitive edge we need to compete with low-wage countries , " he says , adding that it ’ s also important to have a high-quality supplier network in germany .
long-term costs mittag sees little sense in establishing a supplier network abroad and investing heavily to trim it for quality .
there 's a risk of important know-how seeping out .
moreover , the short-term cost advantage of this strategy would only be achieved with long-term disadvantages .
" the first costs people notice are from purchasing , " mittag says .
" other costs like those for quality assurance or production downtimes , processing and marketing are often overlooked in outsourcing projects . "
once these factors are considered in the equation , unit production costs rise , he adds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other machine builders have become cautious about outsourcing buemi has polled other machine builders that have become more cautious with their international expansion .
many medium-sized companies have established subsidiaries in china , whose operations were quickly replicated by competitors next door .
the damage can be huge .
many attribute the rise of china 's auto industry to german mechanical engineering firms that have established production facilities in the country .
know-how transfer is inevitable in such a global economy , but mittag warns nonetheless that companies outsourcing production in china should need to move cautiously and not be blinded by the short-term cost benefits .
today , germany 's mechanical engineering sector has a 10 to 20 year lead on its competitors in asia , according to mittag .
but to maintain that lead , he says , the sector must continue to strive for top quality , which can only be achieved with skilled employees .
" honesty , decency and conscientiousness , " mittag says , are indispensable because if business is driven only by a near insatiable hunger for higher profits , the quality of work and the products will suffer .

dw 's reporter offers a homeboy view of an area usually dismissed as a ghetto . recently , while eating a taco at a joint near where i live in berlin 's neukoelln neighborhood , i overheard a telling conversation .

" it sucks being in prenzlauer berg , " sighed one .
" i have to travel 30 minutes to get to a decent bar . "

i 'll never know exactly what the term means , other than a place someone liked being taken over by people whom that person does n't like .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 17.09.2010 chinese electric cars could soon plug into germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese electric cars are headed for german cities in germany – home to bmw , daimler and vw – energy company rwe plans to help a chinese company launch its electric cars .
the move could pressure german carmakers to ramp up mass production of their own electric vehicles . rwe and china 's byd have teamed to bring electrical cars to germany , beginning with a trial fleet in 2011 .
a mass rollout in germany and several other european markets is planned the following year .
the deal with the chinese company , a battery specialist that has since expanded into car manufacturing , follows a string of agreements with other manufacturers , including france 's renault , japan 's nissan and daimler .
the centrepiece of the agreement is a package deal for electric car enthusiasts , consisting of byd 's electric vehicles and rwe 's fast-charging posts and electricity supplied exclusively from renewable sources .
two models will be initially available and targeted primarily at consumers in cities driving shorter distances .
already on the market the one model is a plug-in hybrid car that combines new electric and conventional internal combustion systems .
on the market in china since early this year , it has a range of between 60 and 100 kilometers when running only on electricity .
the other newer model will be a purely electric vehicle with a battery range of about 300 kilometers and an acceleration of 0 to 100 kilometers per hour within 10 seconds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe plans to charge electric cars with electricity from rewewable energy sources the package will include a fast-charging device from rwe , access to the company 's expanding network of public charging points – now at around 450 – and electricity generated by wind and solar systems .
rwe spokesman peter hoscheidt told deutsche welle that no decision has yet been reached on whether the cars and charging unit can be leased in addition to being purchased or both and what the prices will be .
but he said both options will be likely and prices will be attractive to garner attention .
in berlin , the german energy company is already collaborating with daimler in a field trial .
they 're testing smart cars powered by lithium-ion batteries , which can be charged at home and public supply points .
the collaboration is one of several electric car initiatives running under the german government 's e-mobility program .
seeking standardization through their collaboration , rwe and byd also hope to contribute to standardization efforts in the nascent electric car industry .
standardized components are crucial to kick start mass production .
but the standardization process of a new technology , like electrically powered cars , is often accompanied by power struggles between groups seeking recognition of their own systems as standards in order to collect royalty fees down the road .
bildunterschrift : rwe sees the day coming when " fill it up " is replaced by " charge it up " why the cooperation with a chinese manufacturer now ?
because the chinese , hoscheidt said , promise mass production by 2012 , thus ensuring a sufficient supply of competitively priced vehicles .
" this is by no means an exclusive agreement , " he said .
" we 're seeking partners to push electric cars .
the sooner they can deliver , the better . "
coveted battery technolgy earlier this year , byd and daimler signed an agreement to develop and build electric cars for the chinese market .
the cars will be sold under a jointly owned brand .
daimler plans to take advantage of byd 's battery technology to help boost chinese sales .
byd is china 's sixth-biggest car manufacturer by sales last year .
american billionaire warren buffet owns 10 percent of the company .
but ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a professor at the university of duisburg-essen and an expert on the german auto industry warns about expecting too much too soon from chinese car makers .
" let 's see what comes , " he told deutsche welle .
" we 've seen a few chinese manufacturers come to europe , and they 've failed . "
byd 's car sales have been dropping noticeably in its home market , according to dudenhoeffer .
" there 's plenty of demand in china but other cars are apparently in greater demand , " he said .
nevertheless , dudenhoeffer welcomes the latest attempt to push electric cars in germany .
" there 's a lot more happening in a number of countries like france , " he said , pointing to financial incentives .
" in germany , there 's still just a lot of hot air . "

after a bumpy first three rounds , they 'll try to get it together this week . match day four in the bundesliga is upon us , and dw 's team of football freaks are plotting their comeback ... or hoping that when it comes to picks , it 's a case of four is fantastic .
the prediction squad has taken a hit from all the upsets thus far -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but still we rise .
friday , september 18 frankfurt-freiburg freiburg have looked much better this year than last and have shown they can win away .
but after a sputtering start , frankfurt got back on track last week and have enough drive going forward to exploit their opponents ' weakness at the back .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 saturday , september 18 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne will hope to see this mueller - not the celebratory one bayern munich-cologne no secret about the billy goats ' strategy here – pack it in in their own half , frustrate franck ribery and hope for a draw .
with bayern perhaps having tired legs from the champions league , cologne 's plan has a chance of working .
but something tells me thomas mueller has found his rhythm again , and as he showed on wedsnesday , he can manufacture goals from nothing .
prediction : bayern 2-0 werder bremen-mainz this is just the sort of match profligate bremen often lose , and what 's not to like about this year 's plucky , well-organized mainz squad ?
unfortunately for the latter , though , i think the now-confirmed news that wunderkind andre schuerrle is headed to leverkusen next season will prove to be a distraction .
prediction : bremen 3-1 stuttgart-moenchengladbach this is a case of the underachieving taking on the unpredictable .
stuttgart have been a mess this season , especially on defense , and are coming off only two days rest .
gladbach have been up and down but have already tripped up one big club at home .
methinks they split the points .
prediction : 1-1 draw wolfsburg-hanover there 's one team here still looking for its first points , and it 's not hanover .
the 96ers are undefeated , and their two wins , while close , have been deserved .
for the wolves , who are miles ahead talent-wise , this will be a test of whether they have faith in new coach steve mcclaren .
i think the result will be indecisive .
prediction : 2-2 draw .
kaiserslautern-hoffenheim as bayern found out two weeks ago , never underestimate lautern 's home field advantage .
but i like what i 've seen from hoffenheim this season .
they 're more disciplined than in the past and look like they 're on a mission to prove the doubters wrong .
and they simply have too much attacking firepower for the red devils .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 sunday , september 19 st. pauli-hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. pauli fans will hope their outlaw act intimidates their city rivals of the true city derbies in german football , this one is the best .
on paper , pauli are completely overmatched against hamburg .
but that 's on paper .
taking to the field in millerntor stadium with ac / dc 's hell 's bells ringing in your ears is something that can impress even the likes of ruud van nistelrooy .
and somewhere within all that ringing i hear the sound of an upset .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 dortmund-schalke could things get any worse for schalke ?
they 're on a bad losing streak , and now they get a visit their bitterest rivals , who are off to a good start .
but i 'm not writing off schalke just yet , and i think two extra days rest will help them sneak a point .
prediction : 1-1 draw leverkusen-nuremberg leverkusen have lived up to their reputation as one of the bundesliga 's least consistent teams and will have thursday 's europa cup match weighing down their legs .
but i think nuremberg will be thrown off by the loss of their best striker , albert bunjaku , to injury for the rest of the year .

the eu ’ s commissioner for equal opportunities viviane reding has warned firms in europe to rapidly promote women into top jobs or face a 30 percent quota from next year . a european commission threat to elevate women by fixed quotas into top company jobs coincides with growing admissions in germany that this could be the only remaining option to redress the balance .
despite a pledge made nine years ago by german industry to voluntarily remove the “ glass ceiling ” blocking women , only 2.5 percent of board members of germany 's 200 largest companies are female .
and at the 100 firms with the highest turnover , only four board executives are women .
eu-wide the trend is much the same : the commission says 89 percent of board members of europe 's stock market-listed companies are males .
growing support for quotas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henkel now favors quotas for women hans-olaf henkel , ex-president of the german bdi industry federation , conceded recently that he no longer opposes a quota .
“ the fact that over the years hardly anything has happened shows that we 're not making headway . ”
personnel consultant heiner thorborg , the author of a book on why women do not make it into top jobs , said he too had once been an opponent of quotas .
“ but when i consider that my 12-year-old daughter will have to wait 200 years until something significant happens , then i say : the last modus is the quota , and it has to come ! ”
pressure mounts within bavarian csu even within bavaria 's tradionally conservative party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , women members want change .
bavarian justice minister beate merk told german public radio on thursday that she wants a 40 percent women 's quota on party committees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goodwill is not enough , says bavaria 's justice minister beate merk .
“ we 've seen that all the goodwill and effort has n't helped . ”
female participation in party membership , currently at 18 percent , was dwindling , she added . “ we want a quota .
women voters can only be won over when women can participate in politics and when women have the chance to move into positions of leadership . ”
family minister seeks concensus federal family minister kristina schroeder favors industry 's goodwill as before .
“ what we need are political changes that we 'll best achieve with the support of commerce , not in battle against industry . ”
schroeder 's ministry has initiated the drafting of a voluntary “ code for good management . ”
apart from one woman , its code commission is made up of male executives .
like commissioner reding , business studies professor ulrike detmers points to research findings showing that firms with a balanced male-female mix benefit all round , including gains in profitability : “ goals are reached much more quickly .
meetings run more efficiently .
when the women present are also mothers then one comes straight to the point . ” what 's needed , she says , is “ better childcare , more flexible hours ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's high time to redress the balance , if necessary by force , says viviane reding but some in germany maintain that such progress can not be legislated .
the president of the german chambers of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , hans heinrich driftmann , says that the lack of women in senior positions can be attributed to a number of reasons , including the difficulty of balancing family and work , and women 's tendency to avoid technical and scientific career paths .
" a legal quota ca n't really influence such wide-ranging underlying causes , and for that reason , i would argue against imposing one , " driftmann told the german daily paper die welt .
" i was recruited to my career on the basis of my qualifications , not because of my sex , " said marie-christine ostermann , a 32-year-old executive who also chairs germany 's association of young business leaders .
" had a quota been in place , i would have felt as if i had been reduced to a gender . "
germany falling back in international rankings in overall gender inequality terms , germany has fallen back in recent years , according to the world economic forum 's latest survey .
from being ranked fifth among 128 nations in 2006 , germany has slipped to 12th place .
topping the list are scandinavian nations .
the forum 's scoring is based on 30 indicators , including women 's access to education and chances for economic participation .
in one of several nationwide studies , the german institute for economic research , the diw , found that most women in employment remain confined to lower-paid jobs , and if they do enter senior management , then this tends to happen in service sectors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sattelberg says ' old boys networks ' persist everywhere the luebeck-based survey institute databyte says the presence of women in middle to upper management nationwide is 17 percent , but its survey of 940,000 firms shows marked regional variety . berlin tops with a women 's quota of 19 percent , closely followed by germany 's post-unification eastern states .
the tail-ender is baden-wurttemberg in southwestern germany with below 15 percent .
firm size also plays a role – women play bigger roles in smaller firms , including the retailing and the health sector in eastern germany .
one of the few german companies to self-impose its own women 's quota is deutsche telekom .
its goal is 30 percent by 2015 , but senior telekom employees fear that a decade of appeals and promises has not worked .
" old boys network " still prevails “ i think we have underestimated one thing – the ever-present dna , the ' old boys networks ' that shape company cultures , also in the sense of propagating traditional role models , " telekom 's head of personnel , thomas sattelberg said . professor detmer doubts that germany 's current government will move beyond soliciting goodwill .
“ out of consideration for industry 's interests , i do n't think the federal government will make the hard choices . ”

firm size also plays a role – women play bigger roles in smaller firms , including the retailing and the health sector in eastern germany .
one of the few german companies to self-impose its own women 's quota is deutsche telekom .
its goal is 30 percent by 2015 , but senior telekom employees fear that a decade of appeals and promises has not worked .
" old boys network " still prevails “ i think we have underestimated one thing – the ever-present dna , the ' old boys networks ' that shape company cultures , also in the sense of propagating traditional role models , " telekom 's head of personnel , thomas sattelberg said . professor detmer doubts that germany 's current government will move beyond soliciting goodwill .
“ out of consideration for industry 's interests , i do n't think the federal government will make the hard choices . ”

another man was arrested about eight hours later .
the police said officers had been searching two businesses and eight homes in the capital since the arrests , but had found no weapons or dangerous materials .
media reports suggested the arrests were likely linked to the papal visit , an issue on which the police would not comment .
the presence of pope benedict xvi in london meant that the british capital was already on high alert before friday 's raids .
" we 're totally calm , the pope is happy , " vatican spokesman federico lombardi said when reporters told him about the arrests .
" we can say that we 're totally confident in the work of the police . "
papal schedule unchanged the pope attended a service at london 's westminster abbey on friday led by archbishop of canterbury rowan williams , the leader of the world 's anglican church .
the two church leaders then met at lambeth palace , the anglican archbishop 's london residence , for historic talks : no pontiff had visited lambeth palace or visited the historic abbey since the foundation of the church of england when king henry viii broke with rome in 1534 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some object to benedict 's handling of the sex scandal benedict also delivered a speech at westminster hall - the historic heart of the houses of parliament - and addressed some 3,000 young catholics at an event in southwest london .
anti-church protests continue the run-up to the visit was clouded by criticism of the catholic church 's handling of a child abuse scandal and a furore over the trip 's cost : 20 million gbp -lrb- 37 million euros -rrb- .
there were protests before benedict 's engagement with young people in twickenham on friday , in the southwest of the british capital , with around 20 demonstrators waving banners with slogans saying , " there is no god - get over it ! " or " the pope is wrong , put a condom on ! "
on his flight to britain , benedict made some of his strongest comments yet on the paedophilia controversy , saying revelations of child abuse by priests that have rocked the catholic church " were a shock to me . "
he added that " the authorities in the church have not been vigilant enough . "
the church " did not act quickly or firmly enough to take the necessary action " to stop the problem , which involved abuse by priests and catholic teachers in ireland , germany , and a number of other countries around europe .
while in london , benedict was expected to meet a group of 10 victims of abuse , either on friday or saturday .
first pope to make ' state visit ' to england on the first day of the pope 's visit , he warned of the risk of " aggressive secularism " in britain and greeted tens of thousands of people at a mass in glasgow and on the streets of edinburgh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen cordially invited the pope to britain herself " the united kingdom strives to be a modern and multicultural society , " benedict xvi said .
" in this challenging enterprise , may it always maintain its respect for those traditional values and cultural expressions that more aggressive forms of secularism no longer value or even tolerate . "
the pontiff also met queen elizabeth ii while in edinburgh : " i am delighted to welcome you to the uk and particularly to scotland on your first visit as pope , " the queen said .
this is the first papal visit to the uk to be classified as a state visit , because it was elizabeth ii who invited the pontiff , not the church .
benedict xvi and the queen focused on the positive aspects of relations between predominantly anglican britain and the roman catholic church , two bodies which the queen said shared " a common christian heritage . "
on sunday , benedict will travel to the central english city of birmingham for the final day of his visit , where he will preside over the beatification of a 19th century cardinal , john henry newman .

cheers !
with oktoberfest about to kick off in munich , we asked our facebook users about their oktoberfest experiences , the good and the bad .
here 's a selection of their comments . have you ever been to oktoberfest ?
ha , i never went to oktoberfest while i was living in germany .
i am a born and bred berliner .
that explains it i guess .
however , i 've been to numerous oktoberfests in new zealand .
they are put on each year by the new zealand german business association in auckland and they rock , i mean ooompah !
so much fun - this year 's is on this friday . - anja yes !
and it was very memorable .
i went in munich for the 2000 oktoberfest !
we arrived very early and picked a tent and it was packed !
we squeezed in with a table and started drinking , and soon everyone was talking , dancing and singing and they locked the doors .
later , some star guests arrived ; some soccer players and a man with a dog , and the crowd went wild .
i still have the little woven heart trinket i bought . - laura yes .
when i was a student of goethe institut hong kong , i attended the oktoberfest party at the open car park of the marco polo hotel .
the marco polo oktoberfest is now very famous in hong kong .
it 's all about german food , beer , dancing and a swiss band .
but after all the years , it is still unchanged .
i 'll attend too this year , and see if the swiss band will still sing the same songs and play the same games .
but no change could be nice , because it 's a good atmosphere and memories every time . - paskol yeah , i went with my colleagues when i lived in germany last year .
we spent a long time walking around as there were no places to sit but it was a great atmosphere .
in the end we learned that it 's better to book in advance so we sat at odeonsplatz instead and had some beers . - hannah when i was stationed as a soldier in offenbach / main in 1958 , i made friends with a young german and we decided at the last minute to go to the oktoberfest on his motorcycle .
once there we hunted and hunted for a place to spend the night but everything was booked .
we ended up sleeping on big oil cans at a gas station .
had a great time though . - bill yes .
i was there last year with five friends in the second weekend .
it was wonderful and the weather was very good .
we do n't remember the number of beer mugs we drank , but we had a good time .
i suppose we will remember that weekend until our last minute in this world . - francisco horrible experience .
everybody was drunk and the whole thing was pretty boring ...
i prefer cologne 's carnival .
everyone 's drunk there as well , but at least it 's fun : they sing and dress up . - maria-lujan last year i was at the oktoberfest together with other students studying german at the goethe institut in schwaebisch hall .
a camera crew from the deutsche welle team filmed us while we experienced the oktoberfest for the first time .
it was such a fun and amazing experience !
i ended up going back to the wiesn four more times that year and each time i met interesting and fun people .
one of the things i liked best about the oktoberfest is how easy it is to meet people sitting near you and to strike up a conversation with them .
i also especially enjoyed standing on the benches , drinking lots of beer , and singing crazy german songs ! - benjamin compiled by stuart tiffen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when addressing issues of worldwide significance many nations need to be at the table , experts say . the united nations millennium development goals -lrb- mdg -rrb- include pledges to wipe out extreme poverty , achieve universal primary education , promote gender equality , reduce rates of child mortality , fight epidemic diseases , and develop a global partnership for development . the international nature of these global goals leaves individual nations struggling for effective solutions that transcend their borders .
that 's where " global governance " comes in .
it works to create international structures capable of dealing with issues of global significance , and the closer the mdgs come to their deadline of 2015 the clearer multinational cooperation becomes . states ' changing role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power structures are shifting from single states to larger organizations , like the g-20 " the old idea was that nation states need to be as independent as possible to be responsible to their own population , " said dirk messner , director of the german development institute .
" it 's now become clear that we are dealing with global interdependencies and that we have to politically organize them . " such organization is crucial for shared resources such as the climate , the food supply and energy , messner added .
while the united nations enjoys a high degree of respect when it comes to international debate , it suffers under its inability to take quick action in an emergency . " we 've just been through a small revolution that 's been overlooked by a lot of people : we 've seen the shift from a world economy organized by the g-8 to a g-20-organized global governance , which includes several emerging and developing nations that until now did not take part in the global development and political processes , " messner said . path to balanced agreements he added that having more countries at the table deciding on global issues would increase the likelihood that developing nations ' concerns are heard and that an agreement that balances the interests of the industrialized and developing world can be made . germany has shown itself to be interested in a finding a way to balance international interests , according to juergen zattler , the head of the german ministry for economic cooperation and development 's department for european and multinational development policy . " we hope that once the global governance structure is in place we can talk about a variety of topics , " he said .
" that members of the international community get closer together and more capable of taking action and that global deals can be made . " ngos out in the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un may represent a better place to make multilateral decisions while zattler said giving more influence to the g-20 would be a promising step toward successful multinational negotiation on the mdgs and climate change , a shift toward a g-20 dominated landscape still leaves civil non-national organizations in the cold , according to jens martens of the global policy forum europe . " civil groups and non-government organizations have a right to take part in discussions at the united nations , " he said .
" in other bodies , such as the g-20 , this is not the case .
it 's an exclusive club of governments that meets behind closed doors . " instead of creating new organizations designed to quicken decision making by circumventing the un , martens said the world body deserved strengthening - despite its cumbersome nature . " the more parties take part the harder it gets - that 's democracy , " he said .
" but it 's worth the effort to make truly representative decisions and to take into account the interests of the groups that otherwise do n't have a say .
in terms of the millennium goals it 's the interests of the world 's poorest people . " author : heiner kiesel -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's reporter offers a homeboy view of an area usually dismissed as a ghetto . recently , while eating a taco at a joint near where i live in berlin 's neukoelln neighborhood , i overheard a telling conversation .
two young english-speaking women , probably around 20 and obviously recent arrivals to our fair city , were talking about the difficulty of finding a suitably located apartment .
" it sucks being in prenzlauer berg , " sighed one .
" i have to travel 30 minutes to get to a decent bar . "
i nearly blew mole sauce through my nostrils laughing .
eleven years ago , when i permanently moved to berlin , my entire circle of friends lived in the prenzlauer berg and mitte districts in the former east and would draw air circles beside their temples upon learning i 'd chosen to invest in property south of the river spree .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neukoelln is still very international back then , neukoelln existed in the popular imagination only as a kind of forbidden zone for lower-class alcoholics , people who chronically forgot to take their lithium and double-digit turkish families roasting whole lambs in three-room tenement flats .
but times change , and cities with them .
these days , most parts of prenzlauer berg offer all the charm and excitement of a pta meeting , whereas it 's virtually impossible to spit across the street in the northern section neukoelln without hitting an independent fashion designer 's studio or a bar staffed by people who look like occasional members of the arcade fire .
as recently as 2006 , neukoelln attracted the opprobrium of the nation , after teachers at a neighborhood high school wrote to the mayor complaining that it was too dangerous to hold any kind of instruction in .
fast forward to now and hipsters sport t-shirts reading " i 'm a ruetli student . "
gentrification happens elsewhere the first step toward gentrification ?
i 'll never know exactly what the term means , other than a place someone liked being taken over by people whom that person does n't like .
what i do know is that in the past 10 years the value of my apartment has roughly doubled , and i can get reasonably authentic mexican food without having to inflict undue wear and tear on the soles of my adidas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this 1920 's housing estate in neukoelln is a unesco world heritage site walk down weserstrasse , which has become the street of choice for many 20-somethings to get hammered , and most of the bars still feel like they 're being run by students on the very edge of legality .
moreover , i doubt neukoelln could go the prenzlauer berg-mitte route , even if it wanted to .
first of all , it 's much bigger , and over 20 percent of its 300,000-plus inhabitants are foreigners - the vast majority working-class turkish people , and not ex-pat computer programmers from new york or london .
ironically , one reason student-types first begin moving in was because the u8 subway line was an easy connection up to the then-trendy districts in the east .
they 've since discovered that it 's more fun to stay in their own neighborhood to party .
and for the time being , at least , i 'm having fun watching them do it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 17.09.2010 german machine builders are leery of outsourcing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's buemi views quality as competitive edge mechanical engineering is a pillar of the german economy .
while machine builders can save costs in the short term by outsourcing production , in the long term , they can hurt themselves and the national economy . for years , german industry has faced growing international competition .
emerging markets such as china , india and brazil have already become big competitors , and a number of african countries could join the fray someday .
the prospect of lower labor costs has led many german machine builders to move parts or even all of their production abroad to stay competitive .
but some companies , like buemi in gevelsberg near wuppertal , view the outsourcing trend with skepticism .
buemi manufactures precision parts , such as axels , shafts , sockets and studs , for machine tools and trains .
the company is viewed as one of the " hidden champions " of german industry .
its customers include thyssen-krupp , siemens , komatsu and bombardier transportation .
maintaining a standard of living buemi managing director frank mittag has been at the helm of the company for 15 years .
he views germany as a manufacturing nation that relies on a powerful mechanical engineering sector .
and it 's thanks to the country 's competitive manufacturing base that services such as information technology can be easily outsourced .
" but if we rely solely on services , we will not be able to maintain our standard of living , " mittag says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : managing director frank mittag warns about being blinded by short-term cost benefits in a high-wage country like germany , the managing director asserts , there is only one alternative : quality .
that means precision , innovation , reliability and longevity .
competing on price is n't an option for germany .
so while german machine builders can lower operating costs by outsourcing some production , it 's important they retain their core competencies at home , according to mittag .
" if we transfer abroad our innovative production processes and the constructions we need to achieve superior quality and reliability , then we destroy the very competitive edge we need to compete with low-wage countries , " he says , adding that it ’ s also important to have a high-quality supplier network in germany .
long-term costs mittag sees little sense in establishing a supplier network abroad and investing heavily to trim it for quality .
there 's a risk of important know-how seeping out .
moreover , the short-term cost advantage of this strategy would only be achieved with long-term disadvantages .
" the first costs people notice are from purchasing , " mittag says .
" other costs like those for quality assurance or production downtimes , processing and marketing are often overlooked in outsourcing projects . "
once these factors are considered in the equation , unit production costs rise , he adds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other machine builders have become cautious about outsourcing buemi has polled other machine builders that have become more cautious with their international expansion .
many medium-sized companies have established subsidiaries in china , whose operations were quickly replicated by competitors next door .
the damage can be huge .
many attribute the rise of china 's auto industry to german mechanical engineering firms that have established production facilities in the country .
know-how transfer is inevitable in such a global economy , but mittag warns nonetheless that companies outsourcing production in china should need to move cautiously and not be blinded by the short-term cost benefits .
today , germany 's mechanical engineering sector has a 10 to 20 year lead on its competitors in asia , according to mittag .
but to maintain that lead , he says , the sector must continue to strive for top quality , which can only be achieved with skilled employees .
" honesty , decency and conscientiousness , " mittag says , are indispensable because if business is driven only by a near insatiable hunger for higher profits , the quality of work and the products will suffer .

while machine builders can save costs in the short term by outsourcing production , in the long term , they can hurt themselves and the national economy . for years , german industry has faced growing international competition .
emerging markets such as china , india and brazil have already become big competitors , and a number of african countries could join the fray someday .
the prospect of lower labor costs has led many german machine builders to move parts or even all of their production abroad to stay competitive .
but some companies , like buemi in gevelsberg near wuppertal , view the outsourcing trend with skepticism .
buemi manufactures precision parts , such as axels , shafts , sockets and studs , for machine tools and trains .
the company is viewed as one of the " hidden champions " of german industry .
its customers include thyssen-krupp , siemens , komatsu and bombardier transportation .
maintaining a standard of living buemi managing director frank mittag has been at the helm of the company for 15 years .
he views germany as a manufacturing nation that relies on a powerful mechanical engineering sector .
and it 's thanks to the country 's competitive manufacturing base that services such as information technology can be easily outsourced .
" but if we rely solely on services , we will not be able to maintain our standard of living , " mittag says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : managing director frank mittag warns about being blinded by short-term cost benefits in a high-wage country like germany , the managing director asserts , there is only one alternative : quality .
that means precision , innovation , reliability and longevity .
competing on price is n't an option for germany .
so while german machine builders can lower operating costs by outsourcing some production , it 's important they retain their core competencies at home , according to mittag .
" if we transfer abroad our innovative production processes and the constructions we need to achieve superior quality and reliability , then we destroy the very competitive edge we need to compete with low-wage countries , " he says , adding that it ’ s also important to have a high-quality supplier network in germany .
long-term costs mittag sees little sense in establishing a supplier network abroad and investing heavily to trim it for quality .
there 's a risk of important know-how seeping out .
moreover , the short-term cost advantage of this strategy would only be achieved with long-term disadvantages .
" the first costs people notice are from purchasing , " mittag says .
" other costs like those for quality assurance or production downtimes , processing and marketing are often overlooked in outsourcing projects . "
once these factors are considered in the equation , unit production costs rise , he adds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other machine builders have become cautious about outsourcing buemi has polled other machine builders that have become more cautious with their international expansion .
many medium-sized companies have established subsidiaries in china , whose operations were quickly replicated by competitors next door .
the damage can be huge .
many attribute the rise of china 's auto industry to german mechanical engineering firms that have established production facilities in the country .
know-how transfer is inevitable in such a global economy , but mittag warns nonetheless that companies outsourcing production in china should need to move cautiously and not be blinded by the short-term cost benefits .
today , germany 's mechanical engineering sector has a 10 to 20 year lead on its competitors in asia , according to mittag .
but to maintain that lead , he says , the sector must continue to strive for top quality , which can only be achieved with skilled employees .
" honesty , decency and conscientiousness , " mittag says , are indispensable because if business is driven only by a near insatiable hunger for higher profits , the quality of work and the products will suffer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 17.09.2010 germany 's forgotten performer valeska gert helped inspire punks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always a non-conformist , gert broke new ground in music and performance more than 30 years after her death , admirers pay tribute to one of germany 's most enigmatic - and overlooked - artists , dancer and actress valeska gert .
she 's said to have laid the foundations for the punk movement . " i saw her on television in 1977 when she was 86 and i thought , she has short hair , a colorful dress , she 's tough and living in the present , she 's a real punk because she does n't care about her image , " said artist and musician wolfgang mueller at the opening night of a new exhibition dedicated to valeska gert . the show in berlin 's hamburger bahnhof coincides with the launch of a mueller 's new biography on the performer .
" when she died in 1978 people took care of her letters and found correspondence from punks who said , we would like to know you and to meet you , " he said . indeed , valeska gert 's appearance on a tv talk show in the late 1970 's re-ignited interest in one of germany 's most enigmatic artistic figures .
her acceptance , at the age of 86 , by the burgeoning punk movement is as much a testament to her brash , no-nonsense energy as it is to her artistic achievements .
since then she has remained a marginal curio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this self-designed costume , pictured in 1931 , foreshadows 60 's fashions gert was born gertrud valesca samosch to a jewish family in berlin in 1892 .
showing no interest in academia , gert began taking dance lessons at the age of nine , and by 1915 was studying acting with alexander moissi .
her leanings toward the performing arts , combined with the detrimental effects of world war i on her father 's finances , led her to seek employment and she soon made appearances at the munich kammerspiele , the deutsches theater and the berliner tribuene . radical experiments on stage as the 1920 's progressed , she also began appearing in silent cinema , performing in " the threepenny opera , " " diary of a lost girl " with iconic flapper louise brooks , and g. w. pabst 's " joyless street . " it was around this time that gert unveiled one of her most enduring performance works .
entitled " pause , " it was an interpretative anti-dance performed between reels in cinemas , designed to draw attention to stillness and serenity . " it was so radical just to go on stage in the cinema stand there and do nothing , " said wolfgang mueller , " she did this in the 20 's where the convention was speed , business , activity and you see this in the films of the 20 's : big cities , traffic , nervosity .
to go out there and do the complete opposite was very , very modern . " by 1933 , with the nazis in power , gert suffered a ban from the german stage due to her jewish heritage .
she moved to london where she continued to perform on stage and appeared in the experimental short film " pett and pot " directed by alberto cavalcanti .
it would be her last film work until her triumphant return to the cinema in the mid-1960 's . trend setting with ' freedom from taste ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare 1969 recording of baby is screened at the pause exhibition by 1938 , in her late 40 's and living in new york but , gert found it virtually impossible to revive her previous career .
she lived on the welfare of a jewish refugee community , washed dishes and posed as a nude model .
in 1941 , she opened the bettlerbar -lrb- beggar 's bar -rrb- , a ramshackle cabaret / restaurant filled with mismatched furniture and staffed by the likes of jackson pollock and tennessee williams , the latter being fired by gert for being " too sloppy . " although licensing requirements forced the new york bar to close , gert introduced the concept to germany upon her return in 1950 .
it has proved perhaps her most enduring legacy ; tumbledown bars furnished with random pieces of flea-market chic and junk store accessories have since become legion in berlin , a fad started by gert which wolfgang mueller terms " freedom from taste . " back in post-war berlin , she once again had to start from scratch .
in the same 1977 television show , the interviewer tactfully suggested that by the dawn of the 1950 's gert was perhaps not so well remembered as before .
with typical self-depricating humor and bluntness typical for berliners , she exclaimed , " not so well remembered ?
i was totally forgotten ! " she opened the hexenkueche -lrb- witch 's kitchen -rrb- cabaret and made a triumphant return to the silver screen with an appearance in the 1965 surrealist drama " juliet of the spirits , " directed by frederico fellini .
she was soon cast in other high profile projects by rainer werner fassbinder 's and volker schloendorff . well outside the box bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the valeska gert exhibition is on display at the hamburger bahnhof until february 2011 while valeska gert has had a small but solid fan base , widespread fame always eluded her and , especially in the intervening years , she has become very much a marginalized character .
" i think she is a bit invisible , " said wolfgang mueller , " she is not known because she always ignored borders .
she was always far away from these boxes that the art scene puts people in . " however , 2010 may well see an upswing in gert 's popularity ; the exhibition dedicated to her work has a generous five-month run , while the martin schmitz publishing house has not only released mueller 's definitive new biography but also a 7 " vinyl recording of her 1969 performance of " baby , " an impersonation of a gurgling child alternating between rage and happiness . historian an paenhuysen , the curator of the new exhibition in berlin , was new to gert 's world before taking on this project ; now she is a devoted fan .
" valeska gert made work that is still very contemporary .
it still works for today , " she said .
" it 's very familiar and at the same time very strange , frightening .
it touches you .
it 's really hard to sum her up .
you ca n't name her or put her in a box . " author : neale lytollis editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's reporter offers a homeboy view of an area usually dismissed as a ghetto . recently , while eating a taco at a joint near where i live in berlin 's neukoelln neighborhood , i overheard a telling conversation .
two young english-speaking women , probably around 20 and obviously recent arrivals to our fair city , were talking about the difficulty of finding a suitably located apartment .
" it sucks being in prenzlauer berg , " sighed one .
" i have to travel 30 minutes to get to a decent bar . "
i nearly blew mole sauce through my nostrils laughing .
eleven years ago , when i permanently moved to berlin , my entire circle of friends lived in the prenzlauer berg and mitte districts in the former east and would draw air circles beside their temples upon learning i 'd chosen to invest in property south of the river spree .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neukoelln is still very international back then , neukoelln existed in the popular imagination only as a kind of forbidden zone for lower-class alcoholics , people who chronically forgot to take their lithium and double-digit turkish families roasting whole lambs in three-room tenement flats .
but times change , and cities with them .
these days , most parts of prenzlauer berg offer all the charm and excitement of a pta meeting , whereas it 's virtually impossible to spit across the street in the northern section neukoelln without hitting an independent fashion designer 's studio or a bar staffed by people who look like occasional members of the arcade fire .
as recently as 2006 , neukoelln attracted the opprobrium of the nation , after teachers at a neighborhood high school wrote to the mayor complaining that it was too dangerous to hold any kind of instruction in .
fast forward to now and hipsters sport t-shirts reading " i 'm a ruetli student . "
gentrification happens elsewhere the first step toward gentrification ?
i 'll never know exactly what the term means , other than a place someone liked being taken over by people whom that person does n't like .
what i do know is that in the past 10 years the value of my apartment has roughly doubled , and i can get reasonably authentic mexican food without having to inflict undue wear and tear on the soles of my adidas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this 1920 's housing estate in neukoelln is a unesco world heritage site walk down weserstrasse , which has become the street of choice for many 20-somethings to get hammered , and most of the bars still feel like they 're being run by students on the very edge of legality .
moreover , i doubt neukoelln could go the prenzlauer berg-mitte route , even if it wanted to .
first of all , it 's much bigger , and over 20 percent of its 300,000-plus inhabitants are foreigners - the vast majority working-class turkish people , and not ex-pat computer programmers from new york or london .
ironically , one reason student-types first begin moving in was because the u8 subway line was an easy connection up to the then-trendy districts in the east .
they 've since discovered that it 's more fun to stay in their own neighborhood to party .
and for the time being , at least , i 'm having fun watching them do it .

when addressing issues of worldwide significance many nations need to be at the table , experts say . the united nations millennium development goals -lrb- mdg -rrb- include pledges to wipe out extreme poverty , achieve universal primary education , promote gender equality , reduce rates of child mortality , fight epidemic diseases , and develop a global partnership for development . the international nature of these global goals leaves individual nations struggling for effective solutions that transcend their borders .
that 's where " global governance " comes in .
it works to create international structures capable of dealing with issues of global significance , and the closer the mdgs come to their deadline of 2015 the clearer multinational cooperation becomes . states ' changing role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power structures are shifting from single states to larger organizations , like the g-20 " the old idea was that nation states need to be as independent as possible to be responsible to their own population , " said dirk messner , director of the german development institute .
" it 's now become clear that we are dealing with global interdependencies and that we have to politically organize them . " such organization is crucial for shared resources such as the climate , the food supply and energy , messner added .
while the united nations enjoys a high degree of respect when it comes to international debate , it suffers under its inability to take quick action in an emergency . " we 've just been through a small revolution that 's been overlooked by a lot of people : we 've seen the shift from a world economy organized by the g-8 to a g-20-organized global governance , which includes several emerging and developing nations that until now did not take part in the global development and political processes , " messner said . path to balanced agreements he added that having more countries at the table deciding on global issues would increase the likelihood that developing nations ' concerns are heard and that an agreement that balances the interests of the industrialized and developing world can be made . germany has shown itself to be interested in a finding a way to balance international interests , according to juergen zattler , the head of the german ministry for economic cooperation and development 's department for european and multinational development policy . " we hope that once the global governance structure is in place we can talk about a variety of topics , " he said .
" that members of the international community get closer together and more capable of taking action and that global deals can be made . " ngos out in the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un may represent a better place to make multilateral decisions while zattler said giving more influence to the g-20 would be a promising step toward successful multinational negotiation on the mdgs and climate change , a shift toward a g-20 dominated landscape still leaves civil non-national organizations in the cold , according to jens martens of the global policy forum europe . " civil groups and non-government organizations have a right to take part in discussions at the united nations , " he said .
" in other bodies , such as the g-20 , this is not the case .
it 's an exclusive club of governments that meets behind closed doors . " instead of creating new organizations designed to quicken decision making by circumventing the un , martens said the world body deserved strengthening - despite its cumbersome nature . " the more parties take part the harder it gets - that 's democracy , " he said .
" but it 's worth the effort to make truly representative decisions and to take into account the interests of the groups that otherwise do n't have a say .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 17.09.2010 in further proof that pigs can fly , berlin 's neukoelln is the place to be großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unloved , underprivileged district south of the river spree has become a magnet for berlin scenesters .
dw 's reporter offers a homeboy view of an area usually dismissed as a ghetto . recently , while eating a taco at a joint near where i live in berlin 's neukoelln neighborhood , i overheard a telling conversation .
two young english-speaking women , probably around 20 and obviously recent arrivals to our fair city , were talking about the difficulty of finding a suitably located apartment .
" it sucks being in prenzlauer berg , " sighed one .
" i have to travel 30 minutes to get to a decent bar . "
i nearly blew mole sauce through my nostrils laughing .
eleven years ago , when i permanently moved to berlin , my entire circle of friends lived in the prenzlauer berg and mitte districts in the former east and would draw air circles beside their temples upon learning i 'd chosen to invest in property south of the river spree .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neukoelln is still very international back then , neukoelln existed in the popular imagination only as a kind of forbidden zone for lower-class alcoholics , people who chronically forgot to take their lithium and double-digit turkish families roasting whole lambs in three-room tenement flats .
but times change , and cities with them .
these days , most parts of prenzlauer berg offer all the charm and excitement of a pta meeting , whereas it 's virtually impossible to spit across the street in the northern section neukoelln without hitting an independent fashion designer 's studio or a bar staffed by people who look like occasional members of the arcade fire .
as recently as 2006 , neukoelln attracted the opprobrium of the nation , after teachers at a neighborhood high school wrote to the mayor complaining that it was too dangerous to hold any kind of instruction in .
fast forward to now and hipsters sport t-shirts reading " i 'm a ruetli student . "
gentrification happens elsewhere the first step toward gentrification ?
i 'll never know exactly what the term means , other than a place someone liked being taken over by people whom that person does n't like .
what i do know is that in the past 10 years the value of my apartment has roughly doubled , and i can get reasonably authentic mexican food without having to inflict undue wear and tear on the soles of my adidas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this 1920 's housing estate in neukoelln is a unesco world heritage site walk down weserstrasse , which has become the street of choice for many 20-somethings to get hammered , and most of the bars still feel like they 're being run by students on the very edge of legality .
moreover , i doubt neukoelln could go the prenzlauer berg-mitte route , even if it wanted to .
first of all , it 's much bigger , and over 20 percent of its 300,000-plus inhabitants are foreigners - the vast majority working-class turkish people , and not ex-pat computer programmers from new york or london .
ironically , one reason student-types first begin moving in was because the u8 subway line was an easy connection up to the then-trendy districts in the east .
they 've since discovered that it 's more fun to stay in their own neighborhood to party .
and for the time being , at least , i 'm having fun watching them do it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 17.09.2010 germany 's forgotten performer valeska gert helped inspire punks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always a non-conformist , gert broke new ground in music and performance more than 30 years after her death , admirers pay tribute to one of germany 's most enigmatic - and overlooked - artists , dancer and actress valeska gert .
she 's said to have laid the foundations for the punk movement . " i saw her on television in 1977 when she was 86 and i thought , she has short hair , a colorful dress , she 's tough and living in the present , she 's a real punk because she does n't care about her image , " said artist and musician wolfgang mueller at the opening night of a new exhibition dedicated to valeska gert . the show in berlin 's hamburger bahnhof coincides with the launch of a mueller 's new biography on the performer .
" when she died in 1978 people took care of her letters and found correspondence from punks who said , we would like to know you and to meet you , " he said . indeed , valeska gert 's appearance on a tv talk show in the late 1970 's re-ignited interest in one of germany 's most enigmatic artistic figures .
her acceptance , at the age of 86 , by the burgeoning punk movement is as much a testament to her brash , no-nonsense energy as it is to her artistic achievements .
since then she has remained a marginal curio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this self-designed costume , pictured in 1931 , foreshadows 60 's fashions gert was born gertrud valesca samosch to a jewish family in berlin in 1892 .
showing no interest in academia , gert began taking dance lessons at the age of nine , and by 1915 was studying acting with alexander moissi .
her leanings toward the performing arts , combined with the detrimental effects of world war i on her father 's finances , led her to seek employment and she soon made appearances at the munich kammerspiele , the deutsches theater and the berliner tribuene . radical experiments on stage as the 1920 's progressed , she also began appearing in silent cinema , performing in " the threepenny opera , " " diary of a lost girl " with iconic flapper louise brooks , and g. w. pabst 's " joyless street . " it was around this time that gert unveiled one of her most enduring performance works .
entitled " pause , " it was an interpretative anti-dance performed between reels in cinemas , designed to draw attention to stillness and serenity . " it was so radical just to go on stage in the cinema stand there and do nothing , " said wolfgang mueller , " she did this in the 20 's where the convention was speed , business , activity and you see this in the films of the 20 's : big cities , traffic , nervosity .
to go out there and do the complete opposite was very , very modern . " by 1933 , with the nazis in power , gert suffered a ban from the german stage due to her jewish heritage .
she moved to london where she continued to perform on stage and appeared in the experimental short film " pett and pot " directed by alberto cavalcanti .
it would be her last film work until her triumphant return to the cinema in the mid-1960 's . trend setting with ' freedom from taste ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare 1969 recording of baby is screened at the pause exhibition by 1938 , in her late 40 's and living in new york but , gert found it virtually impossible to revive her previous career .
she lived on the welfare of a jewish refugee community , washed dishes and posed as a nude model .
in 1941 , she opened the bettlerbar -lrb- beggar 's bar -rrb- , a ramshackle cabaret / restaurant filled with mismatched furniture and staffed by the likes of jackson pollock and tennessee williams , the latter being fired by gert for being " too sloppy . " although licensing requirements forced the new york bar to close , gert introduced the concept to germany upon her return in 1950 .
it has proved perhaps her most enduring legacy ; tumbledown bars furnished with random pieces of flea-market chic and junk store accessories have since become legion in berlin , a fad started by gert which wolfgang mueller terms " freedom from taste . " back in post-war berlin , she once again had to start from scratch .
in the same 1977 television show , the interviewer tactfully suggested that by the dawn of the 1950 's gert was perhaps not so well remembered as before .
with typical self-depricating humor and bluntness typical for berliners , she exclaimed , " not so well remembered ?
i was totally forgotten ! " she opened the hexenkueche -lrb- witch 's kitchen -rrb- cabaret and made a triumphant return to the silver screen with an appearance in the 1965 surrealist drama " juliet of the spirits , " directed by frederico fellini .
she was soon cast in other high profile projects by rainer werner fassbinder 's and volker schloendorff . well outside the box bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the valeska gert exhibition is on display at the hamburger bahnhof until february 2011 while valeska gert has had a small but solid fan base , widespread fame always eluded her and , especially in the intervening years , she has become very much a marginalized character .
" i think she is a bit invisible , " said wolfgang mueller , " she is not known because she always ignored borders .
she was always far away from these boxes that the art scene puts people in . " however , 2010 may well see an upswing in gert 's popularity ; the exhibition dedicated to her work has a generous five-month run , while the martin schmitz publishing house has not only released mueller 's definitive new biography but also a 7 " vinyl recording of her 1969 performance of " baby , " an impersonation of a gurgling child alternating between rage and happiness . historian an paenhuysen , the curator of the new exhibition in berlin , was new to gert 's world before taking on this project ; now she is a devoted fan .
" valeska gert made work that is still very contemporary .
it still works for today , " she said .
" it 's very familiar and at the same time very strange , frightening .
it touches you .
it 's really hard to sum her up .

when addressing issues of worldwide significance many nations need to be at the table , experts say . the united nations millennium development goals -lrb- mdg -rrb- include pledges to wipe out extreme poverty , achieve universal primary education , promote gender equality , reduce rates of child mortality , fight epidemic diseases , and develop a global partnership for development . the international nature of these global goals leaves individual nations struggling for effective solutions that transcend their borders .
that 's where " global governance " comes in .
it works to create international structures capable of dealing with issues of global significance , and the closer the mdgs come to their deadline of 2015 the clearer multinational cooperation becomes . states ' changing role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power structures are shifting from single states to larger organizations , like the g-20 " the old idea was that nation states need to be as independent as possible to be responsible to their own population , " said dirk messner , director of the german development institute .
" it 's now become clear that we are dealing with global interdependencies and that we have to politically organize them . " such organization is crucial for shared resources such as the climate , the food supply and energy , messner added .
while the united nations enjoys a high degree of respect when it comes to international debate , it suffers under its inability to take quick action in an emergency . " we 've just been through a small revolution that 's been overlooked by a lot of people : we 've seen the shift from a world economy organized by the g-8 to a g-20-organized global governance , which includes several emerging and developing nations that until now did not take part in the global development and political processes , " messner said . path to balanced agreements he added that having more countries at the table deciding on global issues would increase the likelihood that developing nations ' concerns are heard and that an agreement that balances the interests of the industrialized and developing world can be made . germany has shown itself to be interested in a finding a way to balance international interests , according to juergen zattler , the head of the german ministry for economic cooperation and development 's department for european and multinational development policy . " we hope that once the global governance structure is in place we can talk about a variety of topics , " he said .
" that members of the international community get closer together and more capable of taking action and that global deals can be made . " ngos out in the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un may represent a better place to make multilateral decisions while zattler said giving more influence to the g-20 would be a promising step toward successful multinational negotiation on the mdgs and climate change , a shift toward a g-20 dominated landscape still leaves civil non-national organizations in the cold , according to jens martens of the global policy forum europe . " civil groups and non-government organizations have a right to take part in discussions at the united nations , " he said .
" in other bodies , such as the g-20 , this is not the case .
it 's an exclusive club of governments that meets behind closed doors . " instead of creating new organizations designed to quicken decision making by circumventing the un , martens said the world body deserved strengthening - despite its cumbersome nature . " the more parties take part the harder it gets - that 's democracy , " he said .
" but it 's worth the effort to make truly representative decisions and to take into account the interests of the groups that otherwise do n't have a say .
in terms of the millennium goals it 's the interests of the world 's poorest people . " author : heiner kiesel -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 17.09.2010 german machine builders are leery of outsourcing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's buemi views quality as competitive edge mechanical engineering is a pillar of the german economy .
while machine builders can save costs in the short term by outsourcing production , in the long term , they can hurt themselves and the national economy . for years , german industry has faced growing international competition .
emerging markets such as china , india and brazil have already become big competitors , and a number of african countries could join the fray someday .
the prospect of lower labor costs has led many german machine builders to move parts or even all of their production abroad to stay competitive .
but some companies , like buemi in gevelsberg near wuppertal , view the outsourcing trend with skepticism .
buemi manufactures precision parts , such as axels , shafts , sockets and studs , for machine tools and trains .
the company is viewed as one of the " hidden champions " of german industry .
its customers include thyssen-krupp , siemens , komatsu and bombardier transportation .
maintaining a standard of living buemi managing director frank mittag has been at the helm of the company for 15 years .
he views germany as a manufacturing nation that relies on a powerful mechanical engineering sector .
and it 's thanks to the country 's competitive manufacturing base that services such as information technology can be easily outsourced .
" but if we rely solely on services , we will not be able to maintain our standard of living , " mittag says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : managing director frank mittag warns about being blinded by short-term cost benefits in a high-wage country like germany , the managing director asserts , there is only one alternative : quality .
that means precision , innovation , reliability and longevity .
competing on price is n't an option for germany .
so while german machine builders can lower operating costs by outsourcing some production , it 's important they retain their core competencies at home , according to mittag .
" if we transfer abroad our innovative production processes and the constructions we need to achieve superior quality and reliability , then we destroy the very competitive edge we need to compete with low-wage countries , " he says , adding that it ’ s also important to have a high-quality supplier network in germany .
long-term costs mittag sees little sense in establishing a supplier network abroad and investing heavily to trim it for quality .
there 's a risk of important know-how seeping out .
moreover , the short-term cost advantage of this strategy would only be achieved with long-term disadvantages .
" the first costs people notice are from purchasing , " mittag says .
" other costs like those for quality assurance or production downtimes , processing and marketing are often overlooked in outsourcing projects . "
once these factors are considered in the equation , unit production costs rise , he adds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other machine builders have become cautious about outsourcing buemi has polled other machine builders that have become more cautious with their international expansion .
many medium-sized companies have established subsidiaries in china , whose operations were quickly replicated by competitors next door .
the damage can be huge .
many attribute the rise of china 's auto industry to german mechanical engineering firms that have established production facilities in the country .
know-how transfer is inevitable in such a global economy , but mittag warns nonetheless that companies outsourcing production in china should need to move cautiously and not be blinded by the short-term cost benefits .
today , germany 's mechanical engineering sector has a 10 to 20 year lead on its competitors in asia , according to mittag .
but to maintain that lead , he says , the sector must continue to strive for top quality , which can only be achieved with skilled employees .
" honesty , decency and conscientiousness , " mittag says , are indispensable because if business is driven only by a near insatiable hunger for higher profits , the quality of work and the products will suffer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 17.09.2010 chinese electric cars could soon plug into germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese electric cars are headed for german cities in germany – home to bmw , daimler and vw – energy company rwe plans to help a chinese company launch its electric cars .
the move could pressure german carmakers to ramp up mass production of their own electric vehicles . rwe and china 's byd have teamed to bring electrical cars to germany , beginning with a trial fleet in 2011 .
a mass rollout in germany and several other european markets is planned the following year .
the deal with the chinese company , a battery specialist that has since expanded into car manufacturing , follows a string of agreements with other manufacturers , including france 's renault , japan 's nissan and daimler .
the centrepiece of the agreement is a package deal for electric car enthusiasts , consisting of byd 's electric vehicles and rwe 's fast-charging posts and electricity supplied exclusively from renewable sources .
two models will be initially available and targeted primarily at consumers in cities driving shorter distances .
already on the market the one model is a plug-in hybrid car that combines new electric and conventional internal combustion systems .
on the market in china since early this year , it has a range of between 60 and 100 kilometers when running only on electricity .
the other newer model will be a purely electric vehicle with a battery range of about 300 kilometers and an acceleration of 0 to 100 kilometers per hour within 10 seconds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe plans to charge electric cars with electricity from rewewable energy sources the package will include a fast-charging device from rwe , access to the company 's expanding network of public charging points – now at around 450 – and electricity generated by wind and solar systems .
rwe spokesman peter hoscheidt told deutsche welle that no decision has yet been reached on whether the cars and charging unit can be leased in addition to being purchased or both and what the prices will be .
but he said both options will be likely and prices will be attractive to garner attention .
in berlin , the german energy company is already collaborating with daimler in a field trial .
they 're testing smart cars powered by lithium-ion batteries , which can be charged at home and public supply points .
the collaboration is one of several electric car initiatives running under the german government 's e-mobility program .
seeking standardization through their collaboration , rwe and byd also hope to contribute to standardization efforts in the nascent electric car industry .
standardized components are crucial to kick start mass production .
but the standardization process of a new technology , like electrically powered cars , is often accompanied by power struggles between groups seeking recognition of their own systems as standards in order to collect royalty fees down the road .
bildunterschrift : rwe sees the day coming when " fill it up " is replaced by " charge it up " why the cooperation with a chinese manufacturer now ?
because the chinese , hoscheidt said , promise mass production by 2012 , thus ensuring a sufficient supply of competitively priced vehicles .
" this is by no means an exclusive agreement , " he said .
" we 're seeking partners to push electric cars .
the sooner they can deliver , the better . "
coveted battery technolgy earlier this year , byd and daimler signed an agreement to develop and build electric cars for the chinese market .
the cars will be sold under a jointly owned brand .
daimler plans to take advantage of byd 's battery technology to help boost chinese sales .
byd is china 's sixth-biggest car manufacturer by sales last year .
american billionaire warren buffet owns 10 percent of the company .
but ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a professor at the university of duisburg-essen and an expert on the german auto industry warns about expecting too much too soon from chinese car makers .
" let 's see what comes , " he told deutsche welle .
" we 've seen a few chinese manufacturers come to europe , and they 've failed . "
byd 's car sales have been dropping noticeably in its home market , according to dudenhoeffer .
" there 's plenty of demand in china but other cars are apparently in greater demand , " he said .
nevertheless , dudenhoeffer welcomes the latest attempt to push electric cars in germany .
" there 's a lot more happening in a number of countries like france , " he said , pointing to financial incentives .
" in germany , there 's still just a lot of hot air . "

when addressing issues of worldwide significance many nations need to be at the table , experts say . the united nations millennium development goals -lrb- mdg -rrb- include pledges to wipe out extreme poverty , achieve universal primary education , promote gender equality , reduce rates of child mortality , fight epidemic diseases , and develop a global partnership for development . the international nature of these global goals leaves individual nations struggling for effective solutions that transcend their borders .
that 's where " global governance " comes in .
it works to create international structures capable of dealing with issues of global significance , and the closer the mdgs come to their deadline of 2015 the clearer multinational cooperation becomes . states ' changing role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power structures are shifting from single states to larger organizations , like the g-20 " the old idea was that nation states need to be as independent as possible to be responsible to their own population , " said dirk messner , director of the german development institute .
" it 's now become clear that we are dealing with global interdependencies and that we have to politically organize them . " such organization is crucial for shared resources such as the climate , the food supply and energy , messner added .
while the united nations enjoys a high degree of respect when it comes to international debate , it suffers under its inability to take quick action in an emergency . " we 've just been through a small revolution that 's been overlooked by a lot of people : we 've seen the shift from a world economy organized by the g-8 to a g-20-organized global governance , which includes several emerging and developing nations that until now did not take part in the global development and political processes , " messner said . path to balanced agreements he added that having more countries at the table deciding on global issues would increase the likelihood that developing nations ' concerns are heard and that an agreement that balances the interests of the industrialized and developing world can be made . germany has shown itself to be interested in a finding a way to balance international interests , according to juergen zattler , the head of the german ministry for economic cooperation and development 's department for european and multinational development policy . " we hope that once the global governance structure is in place we can talk about a variety of topics , " he said .
" that members of the international community get closer together and more capable of taking action and that global deals can be made . " ngos out in the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un may represent a better place to make multilateral decisions while zattler said giving more influence to the g-20 would be a promising step toward successful multinational negotiation on the mdgs and climate change , a shift toward a g-20 dominated landscape still leaves civil non-national organizations in the cold , according to jens martens of the global policy forum europe . " civil groups and non-government organizations have a right to take part in discussions at the united nations , " he said .
" in other bodies , such as the g-20 , this is not the case .
it 's an exclusive club of governments that meets behind closed doors . " instead of creating new organizations designed to quicken decision making by circumventing the un , martens said the world body deserved strengthening - despite its cumbersome nature . " the more parties take part the harder it gets - that 's democracy , " he said .
" but it 's worth the effort to make truly representative decisions and to take into account the interests of the groups that otherwise do n't have a say .

i 'll never know exactly what the term means , other than a place someone liked being taken over by people whom that person does n't like .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 17.09.2010 republicans seek to end birthright citizenship for illegal migrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants face increasing legal and political pressure a move to deny birthright citizenship to children of illegal immigrants in the us is gaining political traction and public support .
but experts say this wo n't just be hard to do , it could also be counterproductive . according to a new poll released this week , almost half of americans are against giving automatic citizenship to children of illegal immigrants born in the us .
while 48 percent of people sampled by the quinnipiac university polling institute in connecticut oppose the constitutionally sanctioned practice , 45 percent of respondents support it with sentiment running pretty much along party lines . the poll is certain to add further momentum to political initiatives launched by republicans in congress to overturn the long-held practice of granting birthright citizenship to children of illegal immigrants born on us soil . the principle of birthright citizenship dates back to 1865 .
in the aftermath of the us civil war , the 14th amendment to the constitution was adopted to extend citizenship rights to former slaves , stating : " all persons born or naturalized in the united states , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the united states and of the state wherein they reside . " overturn amendment or pass a law on the basis of the 14th amendment , automatic birthright citizenship has been granted to children born on us soil regardless of their parents ' legal status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children of illegal immigrants only get us citizenship if they 're born on us soil recently , however , calls to deny automatic citizenship to children of illegal immigrants have increased .
critics of the current practice charge that children of illegal immigrants are not subject to the jurisdiction of the us and were not intended to fall under the 14th amendment . however , overturning the 14th amendment would be virtually impossible , because it would require a two-thirds majority in both chambers of congress and would have to be adopted by three-fourths of the states .
some republicans therefore argue that passing a statute clarifying and revoking birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants would suffice . " i think that is a wrong legal interpretation , " says stephen yale-loehr , a law professor at cornell university and one of the most renowned experts on us immigration law .
his opinion is shared by polly price , a law professor at emory university . " the statute would not be enough to change the law , because the united states supreme court would strike it down pretty quickly in violation of the constitution , " price concurs . while more than 90 members of the us house of representatives have already co-sponsored the so-called birthright citizenship act of 2009 aimed at denying automatic citizenship to children of illegal immigrants born in the us , passing a bill wo n't be good enough , says yale-loehr . " if the us people want to change that rule effectively , they have to repeal the 14th amendment and enact an amendment instead , " yale-loehr said .
" and that 's very hard to do .
we have n't had constitutional amendments in the united states for many years . " denying birthright citizenship wo n't slow immigration beyond the legal realm , though , there are also sociological and political reasons why changing the current practice would be unwise , argues anna triandafyllidou , a migration expert and professor at the european university institute in florence . " this is not going to solve the problem of irregular migration and it would make the streets even more dangerous , " she says . triandafyllidou contends that seemingly easy solutions , such as the measures targeting illegal immigrants that have been instituted in arizona recently or revoking birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants , do n't tackle the larger problem associated with migration .
people will still migrate to the united states , even if their children are not guaranteed us citizenship .
yale-loehr points out that by ending birthright citizenship , the theory that fewer people will come to the united states simply to have their children born there is erroneous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : undocumented workers play a vital role in the us economy " a recent study by the migration policy institute in washington dc said that if we did eliminate birthright citizenship , it would actually increase the number of illegal aliens in the united states by at least five million over the next four decades , " says yale-loehr .
currently , there are an estimated 11 million people residing in the us illegally . according to price , the sociological implications also needed to be considered . " if a large segment of your population has an undocumented status , then potentially you create a permanent underclass for persons who were born here and have lived here all their lives and yet do not have the opportunity to become citizens , " price says . german reform with unintended consequences while the us practice of granting citizenship to anyone born on its soil is very liberal compared to most other countries , it has served the us well .
it has made the country attractive for immigrants which are an important factor for keeping the us competitive and innovative , experts argue . tinkering with the system , without a comprehensive reform , could therefore lead to unintended consequences , yale-loehr explains .
he cites the example of germany , which 10 years ago loosened its citizenship laws making it easier for children born in germany to become citizens if at least one of the parents had lived in the country legally . " but the children born in germany of two undocumented parents still are not german citizens at birth , " says yale-loehr .
" as i understand it , the result is that you have an underground market in germany in fraudulent paternity where german men who are citizens , known as imbissvaeter or fast-food fathers , claim to be a child 's father in exchange for a fee thus enabling the child to be a german citizen .
something like that could happen in the united states if we restrict or eliminate birthright citizenship here . " author : michael knigge editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i saw her on television in 1977 when she was 86 and i thought , she has short hair , a colorful dress , she 's tough and living in the present , she 's a real punk because she does n't care about her image , " said artist and musician wolfgang mueller at the opening night of a new exhibition dedicated to valeska gert . the show in berlin 's hamburger bahnhof coincides with the launch of a mueller 's new biography on the performer .
" when she died in 1978 people took care of her letters and found correspondence from punks who said , we would like to know you and to meet you , " he said . indeed , valeska gert 's appearance on a tv talk show in the late 1970 's re-ignited interest in one of germany 's most enigmatic artistic figures .
her acceptance , at the age of 86 , by the burgeoning punk movement is as much a testament to her brash , no-nonsense energy as it is to her artistic achievements .
since then she has remained a marginal curio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this self-designed costume , pictured in 1931 , foreshadows 60 's fashions gert was born gertrud valesca samosch to a jewish family in berlin in 1892 .
showing no interest in academia , gert began taking dance lessons at the age of nine , and by 1915 was studying acting with alexander moissi .
her leanings toward the performing arts , combined with the detrimental effects of world war i on her father 's finances , led her to seek employment and she soon made appearances at the munich kammerspiele , the deutsches theater and the berliner tribuene . radical experiments on stage as the 1920 's progressed , she also began appearing in silent cinema , performing in " the threepenny opera , " " diary of a lost girl " with iconic flapper louise brooks , and g. w. pabst 's " joyless street . " it was around this time that gert unveiled one of her most enduring performance works .
entitled " pause , " it was an interpretative anti-dance performed between reels in cinemas , designed to draw attention to stillness and serenity . " it was so radical just to go on stage in the cinema stand there and do nothing , " said wolfgang mueller , " she did this in the 20 's where the convention was speed , business , activity and you see this in the films of the 20 's : big cities , traffic , nervosity .
to go out there and do the complete opposite was very , very modern . " by 1933 , with the nazis in power , gert suffered a ban from the german stage due to her jewish heritage .
she moved to london where she continued to perform on stage and appeared in the experimental short film " pett and pot " directed by alberto cavalcanti .
it would be her last film work until her triumphant return to the cinema in the mid-1960 's . trend setting with ' freedom from taste ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare 1969 recording of baby is screened at the pause exhibition by 1938 , in her late 40 's and living in new york but , gert found it virtually impossible to revive her previous career .
she lived on the welfare of a jewish refugee community , washed dishes and posed as a nude model .
in 1941 , she opened the bettlerbar -lrb- beggar 's bar -rrb- , a ramshackle cabaret / restaurant filled with mismatched furniture and staffed by the likes of jackson pollock and tennessee williams , the latter being fired by gert for being " too sloppy . " although licensing requirements forced the new york bar to close , gert introduced the concept to germany upon her return in 1950 .
it has proved perhaps her most enduring legacy ; tumbledown bars furnished with random pieces of flea-market chic and junk store accessories have since become legion in berlin , a fad started by gert which wolfgang mueller terms " freedom from taste . " back in post-war berlin , she once again had to start from scratch .
in the same 1977 television show , the interviewer tactfully suggested that by the dawn of the 1950 's gert was perhaps not so well remembered as before .
with typical self-depricating humor and bluntness typical for berliners , she exclaimed , " not so well remembered ?
i was totally forgotten ! " she opened the hexenkueche -lrb- witch 's kitchen -rrb- cabaret and made a triumphant return to the silver screen with an appearance in the 1965 surrealist drama " juliet of the spirits , " directed by frederico fellini .
she was soon cast in other high profile projects by rainer werner fassbinder 's and volker schloendorff . well outside the box bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the valeska gert exhibition is on display at the hamburger bahnhof until february 2011 while valeska gert has had a small but solid fan base , widespread fame always eluded her and , especially in the intervening years , she has become very much a marginalized character .
" i think she is a bit invisible , " said wolfgang mueller , " she is not known because she always ignored borders .
she was always far away from these boxes that the art scene puts people in . " however , 2010 may well see an upswing in gert 's popularity ; the exhibition dedicated to her work has a generous five-month run , while the martin schmitz publishing house has not only released mueller 's definitive new biography but also a 7 " vinyl recording of her 1969 performance of " baby , " an impersonation of a gurgling child alternating between rage and happiness . historian an paenhuysen , the curator of the new exhibition in berlin , was new to gert 's world before taking on this project ; now she is a devoted fan .
" valeska gert made work that is still very contemporary .
it still works for today , " she said .
" it 's very familiar and at the same time very strange , frightening .

she 's said to have laid the foundations for the punk movement . " i saw her on television in 1977 when she was 86 and i thought , she has short hair , a colorful dress , she 's tough and living in the present , she 's a real punk because she does n't care about her image , " said artist and musician wolfgang mueller at the opening night of a new exhibition dedicated to valeska gert . the show in berlin 's hamburger bahnhof coincides with the launch of a mueller 's new biography on the performer .
" when she died in 1978 people took care of her letters and found correspondence from punks who said , we would like to know you and to meet you , " he said . indeed , valeska gert 's appearance on a tv talk show in the late 1970 's re-ignited interest in one of germany 's most enigmatic artistic figures .
her acceptance , at the age of 86 , by the burgeoning punk movement is as much a testament to her brash , no-nonsense energy as it is to her artistic achievements .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 17.09.2010 german machine builders are leery of outsourcing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's buemi views quality as competitive edge mechanical engineering is a pillar of the german economy .
while machine builders can save costs in the short term by outsourcing production , in the long term , they can hurt themselves and the national economy . for years , german industry has faced growing international competition .
emerging markets such as china , india and brazil have already become big competitors , and a number of african countries could join the fray someday .
the prospect of lower labor costs has led many german machine builders to move parts or even all of their production abroad to stay competitive .
but some companies , like buemi in gevelsberg near wuppertal , view the outsourcing trend with skepticism .
buemi manufactures precision parts , such as axels , shafts , sockets and studs , for machine tools and trains .
the company is viewed as one of the " hidden champions " of german industry .
its customers include thyssen-krupp , siemens , komatsu and bombardier transportation .
maintaining a standard of living buemi managing director frank mittag has been at the helm of the company for 15 years .
he views germany as a manufacturing nation that relies on a powerful mechanical engineering sector .
and it 's thanks to the country 's competitive manufacturing base that services such as information technology can be easily outsourced .
" but if we rely solely on services , we will not be able to maintain our standard of living , " mittag says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : managing director frank mittag warns about being blinded by short-term cost benefits in a high-wage country like germany , the managing director asserts , there is only one alternative : quality .
that means precision , innovation , reliability and longevity .
competing on price is n't an option for germany .
so while german machine builders can lower operating costs by outsourcing some production , it 's important they retain their core competencies at home , according to mittag .
" if we transfer abroad our innovative production processes and the constructions we need to achieve superior quality and reliability , then we destroy the very competitive edge we need to compete with low-wage countries , " he says , adding that it ’ s also important to have a high-quality supplier network in germany .
long-term costs mittag sees little sense in establishing a supplier network abroad and investing heavily to trim it for quality .
there 's a risk of important know-how seeping out .
moreover , the short-term cost advantage of this strategy would only be achieved with long-term disadvantages .
" the first costs people notice are from purchasing , " mittag says .
" other costs like those for quality assurance or production downtimes , processing and marketing are often overlooked in outsourcing projects . "
once these factors are considered in the equation , unit production costs rise , he adds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other machine builders have become cautious about outsourcing buemi has polled other machine builders that have become more cautious with their international expansion .
many medium-sized companies have established subsidiaries in china , whose operations were quickly replicated by competitors next door .
the damage can be huge .
many attribute the rise of china 's auto industry to german mechanical engineering firms that have established production facilities in the country .
know-how transfer is inevitable in such a global economy , but mittag warns nonetheless that companies outsourcing production in china should need to move cautiously and not be blinded by the short-term cost benefits .
today , germany 's mechanical engineering sector has a 10 to 20 year lead on its competitors in asia , according to mittag .
but to maintain that lead , he says , the sector must continue to strive for top quality , which can only be achieved with skilled employees .
" honesty , decency and conscientiousness , " mittag says , are indispensable because if business is driven only by a near insatiable hunger for higher profits , the quality of work and the products will suffer .

while machine builders can save costs in the short term by outsourcing production , in the long term , they can hurt themselves and the national economy . for years , german industry has faced growing international competition .
emerging markets such as china , india and brazil have already become big competitors , and a number of african countries could join the fray someday .
the prospect of lower labor costs has led many german machine builders to move parts or even all of their production abroad to stay competitive .
but some companies , like buemi in gevelsberg near wuppertal , view the outsourcing trend with skepticism .
buemi manufactures precision parts , such as axels , shafts , sockets and studs , for machine tools and trains .
the company is viewed as one of the " hidden champions " of german industry .
its customers include thyssen-krupp , siemens , komatsu and bombardier transportation .
maintaining a standard of living buemi managing director frank mittag has been at the helm of the company for 15 years .
he views germany as a manufacturing nation that relies on a powerful mechanical engineering sector .
and it 's thanks to the country 's competitive manufacturing base that services such as information technology can be easily outsourced .
" but if we rely solely on services , we will not be able to maintain our standard of living , " mittag says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : managing director frank mittag warns about being blinded by short-term cost benefits in a high-wage country like germany , the managing director asserts , there is only one alternative : quality .
that means precision , innovation , reliability and longevity .
competing on price is n't an option for germany .
so while german machine builders can lower operating costs by outsourcing some production , it 's important they retain their core competencies at home , according to mittag .
" if we transfer abroad our innovative production processes and the constructions we need to achieve superior quality and reliability , then we destroy the very competitive edge we need to compete with low-wage countries , " he says , adding that it ’ s also important to have a high-quality supplier network in germany .
long-term costs mittag sees little sense in establishing a supplier network abroad and investing heavily to trim it for quality .
there 's a risk of important know-how seeping out .
moreover , the short-term cost advantage of this strategy would only be achieved with long-term disadvantages .
" the first costs people notice are from purchasing , " mittag says .
" other costs like those for quality assurance or production downtimes , processing and marketing are often overlooked in outsourcing projects . "
once these factors are considered in the equation , unit production costs rise , he adds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other machine builders have become cautious about outsourcing buemi has polled other machine builders that have become more cautious with their international expansion .
many medium-sized companies have established subsidiaries in china , whose operations were quickly replicated by competitors next door .
the damage can be huge .
many attribute the rise of china 's auto industry to german mechanical engineering firms that have established production facilities in the country .
know-how transfer is inevitable in such a global economy , but mittag warns nonetheless that companies outsourcing production in china should need to move cautiously and not be blinded by the short-term cost benefits .
today , germany 's mechanical engineering sector has a 10 to 20 year lead on its competitors in asia , according to mittag .
but to maintain that lead , he says , the sector must continue to strive for top quality , which can only be achieved with skilled employees .
" honesty , decency and conscientiousness , " mittag says , are indispensable because if business is driven only by a near insatiable hunger for higher profits , the quality of work and the products will suffer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 17.09.2010 eu threat to impose female quotas gets mixed response in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuck in lower management ?
the eu ’ s commissioner for equal opportunities viviane reding has warned firms in europe to rapidly promote women into top jobs or face a 30 percent quota from next year . a european commission threat to elevate women by fixed quotas into top company jobs coincides with growing admissions in germany that this could be the only remaining option to redress the balance .
despite a pledge made nine years ago by german industry to voluntarily remove the “ glass ceiling ” blocking women , only 2.5 percent of board members of germany 's 200 largest companies are female .
and at the 100 firms with the highest turnover , only four board executives are women .
eu-wide the trend is much the same : the commission says 89 percent of board members of europe 's stock market-listed companies are males .
growing support for quotas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henkel now favors quotas for women hans-olaf henkel , ex-president of the german bdi industry federation , conceded recently that he no longer opposes a quota .
“ the fact that over the years hardly anything has happened shows that we 're not making headway . ”
personnel consultant heiner thorborg , the author of a book on why women do not make it into top jobs , said he too had once been an opponent of quotas .
“ but when i consider that my 12-year-old daughter will have to wait 200 years until something significant happens , then i say : the last modus is the quota , and it has to come ! ”
pressure mounts within bavarian csu even within bavaria 's tradionally conservative party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , women members want change .
bavarian justice minister beate merk told german public radio on thursday that she wants a 40 percent women 's quota on party committees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goodwill is not enough , says bavaria 's justice minister beate merk .
“ we 've seen that all the goodwill and effort has n't helped . ”
female participation in party membership , currently at 18 percent , was dwindling , she added . “ we want a quota .
women voters can only be won over when women can participate in politics and when women have the chance to move into positions of leadership . ”
family minister seeks concensus federal family minister kristina schroeder favors industry 's goodwill as before .
“ what we need are political changes that we 'll best achieve with the support of commerce , not in battle against industry . ”
schroeder 's ministry has initiated the drafting of a voluntary “ code for good management . ”
apart from one woman , its code commission is made up of male executives .
like commissioner reding , business studies professor ulrike detmers points to research findings showing that firms with a balanced male-female mix benefit all round , including gains in profitability : “ goals are reached much more quickly .
meetings run more efficiently .
when the women present are also mothers then one comes straight to the point . ” what 's needed , she says , is “ better childcare , more flexible hours ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's high time to redress the balance , if necessary by force , says viviane reding but some in germany maintain that such progress can not be legislated .
the president of the german chambers of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , hans heinrich driftmann , says that the lack of women in senior positions can be attributed to a number of reasons , including the difficulty of balancing family and work , and women 's tendency to avoid technical and scientific career paths .
" a legal quota ca n't really influence such wide-ranging underlying causes , and for that reason , i would argue against imposing one , " driftmann told the german daily paper die welt .
" i was recruited to my career on the basis of my qualifications , not because of my sex , " said marie-christine ostermann , a 32-year-old executive who also chairs germany 's association of young business leaders .
" had a quota been in place , i would have felt as if i had been reduced to a gender . "
germany falling back in international rankings in overall gender inequality terms , germany has fallen back in recent years , according to the world economic forum 's latest survey .
from being ranked fifth among 128 nations in 2006 , germany has slipped to 12th place .
topping the list are scandinavian nations .
the forum 's scoring is based on 30 indicators , including women 's access to education and chances for economic participation .
in one of several nationwide studies , the german institute for economic research , the diw , found that most women in employment remain confined to lower-paid jobs , and if they do enter senior management , then this tends to happen in service sectors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sattelberg says ' old boys networks ' persist everywhere the luebeck-based survey institute databyte says the presence of women in middle to upper management nationwide is 17 percent , but its survey of 940,000 firms shows marked regional variety . berlin tops with a women 's quota of 19 percent , closely followed by germany 's post-unification eastern states .
the tail-ender is baden-wurttemberg in southwestern germany with below 15 percent .
firm size also plays a role – women play bigger roles in smaller firms , including the retailing and the health sector in eastern germany .
one of the few german companies to self-impose its own women 's quota is deutsche telekom .
its goal is 30 percent by 2015 , but senior telekom employees fear that a decade of appeals and promises has not worked .
" old boys network " still prevails “ i think we have underestimated one thing – the ever-present dna , the ' old boys networks ' that shape company cultures , also in the sense of propagating traditional role models , " telekom 's head of personnel , thomas sattelberg said . professor detmer doubts that germany 's current government will move beyond soliciting goodwill .
“ out of consideration for industry 's interests , i do n't think the federal government will make the hard choices . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 17.09.2010 six arrested in pope security scare in london großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict is on the first papal ' state visit ' to britain british police say they have arrested six terror suspects in central london , amid speculation that the arrests could be linked to the visit of pope benedict xvi , who is in the british capital on day two of his trip . london police confirmed that they arrested five men , suspected of preparing a terrorist attack , in an early morning raid on friday .
another man was arrested about eight hours later .
the police said officers had been searching two businesses and eight homes in the capital since the arrests , but had found no weapons or dangerous materials .
media reports suggested the arrests were likely linked to the papal visit , an issue on which the police would not comment .
the presence of pope benedict xvi in london meant that the british capital was already on high alert before friday 's raids .
" we 're totally calm , the pope is happy , " vatican spokesman federico lombardi said when reporters told him about the arrests .
" we can say that we 're totally confident in the work of the police . "
papal schedule unchanged the pope attended a service at london 's westminster abbey on friday led by archbishop of canterbury rowan williams , the leader of the world 's anglican church .
the two church leaders then met at lambeth palace , the anglican archbishop 's london residence , for historic talks : no pontiff had visited lambeth palace or visited the historic abbey since the foundation of the church of england when king henry viii broke with rome in 1534 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some object to benedict 's handling of the sex scandal benedict also delivered a speech at westminster hall - the historic heart of the houses of parliament - and addressed some 3,000 young catholics at an event in southwest london .
anti-church protests continue the run-up to the visit was clouded by criticism of the catholic church 's handling of a child abuse scandal and a furore over the trip 's cost : 20 million gbp -lrb- 37 million euros -rrb- .
there were protests before benedict 's engagement with young people in twickenham on friday , in the southwest of the british capital , with around 20 demonstrators waving banners with slogans saying , " there is no god - get over it ! " or " the pope is wrong , put a condom on ! "
on his flight to britain , benedict made some of his strongest comments yet on the paedophilia controversy , saying revelations of child abuse by priests that have rocked the catholic church " were a shock to me . "
he added that " the authorities in the church have not been vigilant enough . "
the church " did not act quickly or firmly enough to take the necessary action " to stop the problem , which involved abuse by priests and catholic teachers in ireland , germany , and a number of other countries around europe .
while in london , benedict was expected to meet a group of 10 victims of abuse , either on friday or saturday .
first pope to make ' state visit ' to england on the first day of the pope 's visit , he warned of the risk of " aggressive secularism " in britain and greeted tens of thousands of people at a mass in glasgow and on the streets of edinburgh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen cordially invited the pope to britain herself " the united kingdom strives to be a modern and multicultural society , " benedict xvi said .
" in this challenging enterprise , may it always maintain its respect for those traditional values and cultural expressions that more aggressive forms of secularism no longer value or even tolerate . "
the pontiff also met queen elizabeth ii while in edinburgh : " i am delighted to welcome you to the uk and particularly to scotland on your first visit as pope , " the queen said .
this is the first papal visit to the uk to be classified as a state visit , because it was elizabeth ii who invited the pontiff , not the church .
benedict xvi and the queen focused on the positive aspects of relations between predominantly anglican britain and the roman catholic church , two bodies which the queen said shared " a common christian heritage . "
on sunday , benedict will travel to the central english city of birmingham for the final day of his visit , where he will preside over the beatification of a 19th century cardinal , john henry newman .

she 's said to have laid the foundations for the punk movement . " i saw her on television in 1977 when she was 86 and i thought , she has short hair , a colorful dress , she 's tough and living in the present , she 's a real punk because she does n't care about her image , " said artist and musician wolfgang mueller at the opening night of a new exhibition dedicated to valeska gert . the show in berlin 's hamburger bahnhof coincides with the launch of a mueller 's new biography on the performer .
" when she died in 1978 people took care of her letters and found correspondence from punks who said , we would like to know you and to meet you , " he said . indeed , valeska gert 's appearance on a tv talk show in the late 1970 's re-ignited interest in one of germany 's most enigmatic artistic figures .
her acceptance , at the age of 86 , by the burgeoning punk movement is as much a testament to her brash , no-nonsense energy as it is to her artistic achievements .
since then she has remained a marginal curio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this self-designed costume , pictured in 1931 , foreshadows 60 's fashions gert was born gertrud valesca samosch to a jewish family in berlin in 1892 .
showing no interest in academia , gert began taking dance lessons at the age of nine , and by 1915 was studying acting with alexander moissi .
her leanings toward the performing arts , combined with the detrimental effects of world war i on her father 's finances , led her to seek employment and she soon made appearances at the munich kammerspiele , the deutsches theater and the berliner tribuene . radical experiments on stage as the 1920 's progressed , she also began appearing in silent cinema , performing in " the threepenny opera , " " diary of a lost girl " with iconic flapper louise brooks , and g. w. pabst 's " joyless street . " it was around this time that gert unveiled one of her most enduring performance works .
entitled " pause , " it was an interpretative anti-dance performed between reels in cinemas , designed to draw attention to stillness and serenity . " it was so radical just to go on stage in the cinema stand there and do nothing , " said wolfgang mueller , " she did this in the 20 's where the convention was speed , business , activity and you see this in the films of the 20 's : big cities , traffic , nervosity .
to go out there and do the complete opposite was very , very modern . " by 1933 , with the nazis in power , gert suffered a ban from the german stage due to her jewish heritage .
she moved to london where she continued to perform on stage and appeared in the experimental short film " pett and pot " directed by alberto cavalcanti .
it would be her last film work until her triumphant return to the cinema in the mid-1960 's . trend setting with ' freedom from taste ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare 1969 recording of baby is screened at the pause exhibition by 1938 , in her late 40 's and living in new york but , gert found it virtually impossible to revive her previous career .
she lived on the welfare of a jewish refugee community , washed dishes and posed as a nude model .
in 1941 , she opened the bettlerbar -lrb- beggar 's bar -rrb- , a ramshackle cabaret / restaurant filled with mismatched furniture and staffed by the likes of jackson pollock and tennessee williams , the latter being fired by gert for being " too sloppy . " although licensing requirements forced the new york bar to close , gert introduced the concept to germany upon her return in 1950 .
it has proved perhaps her most enduring legacy ; tumbledown bars furnished with random pieces of flea-market chic and junk store accessories have since become legion in berlin , a fad started by gert which wolfgang mueller terms " freedom from taste . " back in post-war berlin , she once again had to start from scratch .
in the same 1977 television show , the interviewer tactfully suggested that by the dawn of the 1950 's gert was perhaps not so well remembered as before .
with typical self-depricating humor and bluntness typical for berliners , she exclaimed , " not so well remembered ?
i was totally forgotten ! " she opened the hexenkueche -lrb- witch 's kitchen -rrb- cabaret and made a triumphant return to the silver screen with an appearance in the 1965 surrealist drama " juliet of the spirits , " directed by frederico fellini .
she was soon cast in other high profile projects by rainer werner fassbinder 's and volker schloendorff . well outside the box bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the valeska gert exhibition is on display at the hamburger bahnhof until february 2011 while valeska gert has had a small but solid fan base , widespread fame always eluded her and , especially in the intervening years , she has become very much a marginalized character .
" i think she is a bit invisible , " said wolfgang mueller , " she is not known because she always ignored borders .
she was always far away from these boxes that the art scene puts people in . " however , 2010 may well see an upswing in gert 's popularity ; the exhibition dedicated to her work has a generous five-month run , while the martin schmitz publishing house has not only released mueller 's definitive new biography but also a 7 " vinyl recording of her 1969 performance of " baby , " an impersonation of a gurgling child alternating between rage and happiness . historian an paenhuysen , the curator of the new exhibition in berlin , was new to gert 's world before taking on this project ; now she is a devoted fan .
" valeska gert made work that is still very contemporary .
it still works for today , " she said .
" it 's very familiar and at the same time very strange , frightening .
it touches you .
it 's really hard to sum her up .
you ca n't name her or put her in a box . " author : gavin blackburn editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 17.09.2010 eu threat to impose female quotas gets mixed response in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuck in lower management ?
the eu ’ s commissioner for equal opportunities viviane reding has warned firms in europe to rapidly promote women into top jobs or face a 30 percent quota from next year . a european commission threat to elevate women by fixed quotas into top company jobs coincides with growing admissions in germany that this could be the only remaining option to redress the balance .
despite a pledge made nine years ago by german industry to voluntarily remove the “ glass ceiling ” blocking women , only 2.5 percent of board members of germany 's 200 largest companies are female .
and at the 100 firms with the highest turnover , only four board executives are women .
eu-wide the trend is much the same : the commission says 89 percent of board members of europe 's stock market-listed companies are males .
growing support for quotas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henkel now favors quotas for women hans-olaf henkel , ex-president of the german bdi industry federation , conceded recently that he no longer opposes a quota .
“ the fact that over the years hardly anything has happened shows that we 're not making headway . ”
personnel consultant heiner thorborg , the author of a book on why women do not make it into top jobs , said he too had once been an opponent of quotas .
“ but when i consider that my 12-year-old daughter will have to wait 200 years until something significant happens , then i say : the last modus is the quota , and it has to come ! ”
pressure mounts within bavarian csu even within bavaria 's tradionally conservative party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , women members want change .
bavarian justice minister beate merk told german public radio on thursday that she wants a 40 percent women 's quota on party committees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goodwill is not enough , says bavaria 's justice minister beate merk .
“ we 've seen that all the goodwill and effort has n't helped . ”
female participation in party membership , currently at 18 percent , was dwindling , she added . “ we want a quota .
women voters can only be won over when women can participate in politics and when women have the chance to move into positions of leadership . ”
family minister seeks concensus federal family minister kristina schroeder favors industry 's goodwill as before .
“ what we need are political changes that we 'll best achieve with the support of commerce , not in battle against industry . ”
schroeder 's ministry has initiated the drafting of a voluntary “ code for good management . ”
apart from one woman , its code commission is made up of male executives .
like commissioner reding , business studies professor ulrike detmers points to research findings showing that firms with a balanced male-female mix benefit all round , including gains in profitability : “ goals are reached much more quickly .
meetings run more efficiently .
when the women present are also mothers then one comes straight to the point . ” what 's needed , she says , is “ better childcare , more flexible hours ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's high time to redress the balance , if necessary by force , says viviane reding but some in germany maintain that such progress can not be legislated .
the president of the german chambers of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , hans heinrich driftmann , says that the lack of women in senior positions can be attributed to a number of reasons , including the difficulty of balancing family and work , and women 's tendency to avoid technical and scientific career paths .
" a legal quota ca n't really influence such wide-ranging underlying causes , and for that reason , i would argue against imposing one , " driftmann told the german daily paper die welt .
" i was recruited to my career on the basis of my qualifications , not because of my sex , " said marie-christine ostermann , a 32-year-old executive who also chairs germany 's association of young business leaders .
" had a quota been in place , i would have felt as if i had been reduced to a gender . "
germany falling back in international rankings in overall gender inequality terms , germany has fallen back in recent years , according to the world economic forum 's latest survey .
from being ranked fifth among 128 nations in 2006 , germany has slipped to 12th place .
topping the list are scandinavian nations .
the forum 's scoring is based on 30 indicators , including women 's access to education and chances for economic participation .
in one of several nationwide studies , the german institute for economic research , the diw , found that most women in employment remain confined to lower-paid jobs , and if they do enter senior management , then this tends to happen in service sectors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sattelberg says ' old boys networks ' persist everywhere the luebeck-based survey institute databyte says the presence of women in middle to upper management nationwide is 17 percent , but its survey of 940,000 firms shows marked regional variety . berlin tops with a women 's quota of 19 percent , closely followed by germany 's post-unification eastern states .
the tail-ender is baden-wurttemberg in southwestern germany with below 15 percent .
firm size also plays a role – women play bigger roles in smaller firms , including the retailing and the health sector in eastern germany .
one of the few german companies to self-impose its own women 's quota is deutsche telekom .
its goal is 30 percent by 2015 , but senior telekom employees fear that a decade of appeals and promises has not worked .
" old boys network " still prevails “ i think we have underestimated one thing – the ever-present dna , the ' old boys networks ' that shape company cultures , also in the sense of propagating traditional role models , " telekom 's head of personnel , thomas sattelberg said . professor detmer doubts that germany 's current government will move beyond soliciting goodwill .
“ out of consideration for industry 's interests , i do n't think the federal government will make the hard choices . ”

another man was arrested about eight hours later .
the police said officers had been searching two businesses and eight homes in the capital since the arrests , but had found no weapons or dangerous materials .
media reports suggested the arrests were likely linked to the papal visit , an issue on which the police would not comment .
the presence of pope benedict xvi in london meant that the british capital was already on high alert before friday 's raids .
" we 're totally calm , the pope is happy , " vatican spokesman federico lombardi said when reporters told him about the arrests .
" we can say that we 're totally confident in the work of the police . "
papal schedule unchanged the pope attended a service at london 's westminster abbey on friday led by archbishop of canterbury rowan williams , the leader of the world 's anglican church .
the two church leaders then met at lambeth palace , the anglican archbishop 's london residence , for historic talks : no pontiff had visited lambeth palace or visited the historic abbey since the foundation of the church of england when king henry viii broke with rome in 1534 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some object to benedict 's handling of the sex scandal benedict also delivered a speech at westminster hall - the historic heart of the houses of parliament - and addressed some 3,000 young catholics at an event in southwest london .
anti-church protests continue the run-up to the visit was clouded by criticism of the catholic church 's handling of a child abuse scandal and a furore over the trip 's cost : 20 million gbp -lrb- 37 million euros -rrb- .
there were protests before benedict 's engagement with young people in twickenham on friday , in the southwest of the british capital , with around 20 demonstrators waving banners with slogans saying , " there is no god - get over it ! " or " the pope is wrong , put a condom on ! "
on his flight to britain , benedict made some of his strongest comments yet on the paedophilia controversy , saying revelations of child abuse by priests that have rocked the catholic church " were a shock to me . "
he added that " the authorities in the church have not been vigilant enough . "
the church " did not act quickly or firmly enough to take the necessary action " to stop the problem , which involved abuse by priests and catholic teachers in ireland , germany , and a number of other countries around europe .
while in london , benedict was expected to meet a group of 10 victims of abuse , either on friday or saturday .
first pope to make ' state visit ' to england on the first day of the pope 's visit , he warned of the risk of " aggressive secularism " in britain and greeted tens of thousands of people at a mass in glasgow and on the streets of edinburgh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen cordially invited the pope to britain herself " the united kingdom strives to be a modern and multicultural society , " benedict xvi said .
" in this challenging enterprise , may it always maintain its respect for those traditional values and cultural expressions that more aggressive forms of secularism no longer value or even tolerate . "
the pontiff also met queen elizabeth ii while in edinburgh : " i am delighted to welcome you to the uk and particularly to scotland on your first visit as pope , " the queen said .
this is the first papal visit to the uk to be classified as a state visit , because it was elizabeth ii who invited the pontiff , not the church .
benedict xvi and the queen focused on the positive aspects of relations between predominantly anglican britain and the roman catholic church , two bodies which the queen said shared " a common christian heritage . "
on sunday , benedict will travel to the central english city of birmingham for the final day of his visit , where he will preside over the beatification of a 19th century cardinal , john henry newman .

the center will be a new way to help computer users escape botnets - groups of malware-infected computers that can be controlled and exploited by a remote third party .
" the main goal is to remove germany from the top 10 ranking of countries from which botnet activities originate , " according to a document about the project published late last year on the organization for economic cooperation and development 's website .
when expanded successfully , botnets can comprise thousands or millions of so-called zombie computers that are under the control of an attacker .
they can be used for infecting further computers , sending spam , conducting criminal activity and launching cyber-attacks .
generally speaking , botnets only affect computers with the microsoft windows operating system .
linux and mac os computers are rarely infected .
according to industry statistics , every seventh german computer connected to the internet is currently part of a botnet , with its user often unaware of the situation .
thomas de maiziere , germany 's interior minister , in a statement , described the problem as " the greatest current danger for the internet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center will have a budget of two million euros annually various types of assistance the anti-botnet beratungszentrum offers help via email or by phone .
the center 's website , www.botfrei.de , contains instructions on how to free an affected computer from a botnet , as well as useful software .
the 2 million euro project is financially supported by the federal ministry of the interior and technically by the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- .
several internet providers , such as deutsche telekom , are also involved .
in the future , the participating internet providers will automatically notify their clients by email or post if their computers are infected with malware .
de maziere is encouraging non-participating providers to join the project , but he also emphasizes that affected internet users need to “ take their share of responsibility ” and take advantage of the assistance offered by the help center .

the center will be a new way to help computer users escape botnets - groups of malware-infected computers that can be controlled and exploited by a remote third party .
" the main goal is to remove germany from the top 10 ranking of countries from which botnet activities originate , " according to a document about the project published late last year on the organization for economic cooperation and development 's website .
when expanded successfully , botnets can comprise thousands or millions of so-called zombie computers that are under the control of an attacker .
they can be used for infecting further computers , sending spam , conducting criminal activity and launching cyber-attacks .
generally speaking , botnets only affect computers with the microsoft windows operating system .
linux and mac os computers are rarely infected .
according to industry statistics , every seventh german computer connected to the internet is currently part of a botnet , with its user often unaware of the situation .
thomas de maiziere , germany 's interior minister , in a statement , described the problem as " the greatest current danger for the internet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center will have a budget of two million euros annually various types of assistance the anti-botnet beratungszentrum offers help via email or by phone .
the center 's website , www.botfrei.de , contains instructions on how to free an affected computer from a botnet , as well as useful software .
the 2 million euro project is financially supported by the federal ministry of the interior and technically by the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- .
several internet providers , such as deutsche telekom , are also involved .
in the future , the participating internet providers will automatically notify their clients by email or post if their computers are infected with malware .
de maziere is encouraging non-participating providers to join the project , but he also emphasizes that affected internet users need to “ take their share of responsibility ” and take advantage of the assistance offered by the help center .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 17.09.2010 germany 's forgotten performer valeska gert helped inspire punks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always a non-conformist , gert broke new ground in music and performance more than 30 years after her death , admirers pay tribute to one of germany 's most enigmatic - and overlooked - artists , dancer and actress valeska gert .
she 's said to have laid the foundations for the punk movement . " i saw her on television in 1977 when she was 86 and i thought , she has short hair , a colorful dress , she 's tough and living in the present , she 's a real punk because she does n't care about her image , " said artist and musician wolfgang mueller at the opening night of a new exhibition dedicated to valeska gert . the show in berlin 's hamburger bahnhof coincides with the launch of a mueller 's new biography on the performer .
" when she died in 1978 people took care of her letters and found correspondence from punks who said , we would like to know you and to meet you , " he said . indeed , valeska gert 's appearance on a tv talk show in the late 1970 's re-ignited interest in one of germany 's most enigmatic artistic figures .
her acceptance , at the age of 86 , by the burgeoning punk movement is as much a testament to her brash , no-nonsense energy as it is to her artistic achievements .
since then she has remained a marginal curio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this self-designed costume , pictured in 1931 , foreshadows 60 's fashions gert was born gertrud valesca samosch to a jewish family in berlin in 1892 .
showing no interest in academia , gert began taking dance lessons at the age of nine , and by 1915 was studying acting with alexander moissi .
her leanings toward the performing arts , combined with the detrimental effects of world war i on her father 's finances , led her to seek employment and she soon made appearances at the munich kammerspiele , the deutsches theater and the berliner tribuene . radical experiments on stage as the 1920 's progressed , she also began appearing in silent cinema , performing in " the threepenny opera , " " diary of a lost girl " with iconic flapper louise brooks , and g. w. pabst 's " joyless street . " it was around this time that gert unveiled one of her most enduring performance works .
entitled " pause , " it was an interpretative anti-dance performed between reels in cinemas , designed to draw attention to stillness and serenity . " it was so radical just to go on stage in the cinema stand there and do nothing , " said wolfgang mueller , " she did this in the 20 's where the convention was speed , business , activity and you see this in the films of the 20 's : big cities , traffic , nervosity .
to go out there and do the complete opposite was very , very modern . " by 1933 , with the nazis in power , gert suffered a ban from the german stage due to her jewish heritage .
she moved to london where she continued to perform on stage and appeared in the experimental short film " pett and pot " directed by alberto cavalcanti .
it would be her last film work until her triumphant return to the cinema in the mid-1960 's . trend setting with ' freedom from taste ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare 1969 recording of baby is screened at the pause exhibition by 1938 , in her late 40 's and living in new york but , gert found it virtually impossible to revive her previous career .
she lived on the welfare of a jewish refugee community , washed dishes and posed as a nude model .
in 1941 , she opened the bettlerbar -lrb- beggar 's bar -rrb- , a ramshackle cabaret / restaurant filled with mismatched furniture and staffed by the likes of jackson pollock and tennessee williams , the latter being fired by gert for being " too sloppy . " although licensing requirements forced the new york bar to close , gert introduced the concept to germany upon her return in 1950 .
it has proved perhaps her most enduring legacy ; tumbledown bars furnished with random pieces of flea-market chic and junk store accessories have since become legion in berlin , a fad started by gert which wolfgang mueller terms " freedom from taste . " back in post-war berlin , she once again had to start from scratch .
in the same 1977 television show , the interviewer tactfully suggested that by the dawn of the 1950 's gert was perhaps not so well remembered as before .
with typical self-depricating humor and bluntness typical for berliners , she exclaimed , " not so well remembered ?
i was totally forgotten ! " she opened the hexenkueche -lrb- witch 's kitchen -rrb- cabaret and made a triumphant return to the silver screen with an appearance in the 1965 surrealist drama " juliet of the spirits , " directed by frederico fellini .
she was soon cast in other high profile projects by rainer werner fassbinder 's and volker schloendorff . well outside the box bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the valeska gert exhibition is on display at the hamburger bahnhof until february 2011 while valeska gert has had a small but solid fan base , widespread fame always eluded her and , especially in the intervening years , she has become very much a marginalized character .
" i think she is a bit invisible , " said wolfgang mueller , " she is not known because she always ignored borders .
she was always far away from these boxes that the art scene puts people in . " however , 2010 may well see an upswing in gert 's popularity ; the exhibition dedicated to her work has a generous five-month run , while the martin schmitz publishing house has not only released mueller 's definitive new biography but also a 7 " vinyl recording of her 1969 performance of " baby , " an impersonation of a gurgling child alternating between rage and happiness . historian an paenhuysen , the curator of the new exhibition in berlin , was new to gert 's world before taking on this project ; now she is a devoted fan .
" valeska gert made work that is still very contemporary .
it still works for today , " she said .
" it 's very familiar and at the same time very strange , frightening .
it touches you .
it 's really hard to sum her up .
you ca n't name her or put her in a box . " author : neale lytollis editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move could pressure german carmakers to ramp up mass production of their own electric vehicles . rwe and china 's byd have teamed to bring electrical cars to germany , beginning with a trial fleet in 2011 .
a mass rollout in germany and several other european markets is planned the following year .
the deal with the chinese company , a battery specialist that has since expanded into car manufacturing , follows a string of agreements with other manufacturers , including france 's renault , japan 's nissan and daimler .
the centrepiece of the agreement is a package deal for electric car enthusiasts , consisting of byd 's electric vehicles and rwe 's fast-charging posts and electricity supplied exclusively from renewable sources .
two models will be initially available and targeted primarily at consumers in cities driving shorter distances .
already on the market the one model is a plug-in hybrid car that combines new electric and conventional internal combustion systems .
on the market in china since early this year , it has a range of between 60 and 100 kilometers when running only on electricity .
the other newer model will be a purely electric vehicle with a battery range of about 300 kilometers and an acceleration of 0 to 100 kilometers per hour within 10 seconds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe plans to charge electric cars with electricity from rewewable energy sources the package will include a fast-charging device from rwe , access to the company 's expanding network of public charging points – now at around 450 – and electricity generated by wind and solar systems .
rwe spokesman peter hoscheidt told deutsche welle that no decision has yet been reached on whether the cars and charging unit can be leased in addition to being purchased or both and what the prices will be .
but he said both options will be likely and prices will be attractive to garner attention .
in berlin , the german energy company is already collaborating with daimler in a field trial .
they 're testing smart cars powered by lithium-ion batteries , which can be charged at home and public supply points .
the collaboration is one of several electric car initiatives running under the german government 's e-mobility program .
seeking standardization through their collaboration , rwe and byd also hope to contribute to standardization efforts in the nascent electric car industry .
standardized components are crucial to kick start mass production .
but the standardization process of a new technology , like electrically powered cars , is often accompanied by power struggles between groups seeking recognition of their own systems as standards in order to collect royalty fees down the road .
bildunterschrift : rwe sees the day coming when " fill it up " is replaced by " charge it up " why the cooperation with a chinese manufacturer now ?
because the chinese , hoscheidt said , promise mass production by 2012 , thus ensuring a sufficient supply of competitively priced vehicles .
" this is by no means an exclusive agreement , " he said .
" we 're seeking partners to push electric cars .
the sooner they can deliver , the better . "
coveted battery technolgy earlier this year , byd and daimler signed an agreement to develop and build electric cars for the chinese market .
the cars will be sold under a jointly owned brand .
daimler plans to take advantage of byd 's battery technology to help boost chinese sales .
byd is china 's sixth-biggest car manufacturer by sales last year .

another man was arrested about eight hours later .
the police said officers had been searching two businesses and eight homes in the capital since the arrests , but had found no weapons or dangerous materials .
media reports suggested the arrests were likely linked to the papal visit , an issue on which the police would not comment .
the presence of pope benedict xvi in london meant that the british capital was already on high alert before friday 's raids .
" we 're totally calm , the pope is happy , " vatican spokesman federico lombardi said when reporters told him about the arrests .
" we can say that we 're totally confident in the work of the police . "
papal schedule unchanged the pope attended a service at london 's westminster abbey on friday led by archbishop of canterbury rowan williams , the leader of the world 's anglican church .
the two church leaders then met at lambeth palace , the anglican archbishop 's london residence , for historic talks : no pontiff had visited lambeth palace or visited the historic abbey since the foundation of the church of england when king henry viii broke with rome in 1534 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some object to benedict 's handling of the sex scandal benedict also delivered a speech at westminster hall - the historic heart of the houses of parliament - and addressed some 3,000 young catholics at an event in southwest london .
anti-church protests continue the run-up to the visit was clouded by criticism of the catholic church 's handling of a child abuse scandal and a furore over the trip 's cost : 20 million gbp -lrb- 37 million euros -rrb- .
there were protests before benedict 's engagement with young people in twickenham on friday , in the southwest of the british capital , with around 20 demonstrators waving banners with slogans saying , " there is no god - get over it ! " or " the pope is wrong , put a condom on ! "
on his flight to britain , benedict made some of his strongest comments yet on the paedophilia controversy , saying revelations of child abuse by priests that have rocked the catholic church " were a shock to me . "
he added that " the authorities in the church have not been vigilant enough . "
the church " did not act quickly or firmly enough to take the necessary action " to stop the problem , which involved abuse by priests and catholic teachers in ireland , germany , and a number of other countries around europe .
while in london , benedict was expected to meet a group of 10 victims of abuse , either on friday or saturday .
first pope to make ' state visit ' to england on the first day of the pope 's visit , he warned of the risk of " aggressive secularism " in britain and greeted tens of thousands of people at a mass in glasgow and on the streets of edinburgh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen cordially invited the pope to britain herself " the united kingdom strives to be a modern and multicultural society , " benedict xvi said .
" in this challenging enterprise , may it always maintain its respect for those traditional values and cultural expressions that more aggressive forms of secularism no longer value or even tolerate . "
the pontiff also met queen elizabeth ii while in edinburgh : " i am delighted to welcome you to the uk and particularly to scotland on your first visit as pope , " the queen said .
this is the first papal visit to the uk to be classified as a state visit , because it was elizabeth ii who invited the pontiff , not the church .
benedict xvi and the queen focused on the positive aspects of relations between predominantly anglican britain and the roman catholic church , two bodies which the queen said shared " a common christian heritage . "
on sunday , benedict will travel to the central english city of birmingham for the final day of his visit , where he will preside over the beatification of a 19th century cardinal , john henry newman .

after a bumpy first three rounds , they 'll try to get it together this week . match day four in the bundesliga is upon us , and dw 's team of football freaks are plotting their comeback ... or hoping that when it comes to picks , it 's a case of four is fantastic .
the prediction squad has taken a hit from all the upsets thus far -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but still we rise .
friday , september 18 frankfurt-freiburg freiburg have looked much better this year than last and have shown they can win away .
but after a sputtering start , frankfurt got back on track last week and have enough drive going forward to exploit their opponents ' weakness at the back .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 saturday , september 18 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne will hope to see this mueller - not the celebratory one bayern munich-cologne no secret about the billy goats ' strategy here – pack it in in their own half , frustrate franck ribery and hope for a draw .
with bayern perhaps having tired legs from the champions league , cologne 's plan has a chance of working .
but something tells me thomas mueller has found his rhythm again , and as he showed on wedsnesday , he can manufacture goals from nothing .
prediction : bayern 2-0 werder bremen-mainz this is just the sort of match profligate bremen often lose , and what 's not to like about this year 's plucky , well-organized mainz squad ?
unfortunately for the latter , though , i think the now-confirmed news that wunderkind andre schuerrle is headed to leverkusen next season will prove to be a distraction .
prediction : bremen 3-1 stuttgart-moenchengladbach this is a case of the underachieving taking on the unpredictable .
stuttgart have been a mess this season , especially on defense , and are coming off only two days rest .
gladbach have been up and down but have already tripped up one big club at home .
methinks they split the points .
prediction : 1-1 draw wolfsburg-hanover there 's one team here still looking for its first points , and it 's not hanover .
the 96ers are undefeated , and their two wins , while close , have been deserved .
for the wolves , who are miles ahead talent-wise , this will be a test of whether they have faith in new coach steve mcclaren .
i think the result will be indecisive .
prediction : 2-2 draw .
kaiserslautern-hoffenheim as bayern found out two weeks ago , never underestimate lautern 's home field advantage .
but i like what i 've seen from hoffenheim this season .
they 're more disciplined than in the past and look like they 're on a mission to prove the doubters wrong .
and they simply have too much attacking firepower for the red devils .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 sunday , september 19 st. pauli-hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. pauli fans will hope their outlaw act intimidates their city rivals of the true city derbies in german football , this one is the best .
on paper , pauli are completely overmatched against hamburg .
but that 's on paper .
taking to the field in millerntor stadium with ac / dc 's hell 's bells ringing in your ears is something that can impress even the likes of ruud van nistelrooy .
and somewhere within all that ringing i hear the sound of an upset .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 dortmund-schalke could things get any worse for schalke ?
they 're on a bad losing streak , and now they get a visit their bitterest rivals , who are off to a good start .
but i 'm not writing off schalke just yet , and i think two extra days rest will help them sneak a point .
prediction : 1-1 draw leverkusen-nuremberg leverkusen have lived up to their reputation as one of the bundesliga 's least consistent teams and will have thursday 's europa cup match weighing down their legs .
but i think nuremberg will be thrown off by the loss of their best striker , albert bunjaku , to injury for the rest of the year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 17.09.2010 germany 's forgotten performer valeska gert helped inspire punks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always a non-conformist , gert broke new ground in music and performance more than 30 years after her death , admirers pay tribute to one of germany 's most enigmatic - and overlooked - artists , dancer and actress valeska gert .
she 's said to have laid the foundations for the punk movement . " i saw her on television in 1977 when she was 86 and i thought , she has short hair , a colorful dress , she 's tough and living in the present , she 's a real punk because she does n't care about her image , " said artist and musician wolfgang mueller at the opening night of a new exhibition dedicated to valeska gert . the show in berlin 's hamburger bahnhof coincides with the launch of a mueller 's new biography on the performer .
" when she died in 1978 people took care of her letters and found correspondence from punks who said , we would like to know you and to meet you , " he said . indeed , valeska gert 's appearance on a tv talk show in the late 1970 's re-ignited interest in one of germany 's most enigmatic artistic figures .
her acceptance , at the age of 86 , by the burgeoning punk movement is as much a testament to her brash , no-nonsense energy as it is to her artistic achievements .
since then she has remained a marginal curio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this self-designed costume , pictured in 1931 , foreshadows 60 's fashions gert was born gertrud valesca samosch to a jewish family in berlin in 1892 .
showing no interest in academia , gert began taking dance lessons at the age of nine , and by 1915 was studying acting with alexander moissi .
her leanings toward the performing arts , combined with the detrimental effects of world war i on her father 's finances , led her to seek employment and she soon made appearances at the munich kammerspiele , the deutsches theater and the berliner tribuene . radical experiments on stage as the 1920 's progressed , she also began appearing in silent cinema , performing in " the threepenny opera , " " diary of a lost girl " with iconic flapper louise brooks , and g. w. pabst 's " joyless street . " it was around this time that gert unveiled one of her most enduring performance works .
entitled " pause , " it was an interpretative anti-dance performed between reels in cinemas , designed to draw attention to stillness and serenity . " it was so radical just to go on stage in the cinema stand there and do nothing , " said wolfgang mueller , " she did this in the 20 's where the convention was speed , business , activity and you see this in the films of the 20 's : big cities , traffic , nervosity .
to go out there and do the complete opposite was very , very modern . " by 1933 , with the nazis in power , gert suffered a ban from the german stage due to her jewish heritage .
she moved to london where she continued to perform on stage and appeared in the experimental short film " pett and pot " directed by alberto cavalcanti .
it would be her last film work until her triumphant return to the cinema in the mid-1960 's . trend setting with ' freedom from taste ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare 1969 recording of baby is screened at the pause exhibition by 1938 , in her late 40 's and living in new york but , gert found it virtually impossible to revive her previous career .
she lived on the welfare of a jewish refugee community , washed dishes and posed as a nude model .
in 1941 , she opened the bettlerbar -lrb- beggar 's bar -rrb- , a ramshackle cabaret / restaurant filled with mismatched furniture and staffed by the likes of jackson pollock and tennessee williams , the latter being fired by gert for being " too sloppy . " although licensing requirements forced the new york bar to close , gert introduced the concept to germany upon her return in 1950 .
it has proved perhaps her most enduring legacy ; tumbledown bars furnished with random pieces of flea-market chic and junk store accessories have since become legion in berlin , a fad started by gert which wolfgang mueller terms " freedom from taste . " back in post-war berlin , she once again had to start from scratch .
in the same 1977 television show , the interviewer tactfully suggested that by the dawn of the 1950 's gert was perhaps not so well remembered as before .
with typical self-depricating humor and bluntness typical for berliners , she exclaimed , " not so well remembered ?
i was totally forgotten ! " she opened the hexenkueche -lrb- witch 's kitchen -rrb- cabaret and made a triumphant return to the silver screen with an appearance in the 1965 surrealist drama " juliet of the spirits , " directed by frederico fellini .
she was soon cast in other high profile projects by rainer werner fassbinder 's and volker schloendorff . well outside the box bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the valeska gert exhibition is on display at the hamburger bahnhof until february 2011 while valeska gert has had a small but solid fan base , widespread fame always eluded her and , especially in the intervening years , she has become very much a marginalized character .
" i think she is a bit invisible , " said wolfgang mueller , " she is not known because she always ignored borders .
she was always far away from these boxes that the art scene puts people in . " however , 2010 may well see an upswing in gert 's popularity ; the exhibition dedicated to her work has a generous five-month run , while the martin schmitz publishing house has not only released mueller 's definitive new biography but also a 7 " vinyl recording of her 1969 performance of " baby , " an impersonation of a gurgling child alternating between rage and happiness . historian an paenhuysen , the curator of the new exhibition in berlin , was new to gert 's world before taking on this project ; now she is a devoted fan .
" valeska gert made work that is still very contemporary .
it still works for today , " she said .
" it 's very familiar and at the same time very strange , frightening .
it touches you .
it 's really hard to sum her up .
you ca n't name her or put her in a box . " author : gavin blackburn editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 17.09.2010 chinese electric cars could soon plug into germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese electric cars are headed for german cities in germany – home to bmw , daimler and vw – energy company rwe plans to help a chinese company launch its electric cars .
the move could pressure german carmakers to ramp up mass production of their own electric vehicles . rwe and china 's byd have teamed to bring electrical cars to germany , beginning with a trial fleet in 2011 .
a mass rollout in germany and several other european markets is planned the following year .
the deal with the chinese company , a battery specialist that has since expanded into car manufacturing , follows a string of agreements with other manufacturers , including france 's renault , japan 's nissan and daimler .
the centrepiece of the agreement is a package deal for electric car enthusiasts , consisting of byd 's electric vehicles and rwe 's fast-charging posts and electricity supplied exclusively from renewable sources .
two models will be initially available and targeted primarily at consumers in cities driving shorter distances .
already on the market the one model is a plug-in hybrid car that combines new electric and conventional internal combustion systems .
on the market in china since early this year , it has a range of between 60 and 100 kilometers when running only on electricity .
the other newer model will be a purely electric vehicle with a battery range of about 300 kilometers and an acceleration of 0 to 100 kilometers per hour within 10 seconds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe plans to charge electric cars with electricity from rewewable energy sources the package will include a fast-charging device from rwe , access to the company 's expanding network of public charging points – now at around 450 – and electricity generated by wind and solar systems .
rwe spokesman peter hoscheidt told deutsche welle that no decision has yet been reached on whether the cars and charging unit can be leased in addition to being purchased or both and what the prices will be .
but he said both options will be likely and prices will be attractive to garner attention .
in berlin , the german energy company is already collaborating with daimler in a field trial .
they 're testing smart cars powered by lithium-ion batteries , which can be charged at home and public supply points .
the collaboration is one of several electric car initiatives running under the german government 's e-mobility program .
seeking standardization through their collaboration , rwe and byd also hope to contribute to standardization efforts in the nascent electric car industry .
standardized components are crucial to kick start mass production .
but the standardization process of a new technology , like electrically powered cars , is often accompanied by power struggles between groups seeking recognition of their own systems as standards in order to collect royalty fees down the road .
bildunterschrift : rwe sees the day coming when " fill it up " is replaced by " charge it up " why the cooperation with a chinese manufacturer now ?
because the chinese , hoscheidt said , promise mass production by 2012 , thus ensuring a sufficient supply of competitively priced vehicles .
" this is by no means an exclusive agreement , " he said .
" we 're seeking partners to push electric cars .
the sooner they can deliver , the better . "
coveted battery technolgy earlier this year , byd and daimler signed an agreement to develop and build electric cars for the chinese market .
the cars will be sold under a jointly owned brand .
daimler plans to take advantage of byd 's battery technology to help boost chinese sales .
byd is china 's sixth-biggest car manufacturer by sales last year .
american billionaire warren buffet owns 10 percent of the company .
but ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a professor at the university of duisburg-essen and an expert on the german auto industry warns about expecting too much too soon from chinese car makers .
" let 's see what comes , " he told deutsche welle .
" we 've seen a few chinese manufacturers come to europe , and they 've failed . "
byd 's car sales have been dropping noticeably in its home market , according to dudenhoeffer .
" there 's plenty of demand in china but other cars are apparently in greater demand , " he said .
nevertheless , dudenhoeffer welcomes the latest attempt to push electric cars in germany .
" there 's a lot more happening in a number of countries like france , " he said , pointing to financial incentives .
" in germany , there 's still just a lot of hot air . "

the eu ’ s commissioner for equal opportunities viviane reding has warned firms in europe to rapidly promote women into top jobs or face a 30 percent quota from next year . a european commission threat to elevate women by fixed quotas into top company jobs coincides with growing admissions in germany that this could be the only remaining option to redress the balance .
despite a pledge made nine years ago by german industry to voluntarily remove the “ glass ceiling ” blocking women , only 2.5 percent of board members of germany 's 200 largest companies are female .
and at the 100 firms with the highest turnover , only four board executives are women .
eu-wide the trend is much the same : the commission says 89 percent of board members of europe 's stock market-listed companies are males .
growing support for quotas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henkel now favors quotas for women hans-olaf henkel , ex-president of the german bdi industry federation , conceded recently that he no longer opposes a quota .
“ the fact that over the years hardly anything has happened shows that we 're not making headway . ”
personnel consultant heiner thorborg , the author of a book on why women do not make it into top jobs , said he too had once been an opponent of quotas .
“ but when i consider that my 12-year-old daughter will have to wait 200 years until something significant happens , then i say : the last modus is the quota , and it has to come ! ”
pressure mounts within bavarian csu even within bavaria 's tradionally conservative party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , women members want change .
bavarian justice minister beate merk told german public radio on thursday that she wants a 40 percent women 's quota on party committees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goodwill is not enough , says bavaria 's justice minister beate merk .
“ we 've seen that all the goodwill and effort has n't helped . ”
female participation in party membership , currently at 18 percent , was dwindling , she added . “ we want a quota .
women voters can only be won over when women can participate in politics and when women have the chance to move into positions of leadership . ”
family minister seeks concensus federal family minister kristina schroeder favors industry 's goodwill as before .
“ what we need are political changes that we 'll best achieve with the support of commerce , not in battle against industry . ”
schroeder 's ministry has initiated the drafting of a voluntary “ code for good management . ”
apart from one woman , its code commission is made up of male executives .
like commissioner reding , business studies professor ulrike detmers points to research findings showing that firms with a balanced male-female mix benefit all round , including gains in profitability : “ goals are reached much more quickly .
meetings run more efficiently .
when the women present are also mothers then one comes straight to the point . ” what 's needed , she says , is “ better childcare , more flexible hours ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's high time to redress the balance , if necessary by force , says viviane reding but some in germany maintain that such progress can not be legislated .
the president of the german chambers of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , hans heinrich driftmann , says that the lack of women in senior positions can be attributed to a number of reasons , including the difficulty of balancing family and work , and women 's tendency to avoid technical and scientific career paths .
" a legal quota ca n't really influence such wide-ranging underlying causes , and for that reason , i would argue against imposing one , " driftmann told the german daily paper die welt .
" i was recruited to my career on the basis of my qualifications , not because of my sex , " said marie-christine ostermann , a 32-year-old executive who also chairs germany 's association of young business leaders .
" had a quota been in place , i would have felt as if i had been reduced to a gender . "
germany falling back in international rankings in overall gender inequality terms , germany has fallen back in recent years , according to the world economic forum 's latest survey .
from being ranked fifth among 128 nations in 2006 , germany has slipped to 12th place .
topping the list are scandinavian nations .
the forum 's scoring is based on 30 indicators , including women 's access to education and chances for economic participation .
in one of several nationwide studies , the german institute for economic research , the diw , found that most women in employment remain confined to lower-paid jobs , and if they do enter senior management , then this tends to happen in service sectors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sattelberg says ' old boys networks ' persist everywhere the luebeck-based survey institute databyte says the presence of women in middle to upper management nationwide is 17 percent , but its survey of 940,000 firms shows marked regional variety . berlin tops with a women 's quota of 19 percent , closely followed by germany 's post-unification eastern states .
the tail-ender is baden-wurttemberg in southwestern germany with below 15 percent .
firm size also plays a role – women play bigger roles in smaller firms , including the retailing and the health sector in eastern germany .
one of the few german companies to self-impose its own women 's quota is deutsche telekom .
its goal is 30 percent by 2015 , but senior telekom employees fear that a decade of appeals and promises has not worked .
" old boys network " still prevails “ i think we have underestimated one thing – the ever-present dna , the ' old boys networks ' that shape company cultures , also in the sense of propagating traditional role models , " telekom 's head of personnel , thomas sattelberg said . professor detmer doubts that germany 's current government will move beyond soliciting goodwill .
“ out of consideration for industry 's interests , i do n't think the federal government will make the hard choices . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 17.09.2010 chinese electric cars could soon plug into germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese electric cars are headed for german cities in germany – home to bmw , daimler and vw – energy company rwe plans to help a chinese company launch its electric cars .
the move could pressure german carmakers to ramp up mass production of their own electric vehicles . rwe and china 's byd have teamed to bring electrical cars to germany , beginning with a trial fleet in 2011 .
a mass rollout in germany and several other european markets is planned the following year .
the deal with the chinese company , a battery specialist that has since expanded into car manufacturing , follows a string of agreements with other manufacturers , including france 's renault , japan 's nissan and daimler .
the centrepiece of the agreement is a package deal for electric car enthusiasts , consisting of byd 's electric vehicles and rwe 's fast-charging posts and electricity supplied exclusively from renewable sources .
two models will be initially available and targeted primarily at consumers in cities driving shorter distances .
already on the market the one model is a plug-in hybrid car that combines new electric and conventional internal combustion systems .
on the market in china since early this year , it has a range of between 60 and 100 kilometers when running only on electricity .
the other newer model will be a purely electric vehicle with a battery range of about 300 kilometers and an acceleration of 0 to 100 kilometers per hour within 10 seconds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe plans to charge electric cars with electricity from rewewable energy sources the package will include a fast-charging device from rwe , access to the company 's expanding network of public charging points – now at around 450 – and electricity generated by wind and solar systems .
rwe spokesman peter hoscheidt told deutsche welle that no decision has yet been reached on whether the cars and charging unit can be leased in addition to being purchased or both and what the prices will be .
but he said both options will be likely and prices will be attractive to garner attention .
in berlin , the german energy company is already collaborating with daimler in a field trial .
they 're testing smart cars powered by lithium-ion batteries , which can be charged at home and public supply points .
the collaboration is one of several electric car initiatives running under the german government 's e-mobility program .
seeking standardization through their collaboration , rwe and byd also hope to contribute to standardization efforts in the nascent electric car industry .
standardized components are crucial to kick start mass production .
but the standardization process of a new technology , like electrically powered cars , is often accompanied by power struggles between groups seeking recognition of their own systems as standards in order to collect royalty fees down the road .
bildunterschrift : rwe sees the day coming when " fill it up " is replaced by " charge it up " why the cooperation with a chinese manufacturer now ?
because the chinese , hoscheidt said , promise mass production by 2012 , thus ensuring a sufficient supply of competitively priced vehicles .
" this is by no means an exclusive agreement , " he said .
" we 're seeking partners to push electric cars .
the sooner they can deliver , the better . "
coveted battery technolgy earlier this year , byd and daimler signed an agreement to develop and build electric cars for the chinese market .
the cars will be sold under a jointly owned brand .
daimler plans to take advantage of byd 's battery technology to help boost chinese sales .
byd is china 's sixth-biggest car manufacturer by sales last year .
american billionaire warren buffet owns 10 percent of the company .
but ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a professor at the university of duisburg-essen and an expert on the german auto industry warns about expecting too much too soon from chinese car makers .
" let 's see what comes , " he told deutsche welle .
" we 've seen a few chinese manufacturers come to europe , and they 've failed . "
byd 's car sales have been dropping noticeably in its home market , according to dudenhoeffer .
" there 's plenty of demand in china but other cars are apparently in greater demand , " he said .
nevertheless , dudenhoeffer welcomes the latest attempt to push electric cars in germany .
" there 's a lot more happening in a number of countries like france , " he said , pointing to financial incentives .
" in germany , there 's still just a lot of hot air . "

when addressing issues of worldwide significance many nations need to be at the table , experts say . the united nations millennium development goals -lrb- mdg -rrb- include pledges to wipe out extreme poverty , achieve universal primary education , promote gender equality , reduce rates of child mortality , fight epidemic diseases , and develop a global partnership for development . the international nature of these global goals leaves individual nations struggling for effective solutions that transcend their borders .
that 's where " global governance " comes in .
it works to create international structures capable of dealing with issues of global significance , and the closer the mdgs come to their deadline of 2015 the clearer multinational cooperation becomes . states ' changing role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power structures are shifting from single states to larger organizations , like the g-20 " the old idea was that nation states need to be as independent as possible to be responsible to their own population , " said dirk messner , director of the german development institute .
" it 's now become clear that we are dealing with global interdependencies and that we have to politically organize them . " such organization is crucial for shared resources such as the climate , the food supply and energy , messner added .
while the united nations enjoys a high degree of respect when it comes to international debate , it suffers under its inability to take quick action in an emergency . " we 've just been through a small revolution that 's been overlooked by a lot of people : we 've seen the shift from a world economy organized by the g-8 to a g-20-organized global governance , which includes several emerging and developing nations that until now did not take part in the global development and political processes , " messner said . path to balanced agreements he added that having more countries at the table deciding on global issues would increase the likelihood that developing nations ' concerns are heard and that an agreement that balances the interests of the industrialized and developing world can be made . germany has shown itself to be interested in a finding a way to balance international interests , according to juergen zattler , the head of the german ministry for economic cooperation and development 's department for european and multinational development policy . " we hope that once the global governance structure is in place we can talk about a variety of topics , " he said .
" that members of the international community get closer together and more capable of taking action and that global deals can be made . " ngos out in the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un may represent a better place to make multilateral decisions while zattler said giving more influence to the g-20 would be a promising step toward successful multinational negotiation on the mdgs and climate change , a shift toward a g-20 dominated landscape still leaves civil non-national organizations in the cold , according to jens martens of the global policy forum europe . " civil groups and non-government organizations have a right to take part in discussions at the united nations , " he said .
" in other bodies , such as the g-20 , this is not the case .
it 's an exclusive club of governments that meets behind closed doors . " instead of creating new organizations designed to quicken decision making by circumventing the un , martens said the world body deserved strengthening - despite its cumbersome nature . " the more parties take part the harder it gets - that 's democracy , " he said .
" but it 's worth the effort to make truly representative decisions and to take into account the interests of the groups that otherwise do n't have a say .
in terms of the millennium goals it 's the interests of the world 's poorest people . " author : heiner kiesel -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after a bumpy first three rounds , they 'll try to get it together this week . match day four in the bundesliga is upon us , and dw 's team of football freaks are plotting their comeback ... or hoping that when it comes to picks , it 's a case of four is fantastic .
the prediction squad has taken a hit from all the upsets thus far -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but still we rise .
friday , september 18 frankfurt-freiburg freiburg have looked much better this year than last and have shown they can win away .
but after a sputtering start , frankfurt got back on track last week and have enough drive going forward to exploit their opponents ' weakness at the back .
prediction : frankfurt 2-0 saturday , september 18 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne will hope to see this mueller - not the celebratory one bayern munich-cologne no secret about the billy goats ' strategy here – pack it in in their own half , frustrate franck ribery and hope for a draw .
with bayern perhaps having tired legs from the champions league , cologne 's plan has a chance of working .
but something tells me thomas mueller has found his rhythm again , and as he showed on wedsnesday , he can manufacture goals from nothing .
prediction : bayern 2-0 werder bremen-mainz this is just the sort of match profligate bremen often lose , and what 's not to like about this year 's plucky , well-organized mainz squad ?
unfortunately for the latter , though , i think the now-confirmed news that wunderkind andre schuerrle is headed to leverkusen next season will prove to be a distraction .
prediction : bremen 3-1 stuttgart-moenchengladbach this is a case of the underachieving taking on the unpredictable .
stuttgart have been a mess this season , especially on defense , and are coming off only two days rest .
gladbach have been up and down but have already tripped up one big club at home .
methinks they split the points .
prediction : 1-1 draw wolfsburg-hanover there 's one team here still looking for its first points , and it 's not hanover .
the 96ers are undefeated , and their two wins , while close , have been deserved .
for the wolves , who are miles ahead talent-wise , this will be a test of whether they have faith in new coach steve mcclaren .
i think the result will be indecisive .
prediction : 2-2 draw .
kaiserslautern-hoffenheim as bayern found out two weeks ago , never underestimate lautern 's home field advantage .
but i like what i 've seen from hoffenheim this season .
they 're more disciplined than in the past and look like they 're on a mission to prove the doubters wrong .
and they simply have too much attacking firepower for the red devils .
prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 sunday , september 19 st. pauli-hamburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. pauli fans will hope their outlaw act intimidates their city rivals of the true city derbies in german football , this one is the best .
on paper , pauli are completely overmatched against hamburg .
but that 's on paper .
taking to the field in millerntor stadium with ac / dc 's hell 's bells ringing in your ears is something that can impress even the likes of ruud van nistelrooy .
and somewhere within all that ringing i hear the sound of an upset .
prediction : st. pauli 2-1 dortmund-schalke could things get any worse for schalke ?
they 're on a bad losing streak , and now they get a visit their bitterest rivals , who are off to a good start .
but i 'm not writing off schalke just yet , and i think two extra days rest will help them sneak a point .
prediction : 1-1 draw leverkusen-nuremberg leverkusen have lived up to their reputation as one of the bundesliga 's least consistent teams and will have thursday 's europa cup match weighing down their legs .
but i think nuremberg will be thrown off by the loss of their best striker , albert bunjaku , to injury for the rest of the year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 17.09.2010 germany 's forgotten performer valeska gert helped inspire punks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always a non-conformist , gert broke new ground in music and performance more than 30 years after her death , admirers pay tribute to one of germany 's most enigmatic - and overlooked - artists , dancer and actress valeska gert .
she 's said to have laid the foundations for the punk movement . " i saw her on television in 1977 when she was 86 and i thought , she has short hair , a colorful dress , she 's tough and living in the present , she 's a real punk because she does n't care about her image , " said artist and musician wolfgang mueller at the opening night of a new exhibition dedicated to valeska gert . the show in berlin 's hamburger bahnhof coincides with the launch of a mueller 's new biography on the performer .
" when she died in 1978 people took care of her letters and found correspondence from punks who said , we would like to know you and to meet you , " he said . indeed , valeska gert 's appearance on a tv talk show in the late 1970 's re-ignited interest in one of germany 's most enigmatic artistic figures .
her acceptance , at the age of 86 , by the burgeoning punk movement is as much a testament to her brash , no-nonsense energy as it is to her artistic achievements .
since then she has remained a marginal curio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this self-designed costume , pictured in 1931 , foreshadows 60 's fashions gert was born gertrud valesca samosch to a jewish family in berlin in 1892 .
showing no interest in academia , gert began taking dance lessons at the age of nine , and by 1915 was studying acting with alexander moissi .
her leanings toward the performing arts , combined with the detrimental effects of world war i on her father 's finances , led her to seek employment and she soon made appearances at the munich kammerspiele , the deutsches theater and the berliner tribuene . radical experiments on stage as the 1920 's progressed , she also began appearing in silent cinema , performing in " the threepenny opera , " " diary of a lost girl " with iconic flapper louise brooks , and g. w. pabst 's " joyless street . " it was around this time that gert unveiled one of her most enduring performance works .
entitled " pause , " it was an interpretative anti-dance performed between reels in cinemas , designed to draw attention to stillness and serenity . " it was so radical just to go on stage in the cinema stand there and do nothing , " said wolfgang mueller , " she did this in the 20 's where the convention was speed , business , activity and you see this in the films of the 20 's : big cities , traffic , nervosity .
to go out there and do the complete opposite was very , very modern . " by 1933 , with the nazis in power , gert suffered a ban from the german stage due to her jewish heritage .
she moved to london where she continued to perform on stage and appeared in the experimental short film " pett and pot " directed by alberto cavalcanti .
it would be her last film work until her triumphant return to the cinema in the mid-1960 's . trend setting with ' freedom from taste ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare 1969 recording of baby is screened at the pause exhibition by 1938 , in her late 40 's and living in new york but , gert found it virtually impossible to revive her previous career .
she lived on the welfare of a jewish refugee community , washed dishes and posed as a nude model .
in 1941 , she opened the bettlerbar -lrb- beggar 's bar -rrb- , a ramshackle cabaret / restaurant filled with mismatched furniture and staffed by the likes of jackson pollock and tennessee williams , the latter being fired by gert for being " too sloppy . " although licensing requirements forced the new york bar to close , gert introduced the concept to germany upon her return in 1950 .
it has proved perhaps her most enduring legacy ; tumbledown bars furnished with random pieces of flea-market chic and junk store accessories have since become legion in berlin , a fad started by gert which wolfgang mueller terms " freedom from taste . " back in post-war berlin , she once again had to start from scratch .
in the same 1977 television show , the interviewer tactfully suggested that by the dawn of the 1950 's gert was perhaps not so well remembered as before .
with typical self-depricating humor and bluntness typical for berliners , she exclaimed , " not so well remembered ?
i was totally forgotten ! " she opened the hexenkueche -lrb- witch 's kitchen -rrb- cabaret and made a triumphant return to the silver screen with an appearance in the 1965 surrealist drama " juliet of the spirits , " directed by frederico fellini .
she was soon cast in other high profile projects by rainer werner fassbinder 's and volker schloendorff . well outside the box bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the valeska gert exhibition is on display at the hamburger bahnhof until february 2011 while valeska gert has had a small but solid fan base , widespread fame always eluded her and , especially in the intervening years , she has become very much a marginalized character .
" i think she is a bit invisible , " said wolfgang mueller , " she is not known because she always ignored borders .
she was always far away from these boxes that the art scene puts people in . " however , 2010 may well see an upswing in gert 's popularity ; the exhibition dedicated to her work has a generous five-month run , while the martin schmitz publishing house has not only released mueller 's definitive new biography but also a 7 " vinyl recording of her 1969 performance of " baby , " an impersonation of a gurgling child alternating between rage and happiness . historian an paenhuysen , the curator of the new exhibition in berlin , was new to gert 's world before taking on this project ; now she is a devoted fan .
" valeska gert made work that is still very contemporary .
it still works for today , " she said .
" it 's very familiar and at the same time very strange , frightening .
it touches you .
it 's really hard to sum her up .
you ca n't name her or put her in a box . " author : neale lytollis editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the center will be a new way to help computer users escape botnets - groups of malware-infected computers that can be controlled and exploited by a remote third party .
" the main goal is to remove germany from the top 10 ranking of countries from which botnet activities originate , " according to a document about the project published late last year on the organization for economic cooperation and development 's website .
when expanded successfully , botnets can comprise thousands or millions of so-called zombie computers that are under the control of an attacker .
they can be used for infecting further computers , sending spam , conducting criminal activity and launching cyber-attacks .
generally speaking , botnets only affect computers with the microsoft windows operating system .
linux and mac os computers are rarely infected .
according to industry statistics , every seventh german computer connected to the internet is currently part of a botnet , with its user often unaware of the situation .
thomas de maiziere , germany 's interior minister , in a statement , described the problem as " the greatest current danger for the internet . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center will have a budget of two million euros annually various types of assistance the anti-botnet beratungszentrum offers help via email or by phone .
the center 's website , www.botfrei.de , contains instructions on how to free an affected computer from a botnet , as well as useful software .
the 2 million euro project is financially supported by the federal ministry of the interior and technically by the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- .
several internet providers , such as deutsche telekom , are also involved .
in the future , the participating internet providers will automatically notify their clients by email or post if their computers are infected with malware .
de maziere is encouraging non-participating providers to join the project , but he also emphasizes that affected internet users need to “ take their share of responsibility ” and take advantage of the assistance offered by the help center .

another man was arrested about eight hours later .
the police said officers had been searching two businesses and eight homes in the capital since the arrests , but had found no weapons or dangerous materials .
media reports suggested the arrests were likely linked to the papal visit , an issue on which the police would not comment .
the presence of pope benedict xvi in london meant that the british capital was already on high alert before friday 's raids .
" we 're totally calm , the pope is happy , " vatican spokesman federico lombardi said when reporters told him about the arrests .
" we can say that we 're totally confident in the work of the police . "
papal schedule unchanged the pope attended a service at london 's westminster abbey on friday led by archbishop of canterbury rowan williams , the leader of the world 's anglican church .
the two church leaders then met at lambeth palace , the anglican archbishop 's london residence , for historic talks : no pontiff had visited lambeth palace or visited the historic abbey since the foundation of the church of england when king henry viii broke with rome in 1534 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some object to benedict 's handling of the sex scandal benedict also delivered a speech at westminster hall - the historic heart of the houses of parliament - and addressed some 3,000 young catholics at an event in southwest london .
anti-church protests continue the run-up to the visit was clouded by criticism of the catholic church 's handling of a child abuse scandal and a furore over the trip 's cost : 20 million gbp -lrb- 37 million euros -rrb- .
there were protests before benedict 's engagement with young people in twickenham on friday , in the southwest of the british capital , with around 20 demonstrators waving banners with slogans saying , " there is no god - get over it ! " or " the pope is wrong , put a condom on ! "
on his flight to britain , benedict made some of his strongest comments yet on the paedophilia controversy , saying revelations of child abuse by priests that have rocked the catholic church " were a shock to me . "
he added that " the authorities in the church have not been vigilant enough . "
the church " did not act quickly or firmly enough to take the necessary action " to stop the problem , which involved abuse by priests and catholic teachers in ireland , germany , and a number of other countries around europe .
while in london , benedict was expected to meet a group of 10 victims of abuse , either on friday or saturday .
first pope to make ' state visit ' to england on the first day of the pope 's visit , he warned of the risk of " aggressive secularism " in britain and greeted tens of thousands of people at a mass in glasgow and on the streets of edinburgh .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen cordially invited the pope to britain herself " the united kingdom strives to be a modern and multicultural society , " benedict xvi said .
" in this challenging enterprise , may it always maintain its respect for those traditional values and cultural expressions that more aggressive forms of secularism no longer value or even tolerate . "
the pontiff also met queen elizabeth ii while in edinburgh : " i am delighted to welcome you to the uk and particularly to scotland on your first visit as pope , " the queen said .
this is the first papal visit to the uk to be classified as a state visit , because it was elizabeth ii who invited the pontiff , not the church .
benedict xvi and the queen focused on the positive aspects of relations between predominantly anglican britain and the roman catholic church , two bodies which the queen said shared " a common christian heritage . "
on sunday , benedict will travel to the central english city of birmingham for the final day of his visit , where he will preside over the beatification of a 19th century cardinal , john henry newman .

dw 's reporter offers a homeboy view of an area usually dismissed as a ghetto . recently , while eating a taco at a joint near where i live in berlin 's neukoelln neighborhood , i overheard a telling conversation .
two young english-speaking women , probably around 20 and obviously recent arrivals to our fair city , were talking about the difficulty of finding a suitably located apartment .
" it sucks being in prenzlauer berg , " sighed one .
" i have to travel 30 minutes to get to a decent bar . "
i nearly blew mole sauce through my nostrils laughing .
eleven years ago , when i permanently moved to berlin , my entire circle of friends lived in the prenzlauer berg and mitte districts in the former east and would draw air circles beside their temples upon learning i 'd chosen to invest in property south of the river spree .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neukoelln is still very international back then , neukoelln existed in the popular imagination only as a kind of forbidden zone for lower-class alcoholics , people who chronically forgot to take their lithium and double-digit turkish families roasting whole lambs in three-room tenement flats .
but times change , and cities with them .
these days , most parts of prenzlauer berg offer all the charm and excitement of a pta meeting , whereas it 's virtually impossible to spit across the street in the northern section neukoelln without hitting an independent fashion designer 's studio or a bar staffed by people who look like occasional members of the arcade fire .
as recently as 2006 , neukoelln attracted the opprobrium of the nation , after teachers at a neighborhood high school wrote to the mayor complaining that it was too dangerous to hold any kind of instruction in .
fast forward to now and hipsters sport t-shirts reading " i 'm a ruetli student . "
gentrification happens elsewhere the first step toward gentrification ?
i 'll never know exactly what the term means , other than a place someone liked being taken over by people whom that person does n't like .
what i do know is that in the past 10 years the value of my apartment has roughly doubled , and i can get reasonably authentic mexican food without having to inflict undue wear and tear on the soles of my adidas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this 1920 's housing estate in neukoelln is a unesco world heritage site walk down weserstrasse , which has become the street of choice for many 20-somethings to get hammered , and most of the bars still feel like they 're being run by students on the very edge of legality .
moreover , i doubt neukoelln could go the prenzlauer berg-mitte route , even if it wanted to .
first of all , it 's much bigger , and over 20 percent of its 300,000-plus inhabitants are foreigners - the vast majority working-class turkish people , and not ex-pat computer programmers from new york or london .
ironically , one reason student-types first begin moving in was because the u8 subway line was an easy connection up to the then-trendy districts in the east .
they 've since discovered that it 's more fun to stay in their own neighborhood to party .
and for the time being , at least , i 'm having fun watching them do it .

while machine builders can save costs in the short term by outsourcing production , in the long term , they can hurt themselves and the national economy . for years , german industry has faced growing international competition .
emerging markets such as china , india and brazil have already become big competitors , and a number of african countries could join the fray someday .
the prospect of lower labor costs has led many german machine builders to move parts or even all of their production abroad to stay competitive .
but some companies , like buemi in gevelsberg near wuppertal , view the outsourcing trend with skepticism .
buemi manufactures precision parts , such as axels , shafts , sockets and studs , for machine tools and trains .
the company is viewed as one of the " hidden champions " of german industry .
its customers include thyssen-krupp , siemens , komatsu and bombardier transportation .
maintaining a standard of living buemi managing director frank mittag has been at the helm of the company for 15 years .
he views germany as a manufacturing nation that relies on a powerful mechanical engineering sector .
and it 's thanks to the country 's competitive manufacturing base that services such as information technology can be easily outsourced .
" but if we rely solely on services , we will not be able to maintain our standard of living , " mittag says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : managing director frank mittag warns about being blinded by short-term cost benefits in a high-wage country like germany , the managing director asserts , there is only one alternative : quality .
that means precision , innovation , reliability and longevity .
competing on price is n't an option for germany .
so while german machine builders can lower operating costs by outsourcing some production , it 's important they retain their core competencies at home , according to mittag .
" if we transfer abroad our innovative production processes and the constructions we need to achieve superior quality and reliability , then we destroy the very competitive edge we need to compete with low-wage countries , " he says , adding that it ’ s also important to have a high-quality supplier network in germany .
long-term costs mittag sees little sense in establishing a supplier network abroad and investing heavily to trim it for quality .
there 's a risk of important know-how seeping out .
moreover , the short-term cost advantage of this strategy would only be achieved with long-term disadvantages .
" the first costs people notice are from purchasing , " mittag says .
" other costs like those for quality assurance or production downtimes , processing and marketing are often overlooked in outsourcing projects . "
once these factors are considered in the equation , unit production costs rise , he adds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other machine builders have become cautious about outsourcing buemi has polled other machine builders that have become more cautious with their international expansion .
many medium-sized companies have established subsidiaries in china , whose operations were quickly replicated by competitors next door .
the damage can be huge .
many attribute the rise of china 's auto industry to german mechanical engineering firms that have established production facilities in the country .
know-how transfer is inevitable in such a global economy , but mittag warns nonetheless that companies outsourcing production in china should need to move cautiously and not be blinded by the short-term cost benefits .
today , germany 's mechanical engineering sector has a 10 to 20 year lead on its competitors in asia , according to mittag .
but to maintain that lead , he says , the sector must continue to strive for top quality , which can only be achieved with skilled employees .
" honesty , decency and conscientiousness , " mittag says , are indispensable because if business is driven only by a near insatiable hunger for higher profits , the quality of work and the products will suffer .
