andre borschberg , both the pilot of the ' solar impulse ' and one of its leaders , announced this week that the plane would be entering its next testing phase sometime in september .
the plan is to make three short-distance hops over swiss territory - from payerne to geneva , geneva to zurich , zurich to payerne - to see how well the aircraft can be integrated into the flow of everyday business at an international airport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertrand picard and andre borschberg in the hanger borshberg added that the upcoming jaunts are crictical if they are ever to take the plane beyond swiss borders and land at major foreign airports .
" our airplane is quite special , it flies slowly , it is very light and is sensitive to turbulence , " he said .
" we have to know what logistics need to be put in place and to see what kind of collaboration we need to develop with big airports because . "
a training exercise given the plane 's relatively slow cruising speeds - 50 kilometers per hour -lrb- or about 31 mph -rrb- as compared to the standard 250 kilometers per hour -lrb- or 155 mph -rrb- for larger aircraft - the ground crew has time to drive from payerne to geneva and arrive before it lands .
it might sound like a strange exercise on paper , but borschberg insists that it is all part of getting everyone acquainted with the solar-generated newcomer .
" we have to train the team , " borschberg said , " and see what kind of difficulties we have with traffic arriving and departing . "
and that cuts both ways .
it is not only the pilot and the ground crew dedicated to the ' solar impuse ' that have to get used to operating in a very busy environment , but the other aircraft that have to become accustomed to its presence .
the fact that the plane , which has solar panels attached to the 63 meter span of its wings , it is so easily thrown off by turbulence means the time between it landing and taking has to be adapted accordingly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plane on the ground " it is quite difficult for people in the control towers , because they are not used to it , " borschberg said .
" it is an experiment to get their feedback , to see how it works so that when we fly to another international airport next year , we can propose a way to operate that has been tested and in which we have experience . "
commercial potential ?
as yet there is no solid information about exactly where the non-domestic flights might take the ' solar impulse . '
but wherever it goes , there is a good chance it will attract a lot of attention .
the idea of a plane which can fly without spluttering more emissions into the already choking skies , is a welcome thought , both environmentally and economically .
" ten years ago fuel was 10 percent of airlines cost and now it is nearly 30 percent , " geoff van klaveren , aviation expert with the deutsche bank told deutsche welle .
" any kind of alternative fuel is a thing we have to research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky is the limit .
or is it ?
yet anyone hoping to see this state-of-the-art clean technology ground the world 's current airline fleet is in for a long-haul wait .
commercialization , the ' solar impulse ' pilot insists , is still a very small dot on the horizon .
in reference to the decades it took between the wright brothers ' first aircraft success and the first commercial transatlantic flight , he stressed that it is a slow process .
" i think we will have to wait a while before we can do the same with passengers , but we have to start somewhere , " borschberg said .
making history , changing lives and that it has .
in july , ' solar impulse ' became the first aircraft in history to stay in the air for 26 consecutive hours without any fuel .
the plane took off in the early hours of the morning and spent 14 hours in the air during sunlight hours , enough time for its batteries to charge for the night-time portion of the experiment .
bildunterschrift : solar-powered night flight speaking shortly after the landing , swiss adventurer and brainchild of the project bertrand piccard told reporters that the round-the-clock flight had taken them closer to " the myth of perpetual flight . "
but that is not the only goal they have in mind .
both piccard and borschberg believe that to make the world aware of how much can be achieved with just four six kilowatt electric motors , is to open eyes to the possibilities on the ground .
" at this stage the purpose of the project is not so much to develop a commercial application but to show what we can do today with this technology , " borschberg added .
he said that as much as anything it is about making people see how with the right technology they can use less energy yet still maintain the same quality of life .

after a bumpy round one - and an even worse performance a week later - they 'll try to get it together this week . match day three in the bundesliga is upon us , and dw 's team of football freaks are seeking redemption - and hoping that when it comes to picks , it 's a case of third time 's a charm .
-lrb- or at the very least for things to go back to normal . -rrb-
after a weak first round - when , admittedly there 's not much to go on when filling out your bet slip - the bundesliga gods belched up one of their most unexpected sets of results in recent memory : a match day with seven away wins and a bona fide shocker in bayern 's loss to promoted team kaiserslautern .
as you might expect , the prediction squad took a hit -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but still we rise .
friday , september 10 hoffenheim - schalke the footballing playthings of sap billionaire dietmar hopp have burst into the new season at full stride , dispatching bremen at home and handling pauli away .
vedad ibisisevic is back in great form up front and ghana 's world cup run this summer appears to have done defender isaac vorsah a world of good .
the winless schalke are … a work in progress , at best .
but there is reason for hope .
benedikt hoewedes is back from suspension , which will help shore up their creaky back line , and raul no longer has a donkey named edu for his strike partner - rather he 'll have a face familiar to him from madrid in klaas-jan huntelaar .
i like them to snatch a point .
prediction : 1-1 saturday , september 11 borussia dortmund - wolfsburg bildunterschrift : mueller is fast ebcoming the man in munich dortmund have been up and down thus far , laying an egg at home to leverkusen , and then flying high away from home stuttgart .
in mario goetze , they 've unearthed another young german gem and shinji kagawa -lrb- bought for 350,000 euros - $ 446,000 -rrb- is surely the steal of the season .
wolfsburg were unlucky to lose on opening night to bayern , but just plain blew it against mainz , surrendering a three goal lead to lose 4-3 .
taking into account the injured arne friedrich 's continuing absence from the center of defense and a knock that might keep creative maestro diego out of the starting line-up , i ca n't see wolfsburg getting a result in dortmund .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 hamburg - nuremberg hsv 's ruud van nistelrooy has been chewing up bundesliga defenses , notching three goals in his first two games .
nuremberg , meanwhile , just eked out a draw at gladbach and wilted to defeat at home to lowly freiburg .
hamburg should win at a canter .
prediction : hamburg 3-1 borussia moenchengladbach - eintracht frankfurt a tough one to call , this .
if gladbach are half the side they were in their 6-3 demolition of leverkusen in week two , it 's not a contest .
then again , if they revert to their ordinary form , eintracht - who were unfortunate to go down in week one to hanover before being steamrolled by hamburg in week two - have the horses to get a draw , or even win .
home advantage and frankfurt 's injury worries in defense -lrb- vasoski is out , chris is day-to-day -rrb- should tip this for the foals .
prediction : gladbach 2-1 freiburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : van the man is getting his first taste of the millerntor stadium in any derby , observers are meant to " throw out the record books . "
so i will .
despite freiburg having picked up three points to stuttgart 's none so far this season , i reckon baden-wuerttemburg 's big boys just have too much quality to keep on stinking out stadiums every week .
new signing mauro camoranesi will steady the ship in midfield , while cacau will have a big game against a suspect freiburg back line .
prediction : stuttgart 3-1 hanover 96 - bayer leverkusen among the sides with six points after two match days , the reds are surely the most surprising .
but their results have been convincing - they fought eintracht to a stalemate before snatching a late win , and played schalke off the park .
much of this comes down to good transfer dealing which has brought much-needed quality .
emanuel pogatetz and mohamed abdelloue were inexpensive and have done the business , and i expect damarcus beasley -lrb- brought in on a free transfer -rrb- to do the same .
the only trouble is , this week they host leverkusen , who are just too fast up front for their aging defense .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 bayern munich - werder bremen per mertesacker 's injury in germany 's win over azerbaijan this week came at precisely the wrong moment for werder - just in time to weaken its back line for one of its sternest tests of the season in munich .
mikael silvestre , who bremen picked up ahead of the transfer deadline and will now have to throw into the center of defense , will probably get torched by the likes of thomas mueller , ivica olic , and franck ribery .
bremen 's only chance will be to get big games out of new boys wesley and marko arnautovic - which they may well do .
prediction : bayern 4-2 sunday , september 12 mainz - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you hear that lakic ?
dw sports says you 're due to cool off a shock table-topping clash with both sides on six points , this game is likely to see one of the two participants unmasked as a pretender for top-half status .
i see kaiserslautern as the likelier candidate .
the red devils are very solid at the back , but i do n't trust their on-fire hitman srdan lakic -lrb- three goals in two matches -rrb- to stay ablaze much longer .
mainz , on the other hand , have another year of top-flight experience under their collective belt and earned several stripes with their four-goal fight back in wolfsburg in week two .
prediction : mainz 2-1 cologne - st. pauli these two sets of supporters have a " fan friendship " - an odd german custom wherein two clubs ' ultras agree , over a period of years , to get along rather than taunt each other .
with that in mind , as well as each club 's fans ' reputation for liking a drink or four , this game ought to have a party atmosphere .
the teams may well spoil it .
st. pauli 's hell-for leather approach can be entertaining , but is low on ball skill .
and the more defensive-minded cologne , more often than not , makes for putrid viewing .
expect a draw .

-lrb- or at the very least for things to go back to normal . -rrb-
after a weak first round - when , admittedly there 's not much to go on when filling out your bet slip - the bundesliga gods belched up one of their most unexpected sets of results in recent memory : a match day with seven away wins and a bona fide shocker in bayern 's loss to promoted team kaiserslautern .
as you might expect , the prediction squad took a hit -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but still we rise .
friday , september 10 hoffenheim - schalke the footballing playthings of sap billionaire dietmar hopp have burst into the new season at full stride , dispatching bremen at home and handling pauli away .
vedad ibisisevic is back in great form up front and ghana 's world cup run this summer appears to have done defender isaac vorsah a world of good .
the winless schalke are … a work in progress , at best .
but there is reason for hope .
benedikt hoewedes is back from suspension , which will help shore up their creaky back line , and raul no longer has a donkey named edu for his strike partner - rather he 'll have a face familiar to him from madrid in klaas-jan huntelaar .
i like them to snatch a point .
prediction : 1-1 saturday , september 11 borussia dortmund - wolfsburg bildunterschrift : mueller is fast ebcoming the man in munich dortmund have been up and down thus far , laying an egg at home to leverkusen , and then flying high away from home stuttgart .
in mario goetze , they 've unearthed another young german gem and shinji kagawa -lrb- bought for 350,000 euros - $ 446,000 -rrb- is surely the steal of the season .
wolfsburg were unlucky to lose on opening night to bayern , but just plain blew it against mainz , surrendering a three goal lead to lose 4-3 .
taking into account the injured arne friedrich 's continuing absence from the center of defense and a knock that might keep creative maestro diego out of the starting line-up , i ca n't see wolfsburg getting a result in dortmund .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 hamburg - nuremberg hsv 's ruud van nistelrooy has been chewing up bundesliga defenses , notching three goals in his first two games .
nuremberg , meanwhile , just eked out a draw at gladbach and wilted to defeat at home to lowly freiburg .
hamburg should win at a canter .
prediction : hamburg 3-1 borussia moenchengladbach - eintracht frankfurt a tough one to call , this .
if gladbach are half the side they were in their 6-3 demolition of leverkusen in week two , it 's not a contest .
then again , if they revert to their ordinary form , eintracht - who were unfortunate to go down in week one to hanover before being steamrolled by hamburg in week two - have the horses to get a draw , or even win .
home advantage and frankfurt 's injury worries in defense -lrb- vasoski is out , chris is day-to-day -rrb- should tip this for the foals .
prediction : gladbach 2-1 freiburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : van the man is getting his first taste of the millerntor stadium in any derby , observers are meant to " throw out the record books . "
so i will .
despite freiburg having picked up three points to stuttgart 's none so far this season , i reckon baden-wuerttemburg 's big boys just have too much quality to keep on stinking out stadiums every week .
new signing mauro camoranesi will steady the ship in midfield , while cacau will have a big game against a suspect freiburg back line .
prediction : stuttgart 3-1 hanover 96 - bayer leverkusen among the sides with six points after two match days , the reds are surely the most surprising .
but their results have been convincing - they fought eintracht to a stalemate before snatching a late win , and played schalke off the park .
much of this comes down to good transfer dealing which has brought much-needed quality .
emanuel pogatetz and mohamed abdelloue were inexpensive and have done the business , and i expect damarcus beasley -lrb- brought in on a free transfer -rrb- to do the same .
the only trouble is , this week they host leverkusen , who are just too fast up front for their aging defense .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 bayern munich - werder bremen per mertesacker 's injury in germany 's win over azerbaijan this week came at precisely the wrong moment for werder - just in time to weaken its back line for one of its sternest tests of the season in munich .
mikael silvestre , who bremen picked up ahead of the transfer deadline and will now have to throw into the center of defense , will probably get torched by the likes of thomas mueller , ivica olic , and franck ribery .
bremen 's only chance will be to get big games out of new boys wesley and marko arnautovic - which they may well do .
prediction : bayern 4-2 sunday , september 12 mainz - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you hear that lakic ?
dw sports says you 're due to cool off a shock table-topping clash with both sides on six points , this game is likely to see one of the two participants unmasked as a pretender for top-half status .
i see kaiserslautern as the likelier candidate .
the red devils are very solid at the back , but i do n't trust their on-fire hitman srdan lakic -lrb- three goals in two matches -rrb- to stay ablaze much longer .
mainz , on the other hand , have another year of top-flight experience under their collective belt and earned several stripes with their four-goal fight back in wolfsburg in week two .
prediction : mainz 2-1 cologne - st. pauli these two sets of supporters have a " fan friendship " - an odd german custom wherein two clubs ' ultras agree , over a period of years , to get along rather than taunt each other .
with that in mind , as well as each club 's fans ' reputation for liking a drink or four , this game ought to have a party atmosphere .
the teams may well spoil it .
st. pauli 's hell-for leather approach can be entertaining , but is low on ball skill .
and the more defensive-minded cologne , more often than not , makes for putrid viewing .
expect a draw .

but it was a contemporary form of anti-semitism that got the exhibit off the ground . the project started after four neo-nazis firebombed a synagogue in the northern german town of luebeck on the eve of passover in 1994 , according to mark grellert , who has been creating virtual reconstructions of synagogues at darmstadt technical university since that firebombing both as a student and now professor in the architecture department . " i do n't remember where i heard this about the arson attack , but i think a couple of minutes afterwards and i got the idea , we have to do something against this , " he told deutsche welle . his idea was to virtually reconstruct some of the synagogues that were destroyed on kristallnacht , or the night of the broken glass , on november 10 , 1938 .
that was one of the most heinous attacks against jews , synagogues and jewish businesses in german history . their efforts culminated in an exhibition in bonn in 2000 . that exhibition has now come to the united states for the first time at the holocaust memorial center zekelman family campus in farmington hills , michigan .
the exhibit opened on august 29 and will run through the end of november . back in 1994 , grellert and his team started with three synagogues in frankfurt .
but he said they quickly realized that the project would n't move as quickly as they hoped as it would take them almost one year to finish a single synagogue . getting the plans the first step was to find blueprints or old photographs showing the synagogue 's floor plan then grellert and his team would reach out to people who remembered the original appearance of the synagogue . " in many synagogues , you have only black-and-white photographs , " grellert said .
" so we ask them if they have remembrance of the colors of the synagogues . " bildunterschrift : cologne 's synagogue was built in a neo-islamic style , recalling centuries-old mosques from there , the students redraw the blueprints into computers to create 3d models .
when the project started back in 1994 , 3d modeling technology was less advanced primitive than today . but in recent years , grellert added , the team has been able to account for the detail of the synagogues decor , including ornate chandeliers , stained-glass windows , and red brick exterior . the end result of all the work is 14 virtually reconstructed synagogues from all over germany presented in an exhibit divided three parts : perception , escalation , and reconstruction . the exhibit starts by putting a context around germany 's anti-semitic laws in the 1930s , followed by the names of the 1,200 places in germany where synagogues were destroyed on kristallnacht . the final room , reconstruction , displays the 14 virtually reconstructed synagogues .
the display begins with the synagogue ’ s exterior then shows the interior with special attention paid to details like the shadows cast by balconies and refracted light rays coming in through the windows . the intricate digital displays recreate the importance the houses of worship held in germany before their destruction , according to stephen goldman , executive director of the holocaust memorial center in farmington hills , in the us state of michigan - where the exhibit is currently located . " these were big , prominent institutions , " he told deutsche welle .
" often looking exactly like the cathedrals across the street and done by prominent and well-known german architects . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's synagogue was built in 1861 and destroyed in 1938 ruined communities goldman added that by destroying the synagogues , the nazis tore apart more than individual buildings . " the destruction of a house of worship is very different than the destruction of a home , or even a school , because this effects a whole population , " he said .
" it 's saying , ' we 're no longer safe in our houses of worship ... in our cities , in the buildings we expect to shelter us and cradle us in safety . " ' but goldman admitted that while the digital reconstructions would not have the significance of an actual house of worship , they could serve as a reminder of what was . " it 's not listening to somebody speak to you , but it reminds you of that person , " he said .
" these are speaking in those styles .
these are speaking in the voices of the past . " those voices spoke powerfully to ruth schnee , who attended the exhibit 's opening in michigan .
originally from duesseldorf , she has lived in the united states since 1939 and vividly remembers kristallnacht . " i remember the synagogue in duesseldorf , which was our synagogue , being put on fire , and the rabbi ran into the building to save the torah , and perished in the building , " she said .
" the fire brigade was trained to protect the adjoining buildings , and not of course the synagogues .

but it was a contemporary form of anti-semitism that got the exhibit off the ground . the project started after four neo-nazis firebombed a synagogue in the northern german town of luebeck on the eve of passover in 1994 , according to mark grellert , who has been creating virtual reconstructions of synagogues at darmstadt technical university since that firebombing both as a student and now professor in the architecture department . " i do n't remember where i heard this about the arson attack , but i think a couple of minutes afterwards and i got the idea , we have to do something against this , " he told deutsche welle . his idea was to virtually reconstruct some of the synagogues that were destroyed on kristallnacht , or the night of the broken glass , on november 10 , 1938 .
that was one of the most heinous attacks against jews , synagogues and jewish businesses in german history . their efforts culminated in an exhibition in bonn in 2000 . that exhibition has now come to the united states for the first time at the holocaust memorial center zekelman family campus in farmington hills , michigan .
the exhibit opened on august 29 and will run through the end of november . back in 1994 , grellert and his team started with three synagogues in frankfurt .
but he said they quickly realized that the project would n't move as quickly as they hoped as it would take them almost one year to finish a single synagogue . getting the plans the first step was to find blueprints or old photographs showing the synagogue 's floor plan then grellert and his team would reach out to people who remembered the original appearance of the synagogue . " in many synagogues , you have only black-and-white photographs , " grellert said .
" so we ask them if they have remembrance of the colors of the synagogues . " bildunterschrift : cologne 's synagogue was built in a neo-islamic style , recalling centuries-old mosques from there , the students redraw the blueprints into computers to create 3d models .
when the project started back in 1994 , 3d modeling technology was less advanced primitive than today . but in recent years , grellert added , the team has been able to account for the detail of the synagogues decor , including ornate chandeliers , stained-glass windows , and red brick exterior . the end result of all the work is 14 virtually reconstructed synagogues from all over germany presented in an exhibit divided three parts : perception , escalation , and reconstruction . the exhibit starts by putting a context around germany 's anti-semitic laws in the 1930s , followed by the names of the 1,200 places in germany where synagogues were destroyed on kristallnacht . the final room , reconstruction , displays the 14 virtually reconstructed synagogues .
the display begins with the synagogue ’ s exterior then shows the interior with special attention paid to details like the shadows cast by balconies and refracted light rays coming in through the windows . the intricate digital displays recreate the importance the houses of worship held in germany before their destruction , according to stephen goldman , executive director of the holocaust memorial center in farmington hills , in the us state of michigan - where the exhibit is currently located . " these were big , prominent institutions , " he told deutsche welle .
" often looking exactly like the cathedrals across the street and done by prominent and well-known german architects . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's synagogue was built in 1861 and destroyed in 1938 ruined communities goldman added that by destroying the synagogues , the nazis tore apart more than individual buildings . " the destruction of a house of worship is very different than the destruction of a home , or even a school , because this effects a whole population , " he said .
" it 's saying , ' we 're no longer safe in our houses of worship ... in our cities , in the buildings we expect to shelter us and cradle us in safety . " ' but goldman admitted that while the digital reconstructions would not have the significance of an actual house of worship , they could serve as a reminder of what was . " it 's not listening to somebody speak to you , but it reminds you of that person , " he said .
" these are speaking in those styles .
these are speaking in the voices of the past . " those voices spoke powerfully to ruth schnee , who attended the exhibit 's opening in michigan .
originally from duesseldorf , she has lived in the united states since 1939 and vividly remembers kristallnacht . " i remember the synagogue in duesseldorf , which was our synagogue , being put on fire , and the rabbi ran into the building to save the torah , and perished in the building , " she said .
" the fire brigade was trained to protect the adjoining buildings , and not of course the synagogues .
the art , the furniture , everything was demolished .

critics say madrid is strangling investment in renewables - and the wider economy . about five years ago , spanish farmers realized they could make more money harvesting the sun than they could planting crops .
on the dusty plains of castilla y leon , for instance , fields of sunflowers gave way to solar panels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate activists have put their own form of pressure on spain 's government that growth was spurred by alternative electricity subsidies that are now endangered .
industry minister miguel sebastian has announced subsidies for new , ground-based solar parks will be cut by 45 percent .
state support for rooftop installations will fall by 25 percent , while smaller installations will see cuts of 5 percent .
eduardo collado , technical director at the photovoltaic industry association -lrb- asif -rrb- , described the plan as short-sighted .
by 2020 , renewable energy could be less expensive than conventional and nuclear power , which still enjoys annual subsidies worth billions of euros , he said .
“ it 's very bad news , " he told deutsche welle .
" -lrb- spanish leaders -rrb- are in a deep crisis , so they have to save money where they can , but they are not taking account of the investments that are the future of spain 's energy industry .
it is n't spending , it 's investment .
you have to look 10 or 15 years ahead … if the price of oil goes up , the cost of renewables will be nothing in comparison . "
sector not self-sufficient spain 's government says the cuts reflect improved efficiency in solar technologies , but the sector is not competitive yet .
it contributed 1.2 billion euros towards country 's gdp in 2008 and collected 3 billion euros worth of subsidies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when resources become scarce , solar energy will be invaluable , advocates say however , the solar sector is innovative and dynamic , and in a matter of years has grown rapidly to account for 3 percent of spain 's energy production .
with news of the cuts , anger and frustration has echoed across its trade associations .
carlos navarro , the founder of siliken , a solar panel manufacturer that employs 1,000 people , said the subsidy rollback is the latest in a long line of errors .
the looming cuts have put 10 billion euros worth of projects on hold and lines of credit are now nearly impossible to obtain from banks , he said .
" we have always felt that spain was not so consistent in the program of photovoltaic development , " he told deutsche welle .
" almost every year we have had changes in the policy and the targets and the volumes . "
" the real problem is not the question of the tariff , it 's the uncertainty they are constantly sending to the markets – especially the financial institutions – about the security of their investment … the market is completely stopped right now . "
jobs lost according to asif , the lack of clarity over tariffs has led to significant job losses .
the sector employed 40,000 people in 2008 , when a record-breaking 3,000 megawatts of solar capacity were installed .
now that new investments have ground to a halt , the 2010 workforce consists of just 13,500 workers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's austerity measures have drawn widespread protest many in the industry blame big conventional energy companies for pressuring the government to defend them against competition from renewable energy , which has forced conventional power stations to reduce output .
carlos navarro said big energy companies pushed the government towards austerity measures in the photovoltaic sector because its fragmented composition made it an easy target .
" the problem is that the companies are not running the plants as much as they were before , " he said .
" demand has been cut 5 percent because of the crisis , so they are making a lot of noise and they are trying to find enemies .
well , photovoltaics is a very good enemy because the portfolio of owners is very spread out .
there are no big companies with an interest in photovoltaic energy . "

in sweden , the iranian ambassador was summoned to stockholm to assert the government 's concerns . european union officials welcomed iran 's decision to suspend the stoning sentence on a woman charged with adultery , but said that it all charges should now be dropped against her .
sakineh mohammadi ashtiani , a 43-year-old mother of two has been convicted of adultery in iran and faced a sentence of death by stoning .
ashtiani 's case has drawn criticism from much of the international community .
iran 's foreign ministry announced the decision to suspend the sentence in a statement released on wednesday .
the eu 's high representative for foreign affairs , catherine ashton , described it as " a step in the right direction . "
however it is unclear whether ashtiani still faces the death penalty , or if the sentence could be applied at a later date .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ashtiani 's defense lawyer has fled to europe earlier on wednesday , the european parliament increased pressure on iran to drop ashtiani 's sentence by passing a resolution condemning it .
the legislative resolution condemning tehran won by a vote of 658-to-1 in strasbourg .
' disgusting form of punishment ' in sweden , the iranian ambassador was summoned to stockholm over the ashtiani case .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt told swedish public radio that the government condemned the sentence .
" we are against capital punishment in any case , but stoning is a particularly disgusting form of capital punishment , and iran should realise that this is completely unacceptable , " bildt said .

in sweden , the iranian ambassador was summoned to stockholm to assert the government 's concerns . european union officials welcomed iran 's decision to suspend the stoning sentence on a woman charged with adultery , but said that it all charges should now be dropped against her .
sakineh mohammadi ashtiani , a 43-year-old mother of two has been convicted of adultery in iran and faced a sentence of death by stoning .
ashtiani 's case has drawn criticism from much of the international community .
iran 's foreign ministry announced the decision to suspend the sentence in a statement released on wednesday .
the eu 's high representative for foreign affairs , catherine ashton , described it as " a step in the right direction . "
however it is unclear whether ashtiani still faces the death penalty , or if the sentence could be applied at a later date .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ashtiani 's defense lawyer has fled to europe earlier on wednesday , the european parliament increased pressure on iran to drop ashtiani 's sentence by passing a resolution condemning it .
the legislative resolution condemning tehran won by a vote of 658-to-1 in strasbourg .
' disgusting form of punishment ' in sweden , the iranian ambassador was summoned to stockholm over the ashtiani case .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt told swedish public radio that the government condemned the sentence .
" we are against capital punishment in any case , but stoning is a particularly disgusting form of capital punishment , and iran should realise that this is completely unacceptable , " bildt said .
the minister argued that the international uproar over the case had had " influence . "
" if we had not acted as we have over these past months , she would have presumably been killed by stoning by now , " he said .

as the military crackdown against the movement intensifies , protests have turned violent . as temperatures soar above 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in aden , the great port city of south yemen , homes become airless .
daily power cuts leave residents sweating through dark nights .
in a region where resentment of the government in the north has been festering for a decade , such daily indignities are enough to spark fury in the people .
earlier this week thousands took to the streets in protest .
car tyres were burned , property vandalised and gun shots fired .
police were pelted with stones .
according to yemeni officials this came after members of the opposition group known as the southern movement , some of whose factions call for independence from northern yemen , ambushed a military patrol and wounded three soldiers .
the attack followed shortly on from the twice attempted assassination of an army brigade commander by members of the southern movement the week earlier .
in south yemen scenes like these repeat themselves at increasingly shorter intervals .
besieged by conflicts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen 's president ali abdullah saleh is facing growing unrest from his palace in the mountain capital of sanaa president ali abdullah saleh seems besieged by conflicts .
to the north , a recent peace agreement quelling six years of rebellion by the zaidi shia houthi clan , who fight a government they accuse of marginalising them politically as well as economically , has been breaking down , threatening a return to war .
in the unruly tribal strongholds of east yemen saleh 's troops face an al qaeda branch well integrated into the local community and whose failed attempt to bring down a us airliner last christmas day showed they are a menace not just to yemen , but to international security as well .
however , to the government in sanaa , no conflict is more serious than the growing power of the southern movement , whose call for independence from the north threatens the territorial integrity of the state .
economic injustices the key grievance levelled by the southern movement against president saleh is economic : southerners complain bitterly that despite their small numbers , just 3.5 million compared to 20 million living in the north , and despite the south being home to the majority of yemen 's oil and gas fields -lrb- which account for 75 percent of the government 's revenue -rrb- the south has not witnessed anything like the economic growth and development of the north , limited though that is .
the movement accuses the president of favoritism of northerners , working through tribal patronage networks from which southerners are largely excluded , of arbitrary land confiscation and political disenfranchisement .
the grievances date back to the unification between north and south yemen in 1990 , which was viewed by many southern leaders as failed .
they were politically outnumbered by their northern colleagues , the two armies were never integrated and assassinations of southern leaders created a deep mistrust of the north .
after elections in 1993 , leaders of former south yemen called for a new federal constitutional system which would decentralize power .
instead , a year later a brief but bloody civil war erupted with northern troops occupying the south .
in the wake of the victory of north over south , president saleh amended the constitution , removing institutions of joint north-south rule and granting himself power to rule by decree .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yemeni army is coming under increasing attacks from opposition rebels since then , a growing sense injustice has simmered in the south , but it was not until 2007 that the southern movement emerged , coalescing around a group of former south yemen army officers , part of a group of 20,000 military personnel forced into early retirement after the 1994 war , who rose up after their pensions were not paid .
former brigadier nasser al-qawi from the aviation brigade of al-anad air base was one of those officers and is today one of the movement 's leaders .
" the authorities ' refusal to address the issues of the south , the looting of its resources for the benefit of the ruling family and the corruption have led -lsb- the south -rsb- to demand secession from the north , " said al-qawi in an interview .
he insisted that southern movement demonstrations had always been peaceful , but blamed sanaa for a violent response .
" it seems the authorities want to drag us towards violence to find a justification to suppress the movement . " " the language of violence and repression used against the people of the south reflects the failure and inability of the government to provide solutions . -lsb- ... -rsb-
for southerners the dream faded away and turned into a nightmare .
people feel the south is under occupation by the north . "

to the north , a recent peace agreement quelling six years of rebellion by the zaidi shia houthi clan , who fight a government they accuse of marginalising them politically as well as economically , has been breaking down , threatening a return to war .
in the unruly tribal strongholds of east yemen saleh 's troops face an al qaeda branch well integrated into the local community and whose failed attempt to bring down a us airliner last christmas day showed they are a menace not just to yemen , but to international security as well .
however , to the government in sanaa , no conflict is more serious than the growing power of the southern movement , whose call for independence from the north threatens the territorial integrity of the state .
economic injustices the key grievance levelled by the southern movement against president saleh is economic : southerners complain bitterly that despite their small numbers , just 3.5 million compared to 20 million living in the north , and despite the south being home to the majority of yemen 's oil and gas fields -lrb- which account for 75 percent of the government 's revenue -rrb- the south has not witnessed anything like the economic growth and development of the north , limited though that is .
the movement accuses the president of favoritism of northerners , working through tribal patronage networks from which southerners are largely excluded , of arbitrary land confiscation and political disenfranchisement .
the grievances date back to the unification between north and south yemen in 1990 , which was viewed by many southern leaders as failed .
they were politically outnumbered by their northern colleagues , the two armies were never integrated and assassinations of southern leaders created a deep mistrust of the north .
after elections in 1993 , leaders of former south yemen called for a new federal constitutional system which would decentralize power .
instead , a year later a brief but bloody civil war erupted with northern troops occupying the south .
in the wake of the victory of north over south , president saleh amended the constitution , removing institutions of joint north-south rule and granting himself power to rule by decree .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yemeni army is coming under increasing attacks from opposition rebels since then , a growing sense injustice has simmered in the south , but it was not until 2007 that the southern movement emerged , coalescing around a group of former south yemen army officers , part of a group of 20,000 military personnel forced into early retirement after the 1994 war , who rose up after their pensions were not paid .
former brigadier nasser al-qawi from the aviation brigade of al-anad air base was one of those officers and is today one of the movement 's leaders .
" the authorities ' refusal to address the issues of the south , the looting of its resources for the benefit of the ruling family and the corruption have led -lsb- the south -rsb- to demand secession from the north , " said al-qawi in an interview .
he insisted that southern movement demonstrations had always been peaceful , but blamed sanaa for a violent response .
" it seems the authorities want to drag us towards violence to find a justification to suppress the movement . " " the language of violence and repression used against the people of the south reflects the failure and inability of the government to provide solutions . -lsb- ... -rsb-

back to first page back 2/2 no head to cut bildunterschrift : even the use of force against the southern movement is not achieving the desired outcome since 2007 the southern movement has grown steadily .
according to observers it has no unified leadership .
" there is no central nervous system , which , paradoxically , has made it a lot more formidable , as there is no head to cut , " said abdul-ghani aryani , a sanaa based political analyst .
the movement includes several political factions , most importantly the former ruling party of south yemen , the yemeni socialist party -lrb- ysp -rrb- .
while many consider ali salem al-beidh , who served as vice president of yemen until he was forced into exile in germany , the champion of their cause , some observers argue he is only a nominal figurehead .
instead , they point to exiled haydar al-attas , former prime minister , as the most effective leader and former south yemen president ali nasser muhammad , who fled in 1986 .
while the movement 's support base is mainly from the south , members of the islah party , the northern-based islamist opposition party , have also expressed backing for the movement .
sympathy for the movement is even found among members of the president 's ruling party , the general people 's congress -lrb- gpc -rrb- .
one former staunch supporter of president saleh and the gpc , tareq al-fadhli , joined the movement in 2009 .
a month later nasser al-wahayshi , leader of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- announced his support for the movement .
whilst the defection by al-fadhli , a former mujahedeen who allegedly fought alongside osama bin laden in afghanistan and later against the ysp in the early 1990 's was interpreted by some as the southern movement developing ties with al qaeda , many see it as a deepening divide between the north and south .
" he was obviously disgruntled by the marginalization he and other southerners suffer from for the benefit of northern tribal elite , " said abdul-ghani aryani .
neither evidence nor shared ideology has been found to link the southern movement to al qaeda .
although al-fadhli has stated that he supports an independent southern state , led by former ysp leader ali salem al-beidh , he has recently been sidelined in the movement .
southern tribes such as the large balharis tribe of shebwa and the bakazim of abyan have also declared their solidarity with the movement .
cracking down as the southern movement has grown the government in sanaa has retorted with violence and repression .
in an august 2010 report the human rights organisation amnesty international accused yemeni authorities of sacrificing human rights in the name of security .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is resorting to media repression to quell the unrest the report argued that the government " has increasingly resorted to unlawful means , including enforced disappearances , unlawful killings , arbitrary detention and excessive use of force . "
at the same time newspapers have been closed down , journalists , editors and proprietors detained , held incommunicado , ill-treated and jailed on spurious charges after unfair trials , said amnesty .
" journalists are in danger of arbitrary arrest by the state and are subjected to beatings and charges of causing riots in the streets , " said abdul-khaliq al-hout , who has worked for al-diyar newspaper in aden for six years .
al-hout said writing about the southern movement is a " complex " issue .
" i can feel the lack of freedom of expression and of providing information and facts to the public . "
restrictive laws and the repressive practices of security forces and special courts have undermined freedom of expression in yemen , though it is enshrined in the constitution .
the press and publications law of 1990 and the establishment of the specialized press and publications court in may 2009 have made it possible for the authorities to imprison " anyone who incites -lsb- -rsb- unrest . " like many other journalists al-hout was detained after writing an article about the southern movement .
after two months in prison human rights watch helped to secure his release .
" there is a growing fear among journalists of the press court where journalists are treated as criminals , " he said .
a revolution in the making ?
since the beginning of 2009 , more than 66 people have been killed in or near demonstrations and 251 have been wounded .
fifteen members of the security forces have also been killed , according to media reports .
analysts warn that as violence by government forces increases , so too does the call for independence .
while some of their leaders have called for secession from the north , ysp , according to analysts , would consider federalism as would pro-southern movement elements within the islah party .
members within the gpc have called for a local government in the south .
in response , on 22 may , the 20th anniversary of yemen 's unification , president saleh called for a revival of national dialogue and offered to form a national unity government .
according to abdel karim aryani , a long-time adviser to the president , decentralization in the north and local rule for the south is being discussed .
" this is what they -lsb- the southern movement -rsb- are asking for , " he said .
however , the more radical calls for independence now come from the general population of the south who bear the brunt of the government 's crack down .
the president 's olive branch was greeted with scepticism within the movement which says it has been let down too many times before .
" it will not change anything .
it will be written in pencil so it can be easily erased , " said former brigadier al-qawi .
" we have lost confidence in the government ; their promises are always broken . "
according to human rights lawyer mohammed al-saqqaf , local rule under a decentralised north may be too little too late : " protesters repeat the same song they used to sing during the british rule : ‘ out of our country imperialism , " ' he said .
" the depth of grievance in the south is such that they are unlikely to go away , " said a sanaa-based analyst , who did not want his name published .
with no central command the southern movement remains a fluid force .
however , the analyst warned that if the cycle of violence in the south continues , what has until now been a disparate protest movement could merge and harden into an organized rebellion , tipping a low intensity conflict over into full-blown civil war .
" the emergence of a unified leadership is imminent , as soon as they turn to fully fledged violence , which is equally imminent . "

back to first page back 2/2 no head to cut bildunterschrift : even the use of force against the southern movement is not achieving the desired outcome since 2007 the southern movement has grown steadily .
according to observers it has no unified leadership .
" there is no central nervous system , which , paradoxically , has made it a lot more formidable , as there is no head to cut , " said abdul-ghani aryani , a sanaa based political analyst .
the movement includes several political factions , most importantly the former ruling party of south yemen , the yemeni socialist party -lrb- ysp -rrb- .
while many consider ali salem al-beidh , who served as vice president of yemen until he was forced into exile in germany , the champion of their cause , some observers argue he is only a nominal figurehead .
instead , they point to exiled haydar al-attas , former prime minister , as the most effective leader and former south yemen president ali nasser muhammad , who fled in 1986 .
while the movement 's support base is mainly from the south , members of the islah party , the northern-based islamist opposition party , have also expressed backing for the movement .
sympathy for the movement is even found among members of the president 's ruling party , the general people 's congress -lrb- gpc -rrb- .
one former staunch supporter of president saleh and the gpc , tareq al-fadhli , joined the movement in 2009 .
a month later nasser al-wahayshi , leader of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- announced his support for the movement .
whilst the defection by al-fadhli , a former mujahedeen who allegedly fought alongside osama bin laden in afghanistan and later against the ysp in the early 1990 's was interpreted by some as the southern movement developing ties with al qaeda , many see it as a deepening divide between the north and south .
" he was obviously disgruntled by the marginalization he and other southerners suffer from for the benefit of northern tribal elite , " said abdul-ghani aryani .
neither evidence nor shared ideology has been found to link the southern movement to al qaeda .
although al-fadhli has stated that he supports an independent southern state , led by former ysp leader ali salem al-beidh , he has recently been sidelined in the movement .
southern tribes such as the large balharis tribe of shebwa and the bakazim of abyan have also declared their solidarity with the movement .
cracking down as the southern movement has grown the government in sanaa has retorted with violence and repression .
in an august 2010 report the human rights organisation amnesty international accused yemeni authorities of sacrificing human rights in the name of security .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is resorting to media repression to quell the unrest the report argued that the government " has increasingly resorted to unlawful means , including enforced disappearances , unlawful killings , arbitrary detention and excessive use of force . "
at the same time newspapers have been closed down , journalists , editors and proprietors detained , held incommunicado , ill-treated and jailed on spurious charges after unfair trials , said amnesty .
" journalists are in danger of arbitrary arrest by the state and are subjected to beatings and charges of causing riots in the streets , " said abdul-khaliq al-hout , who has worked for al-diyar newspaper in aden for six years .
al-hout said writing about the southern movement is a " complex " issue .
" i can feel the lack of freedom of expression and of providing information and facts to the public . "
restrictive laws and the repressive practices of security forces and special courts have undermined freedom of expression in yemen , though it is enshrined in the constitution .
the press and publications law of 1990 and the establishment of the specialized press and publications court in may 2009 have made it possible for the authorities to imprison " anyone who incites -lsb- -rsb- unrest . " like many other journalists al-hout was detained after writing an article about the southern movement .
after two months in prison human rights watch helped to secure his release .
" there is a growing fear among journalists of the press court where journalists are treated as criminals , " he said .
a revolution in the making ?
since the beginning of 2009 , more than 66 people have been killed in or near demonstrations and 251 have been wounded .
fifteen members of the security forces have also been killed , according to media reports .
analysts warn that as violence by government forces increases , so too does the call for independence .
while some of their leaders have called for secession from the north , ysp , according to analysts , would consider federalism as would pro-southern movement elements within the islah party .
members within the gpc have called for a local government in the south .
in response , on 22 may , the 20th anniversary of yemen 's unification , president saleh called for a revival of national dialogue and offered to form a national unity government .
according to abdel karim aryani , a long-time adviser to the president , decentralization in the north and local rule for the south is being discussed .
" this is what they -lsb- the southern movement -rsb- are asking for , " he said .
however , the more radical calls for independence now come from the general population of the south who bear the brunt of the government 's crack down .
the president 's olive branch was greeted with scepticism within the movement which says it has been let down too many times before .
" it will not change anything .
it will be written in pencil so it can be easily erased , " said former brigadier al-qawi .
" we have lost confidence in the government ; their promises are always broken . "
according to human rights lawyer mohammed al-saqqaf , local rule under a decentralised north may be too little too late : " protesters repeat the same song they used to sing during the british rule : ‘ out of our country imperialism , " ' he said .
" the depth of grievance in the south is such that they are unlikely to go away , " said a sanaa-based analyst , who did not want his name published .
with no central command the southern movement remains a fluid force .
however , the analyst warned that if the cycle of violence in the south continues , what has until now been a disparate protest movement could merge and harden into an organized rebellion , tipping a low intensity conflict over into full-blown civil war .
" the emergence of a unified leadership is imminent , as soon as they turn to fully fledged violence , which is equally imminent . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 09.09.2010 eu parliament calls on france to halt roma deportations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has already deported almost 1,000 roma the european parliament has demanded that france immediately suspend the expulsion of roma migrants , saying that the mass expulsions are prohibited by eu law .
the french government remains defiant on the issue . the european parliament passed a resolution condemning france 's policy of roma deportation on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament said the actions breached eu law the resolution , which was adopted by 337 votes to 245 , expresses " deep concern at measures taken by france and other member states targeting roma and travelers " and " urges those authorities immediately to suspend all expulsions of roma . "
parliamentarians in strasbourg also called on the european commission , the european council and on individual eu governments to " intervene with the same request . "
the resolution stressed that " mass expulsions are prohibited " under eu law , " since they amount to discrimination on the basis of race and ethnicity . "
french immigration minister eric besson , who was in bucharest on thursday for talks with romanian authorities about the issue said there was " no question " of paris complying .
" of course we are not going to submit to a political diktat , " besson said .
romanian plea for solutions romanian president traian basescu criticized the french policy on thursday , saying that " realistic solutions " were needed .
" france is not handling this like a european state , " said basescu , adding that roma also had a responsibility to integrate into european society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besson said there was no chance of france complying france began a security crackdown in july and has since dismantled some 100 unauthorized camps and deported almost 1,000 roma migrants to their countries of origin , principally bulgaria and romania .
officials have used a " voluntary return procedure , " in which roma are given money in exchange for a promise not to return , to press ahead with deportations .

andre borschberg , both the pilot of the ' solar impulse ' and one of its leaders , announced this week that the plane would be entering its next testing phase sometime in september .
the plan is to make three short-distance hops over swiss territory - from payerne to geneva , geneva to zurich , zurich to payerne - to see how well the aircraft can be integrated into the flow of everyday business at an international airport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertrand picard and andre borschberg in the hanger borshberg added that the upcoming jaunts are crictical if they are ever to take the plane beyond swiss borders and land at major foreign airports .
" our airplane is quite special , it flies slowly , it is very light and is sensitive to turbulence , " he said .
" we have to know what logistics need to be put in place and to see what kind of collaboration we need to develop with big airports because . "
a training exercise given the plane 's relatively slow cruising speeds - 50 kilometers per hour -lrb- or about 31 mph -rrb- as compared to the standard 250 kilometers per hour -lrb- or 155 mph -rrb- for larger aircraft - the ground crew has time to drive from payerne to geneva and arrive before it lands .
it might sound like a strange exercise on paper , but borschberg insists that it is all part of getting everyone acquainted with the solar-generated newcomer .
" we have to train the team , " borschberg said , " and see what kind of difficulties we have with traffic arriving and departing . "
and that cuts both ways .
it is not only the pilot and the ground crew dedicated to the ' solar impuse ' that have to get used to operating in a very busy environment , but the other aircraft that have to become accustomed to its presence .
the fact that the plane , which has solar panels attached to the 63 meter span of its wings , it is so easily thrown off by turbulence means the time between it landing and taking has to be adapted accordingly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plane on the ground " it is quite difficult for people in the control towers , because they are not used to it , " borschberg said .
" it is an experiment to get their feedback , to see how it works so that when we fly to another international airport next year , we can propose a way to operate that has been tested and in which we have experience . "
commercial potential ?
as yet there is no solid information about exactly where the non-domestic flights might take the ' solar impulse . '
but wherever it goes , there is a good chance it will attract a lot of attention .
the idea of a plane which can fly without spluttering more emissions into the already choking skies , is a welcome thought , both environmentally and economically .
" ten years ago fuel was 10 percent of airlines cost and now it is nearly 30 percent , " geoff van klaveren , aviation expert with the deutsche bank told deutsche welle .
" any kind of alternative fuel is a thing we have to research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky is the limit .
or is it ?
yet anyone hoping to see this state-of-the-art clean technology ground the world 's current airline fleet is in for a long-haul wait .
commercialization , the ' solar impulse ' pilot insists , is still a very small dot on the horizon .
in reference to the decades it took between the wright brothers ' first aircraft success and the first commercial transatlantic flight , he stressed that it is a slow process .
" i think we will have to wait a while before we can do the same with passengers , but we have to start somewhere , " borschberg said .
making history , changing lives and that it has .
in july , ' solar impulse ' became the first aircraft in history to stay in the air for 26 consecutive hours without any fuel .
the plane took off in the early hours of the morning and spent 14 hours in the air during sunlight hours , enough time for its batteries to charge for the night-time portion of the experiment .
bildunterschrift : solar-powered night flight speaking shortly after the landing , swiss adventurer and brainchild of the project bertrand piccard told reporters that the round-the-clock flight had taken them closer to " the myth of perpetual flight . "
but that is not the only goal they have in mind .
both piccard and borschberg believe that to make the world aware of how much can be achieved with just four six kilowatt electric motors , is to open eyes to the possibilities on the ground .
" at this stage the purpose of the project is not so much to develop a commercial application but to show what we can do today with this technology , " borschberg added .
he said that as much as anything it is about making people see how with the right technology they can use less energy yet still maintain the same quality of life .

the european union 's top diplomat welcomed the decision . after weeks of diplomatic pressure from european union nations , including germany and france , belgrade indicated on wednesday that it had struck a " compromise " with the eu on a joint text for a resolution at the united nations general assembly . it no longer directly challenges kosovo 's independence .
serbia also agreed to a call for a " dialogue " with kosovo .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle welcomed serbia 's decision .
" this is a clear signal that serbia sees its future in the eu , " westerwelle said .
" i call on all parties to begin these talks rapidly ... and lead to concrete results for the people . "
the eu 's high representative for foreign policy also reacted positively .
" i warmly welcome the announcement , " catherine ashton said in a statement .
the move was seen as bolstering the eu 's mediating role in the region .
" this draft resolution will now be a resolution put forward by 28 european countries , " ashton added .
" all 27 eu member states and serbia will be co-sponsoring this draft resolution . "
in the new text , serbia has dropped calls for the condemnation of kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence and for renewed talks on kosovo 's status .
international pressure in july , the international court of justice ruled that the declaration of independence violated no international law , and welcomed " the readiness of the eu to facilitate the process of dialogue " between serbia and kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last december serbia applied to begin talks on eu membership serbia also agreed to move the venue of talks from the un to the eu , where 22 of the 27 member states have recognized kosovo as an independent country .
serbian president boris tadic said in a statement that the resolution defends his country 's interests " by peaceful and diplomatic means . "
he added that belgrade was acting " on an honest wish to resolve all issues in a partner ship with the eu and other important international players . "
however , serbian nationalists and kosovo serbs have sharply criticized the compromise .
the opposition democratic party of serbia described the move as a " capitulation to ultimatums from western powers and confiscation of kosovo . "
paving the way for a serbia-kosovo dialogue analysts believe the diplomatic bargaining has recognized the eu as the key player in possible talks between belgrade and pristina .
ashton met tadic late on tuesday in brussels , with a breakthrough coming on wednesday .
serbia is keen to become a member of the european union , but questions remain over its stance on kosovo .
kosovo declared independence from serbia in february 2008 , 11 years after nato ousted serbian forces from the region , ending an ethnic conflict .
the new country has been recognized by the united states and most eu nations .

the new draft was due to be presented later on thursday .

the project is called “ media in zimbabwe : the key factor in defending human rights and freedom of opinion .

critics say madrid is strangling investment in renewables - and the wider economy . about five years ago , spanish farmers realized they could make more money harvesting the sun than they could planting crops .
on the dusty plains of castilla y leon , for instance , fields of sunflowers gave way to solar panels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate activists have put their own form of pressure on spain 's government that growth was spurred by alternative electricity subsidies that are now endangered .
industry minister miguel sebastian has announced subsidies for new , ground-based solar parks will be cut by 45 percent .
state support for rooftop installations will fall by 25 percent , while smaller installations will see cuts of 5 percent .
eduardo collado , technical director at the photovoltaic industry association -lrb- asif -rrb- , described the plan as short-sighted .
by 2020 , renewable energy could be less expensive than conventional and nuclear power , which still enjoys annual subsidies worth billions of euros , he said .
“ it 's very bad news , " he told deutsche welle .
" -lrb- spanish leaders -rrb- are in a deep crisis , so they have to save money where they can , but they are not taking account of the investments that are the future of spain 's energy industry .
it is n't spending , it 's investment .
you have to look 10 or 15 years ahead … if the price of oil goes up , the cost of renewables will be nothing in comparison . "
sector not self-sufficient spain 's government says the cuts reflect improved efficiency in solar technologies , but the sector is not competitive yet .
it contributed 1.2 billion euros towards country 's gdp in 2008 and collected 3 billion euros worth of subsidies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when resources become scarce , solar energy will be invaluable , advocates say however , the solar sector is innovative and dynamic , and in a matter of years has grown rapidly to account for 3 percent of spain 's energy production .
with news of the cuts , anger and frustration has echoed across its trade associations .
carlos navarro , the founder of siliken , a solar panel manufacturer that employs 1,000 people , said the subsidy rollback is the latest in a long line of errors .
the looming cuts have put 10 billion euros worth of projects on hold and lines of credit are now nearly impossible to obtain from banks , he said .
" we have always felt that spain was not so consistent in the program of photovoltaic development , " he told deutsche welle .
" almost every year we have had changes in the policy and the targets and the volumes . "
" the real problem is not the question of the tariff , it 's the uncertainty they are constantly sending to the markets – especially the financial institutions – about the security of their investment … the market is completely stopped right now . "
jobs lost according to asif , the lack of clarity over tariffs has led to significant job losses .
the sector employed 40,000 people in 2008 , when a record-breaking 3,000 megawatts of solar capacity were installed .
now that new investments have ground to a halt , the 2010 workforce consists of just 13,500 workers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's austerity measures have drawn widespread protest many in the industry blame big conventional energy companies for pressuring the government to defend them against competition from renewable energy , which has forced conventional power stations to reduce output .
carlos navarro said big energy companies pushed the government towards austerity measures in the photovoltaic sector because its fragmented composition made it an easy target .
" the problem is that the companies are not running the plants as much as they were before , " he said .
" demand has been cut 5 percent because of the crisis , so they are making a lot of noise and they are trying to find enemies .
well , photovoltaics is a very good enemy because the portfolio of owners is very spread out .
there are no big companies with an interest in photovoltaic energy . "

the goal is to support independent journalism in this southern african country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrick leusch , head of dw-akademie project development , and barbara plinkert , chargé d 'affaires , ec delegation harare the european commission will support a long-term dw-akademie project in zimbabwe with 1.1 million euros .
the project is called “ media in zimbabwe : the key factor in defending human rights and freedom of opinion .
reinforcing media reform and the transition to civil society ” .
dw-akademie aims to support zimbabwean media over a three-year period in “ working on a new , free media system and supporting independent journalism in zimbabwe , ” emphasizes patrick leusch , head of dw-akademie project development .
eu assistance makes this possible .
“ the project is very important to us because it ’ s the result of close cooperation between zimbabwean and european partners . ”
particularly benefiting from the support will be existing networks of media companies and media aid agencies in zimbabwe , with a special focus on members of the “ media alliance of zimbabwe ” -lrb- maz -rrb- .
this project concentrates primarily on four areas : media law reform ; institutional advanced training ; expertise development ; and professionalization of the media sector .
the project also aims to strengthen the connection between the media and civil society .
despite the restructuring of the government two years ago , the media situation in this crisis-shaken southern african country has hardly improved .
independent reporting is still not possible , say media and human rights organizations .
and contrary to promises made , no media reforms have been undertaken since the power-sharing agreement between robert mugabe ’ s government and the opposition came into effect .
in fact , the opposite is true : journalists still suffer censorship and persecution .
according to a report from human rights watch , not one independent radio or television broadcaster received a license last year .
primarily , dw-akademie would like to have a coordinating role in the project .
nine partners in total are involved , including the european organization ims in denmark , iwpr in london , press now in the netherlands and fojo in sweden .
four zimbabwean media organizations and networks are also involved .
the project is financed by the eu human rights program “ instrument for democracy and human rights ” -lrb- eidhr -rrb- .
the european commission received more than 200 applications for project funding as part of this program .
eleven were chosen , including the dw-akademie zimbabwe project .

the lower castes are particularly affected since the upper castes also deny them food and shelter . more than 60-thousand people affected by floods now live in a vegetable market in hyderabad , the second largest city of the sindh province of pakistan .
around a thousand of of these are low caste hindus who have been confined to an area of the market that has no roof .
begi rasiya is one of the flood affected women .
the flood washed away her house but she managed to save her four children : " all of us hindus were enrolled in a camp , then somebody took our enrolment papers away from us and has not returned them .
we don ’ t know where to go from here .
the police beat us because we are poor hindus .
the people in charge of the camp also do n't take care of us . "
bildunterschrift : at an aid camp in sukkar , sindh province fighting for aid the feudal system is very much in place in the sindh province .
few of the poor fight for their rights .
many of them are fearful of retaliation from upper caste hindus and muslims .
30 year old ganga has been living without shelter for more than three weeks .
her two children have diarrhoea : " my parents and i are pakistanis and we want to live in pakistan .
we don ’ t get any ration , any food or water .
people come and call us hindu and say that hindus will never get anything .
why are we being punished ? "
amir ali shah jhmoot is a relief worker in charge of camps in hyderabad .
he is also a member of the national assembly of pakistan .
he says that many hindus do n't belong here . " i know they are not from this area and are not affected from the flood . but even then we provide all facilities to them . "
optimism in the face of adversity mohit kohli is a member of the hindu community and a religious person .
his family live in a tent which he received from the government .
he says it is not good to complain all the time .
" we are satisfied with the response from the government and the common people and everyone is doing what he can do .
i pray to all to be happy .
it is good that at least we get something .
people now at least get something which is fine . "
mohit is playing music with his friends to please his god .
45 year old wage labourer yadev is sitting beside mohit .
he joins the chanting .
yadev regularly participates in songs since the flood destroyed his house .
" the flood has taken away most of the worldly items .
mother ganga has to wash away the sins which people commit . "
in the entire camp , these two are the only hindus who are somewhat satisfied .
one of them is satisfied because he receives aid from the camp management while the other says everything will become normal soon .
in sindh province , the flood waters have not receded and many homes are still flooded .
some expect it will be months before people can return to their homes .

back to first page back 2/2 no head to cut bildunterschrift : even the use of force against the southern movement is not achieving the desired outcome since 2007 the southern movement has grown steadily .
according to observers it has no unified leadership .
" there is no central nervous system , which , paradoxically , has made it a lot more formidable , as there is no head to cut , " said abdul-ghani aryani , a sanaa based political analyst .
the movement includes several political factions , most importantly the former ruling party of south yemen , the yemeni socialist party -lrb- ysp -rrb- .
while many consider ali salem al-beidh , who served as vice president of yemen until he was forced into exile in germany , the champion of their cause , some observers argue he is only a nominal figurehead .
instead , they point to exiled haydar al-attas , former prime minister , as the most effective leader and former south yemen president ali nasser muhammad , who fled in 1986 .
while the movement 's support base is mainly from the south , members of the islah party , the northern-based islamist opposition party , have also expressed backing for the movement .
sympathy for the movement is even found among members of the president 's ruling party , the general people 's congress -lrb- gpc -rrb- .
one former staunch supporter of president saleh and the gpc , tareq al-fadhli , joined the movement in 2009 .
a month later nasser al-wahayshi , leader of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- announced his support for the movement .
whilst the defection by al-fadhli , a former mujahedeen who allegedly fought alongside osama bin laden in afghanistan and later against the ysp in the early 1990 's was interpreted by some as the southern movement developing ties with al qaeda , many see it as a deepening divide between the north and south .
" he was obviously disgruntled by the marginalization he and other southerners suffer from for the benefit of northern tribal elite , " said abdul-ghani aryani .
neither evidence nor shared ideology has been found to link the southern movement to al qaeda .
although al-fadhli has stated that he supports an independent southern state , led by former ysp leader ali salem al-beidh , he has recently been sidelined in the movement .
southern tribes such as the large balharis tribe of shebwa and the bakazim of abyan have also declared their solidarity with the movement .
cracking down as the southern movement has grown the government in sanaa has retorted with violence and repression .
in an august 2010 report the human rights organisation amnesty international accused yemeni authorities of sacrificing human rights in the name of security .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is resorting to media repression to quell the unrest the report argued that the government " has increasingly resorted to unlawful means , including enforced disappearances , unlawful killings , arbitrary detention and excessive use of force . "
at the same time newspapers have been closed down , journalists , editors and proprietors detained , held incommunicado , ill-treated and jailed on spurious charges after unfair trials , said amnesty .
" journalists are in danger of arbitrary arrest by the state and are subjected to beatings and charges of causing riots in the streets , " said abdul-khaliq al-hout , who has worked for al-diyar newspaper in aden for six years .
al-hout said writing about the southern movement is a " complex " issue .
" i can feel the lack of freedom of expression and of providing information and facts to the public . "
restrictive laws and the repressive practices of security forces and special courts have undermined freedom of expression in yemen , though it is enshrined in the constitution .
the press and publications law of 1990 and the establishment of the specialized press and publications court in may 2009 have made it possible for the authorities to imprison " anyone who incites -lsb- -rsb- unrest . " like many other journalists al-hout was detained after writing an article about the southern movement .
after two months in prison human rights watch helped to secure his release .
" there is a growing fear among journalists of the press court where journalists are treated as criminals , " he said .
a revolution in the making ?
since the beginning of 2009 , more than 66 people have been killed in or near demonstrations and 251 have been wounded .
fifteen members of the security forces have also been killed , according to media reports .
analysts warn that as violence by government forces increases , so too does the call for independence .
while some of their leaders have called for secession from the north , ysp , according to analysts , would consider federalism as would pro-southern movement elements within the islah party .
members within the gpc have called for a local government in the south .
in response , on 22 may , the 20th anniversary of yemen 's unification , president saleh called for a revival of national dialogue and offered to form a national unity government .
according to abdel karim aryani , a long-time adviser to the president , decentralization in the north and local rule for the south is being discussed .
" this is what they -lsb- the southern movement -rsb- are asking for , " he said .
however , the more radical calls for independence now come from the general population of the south who bear the brunt of the government 's crack down .
the president 's olive branch was greeted with scepticism within the movement which says it has been let down too many times before .
" it will not change anything .
it will be written in pencil so it can be easily erased , " said former brigadier al-qawi .
" we have lost confidence in the government ; their promises are always broken . "
according to human rights lawyer mohammed al-saqqaf , local rule under a decentralised north may be too little too late : " protesters repeat the same song they used to sing during the british rule : ‘ out of our country imperialism , " ' he said .
" the depth of grievance in the south is such that they are unlikely to go away , " said a sanaa-based analyst , who did not want his name published .
with no central command the southern movement remains a fluid force .
however , the analyst warned that if the cycle of violence in the south continues , what has until now been a disparate protest movement could merge and harden into an organized rebellion , tipping a low intensity conflict over into full-blown civil war .
" the emergence of a unified leadership is imminent , as soon as they turn to fully fledged violence , which is equally imminent . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 09.09.2010 beethoven 's ' blood , sweat and tears ' keep audiences coming back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's music and biography fascinate all generations composer ludwig van beethoven moved the masses with his music and still does today .
as the 2010 beethovenfest gets underway , dw asks what is it about the composer that draws people back to his works decade after decade . skepticism is in order when it comes to claims like " beethoven has been performed more than any other composer ! "
reliable statistics on the issue would be nearly impossible to assemble .
but those who see the great composer as one of the most influential musicians in the world - both then and today - are certainly not far from the truth .
" even today , beethoven remains of contemporary interest across the world , " michael ladenburger , director and curator of the beethoven house museum in bonn , told deutsche welle .
" beethoven 's music has n't been reduced to just a cultural artefact that people occasionally listen to when they 're in a certain mood .
instead , there are people across all societies who would say , ' this music enriches my life in a very personal and direct way .
in a sense , beethoven is necessary for my life . " '
beethoven worldwide there 's no shortage of examples of the composer 's enduring power : in the central african city of kinshasa , a group of amateur musicians founded the region 's first symphony orchestra and performed beethoven .
the composer is also a fixed part of the curriculum in venezuela 's " el sistema " youth program for music education .
even the prisoners in gulags and concentration camps during world war ii banded together and played beethoven 's works as a way to help cope with their anguish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's 2010 beethovenfest showcases international interest in the master composer but why does his music inspire such an impassioned response ?
" it 's partly due to the fact that people know beethoven 's life - the health problems , his deafness , the bad twists of fate and his struggle against all of those things , " said ladenburger .
but that 's not all : " even more than most composers , beethoven exerted an enormous amount of blood , sweat and tears to find the ideal form for his works . "
timeless moral message beethoven composed works for specific occasions or events , but many of his works also give expression to a moral or ethical ideal , and his fans and followers sense that .
that may help explain why beethoven enthusiasts get together and perform his pieces again and again .
but ladenburger does n't support every tradition when it comes to performing beethoven 's compositions .
" it 's regrettable that the ninth symphony is performed so much and often so thoughtlessly .
beethoven would have rolled over in his grave if he knew that people performed the ninth and other works for pleasure , with total disregard for the message behind them . "

as the military crackdown against the movement intensifies , protests have turned violent . as temperatures soar above 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in aden , the great port city of south yemen , homes become airless .
daily power cuts leave residents sweating through dark nights .
in a region where resentment of the government in the north has been festering for a decade , such daily indignities are enough to spark fury in the people .
earlier this week thousands took to the streets in protest .
car tyres were burned , property vandalised and gun shots fired .
police were pelted with stones .
according to yemeni officials this came after members of the opposition group known as the southern movement , some of whose factions call for independence from northern yemen , ambushed a military patrol and wounded three soldiers .
the attack followed shortly on from the twice attempted assassination of an army brigade commander by members of the southern movement the week earlier .
in south yemen scenes like these repeat themselves at increasingly shorter intervals .
besieged by conflicts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen 's president ali abdullah saleh is facing growing unrest from his palace in the mountain capital of sanaa president ali abdullah saleh seems besieged by conflicts .
to the north , a recent peace agreement quelling six years of rebellion by the zaidi shia houthi clan , who fight a government they accuse of marginalising them politically as well as economically , has been breaking down , threatening a return to war .
in the unruly tribal strongholds of east yemen saleh 's troops face an al qaeda branch well integrated into the local community and whose failed attempt to bring down a us airliner last christmas day showed they are a menace not just to yemen , but to international security as well .
however , to the government in sanaa , no conflict is more serious than the growing power of the southern movement , whose call for independence from the north threatens the territorial integrity of the state .
economic injustices the key grievance levelled by the southern movement against president saleh is economic : southerners complain bitterly that despite their small numbers , just 3.5 million compared to 20 million living in the north , and despite the south being home to the majority of yemen 's oil and gas fields -lrb- which account for 75 percent of the government 's revenue -rrb- the south has not witnessed anything like the economic growth and development of the north , limited though that is .
the movement accuses the president of favoritism of northerners , working through tribal patronage networks from which southerners are largely excluded , of arbitrary land confiscation and political disenfranchisement .
the grievances date back to the unification between north and south yemen in 1990 , which was viewed by many southern leaders as failed .
they were politically outnumbered by their northern colleagues , the two armies were never integrated and assassinations of southern leaders created a deep mistrust of the north .
after elections in 1993 , leaders of former south yemen called for a new federal constitutional system which would decentralize power .
instead , a year later a brief but bloody civil war erupted with northern troops occupying the south .
in the wake of the victory of north over south , president saleh amended the constitution , removing institutions of joint north-south rule and granting himself power to rule by decree .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yemeni army is coming under increasing attacks from opposition rebels since then , a growing sense injustice has simmered in the south , but it was not until 2007 that the southern movement emerged , coalescing around a group of former south yemen army officers , part of a group of 20,000 military personnel forced into early retirement after the 1994 war , who rose up after their pensions were not paid .
former brigadier nasser al-qawi from the aviation brigade of al-anad air base was one of those officers and is today one of the movement 's leaders .
" the authorities ' refusal to address the issues of the south , the looting of its resources for the benefit of the ruling family and the corruption have led -lsb- the south -rsb- to demand secession from the north , " said al-qawi in an interview .
he insisted that southern movement demonstrations had always been peaceful , but blamed sanaa for a violent response .
" it seems the authorities want to drag us towards violence to find a justification to suppress the movement . " " the language of violence and repression used against the people of the south reflects the failure and inability of the government to provide solutions . -lsb- ... -rsb-
for southerners the dream faded away and turned into a nightmare .
people feel the south is under occupation by the north . "

back to first page back 2/2 no head to cut bildunterschrift : even the use of force against the southern movement is not achieving the desired outcome since 2007 the southern movement has grown steadily .
according to observers it has no unified leadership .
" there is no central nervous system , which , paradoxically , has made it a lot more formidable , as there is no head to cut , " said abdul-ghani aryani , a sanaa based political analyst .
the movement includes several political factions , most importantly the former ruling party of south yemen , the yemeni socialist party -lrb- ysp -rrb- .
while many consider ali salem al-beidh , who served as vice president of yemen until he was forced into exile in germany , the champion of their cause , some observers argue he is only a nominal figurehead .
instead , they point to exiled haydar al-attas , former prime minister , as the most effective leader and former south yemen president ali nasser muhammad , who fled in 1986 .
while the movement 's support base is mainly from the south , members of the islah party , the northern-based islamist opposition party , have also expressed backing for the movement .
sympathy for the movement is even found among members of the president 's ruling party , the general people 's congress -lrb- gpc -rrb- .
one former staunch supporter of president saleh and the gpc , tareq al-fadhli , joined the movement in 2009 .
a month later nasser al-wahayshi , leader of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- announced his support for the movement .
whilst the defection by al-fadhli , a former mujahedeen who allegedly fought alongside osama bin laden in afghanistan and later against the ysp in the early 1990 's was interpreted by some as the southern movement developing ties with al qaeda , many see it as a deepening divide between the north and south .
" he was obviously disgruntled by the marginalization he and other southerners suffer from for the benefit of northern tribal elite , " said abdul-ghani aryani .
neither evidence nor shared ideology has been found to link the southern movement to al qaeda .
although al-fadhli has stated that he supports an independent southern state , led by former ysp leader ali salem al-beidh , he has recently been sidelined in the movement .
southern tribes such as the large balharis tribe of shebwa and the bakazim of abyan have also declared their solidarity with the movement .
cracking down as the southern movement has grown the government in sanaa has retorted with violence and repression .
in an august 2010 report the human rights organisation amnesty international accused yemeni authorities of sacrificing human rights in the name of security .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is resorting to media repression to quell the unrest the report argued that the government " has increasingly resorted to unlawful means , including enforced disappearances , unlawful killings , arbitrary detention and excessive use of force . "
at the same time newspapers have been closed down , journalists , editors and proprietors detained , held incommunicado , ill-treated and jailed on spurious charges after unfair trials , said amnesty .
" journalists are in danger of arbitrary arrest by the state and are subjected to beatings and charges of causing riots in the streets , " said abdul-khaliq al-hout , who has worked for al-diyar newspaper in aden for six years .
al-hout said writing about the southern movement is a " complex " issue .
" i can feel the lack of freedom of expression and of providing information and facts to the public . "
restrictive laws and the repressive practices of security forces and special courts have undermined freedom of expression in yemen , though it is enshrined in the constitution .
the press and publications law of 1990 and the establishment of the specialized press and publications court in may 2009 have made it possible for the authorities to imprison " anyone who incites -lsb- -rsb- unrest . " like many other journalists al-hout was detained after writing an article about the southern movement .
after two months in prison human rights watch helped to secure his release .
" there is a growing fear among journalists of the press court where journalists are treated as criminals , " he said .
a revolution in the making ?
since the beginning of 2009 , more than 66 people have been killed in or near demonstrations and 251 have been wounded .
fifteen members of the security forces have also been killed , according to media reports .
analysts warn that as violence by government forces increases , so too does the call for independence .
while some of their leaders have called for secession from the north , ysp , according to analysts , would consider federalism as would pro-southern movement elements within the islah party .
members within the gpc have called for a local government in the south .
in response , on 22 may , the 20th anniversary of yemen 's unification , president saleh called for a revival of national dialogue and offered to form a national unity government .
according to abdel karim aryani , a long-time adviser to the president , decentralization in the north and local rule for the south is being discussed .
" this is what they -lsb- the southern movement -rsb- are asking for , " he said .
however , the more radical calls for independence now come from the general population of the south who bear the brunt of the government 's crack down .
the president 's olive branch was greeted with scepticism within the movement which says it has been let down too many times before .
" it will not change anything .
it will be written in pencil so it can be easily erased , " said former brigadier al-qawi .
" we have lost confidence in the government ; their promises are always broken . "
according to human rights lawyer mohammed al-saqqaf , local rule under a decentralised north may be too little too late : " protesters repeat the same song they used to sing during the british rule : ‘ out of our country imperialism , " ' he said .
" the depth of grievance in the south is such that they are unlikely to go away , " said a sanaa-based analyst , who did not want his name published .
with no central command the southern movement remains a fluid force .
however , the analyst warned that if the cycle of violence in the south continues , what has until now been a disparate protest movement could merge and harden into an organized rebellion , tipping a low intensity conflict over into full-blown civil war .
" the emergence of a unified leadership is imminent , as soon as they turn to fully fledged violence , which is equally imminent . "

as the military crackdown against the movement intensifies , protests have turned violent . as temperatures soar above 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in aden , the great port city of south yemen , homes become airless .
daily power cuts leave residents sweating through dark nights .
in a region where resentment of the government in the north has been festering for a decade , such daily indignities are enough to spark fury in the people .
earlier this week thousands took to the streets in protest .
car tyres were burned , property vandalised and gun shots fired .
police were pelted with stones .
according to yemeni officials this came after members of the opposition group known as the southern movement , some of whose factions call for independence from northern yemen , ambushed a military patrol and wounded three soldiers .
the attack followed shortly on from the twice attempted assassination of an army brigade commander by members of the southern movement the week earlier .
in south yemen scenes like these repeat themselves at increasingly shorter intervals .
besieged by conflicts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen 's president ali abdullah saleh is facing growing unrest from his palace in the mountain capital of sanaa president ali abdullah saleh seems besieged by conflicts .
to the north , a recent peace agreement quelling six years of rebellion by the zaidi shia houthi clan , who fight a government they accuse of marginalising them politically as well as economically , has been breaking down , threatening a return to war .
in the unruly tribal strongholds of east yemen saleh 's troops face an al qaeda branch well integrated into the local community and whose failed attempt to bring down a us airliner last christmas day showed they are a menace not just to yemen , but to international security as well .
however , to the government in sanaa , no conflict is more serious than the growing power of the southern movement , whose call for independence from the north threatens the territorial integrity of the state .
economic injustices the key grievance levelled by the southern movement against president saleh is economic : southerners complain bitterly that despite their small numbers , just 3.5 million compared to 20 million living in the north , and despite the south being home to the majority of yemen 's oil and gas fields -lrb- which account for 75 percent of the government 's revenue -rrb- the south has not witnessed anything like the economic growth and development of the north , limited though that is .
the movement accuses the president of favoritism of northerners , working through tribal patronage networks from which southerners are largely excluded , of arbitrary land confiscation and political disenfranchisement .
the grievances date back to the unification between north and south yemen in 1990 , which was viewed by many southern leaders as failed .
they were politically outnumbered by their northern colleagues , the two armies were never integrated and assassinations of southern leaders created a deep mistrust of the north .
after elections in 1993 , leaders of former south yemen called for a new federal constitutional system which would decentralize power .
instead , a year later a brief but bloody civil war erupted with northern troops occupying the south .
in the wake of the victory of north over south , president saleh amended the constitution , removing institutions of joint north-south rule and granting himself power to rule by decree .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yemeni army is coming under increasing attacks from opposition rebels since then , a growing sense injustice has simmered in the south , but it was not until 2007 that the southern movement emerged , coalescing around a group of former south yemen army officers , part of a group of 20,000 military personnel forced into early retirement after the 1994 war , who rose up after their pensions were not paid .
former brigadier nasser al-qawi from the aviation brigade of al-anad air base was one of those officers and is today one of the movement 's leaders .
" the authorities ' refusal to address the issues of the south , the looting of its resources for the benefit of the ruling family and the corruption have led -lsb- the south -rsb- to demand secession from the north , " said al-qawi in an interview .
he insisted that southern movement demonstrations had always been peaceful , but blamed sanaa for a violent response .
" it seems the authorities want to drag us towards violence to find a justification to suppress the movement . " " the language of violence and repression used against the people of the south reflects the failure and inability of the government to provide solutions . -lsb- ... -rsb-
for southerners the dream faded away and turned into a nightmare .
people feel the south is under occupation by the north . "

back to first page back 2/2 no head to cut bildunterschrift : even the use of force against the southern movement is not achieving the desired outcome since 2007 the southern movement has grown steadily .
according to observers it has no unified leadership .
" there is no central nervous system , which , paradoxically , has made it a lot more formidable , as there is no head to cut , " said abdul-ghani aryani , a sanaa based political analyst .
the movement includes several political factions , most importantly the former ruling party of south yemen , the yemeni socialist party -lrb- ysp -rrb- .
while many consider ali salem al-beidh , who served as vice president of yemen until he was forced into exile in germany , the champion of their cause , some observers argue he is only a nominal figurehead .
instead , they point to exiled haydar al-attas , former prime minister , as the most effective leader and former south yemen president ali nasser muhammad , who fled in 1986 .
while the movement 's support base is mainly from the south , members of the islah party , the northern-based islamist opposition party , have also expressed backing for the movement .
sympathy for the movement is even found among members of the president 's ruling party , the general people 's congress -lrb- gpc -rrb- .
one former staunch supporter of president saleh and the gpc , tareq al-fadhli , joined the movement in 2009 .

the french government remains defiant on the issue . the european parliament passed a resolution condemning france 's policy of roma deportation on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament said the actions breached eu law the resolution , which was adopted by 337 votes to 245 , expresses " deep concern at measures taken by france and other member states targeting roma and travelers " and " urges those authorities immediately to suspend all expulsions of roma . "
parliamentarians in strasbourg also called on the european commission , the european council and on individual eu governments to " intervene with the same request . "
the resolution stressed that " mass expulsions are prohibited " under eu law , " since they amount to discrimination on the basis of race and ethnicity . "
french immigration minister eric besson , who was in bucharest on thursday for talks with romanian authorities about the issue said there was " no question " of paris complying .
" of course we are not going to submit to a political diktat , " besson said .

officials have used a " voluntary return procedure , " in which roma are given money in exchange for a promise not to return , to press ahead with deportations .
french president nicolas sarkozy claims that the actions are necessary as part of a crackdown on crime .
the actions have prompted criticism from the united nations and the roman catholic church , as well as condemnation from within france itself .

andre borschberg , both the pilot of the ' solar impulse ' and one of its leaders , announced this week that the plane would be entering its next testing phase sometime in september .
the plan is to make three short-distance hops over swiss territory - from payerne to geneva , geneva to zurich , zurich to payerne - to see how well the aircraft can be integrated into the flow of everyday business at an international airport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertrand picard and andre borschberg in the hanger borshberg added that the upcoming jaunts are crictical if they are ever to take the plane beyond swiss borders and land at major foreign airports .
" our airplane is quite special , it flies slowly , it is very light and is sensitive to turbulence , " he said .
" we have to know what logistics need to be put in place and to see what kind of collaboration we need to develop with big airports because . "
a training exercise given the plane 's relatively slow cruising speeds - 50 kilometers per hour -lrb- or about 31 mph -rrb- as compared to the standard 250 kilometers per hour -lrb- or 155 mph -rrb- for larger aircraft - the ground crew has time to drive from payerne to geneva and arrive before it lands .
it might sound like a strange exercise on paper , but borschberg insists that it is all part of getting everyone acquainted with the solar-generated newcomer .
" we have to train the team , " borschberg said , " and see what kind of difficulties we have with traffic arriving and departing . "
and that cuts both ways .
it is not only the pilot and the ground crew dedicated to the ' solar impuse ' that have to get used to operating in a very busy environment , but the other aircraft that have to become accustomed to its presence .
the fact that the plane , which has solar panels attached to the 63 meter span of its wings , it is so easily thrown off by turbulence means the time between it landing and taking has to be adapted accordingly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plane on the ground " it is quite difficult for people in the control towers , because they are not used to it , " borschberg said .
" it is an experiment to get their feedback , to see how it works so that when we fly to another international airport next year , we can propose a way to operate that has been tested and in which we have experience . "
commercial potential ?
as yet there is no solid information about exactly where the non-domestic flights might take the ' solar impulse . '
but wherever it goes , there is a good chance it will attract a lot of attention .
the idea of a plane which can fly without spluttering more emissions into the already choking skies , is a welcome thought , both environmentally and economically .
" ten years ago fuel was 10 percent of airlines cost and now it is nearly 30 percent , " geoff van klaveren , aviation expert with the deutsche bank told deutsche welle .
" any kind of alternative fuel is a thing we have to research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky is the limit .
or is it ?
yet anyone hoping to see this state-of-the-art clean technology ground the world 's current airline fleet is in for a long-haul wait .
commercialization , the ' solar impulse ' pilot insists , is still a very small dot on the horizon .
in reference to the decades it took between the wright brothers ' first aircraft success and the first commercial transatlantic flight , he stressed that it is a slow process .
" i think we will have to wait a while before we can do the same with passengers , but we have to start somewhere , " borschberg said .
making history , changing lives and that it has .
in july , ' solar impulse ' became the first aircraft in history to stay in the air for 26 consecutive hours without any fuel .
the plane took off in the early hours of the morning and spent 14 hours in the air during sunlight hours , enough time for its batteries to charge for the night-time portion of the experiment .
bildunterschrift : solar-powered night flight speaking shortly after the landing , swiss adventurer and brainchild of the project bertrand piccard told reporters that the round-the-clock flight had taken them closer to " the myth of perpetual flight . "
but that is not the only goal they have in mind .
both piccard and borschberg believe that to make the world aware of how much can be achieved with just four six kilowatt electric motors , is to open eyes to the possibilities on the ground .
" at this stage the purpose of the project is not so much to develop a commercial application but to show what we can do today with this technology , " borschberg added .
he said that as much as anything it is about making people see how with the right technology they can use less energy yet still maintain the same quality of life .

i like them to snatch a point .
prediction : 1-1 saturday , september 11 borussia dortmund - wolfsburg bildunterschrift : mueller is fast ebcoming the man in munich dortmund have been up and down thus far , laying an egg at home to leverkusen , and then flying high away from home stuttgart .
in mario goetze , they 've unearthed another young german gem and shinji kagawa -lrb- bought for 350,000 euros - $ 446,000 -rrb- is surely the steal of the season .
wolfsburg were unlucky to lose on opening night to bayern , but just plain blew it against mainz , surrendering a three goal lead to lose 4-3 .
taking into account the injured arne friedrich 's continuing absence from the center of defense and a knock that might keep creative maestro diego out of the starting line-up , i ca n't see wolfsburg getting a result in dortmund .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 hamburg - nuremberg hsv 's ruud van nistelrooy has been chewing up bundesliga defenses , notching three goals in his first two games .
nuremberg , meanwhile , just eked out a draw at gladbach and wilted to defeat at home to lowly freiburg .
hamburg should win at a canter .
prediction : hamburg 3-1 borussia moenchengladbach - eintracht frankfurt a tough one to call , this .
if gladbach are half the side they were in their 6-3 demolition of leverkusen in week two , it 's not a contest .
then again , if they revert to their ordinary form , eintracht - who were unfortunate to go down in week one to hanover before being steamrolled by hamburg in week two - have the horses to get a draw , or even win .

so i will .
despite freiburg having picked up three points to stuttgart 's none so far this season , i reckon baden-wuerttemburg 's big boys just have too much quality to keep on stinking out stadiums every week .
new signing mauro camoranesi will steady the ship in midfield , while cacau will have a big game against a suspect freiburg back line .
prediction : stuttgart 3-1 hanover 96 - bayer leverkusen among the sides with six points after two match days , the reds are surely the most surprising .
but their results have been convincing - they fought eintracht to a stalemate before snatching a late win , and played schalke off the park .
much of this comes down to good transfer dealing which has brought much-needed quality .
emanuel pogatetz and mohamed abdelloue were inexpensive and have done the business , and i expect damarcus beasley -lrb- brought in on a free transfer -rrb- to do the same .
the only trouble is , this week they host leverkusen , who are just too fast up front for their aging defense .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 bayern munich - werder bremen per mertesacker 's injury in germany 's win over azerbaijan this week came at precisely the wrong moment for werder - just in time to weaken its back line for one of its sternest tests of the season in munich .
mikael silvestre , who bremen picked up ahead of the transfer deadline and will now have to throw into the center of defense , will probably get torched by the likes of thomas mueller , ivica olic , and franck ribery .
bremen 's only chance will be to get big games out of new boys wesley and marko arnautovic - which they may well do .
prediction : bayern 4-2 sunday , september 12 mainz - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you hear that lakic ?
dw sports says you 're due to cool off a shock table-topping clash with both sides on six points , this game is likely to see one of the two participants unmasked as a pretender for top-half status .
i see kaiserslautern as the likelier candidate .
the red devils are very solid at the back , but i do n't trust their on-fire hitman srdan lakic -lrb- three goals in two matches -rrb- to stay ablaze much longer .
mainz , on the other hand , have another year of top-flight experience under their collective belt and earned several stripes with their four-goal fight back in wolfsburg in week two .
prediction : mainz 2-1 cologne - st. pauli these two sets of supporters have a " fan friendship " - an odd german custom wherein two clubs ' ultras agree , over a period of years , to get along rather than taunt each other .
with that in mind , as well as each club 's fans ' reputation for liking a drink or four , this game ought to have a party atmosphere .
the teams may well spoil it .
st. pauli 's hell-for leather approach can be entertaining , but is low on ball skill .
and the more defensive-minded cologne , more often than not , makes for putrid viewing .

after a bumpy round one - and an even worse performance a week later - they 'll try to get it together this week . match day three in the bundesliga is upon us , and dw 's team of football freaks are seeking redemption - and hoping that when it comes to picks , it 's a case of third time 's a charm .
-lrb- or at the very least for things to go back to normal . -rrb-
after a weak first round - when , admittedly there 's not much to go on when filling out your bet slip - the bundesliga gods belched up one of their most unexpected sets of results in recent memory : a match day with seven away wins and a bona fide shocker in bayern 's loss to promoted team kaiserslautern .
as you might expect , the prediction squad took a hit -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but still we rise .
friday , september 10 hoffenheim - schalke the footballing playthings of sap billionaire dietmar hopp have burst into the new season at full stride , dispatching bremen at home and handling pauli away .
vedad ibisisevic is back in great form up front and ghana 's world cup run this summer appears to have done defender isaac vorsah a world of good .
the winless schalke are … a work in progress , at best .
but there is reason for hope .
benedikt hoewedes is back from suspension , which will help shore up their creaky back line , and raul no longer has a donkey named edu for his strike partner - rather he 'll have a face familiar to him from madrid in klaas-jan huntelaar .
i like them to snatch a point .
prediction : 1-1 saturday , september 11 borussia dortmund - wolfsburg bildunterschrift : mueller is fast ebcoming the man in munich dortmund have been up and down thus far , laying an egg at home to leverkusen , and then flying high away from home stuttgart .
in mario goetze , they 've unearthed another young german gem and shinji kagawa -lrb- bought for 350,000 euros - $ 446,000 -rrb- is surely the steal of the season .
wolfsburg were unlucky to lose on opening night to bayern , but just plain blew it against mainz , surrendering a three goal lead to lose 4-3 .
taking into account the injured arne friedrich 's continuing absence from the center of defense and a knock that might keep creative maestro diego out of the starting line-up , i ca n't see wolfsburg getting a result in dortmund .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 hamburg - nuremberg hsv 's ruud van nistelrooy has been chewing up bundesliga defenses , notching three goals in his first two games .
nuremberg , meanwhile , just eked out a draw at gladbach and wilted to defeat at home to lowly freiburg .
hamburg should win at a canter .
prediction : hamburg 3-1 borussia moenchengladbach - eintracht frankfurt a tough one to call , this .
if gladbach are half the side they were in their 6-3 demolition of leverkusen in week two , it 's not a contest .
then again , if they revert to their ordinary form , eintracht - who were unfortunate to go down in week one to hanover before being steamrolled by hamburg in week two - have the horses to get a draw , or even win .
home advantage and frankfurt 's injury worries in defense -lrb- vasoski is out , chris is day-to-day -rrb- should tip this for the foals .
prediction : gladbach 2-1 freiburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : van the man is getting his first taste of the millerntor stadium in any derby , observers are meant to " throw out the record books . "
so i will .
despite freiburg having picked up three points to stuttgart 's none so far this season , i reckon baden-wuerttemburg 's big boys just have too much quality to keep on stinking out stadiums every week .
new signing mauro camoranesi will steady the ship in midfield , while cacau will have a big game against a suspect freiburg back line .
prediction : stuttgart 3-1 hanover 96 - bayer leverkusen among the sides with six points after two match days , the reds are surely the most surprising .
but their results have been convincing - they fought eintracht to a stalemate before snatching a late win , and played schalke off the park .
much of this comes down to good transfer dealing which has brought much-needed quality .
emanuel pogatetz and mohamed abdelloue were inexpensive and have done the business , and i expect damarcus beasley -lrb- brought in on a free transfer -rrb- to do the same .
the only trouble is , this week they host leverkusen , who are just too fast up front for their aging defense .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 bayern munich - werder bremen per mertesacker 's injury in germany 's win over azerbaijan this week came at precisely the wrong moment for werder - just in time to weaken its back line for one of its sternest tests of the season in munich .
mikael silvestre , who bremen picked up ahead of the transfer deadline and will now have to throw into the center of defense , will probably get torched by the likes of thomas mueller , ivica olic , and franck ribery .
bremen 's only chance will be to get big games out of new boys wesley and marko arnautovic - which they may well do .
prediction : bayern 4-2 sunday , september 12 mainz - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you hear that lakic ?
dw sports says you 're due to cool off a shock table-topping clash with both sides on six points , this game is likely to see one of the two participants unmasked as a pretender for top-half status .
i see kaiserslautern as the likelier candidate .
the red devils are very solid at the back , but i do n't trust their on-fire hitman srdan lakic -lrb- three goals in two matches -rrb- to stay ablaze much longer .
mainz , on the other hand , have another year of top-flight experience under their collective belt and earned several stripes with their four-goal fight back in wolfsburg in week two .
prediction : mainz 2-1 cologne - st. pauli these two sets of supporters have a " fan friendship " - an odd german custom wherein two clubs ' ultras agree , over a period of years , to get along rather than taunt each other .
with that in mind , as well as each club 's fans ' reputation for liking a drink or four , this game ought to have a party atmosphere .
the teams may well spoil it .
st. pauli 's hell-for leather approach can be entertaining , but is low on ball skill .
and the more defensive-minded cologne , more often than not , makes for putrid viewing .
expect a draw .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 09.09.2010 swiss aviators power ahead with solar plane project großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high in the sky : the ' solar impulse ' does what it does best two months after the ' solar impulse ' flew around the clock using nothing but the energy from the sun as fuel , the minds behind the aircraft say they are gearing up to reach new heights . when the solar-powered plane takes to the skies again sometime later this month , it wo n't be testing the endurance of its batteries , but rather will be making sure that its ground crew is ready to make flights of this kind a success .
andre borschberg , both the pilot of the ' solar impulse ' and one of its leaders , announced this week that the plane would be entering its next testing phase sometime in september .
the plan is to make three short-distance hops over swiss territory - from payerne to geneva , geneva to zurich , zurich to payerne - to see how well the aircraft can be integrated into the flow of everyday business at an international airport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertrand picard and andre borschberg in the hanger borshberg added that the upcoming jaunts are crictical if they are ever to take the plane beyond swiss borders and land at major foreign airports .
" our airplane is quite special , it flies slowly , it is very light and is sensitive to turbulence , " he said .
" we have to know what logistics need to be put in place and to see what kind of collaboration we need to develop with big airports because . "
a training exercise given the plane 's relatively slow cruising speeds - 50 kilometers per hour -lrb- or about 31 mph -rrb- as compared to the standard 250 kilometers per hour -lrb- or 155 mph -rrb- for larger aircraft - the ground crew has time to drive from payerne to geneva and arrive before it lands .
it might sound like a strange exercise on paper , but borschberg insists that it is all part of getting everyone acquainted with the solar-generated newcomer .
" we have to train the team , " borschberg said , " and see what kind of difficulties we have with traffic arriving and departing . "
and that cuts both ways .
it is not only the pilot and the ground crew dedicated to the ' solar impuse ' that have to get used to operating in a very busy environment , but the other aircraft that have to become accustomed to its presence .
the fact that the plane , which has solar panels attached to the 63 meter span of its wings , it is so easily thrown off by turbulence means the time between it landing and taking has to be adapted accordingly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plane on the ground " it is quite difficult for people in the control towers , because they are not used to it , " borschberg said .
" it is an experiment to get their feedback , to see how it works so that when we fly to another international airport next year , we can propose a way to operate that has been tested and in which we have experience . "
commercial potential ?
as yet there is no solid information about exactly where the non-domestic flights might take the ' solar impulse . '
but wherever it goes , there is a good chance it will attract a lot of attention .
the idea of a plane which can fly without spluttering more emissions into the already choking skies , is a welcome thought , both environmentally and economically .
" ten years ago fuel was 10 percent of airlines cost and now it is nearly 30 percent , " geoff van klaveren , aviation expert with the deutsche bank told deutsche welle .
" any kind of alternative fuel is a thing we have to research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky is the limit .
or is it ?
yet anyone hoping to see this state-of-the-art clean technology ground the world 's current airline fleet is in for a long-haul wait .
commercialization , the ' solar impulse ' pilot insists , is still a very small dot on the horizon .
in reference to the decades it took between the wright brothers ' first aircraft success and the first commercial transatlantic flight , he stressed that it is a slow process .
" i think we will have to wait a while before we can do the same with passengers , but we have to start somewhere , " borschberg said .
making history , changing lives and that it has .
in july , ' solar impulse ' became the first aircraft in history to stay in the air for 26 consecutive hours without any fuel .
the plane took off in the early hours of the morning and spent 14 hours in the air during sunlight hours , enough time for its batteries to charge for the night-time portion of the experiment .
bildunterschrift : solar-powered night flight speaking shortly after the landing , swiss adventurer and brainchild of the project bertrand piccard told reporters that the round-the-clock flight had taken them closer to " the myth of perpetual flight . "
but that is not the only goal they have in mind .
both piccard and borschberg believe that to make the world aware of how much can be achieved with just four six kilowatt electric motors , is to open eyes to the possibilities on the ground .
" at this stage the purpose of the project is not so much to develop a commercial application but to show what we can do today with this technology , " borschberg added .
he said that as much as anything it is about making people see how with the right technology they can use less energy yet still maintain the same quality of life .

the lower castes are particularly affected since the upper castes also deny them food and shelter . more than 60-thousand people affected by floods now live in a vegetable market in hyderabad , the second largest city of the sindh province of pakistan .
around a thousand of of these are low caste hindus who have been confined to an area of the market that has no roof .
begi rasiya is one of the flood affected women .
the flood washed away her house but she managed to save her four children : " all of us hindus were enrolled in a camp , then somebody took our enrolment papers away from us and has not returned them .
we don ’ t know where to go from here .
the police beat us because we are poor hindus .
the people in charge of the camp also do n't take care of us . "
bildunterschrift : at an aid camp in sukkar , sindh province fighting for aid the feudal system is very much in place in the sindh province .
few of the poor fight for their rights .
many of them are fearful of retaliation from upper caste hindus and muslims .
30 year old ganga has been living without shelter for more than three weeks .
her two children have diarrhoea : " my parents and i are pakistanis and we want to live in pakistan .
we don ’ t get any ration , any food or water .
people come and call us hindu and say that hindus will never get anything .
why are we being punished ? "
amir ali shah jhmoot is a relief worker in charge of camps in hyderabad .
he is also a member of the national assembly of pakistan .
he says that many hindus do n't belong here . " i know they are not from this area and are not affected from the flood . but even then we provide all facilities to them . "
optimism in the face of adversity mohit kohli is a member of the hindu community and a religious person .
his family live in a tent which he received from the government .
he says it is not good to complain all the time .
" we are satisfied with the response from the government and the common people and everyone is doing what he can do .
i pray to all to be happy .
it is good that at least we get something .
people now at least get something which is fine . "
mohit is playing music with his friends to please his god .
45 year old wage labourer yadev is sitting beside mohit .
he joins the chanting .
yadev regularly participates in songs since the flood destroyed his house .
" the flood has taken away most of the worldly items .
mother ganga has to wash away the sins which people commit . "
in the entire camp , these two are the only hindus who are somewhat satisfied .
one of them is satisfied because he receives aid from the camp management while the other says everything will become normal soon .
in sindh province , the flood waters have not receded and many homes are still flooded .
some expect it will be months before people can return to their homes .

he is set to wrap up his visit to switzerland with stops in lausanne and zurich . germany and switzerland have agreed to resolve differences over tax policy that has soured relations between the two countries over last year .
on the first day of his visit to switzerland , german president christian wulff said it was not unusual for " even the best of neighbors to have differing interests and perceptions . "
the two sides have been at odds over a decision by germany to purchase data obtained illegally about german tax evaders in switzerland .
the stolen cds contained the names of hundreds of germans with secret bank accounts in switzerland .
in august , tax investigators raided german branches of the swiss bank credit suisse as part of an ongoing investigation into tax fraud .
wulff 's swiss counterpart , doris leuthard , said the two countries were determined to resolve their differences in the spirit of good neighbors .
the fact that wulff had chosen switzerland for his first state visit since becoming president in july was a " significant signal , " president leuthard said . the visit had been planned by former president horst koehler , who stepped down in may . this is the first visit to switzerland by a german head of state in 10 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 09.09.2010 beethoven 's ' blood , sweat and tears ' keep audiences coming back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's music and biography fascinate all generations composer ludwig van beethoven moved the masses with his music and still does today .
as the 2010 beethovenfest gets underway , dw asks what is it about the composer that draws people back to his works decade after decade . skepticism is in order when it comes to claims like " beethoven has been performed more than any other composer ! "
reliable statistics on the issue would be nearly impossible to assemble .
but those who see the great composer as one of the most influential musicians in the world - both then and today - are certainly not far from the truth .
" even today , beethoven remains of contemporary interest across the world , " michael ladenburger , director and curator of the beethoven house museum in bonn , told deutsche welle .
" beethoven 's music has n't been reduced to just a cultural artefact that people occasionally listen to when they 're in a certain mood .
instead , there are people across all societies who would say , ' this music enriches my life in a very personal and direct way .
in a sense , beethoven is necessary for my life . " '
beethoven worldwide there 's no shortage of examples of the composer 's enduring power : in the central african city of kinshasa , a group of amateur musicians founded the region 's first symphony orchestra and performed beethoven .
the composer is also a fixed part of the curriculum in venezuela 's " el sistema " youth program for music education .
even the prisoners in gulags and concentration camps during world war ii banded together and played beethoven 's works as a way to help cope with their anguish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's 2010 beethovenfest showcases international interest in the master composer but why does his music inspire such an impassioned response ?
" it 's partly due to the fact that people know beethoven 's life - the health problems , his deafness , the bad twists of fate and his struggle against all of those things , " said ladenburger .
but that 's not all : " even more than most composers , beethoven exerted an enormous amount of blood , sweat and tears to find the ideal form for his works . "
timeless moral message beethoven composed works for specific occasions or events , but many of his works also give expression to a moral or ethical ideal , and his fans and followers sense that .
that may help explain why beethoven enthusiasts get together and perform his pieces again and again .
but ladenburger does n't support every tradition when it comes to performing beethoven 's compositions .
" it 's regrettable that the ninth symphony is performed so much and often so thoughtlessly .
beethoven would have rolled over in his grave if he knew that people performed the ninth and other works for pleasure , with total disregard for the message behind them . "
millionaire and a hobby fisherman ?
the beethoven house in bonn is world renowned as a place to get to know the composer better .
and ever since the museum put its collection online , more questions about the master musician have come in than ever .
in the beethoven forum , people can ask whatever is on their mind , like whether beethoven liked to fish -lrb- he did n't -rrb- and how he might experience life today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , royalties could save beethoven from the financial problems he once faced according to michael ladenburger , beethoven himself reflected deeply on the question of dealing with fame and being a public figure .
" he asked himself what it meant for him to be an extraordinarily gifted person , and what obligations and practical consequences that brings . "
but ladenburger has reason to believe beethoven would have been able to get by in contemporary society , " and not just because he would n't have to subsist on occasional payments from his publishers anymore .
instead , he 'd be a millionaire several times over from royalties ! "
beethoven makes money for bonn hopefully beethoven would n't be against his hometown profiting today from the heritage of its famous son - both financially and in terms of image .
bonn 's mayor juergen nimptsch confirmed that beethoven brings hefty returns .
" it 's more or less the case that for every euro we invest , three to four come back into the region and stay here in bonn . "
top classical musicians from all over the world are scheduled to perform at the 2010 beethovenfest bonn , including pianist helene grimaud , cellist sol gabetta , conductor kent nagano and many others .
the festival runs from september 10 - october 9 .

but it was a contemporary form of anti-semitism that got the exhibit off the ground . the project started after four neo-nazis firebombed a synagogue in the northern german town of luebeck on the eve of passover in 1994 , according to mark grellert , who has been creating virtual reconstructions of synagogues at darmstadt technical university since that firebombing both as a student and now professor in the architecture department . " i do n't remember where i heard this about the arson attack , but i think a couple of minutes afterwards and i got the idea , we have to do something against this , " he told deutsche welle . his idea was to virtually reconstruct some of the synagogues that were destroyed on kristallnacht , or the night of the broken glass , on november 10 , 1938 .
that was one of the most heinous attacks against jews , synagogues and jewish businesses in german history . their efforts culminated in an exhibition in bonn in 2000 . that exhibition has now come to the united states for the first time at the holocaust memorial center zekelman family campus in farmington hills , michigan .
the exhibit opened on august 29 and will run through the end of november . back in 1994 , grellert and his team started with three synagogues in frankfurt .
but he said they quickly realized that the project would n't move as quickly as they hoped as it would take them almost one year to finish a single synagogue . getting the plans the first step was to find blueprints or old photographs showing the synagogue 's floor plan then grellert and his team would reach out to people who remembered the original appearance of the synagogue . " in many synagogues , you have only black-and-white photographs , " grellert said .
" so we ask them if they have remembrance of the colors of the synagogues . " bildunterschrift : cologne 's synagogue was built in a neo-islamic style , recalling centuries-old mosques from there , the students redraw the blueprints into computers to create 3d models .
when the project started back in 1994 , 3d modeling technology was less advanced primitive than today . but in recent years , grellert added , the team has been able to account for the detail of the synagogues decor , including ornate chandeliers , stained-glass windows , and red brick exterior . the end result of all the work is 14 virtually reconstructed synagogues from all over germany presented in an exhibit divided three parts : perception , escalation , and reconstruction . the exhibit starts by putting a context around germany 's anti-semitic laws in the 1930s , followed by the names of the 1,200 places in germany where synagogues were destroyed on kristallnacht . the final room , reconstruction , displays the 14 virtually reconstructed synagogues .
the display begins with the synagogue ’ s exterior then shows the interior with special attention paid to details like the shadows cast by balconies and refracted light rays coming in through the windows . the intricate digital displays recreate the importance the houses of worship held in germany before their destruction , according to stephen goldman , executive director of the holocaust memorial center in farmington hills , in the us state of michigan - where the exhibit is currently located . " these were big , prominent institutions , " he told deutsche welle .
" often looking exactly like the cathedrals across the street and done by prominent and well-known german architects . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's synagogue was built in 1861 and destroyed in 1938 ruined communities goldman added that by destroying the synagogues , the nazis tore apart more than individual buildings . " the destruction of a house of worship is very different than the destruction of a home , or even a school , because this effects a whole population , " he said .
" it 's saying , ' we 're no longer safe in our houses of worship ... in our cities , in the buildings we expect to shelter us and cradle us in safety . " ' but goldman admitted that while the digital reconstructions would not have the significance of an actual house of worship , they could serve as a reminder of what was . " it 's not listening to somebody speak to you , but it reminds you of that person , " he said .
" these are speaking in those styles .
these are speaking in the voices of the past . " those voices spoke powerfully to ruth schnee , who attended the exhibit 's opening in michigan .
originally from duesseldorf , she has lived in the united states since 1939 and vividly remembers kristallnacht . " i remember the synagogue in duesseldorf , which was our synagogue , being put on fire , and the rabbi ran into the building to save the torah , and perished in the building , " she said .
" the fire brigade was trained to protect the adjoining buildings , and not of course the synagogues .
the art , the furniture , everything was demolished . " the duesseldorf synagogue has not been recreated by grellert and his team , though they continue to work on the project with his students 10 years after its launch . author : zak rosen -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the exhibit opened on august 29 and will run through the end of november . back in 1994 , grellert and his team started with three synagogues in frankfurt .
but he said they quickly realized that the project would n't move as quickly as they hoped as it would take them almost one year to finish a single synagogue . getting the plans the first step was to find blueprints or old photographs showing the synagogue 's floor plan then grellert and his team would reach out to people who remembered the original appearance of the synagogue .

when the project started back in 1994 , 3d modeling technology was less advanced primitive than today . but in recent years , grellert added , the team has been able to account for the detail of the synagogues decor , including ornate chandeliers , stained-glass windows , and red brick exterior . the end result of all the work is 14 virtually reconstructed synagogues from all over germany presented in an exhibit divided three parts : perception , escalation , and reconstruction . the exhibit starts by putting a context around germany 's anti-semitic laws in the 1930s , followed by the names of the 1,200 places in germany where synagogues were destroyed on kristallnacht . the final room , reconstruction , displays the 14 virtually reconstructed synagogues .
the display begins with the synagogue ’ s exterior then shows the interior with special attention paid to details like the shadows cast by balconies and refracted light rays coming in through the windows . the intricate digital displays recreate the importance the houses of worship held in germany before their destruction , according to stephen goldman , executive director of the holocaust memorial center in farmington hills , in the us state of michigan - where the exhibit is currently located .

critics say madrid is strangling investment in renewables - and the wider economy . about five years ago , spanish farmers realized they could make more money harvesting the sun than they could planting crops .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate activists have put their own form of pressure on spain 's government that growth was spurred by alternative electricity subsidies that are now endangered .
industry minister miguel sebastian has announced subsidies for new , ground-based solar parks will be cut by 45 percent .
state support for rooftop installations will fall by 25 percent , while smaller installations will see cuts of 5 percent .
eduardo collado , technical director at the photovoltaic industry association -lrb- asif -rrb- , described the plan as short-sighted .
by 2020 , renewable energy could be less expensive than conventional and nuclear power , which still enjoys annual subsidies worth billions of euros , he said .

with news of the cuts , anger and frustration has echoed across its trade associations .
carlos navarro , the founder of siliken , a solar panel manufacturer that employs 1,000 people , said the subsidy rollback is the latest in a long line of errors .
the looming cuts have put 10 billion euros worth of projects on hold and lines of credit are now nearly impossible to obtain from banks , he said .
" we have always felt that spain was not so consistent in the program of photovoltaic development , " he told deutsche welle .
" almost every year we have had changes in the policy and the targets and the volumes . "
" the real problem is not the question of the tariff , it 's the uncertainty they are constantly sending to the markets – especially the financial institutions – about the security of their investment … the market is completely stopped right now . "
jobs lost according to asif , the lack of clarity over tariffs has led to significant job losses .
the sector employed 40,000 people in 2008 , when a record-breaking 3,000 megawatts of solar capacity were installed .
now that new investments have ground to a halt , the 2010 workforce consists of just 13,500 workers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's austerity measures have drawn widespread protest many in the industry blame big conventional energy companies for pressuring the government to defend them against competition from renewable energy , which has forced conventional power stations to reduce output .
carlos navarro said big energy companies pushed the government towards austerity measures in the photovoltaic sector because its fragmented composition made it an easy target .
" the problem is that the companies are not running the plants as much as they were before , " he said .
" demand has been cut 5 percent because of the crisis , so they are making a lot of noise and they are trying to find enemies .
well , photovoltaics is a very good enemy because the portfolio of owners is very spread out .
there are no big companies with an interest in photovoltaic energy . "

the goal is to support independent journalism in this southern african country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrick leusch , head of dw-akademie project development , and barbara plinkert , chargé d 'affaires , ec delegation harare the european commission will support a long-term dw-akademie project in zimbabwe with 1.1 million euros .
the project is called “ media in zimbabwe : the key factor in defending human rights and freedom of opinion .
reinforcing media reform and the transition to civil society ” .
dw-akademie aims to support zimbabwean media over a three-year period in “ working on a new , free media system and supporting independent journalism in zimbabwe , ” emphasizes patrick leusch , head of dw-akademie project development .
eu assistance makes this possible .
“ the project is very important to us because it ’ s the result of close cooperation between zimbabwean and european partners . ”
particularly benefiting from the support will be existing networks of media companies and media aid agencies in zimbabwe , with a special focus on members of the “ media alliance of zimbabwe ” -lrb- maz -rrb- .
this project concentrates primarily on four areas : media law reform ; institutional advanced training ; expertise development ; and professionalization of the media sector .
the project also aims to strengthen the connection between the media and civil society .
despite the restructuring of the government two years ago , the media situation in this crisis-shaken southern african country has hardly improved .
independent reporting is still not possible , say media and human rights organizations .
and contrary to promises made , no media reforms have been undertaken since the power-sharing agreement between robert mugabe ’ s government and the opposition came into effect .
in fact , the opposite is true : journalists still suffer censorship and persecution .
according to a report from human rights watch , not one independent radio or television broadcaster received a license last year .
primarily , dw-akademie would like to have a coordinating role in the project .
nine partners in total are involved , including the european organization ims in denmark , iwpr in london , press now in the netherlands and fojo in sweden .
four zimbabwean media organizations and networks are also involved .
the project is financed by the eu human rights program “ instrument for democracy and human rights ” -lrb- eidhr -rrb- .
the european commission received more than 200 applications for project funding as part of this program .

critics say madrid is strangling investment in renewables - and the wider economy . about five years ago , spanish farmers realized they could make more money harvesting the sun than they could planting crops .
on the dusty plains of castilla y leon , for instance , fields of sunflowers gave way to solar panels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate activists have put their own form of pressure on spain 's government that growth was spurred by alternative electricity subsidies that are now endangered .
industry minister miguel sebastian has announced subsidies for new , ground-based solar parks will be cut by 45 percent .
state support for rooftop installations will fall by 25 percent , while smaller installations will see cuts of 5 percent .
eduardo collado , technical director at the photovoltaic industry association -lrb- asif -rrb- , described the plan as short-sighted .
by 2020 , renewable energy could be less expensive than conventional and nuclear power , which still enjoys annual subsidies worth billions of euros , he said .
“ it 's very bad news , " he told deutsche welle .
" -lrb- spanish leaders -rrb- are in a deep crisis , so they have to save money where they can , but they are not taking account of the investments that are the future of spain 's energy industry .
it is n't spending , it 's investment .
you have to look 10 or 15 years ahead … if the price of oil goes up , the cost of renewables will be nothing in comparison . "
sector not self-sufficient spain 's government says the cuts reflect improved efficiency in solar technologies , but the sector is not competitive yet .
it contributed 1.2 billion euros towards country 's gdp in 2008 and collected 3 billion euros worth of subsidies .

with news of the cuts , anger and frustration has echoed across its trade associations .
carlos navarro , the founder of siliken , a solar panel manufacturer that employs 1,000 people , said the subsidy rollback is the latest in a long line of errors .
the looming cuts have put 10 billion euros worth of projects on hold and lines of credit are now nearly impossible to obtain from banks , he said .
" we have always felt that spain was not so consistent in the program of photovoltaic development , " he told deutsche welle .
" almost every year we have had changes in the policy and the targets and the volumes . "
" the real problem is not the question of the tariff , it 's the uncertainty they are constantly sending to the markets – especially the financial institutions – about the security of their investment … the market is completely stopped right now . "
jobs lost according to asif , the lack of clarity over tariffs has led to significant job losses .
the sector employed 40,000 people in 2008 , when a record-breaking 3,000 megawatts of solar capacity were installed .
now that new investments have ground to a halt , the 2010 workforce consists of just 13,500 workers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's austerity measures have drawn widespread protest many in the industry blame big conventional energy companies for pressuring the government to defend them against competition from renewable energy , which has forced conventional power stations to reduce output .
carlos navarro said big energy companies pushed the government towards austerity measures in the photovoltaic sector because its fragmented composition made it an easy target .
" the problem is that the companies are not running the plants as much as they were before , " he said .
" demand has been cut 5 percent because of the crisis , so they are making a lot of noise and they are trying to find enemies .
well , photovoltaics is a very good enemy because the portfolio of owners is very spread out .
there are no big companies with an interest in photovoltaic energy . "

critics say madrid is strangling investment in renewables - and the wider economy . about five years ago , spanish farmers realized they could make more money harvesting the sun than they could planting crops .
on the dusty plains of castilla y leon , for instance , fields of sunflowers gave way to solar panels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate activists have put their own form of pressure on spain 's government that growth was spurred by alternative electricity subsidies that are now endangered .
industry minister miguel sebastian has announced subsidies for new , ground-based solar parks will be cut by 45 percent .
state support for rooftop installations will fall by 25 percent , while smaller installations will see cuts of 5 percent .
eduardo collado , technical director at the photovoltaic industry association -lrb- asif -rrb- , described the plan as short-sighted .
by 2020 , renewable energy could be less expensive than conventional and nuclear power , which still enjoys annual subsidies worth billions of euros , he said .
“ it 's very bad news , " he told deutsche welle .
" -lrb- spanish leaders -rrb- are in a deep crisis , so they have to save money where they can , but they are not taking account of the investments that are the future of spain 's energy industry .
it is n't spending , it 's investment .
you have to look 10 or 15 years ahead … if the price of oil goes up , the cost of renewables will be nothing in comparison . "
sector not self-sufficient spain 's government says the cuts reflect improved efficiency in solar technologies , but the sector is not competitive yet .
it contributed 1.2 billion euros towards country 's gdp in 2008 and collected 3 billion euros worth of subsidies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when resources become scarce , solar energy will be invaluable , advocates say however , the solar sector is innovative and dynamic , and in a matter of years has grown rapidly to account for 3 percent of spain 's energy production .
with news of the cuts , anger and frustration has echoed across its trade associations .
carlos navarro , the founder of siliken , a solar panel manufacturer that employs 1,000 people , said the subsidy rollback is the latest in a long line of errors .
the looming cuts have put 10 billion euros worth of projects on hold and lines of credit are now nearly impossible to obtain from banks , he said .
" we have always felt that spain was not so consistent in the program of photovoltaic development , " he told deutsche welle .
" almost every year we have had changes in the policy and the targets and the volumes . "
" the real problem is not the question of the tariff , it 's the uncertainty they are constantly sending to the markets – especially the financial institutions – about the security of their investment … the market is completely stopped right now . "
jobs lost according to asif , the lack of clarity over tariffs has led to significant job losses .
the sector employed 40,000 people in 2008 , when a record-breaking 3,000 megawatts of solar capacity were installed .
now that new investments have ground to a halt , the 2010 workforce consists of just 13,500 workers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's austerity measures have drawn widespread protest many in the industry blame big conventional energy companies for pressuring the government to defend them against competition from renewable energy , which has forced conventional power stations to reduce output .
carlos navarro said big energy companies pushed the government towards austerity measures in the photovoltaic sector because its fragmented composition made it an easy target .
" the problem is that the companies are not running the plants as much as they were before , " he said .
" demand has been cut 5 percent because of the crisis , so they are making a lot of noise and they are trying to find enemies .
well , photovoltaics is a very good enemy because the portfolio of owners is very spread out .
there are no big companies with an interest in photovoltaic energy . "

but it was a contemporary form of anti-semitism that got the exhibit off the ground . the project started after four neo-nazis firebombed a synagogue in the northern german town of luebeck on the eve of passover in 1994 , according to mark grellert , who has been creating virtual reconstructions of synagogues at darmstadt technical university since that firebombing both as a student and now professor in the architecture department . " i do n't remember where i heard this about the arson attack , but i think a couple of minutes afterwards and i got the idea , we have to do something against this , " he told deutsche welle . his idea was to virtually reconstruct some of the synagogues that were destroyed on kristallnacht , or the night of the broken glass , on november 10 , 1938 .
that was one of the most heinous attacks against jews , synagogues and jewish businesses in german history . their efforts culminated in an exhibition in bonn in 2000 . that exhibition has now come to the united states for the first time at the holocaust memorial center zekelman family campus in farmington hills , michigan .
the exhibit opened on august 29 and will run through the end of november . back in 1994 , grellert and his team started with three synagogues in frankfurt .
but he said they quickly realized that the project would n't move as quickly as they hoped as it would take them almost one year to finish a single synagogue . getting the plans the first step was to find blueprints or old photographs showing the synagogue 's floor plan then grellert and his team would reach out to people who remembered the original appearance of the synagogue . " in many synagogues , you have only black-and-white photographs , " grellert said .
" so we ask them if they have remembrance of the colors of the synagogues . " bildunterschrift : cologne 's synagogue was built in a neo-islamic style , recalling centuries-old mosques from there , the students redraw the blueprints into computers to create 3d models .
when the project started back in 1994 , 3d modeling technology was less advanced primitive than today . but in recent years , grellert added , the team has been able to account for the detail of the synagogues decor , including ornate chandeliers , stained-glass windows , and red brick exterior . the end result of all the work is 14 virtually reconstructed synagogues from all over germany presented in an exhibit divided three parts : perception , escalation , and reconstruction . the exhibit starts by putting a context around germany 's anti-semitic laws in the 1930s , followed by the names of the 1,200 places in germany where synagogues were destroyed on kristallnacht . the final room , reconstruction , displays the 14 virtually reconstructed synagogues .
the display begins with the synagogue ’ s exterior then shows the interior with special attention paid to details like the shadows cast by balconies and refracted light rays coming in through the windows . the intricate digital displays recreate the importance the houses of worship held in germany before their destruction , according to stephen goldman , executive director of the holocaust memorial center in farmington hills , in the us state of michigan - where the exhibit is currently located . " these were big , prominent institutions , " he told deutsche welle .
" often looking exactly like the cathedrals across the street and done by prominent and well-known german architects . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's synagogue was built in 1861 and destroyed in 1938 ruined communities goldman added that by destroying the synagogues , the nazis tore apart more than individual buildings . " the destruction of a house of worship is very different than the destruction of a home , or even a school , because this effects a whole population , " he said .
" it 's saying , ' we 're no longer safe in our houses of worship ... in our cities , in the buildings we expect to shelter us and cradle us in safety . " ' but goldman admitted that while the digital reconstructions would not have the significance of an actual house of worship , they could serve as a reminder of what was . " it 's not listening to somebody speak to you , but it reminds you of that person , " he said .
" these are speaking in those styles .
these are speaking in the voices of the past . " those voices spoke powerfully to ruth schnee , who attended the exhibit 's opening in michigan .

" i remember the synagogue in duesseldorf , which was our synagogue , being put on fire , and the rabbi ran into the building to save the torah , and perished in the building , " she said .

but it was a contemporary form of anti-semitism that got the exhibit off the ground . the project started after four neo-nazis firebombed a synagogue in the northern german town of luebeck on the eve of passover in 1994 , according to mark grellert , who has been creating virtual reconstructions of synagogues at darmstadt technical university since that firebombing both as a student and now professor in the architecture department . " i do n't remember where i heard this about the arson attack , but i think a couple of minutes afterwards and i got the idea , we have to do something against this , " he told deutsche welle . his idea was to virtually reconstruct some of the synagogues that were destroyed on kristallnacht , or the night of the broken glass , on november 10 , 1938 .
that was one of the most heinous attacks against jews , synagogues and jewish businesses in german history . their efforts culminated in an exhibition in bonn in 2000 . that exhibition has now come to the united states for the first time at the holocaust memorial center zekelman family campus in farmington hills , michigan .
the exhibit opened on august 29 and will run through the end of november . back in 1994 , grellert and his team started with three synagogues in frankfurt .
but he said they quickly realized that the project would n't move as quickly as they hoped as it would take them almost one year to finish a single synagogue . getting the plans the first step was to find blueprints or old photographs showing the synagogue 's floor plan then grellert and his team would reach out to people who remembered the original appearance of the synagogue .

when the project started back in 1994 , 3d modeling technology was less advanced primitive than today . but in recent years , grellert added , the team has been able to account for the detail of the synagogues decor , including ornate chandeliers , stained-glass windows , and red brick exterior . the end result of all the work is 14 virtually reconstructed synagogues from all over germany presented in an exhibit divided three parts : perception , escalation , and reconstruction . the exhibit starts by putting a context around germany 's anti-semitic laws in the 1930s , followed by the names of the 1,200 places in germany where synagogues were destroyed on kristallnacht . the final room , reconstruction , displays the 14 virtually reconstructed synagogues .
the display begins with the synagogue ’ s exterior then shows the interior with special attention paid to details like the shadows cast by balconies and refracted light rays coming in through the windows . the intricate digital displays recreate the importance the houses of worship held in germany before their destruction , according to stephen goldman , executive director of the holocaust memorial center in farmington hills , in the us state of michigan - where the exhibit is currently located .

iran 's foreign ministry announced the decision to suspend the sentence in a statement released on wednesday .
the eu 's high representative for foreign affairs , catherine ashton , described it as " a step in the right direction . "
however it is unclear whether ashtiani still faces the death penalty , or if the sentence could be applied at a later date .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ashtiani 's defense lawyer has fled to europe earlier on wednesday , the european parliament increased pressure on iran to drop ashtiani 's sentence by passing a resolution condemning it .
the legislative resolution condemning tehran won by a vote of 658-to-1 in strasbourg .
' disgusting form of punishment ' in sweden , the iranian ambassador was summoned to stockholm over the ashtiani case .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt told swedish public radio that the government condemned the sentence .
" we are against capital punishment in any case , but stoning is a particularly disgusting form of capital punishment , and iran should realise that this is completely unacceptable , " bildt said .
the minister argued that the international uproar over the case had had " influence . "
" if we had not acted as we have over these past months , she would have presumably been killed by stoning by now , " he said .

sakineh mohammadi ashtiani , a 43-year-old mother of two has been convicted of adultery in iran and faced a sentence of death by stoning .
ashtiani 's case has drawn criticism from much of the international community .
iran 's foreign ministry announced the decision to suspend the sentence in a statement released on wednesday .

the minister argued that the international uproar over the case had had " influence . "
" if we had not acted as we have over these past months , she would have presumably been killed by stoning by now , " he said .

as the military crackdown against the movement intensifies , protests have turned violent . as temperatures soar above 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in aden , the great port city of south yemen , homes become airless .
daily power cuts leave residents sweating through dark nights .
in a region where resentment of the government in the north has been festering for a decade , such daily indignities are enough to spark fury in the people .
earlier this week thousands took to the streets in protest .
car tyres were burned , property vandalised and gun shots fired .
police were pelted with stones .
according to yemeni officials this came after members of the opposition group known as the southern movement , some of whose factions call for independence from northern yemen , ambushed a military patrol and wounded three soldiers .
the attack followed shortly on from the twice attempted assassination of an army brigade commander by members of the southern movement the week earlier .
in south yemen scenes like these repeat themselves at increasingly shorter intervals .
besieged by conflicts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen 's president ali abdullah saleh is facing growing unrest from his palace in the mountain capital of sanaa president ali abdullah saleh seems besieged by conflicts .
to the north , a recent peace agreement quelling six years of rebellion by the zaidi shia houthi clan , who fight a government they accuse of marginalising them politically as well as economically , has been breaking down , threatening a return to war .
in the unruly tribal strongholds of east yemen saleh 's troops face an al qaeda branch well integrated into the local community and whose failed attempt to bring down a us airliner last christmas day showed they are a menace not just to yemen , but to international security as well .
however , to the government in sanaa , no conflict is more serious than the growing power of the southern movement , whose call for independence from the north threatens the territorial integrity of the state .
economic injustices the key grievance levelled by the southern movement against president saleh is economic : southerners complain bitterly that despite their small numbers , just 3.5 million compared to 20 million living in the north , and despite the south being home to the majority of yemen 's oil and gas fields -lrb- which account for 75 percent of the government 's revenue -rrb- the south has not witnessed anything like the economic growth and development of the north , limited though that is .
the movement accuses the president of favoritism of northerners , working through tribal patronage networks from which southerners are largely excluded , of arbitrary land confiscation and political disenfranchisement .
the grievances date back to the unification between north and south yemen in 1990 , which was viewed by many southern leaders as failed .
they were politically outnumbered by their northern colleagues , the two armies were never integrated and assassinations of southern leaders created a deep mistrust of the north .
after elections in 1993 , leaders of former south yemen called for a new federal constitutional system which would decentralize power .
instead , a year later a brief but bloody civil war erupted with northern troops occupying the south .
in the wake of the victory of north over south , president saleh amended the constitution , removing institutions of joint north-south rule and granting himself power to rule by decree .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yemeni army is coming under increasing attacks from opposition rebels since then , a growing sense injustice has simmered in the south , but it was not until 2007 that the southern movement emerged , coalescing around a group of former south yemen army officers , part of a group of 20,000 military personnel forced into early retirement after the 1994 war , who rose up after their pensions were not paid .
former brigadier nasser al-qawi from the aviation brigade of al-anad air base was one of those officers and is today one of the movement 's leaders .
" the authorities ' refusal to address the issues of the south , the looting of its resources for the benefit of the ruling family and the corruption have led -lsb- the south -rsb- to demand secession from the north , " said al-qawi in an interview .
he insisted that southern movement demonstrations had always been peaceful , but blamed sanaa for a violent response .
" it seems the authorities want to drag us towards violence to find a justification to suppress the movement . " " the language of violence and repression used against the people of the south reflects the failure and inability of the government to provide solutions . -lsb- ... -rsb-
for southerners the dream faded away and turned into a nightmare .

as the military crackdown against the movement intensifies , protests have turned violent . as temperatures soar above 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in aden , the great port city of south yemen , homes become airless .
daily power cuts leave residents sweating through dark nights .
in a region where resentment of the government in the north has been festering for a decade , such daily indignities are enough to spark fury in the people .
earlier this week thousands took to the streets in protest .
car tyres were burned , property vandalised and gun shots fired .
police were pelted with stones .
according to yemeni officials this came after members of the opposition group known as the southern movement , some of whose factions call for independence from northern yemen , ambushed a military patrol and wounded three soldiers .
the attack followed shortly on from the twice attempted assassination of an army brigade commander by members of the southern movement the week earlier .
in south yemen scenes like these repeat themselves at increasingly shorter intervals .
besieged by conflicts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen 's president ali abdullah saleh is facing growing unrest from his palace in the mountain capital of sanaa president ali abdullah saleh seems besieged by conflicts .
to the north , a recent peace agreement quelling six years of rebellion by the zaidi shia houthi clan , who fight a government they accuse of marginalising them politically as well as economically , has been breaking down , threatening a return to war .
in the unruly tribal strongholds of east yemen saleh 's troops face an al qaeda branch well integrated into the local community and whose failed attempt to bring down a us airliner last christmas day showed they are a menace not just to yemen , but to international security as well .
however , to the government in sanaa , no conflict is more serious than the growing power of the southern movement , whose call for independence from the north threatens the territorial integrity of the state .
economic injustices the key grievance levelled by the southern movement against president saleh is economic : southerners complain bitterly that despite their small numbers , just 3.5 million compared to 20 million living in the north , and despite the south being home to the majority of yemen 's oil and gas fields -lrb- which account for 75 percent of the government 's revenue -rrb- the south has not witnessed anything like the economic growth and development of the north , limited though that is .
the movement accuses the president of favoritism of northerners , working through tribal patronage networks from which southerners are largely excluded , of arbitrary land confiscation and political disenfranchisement .
the grievances date back to the unification between north and south yemen in 1990 , which was viewed by many southern leaders as failed .
they were politically outnumbered by their northern colleagues , the two armies were never integrated and assassinations of southern leaders created a deep mistrust of the north .
after elections in 1993 , leaders of former south yemen called for a new federal constitutional system which would decentralize power .
instead , a year later a brief but bloody civil war erupted with northern troops occupying the south .
in the wake of the victory of north over south , president saleh amended the constitution , removing institutions of joint north-south rule and granting himself power to rule by decree .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yemeni army is coming under increasing attacks from opposition rebels since then , a growing sense injustice has simmered in the south , but it was not until 2007 that the southern movement emerged , coalescing around a group of former south yemen army officers , part of a group of 20,000 military personnel forced into early retirement after the 1994 war , who rose up after their pensions were not paid .
former brigadier nasser al-qawi from the aviation brigade of al-anad air base was one of those officers and is today one of the movement 's leaders .
" the authorities ' refusal to address the issues of the south , the looting of its resources for the benefit of the ruling family and the corruption have led -lsb- the south -rsb- to demand secession from the north , " said al-qawi in an interview .
he insisted that southern movement demonstrations had always been peaceful , but blamed sanaa for a violent response .
" it seems the authorities want to drag us towards violence to find a justification to suppress the movement . " " the language of violence and repression used against the people of the south reflects the failure and inability of the government to provide solutions . -lsb- ... -rsb-
for southerners the dream faded away and turned into a nightmare .

as the military crackdown against the movement intensifies , protests have turned violent . as temperatures soar above 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in aden , the great port city of south yemen , homes become airless .
daily power cuts leave residents sweating through dark nights .
in a region where resentment of the government in the north has been festering for a decade , such daily indignities are enough to spark fury in the people .
earlier this week thousands took to the streets in protest .
car tyres were burned , property vandalised and gun shots fired .
police were pelted with stones .
according to yemeni officials this came after members of the opposition group known as the southern movement , some of whose factions call for independence from northern yemen , ambushed a military patrol and wounded three soldiers .
the attack followed shortly on from the twice attempted assassination of an army brigade commander by members of the southern movement the week earlier .
in south yemen scenes like these repeat themselves at increasingly shorter intervals .
besieged by conflicts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen 's president ali abdullah saleh is facing growing unrest from his palace in the mountain capital of sanaa president ali abdullah saleh seems besieged by conflicts .
to the north , a recent peace agreement quelling six years of rebellion by the zaidi shia houthi clan , who fight a government they accuse of marginalising them politically as well as economically , has been breaking down , threatening a return to war .
in the unruly tribal strongholds of east yemen saleh 's troops face an al qaeda branch well integrated into the local community and whose failed attempt to bring down a us airliner last christmas day showed they are a menace not just to yemen , but to international security as well .
however , to the government in sanaa , no conflict is more serious than the growing power of the southern movement , whose call for independence from the north threatens the territorial integrity of the state .
economic injustices the key grievance levelled by the southern movement against president saleh is economic : southerners complain bitterly that despite their small numbers , just 3.5 million compared to 20 million living in the north , and despite the south being home to the majority of yemen 's oil and gas fields -lrb- which account for 75 percent of the government 's revenue -rrb- the south has not witnessed anything like the economic growth and development of the north , limited though that is .
the movement accuses the president of favoritism of northerners , working through tribal patronage networks from which southerners are largely excluded , of arbitrary land confiscation and political disenfranchisement .
the grievances date back to the unification between north and south yemen in 1990 , which was viewed by many southern leaders as failed .
they were politically outnumbered by their northern colleagues , the two armies were never integrated and assassinations of southern leaders created a deep mistrust of the north .
after elections in 1993 , leaders of former south yemen called for a new federal constitutional system which would decentralize power .
instead , a year later a brief but bloody civil war erupted with northern troops occupying the south .
in the wake of the victory of north over south , president saleh amended the constitution , removing institutions of joint north-south rule and granting himself power to rule by decree .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yemeni army is coming under increasing attacks from opposition rebels since then , a growing sense injustice has simmered in the south , but it was not until 2007 that the southern movement emerged , coalescing around a group of former south yemen army officers , part of a group of 20,000 military personnel forced into early retirement after the 1994 war , who rose up after their pensions were not paid .
former brigadier nasser al-qawi from the aviation brigade of al-anad air base was one of those officers and is today one of the movement 's leaders .
" the authorities ' refusal to address the issues of the south , the looting of its resources for the benefit of the ruling family and the corruption have led -lsb- the south -rsb- to demand secession from the north , " said al-qawi in an interview .
he insisted that southern movement demonstrations had always been peaceful , but blamed sanaa for a violent response .
" it seems the authorities want to drag us towards violence to find a justification to suppress the movement . " " the language of violence and repression used against the people of the south reflects the failure and inability of the government to provide solutions . -lsb- ... -rsb-

back to first page back 2/2 no head to cut bildunterschrift : even the use of force against the southern movement is not achieving the desired outcome since 2007 the southern movement has grown steadily .
according to observers it has no unified leadership .
" there is no central nervous system , which , paradoxically , has made it a lot more formidable , as there is no head to cut , " said abdul-ghani aryani , a sanaa based political analyst .
the movement includes several political factions , most importantly the former ruling party of south yemen , the yemeni socialist party -lrb- ysp -rrb- .
while many consider ali salem al-beidh , who served as vice president of yemen until he was forced into exile in germany , the champion of their cause , some observers argue he is only a nominal figurehead .
instead , they point to exiled haydar al-attas , former prime minister , as the most effective leader and former south yemen president ali nasser muhammad , who fled in 1986 .
while the movement 's support base is mainly from the south , members of the islah party , the northern-based islamist opposition party , have also expressed backing for the movement .
sympathy for the movement is even found among members of the president 's ruling party , the general people 's congress -lrb- gpc -rrb- .
one former staunch supporter of president saleh and the gpc , tareq al-fadhli , joined the movement in 2009 .
a month later nasser al-wahayshi , leader of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- announced his support for the movement .
whilst the defection by al-fadhli , a former mujahedeen who allegedly fought alongside osama bin laden in afghanistan and later against the ysp in the early 1990 's was interpreted by some as the southern movement developing ties with al qaeda , many see it as a deepening divide between the north and south .
" he was obviously disgruntled by the marginalization he and other southerners suffer from for the benefit of northern tribal elite , " said abdul-ghani aryani .
neither evidence nor shared ideology has been found to link the southern movement to al qaeda .
although al-fadhli has stated that he supports an independent southern state , led by former ysp leader ali salem al-beidh , he has recently been sidelined in the movement .
southern tribes such as the large balharis tribe of shebwa and the bakazim of abyan have also declared their solidarity with the movement .
cracking down as the southern movement has grown the government in sanaa has retorted with violence and repression .
in an august 2010 report the human rights organisation amnesty international accused yemeni authorities of sacrificing human rights in the name of security .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is resorting to media repression to quell the unrest the report argued that the government " has increasingly resorted to unlawful means , including enforced disappearances , unlawful killings , arbitrary detention and excessive use of force . "
at the same time newspapers have been closed down , journalists , editors and proprietors detained , held incommunicado , ill-treated and jailed on spurious charges after unfair trials , said amnesty .
" journalists are in danger of arbitrary arrest by the state and are subjected to beatings and charges of causing riots in the streets , " said abdul-khaliq al-hout , who has worked for al-diyar newspaper in aden for six years .
al-hout said writing about the southern movement is a " complex " issue .
" i can feel the lack of freedom of expression and of providing information and facts to the public . "
restrictive laws and the repressive practices of security forces and special courts have undermined freedom of expression in yemen , though it is enshrined in the constitution .
the press and publications law of 1990 and the establishment of the specialized press and publications court in may 2009 have made it possible for the authorities to imprison " anyone who incites -lsb- -rsb- unrest . " like many other journalists al-hout was detained after writing an article about the southern movement .
after two months in prison human rights watch helped to secure his release .
" there is a growing fear among journalists of the press court where journalists are treated as criminals , " he said .
a revolution in the making ?
since the beginning of 2009 , more than 66 people have been killed in or near demonstrations and 251 have been wounded .
fifteen members of the security forces have also been killed , according to media reports .
analysts warn that as violence by government forces increases , so too does the call for independence .
while some of their leaders have called for secession from the north , ysp , according to analysts , would consider federalism as would pro-southern movement elements within the islah party .
members within the gpc have called for a local government in the south .
in response , on 22 may , the 20th anniversary of yemen 's unification , president saleh called for a revival of national dialogue and offered to form a national unity government .
according to abdel karim aryani , a long-time adviser to the president , decentralization in the north and local rule for the south is being discussed .
" this is what they -lsb- the southern movement -rsb- are asking for , " he said .
however , the more radical calls for independence now come from the general population of the south who bear the brunt of the government 's crack down .
the president 's olive branch was greeted with scepticism within the movement which says it has been let down too many times before .
" it will not change anything .
it will be written in pencil so it can be easily erased , " said former brigadier al-qawi .
" we have lost confidence in the government ; their promises are always broken . "
according to human rights lawyer mohammed al-saqqaf , local rule under a decentralised north may be too little too late : " protesters repeat the same song they used to sing during the british rule : ‘ out of our country imperialism , " ' he said .
" the depth of grievance in the south is such that they are unlikely to go away , " said a sanaa-based analyst , who did not want his name published .
with no central command the southern movement remains a fluid force .
however , the analyst warned that if the cycle of violence in the south continues , what has until now been a disparate protest movement could merge and harden into an organized rebellion , tipping a low intensity conflict over into full-blown civil war .
" the emergence of a unified leadership is imminent , as soon as they turn to fully fledged violence , which is equally imminent . "

" he was obviously disgruntled by the marginalization he and other southerners suffer from for the benefit of northern tribal elite , " said abdul-ghani aryani .
neither evidence nor shared ideology has been found to link the southern movement to al qaeda .
although al-fadhli has stated that he supports an independent southern state , led by former ysp leader ali salem al-beidh , he has recently been sidelined in the movement .
southern tribes such as the large balharis tribe of shebwa and the bakazim of abyan have also declared their solidarity with the movement .
cracking down as the southern movement has grown the government in sanaa has retorted with violence and repression .
in an august 2010 report the human rights organisation amnesty international accused yemeni authorities of sacrificing human rights in the name of security .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is resorting to media repression to quell the unrest the report argued that the government " has increasingly resorted to unlawful means , including enforced disappearances , unlawful killings , arbitrary detention and excessive use of force . "
at the same time newspapers have been closed down , journalists , editors and proprietors detained , held incommunicado , ill-treated and jailed on spurious charges after unfair trials , said amnesty .
" journalists are in danger of arbitrary arrest by the state and are subjected to beatings and charges of causing riots in the streets , " said abdul-khaliq al-hout , who has worked for al-diyar newspaper in aden for six years .
al-hout said writing about the southern movement is a " complex " issue .
" i can feel the lack of freedom of expression and of providing information and facts to the public . "
restrictive laws and the repressive practices of security forces and special courts have undermined freedom of expression in yemen , though it is enshrined in the constitution .
the press and publications law of 1990 and the establishment of the specialized press and publications court in may 2009 have made it possible for the authorities to imprison " anyone who incites -lsb- -rsb- unrest . " like many other journalists al-hout was detained after writing an article about the southern movement .
after two months in prison human rights watch helped to secure his release .
" there is a growing fear among journalists of the press court where journalists are treated as criminals , " he said .
a revolution in the making ?
since the beginning of 2009 , more than 66 people have been killed in or near demonstrations and 251 have been wounded .
fifteen members of the security forces have also been killed , according to media reports .
analysts warn that as violence by government forces increases , so too does the call for independence .
while some of their leaders have called for secession from the north , ysp , according to analysts , would consider federalism as would pro-southern movement elements within the islah party .
members within the gpc have called for a local government in the south .
in response , on 22 may , the 20th anniversary of yemen 's unification , president saleh called for a revival of national dialogue and offered to form a national unity government .
according to abdel karim aryani , a long-time adviser to the president , decentralization in the north and local rule for the south is being discussed .
" this is what they -lsb- the southern movement -rsb- are asking for , " he said .
however , the more radical calls for independence now come from the general population of the south who bear the brunt of the government 's crack down .
the president 's olive branch was greeted with scepticism within the movement which says it has been let down too many times before .
" it will not change anything .
it will be written in pencil so it can be easily erased , " said former brigadier al-qawi .
" we have lost confidence in the government ; their promises are always broken . "
according to human rights lawyer mohammed al-saqqaf , local rule under a decentralised north may be too little too late : " protesters repeat the same song they used to sing during the british rule : ‘ out of our country imperialism , " ' he said .
" the depth of grievance in the south is such that they are unlikely to go away , " said a sanaa-based analyst , who did not want his name published .
with no central command the southern movement remains a fluid force .
however , the analyst warned that if the cycle of violence in the south continues , what has until now been a disparate protest movement could merge and harden into an organized rebellion , tipping a low intensity conflict over into full-blown civil war .
" the emergence of a unified leadership is imminent , as soon as they turn to fully fledged violence , which is equally imminent . "

back to first page back 2/2 no head to cut bildunterschrift : even the use of force against the southern movement is not achieving the desired outcome since 2007 the southern movement has grown steadily .
according to observers it has no unified leadership .
" there is no central nervous system , which , paradoxically , has made it a lot more formidable , as there is no head to cut , " said abdul-ghani aryani , a sanaa based political analyst .
the movement includes several political factions , most importantly the former ruling party of south yemen , the yemeni socialist party -lrb- ysp -rrb- .
while many consider ali salem al-beidh , who served as vice president of yemen until he was forced into exile in germany , the champion of their cause , some observers argue he is only a nominal figurehead .
instead , they point to exiled haydar al-attas , former prime minister , as the most effective leader and former south yemen president ali nasser muhammad , who fled in 1986 .
while the movement 's support base is mainly from the south , members of the islah party , the northern-based islamist opposition party , have also expressed backing for the movement .
sympathy for the movement is even found among members of the president 's ruling party , the general people 's congress -lrb- gpc -rrb- .
one former staunch supporter of president saleh and the gpc , tareq al-fadhli , joined the movement in 2009 .
a month later nasser al-wahayshi , leader of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- announced his support for the movement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 09.09.2010 beethoven 's ' blood , sweat and tears ' keep audiences coming back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's music and biography fascinate all generations composer ludwig van beethoven moved the masses with his music and still does today .
as the 2010 beethovenfest gets underway , dw asks what is it about the composer that draws people back to his works decade after decade . skepticism is in order when it comes to claims like " beethoven has been performed more than any other composer ! "
reliable statistics on the issue would be nearly impossible to assemble .
but those who see the great composer as one of the most influential musicians in the world - both then and today - are certainly not far from the truth .
" even today , beethoven remains of contemporary interest across the world , " michael ladenburger , director and curator of the beethoven house museum in bonn , told deutsche welle .
" beethoven 's music has n't been reduced to just a cultural artefact that people occasionally listen to when they 're in a certain mood .
instead , there are people across all societies who would say , ' this music enriches my life in a very personal and direct way .
in a sense , beethoven is necessary for my life . " '
beethoven worldwide there 's no shortage of examples of the composer 's enduring power : in the central african city of kinshasa , a group of amateur musicians founded the region 's first symphony orchestra and performed beethoven .
the composer is also a fixed part of the curriculum in venezuela 's " el sistema " youth program for music education .
even the prisoners in gulags and concentration camps during world war ii banded together and played beethoven 's works as a way to help cope with their anguish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's 2010 beethovenfest showcases international interest in the master composer but why does his music inspire such an impassioned response ?
" it 's partly due to the fact that people know beethoven 's life - the health problems , his deafness , the bad twists of fate and his struggle against all of those things , " said ladenburger .
but that 's not all : " even more than most composers , beethoven exerted an enormous amount of blood , sweat and tears to find the ideal form for his works . "
timeless moral message beethoven composed works for specific occasions or events , but many of his works also give expression to a moral or ethical ideal , and his fans and followers sense that .
that may help explain why beethoven enthusiasts get together and perform his pieces again and again .
but ladenburger does n't support every tradition when it comes to performing beethoven 's compositions .
" it 's regrettable that the ninth symphony is performed so much and often so thoughtlessly .
beethoven would have rolled over in his grave if he knew that people performed the ninth and other works for pleasure , with total disregard for the message behind them . "
millionaire and a hobby fisherman ?
the beethoven house in bonn is world renowned as a place to get to know the composer better .
and ever since the museum put its collection online , more questions about the master musician have come in than ever .
in the beethoven forum , people can ask whatever is on their mind , like whether beethoven liked to fish -lrb- he did n't -rrb- and how he might experience life today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , royalties could save beethoven from the financial problems he once faced according to michael ladenburger , beethoven himself reflected deeply on the question of dealing with fame and being a public figure .
" he asked himself what it meant for him to be an extraordinarily gifted person , and what obligations and practical consequences that brings . "
but ladenburger has reason to believe beethoven would have been able to get by in contemporary society , " and not just because he would n't have to subsist on occasional payments from his publishers anymore .
instead , he 'd be a millionaire several times over from royalties ! "
beethoven makes money for bonn hopefully beethoven would n't be against his hometown profiting today from the heritage of its famous son - both financially and in terms of image .
bonn 's mayor juergen nimptsch confirmed that beethoven brings hefty returns .
" it 's more or less the case that for every euro we invest , three to four come back into the region and stay here in bonn . "

the european union 's top diplomat welcomed the decision . after weeks of diplomatic pressure from european union nations , including germany and france , belgrade indicated on wednesday that it had struck a " compromise " with the eu on a joint text for a resolution at the united nations general assembly . it no longer directly challenges kosovo 's independence .
serbia also agreed to a call for a " dialogue " with kosovo .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle welcomed serbia 's decision .
" this is a clear signal that serbia sees its future in the eu , " westerwelle said .
" i call on all parties to begin these talks rapidly ... and lead to concrete results for the people . "
the eu 's high representative for foreign policy also reacted positively .
" i warmly welcome the announcement , " catherine ashton said in a statement .
the move was seen as bolstering the eu 's mediating role in the region .
" this draft resolution will now be a resolution put forward by 28 european countries , " ashton added .
" all 27 eu member states and serbia will be co-sponsoring this draft resolution . "
in the new text , serbia has dropped calls for the condemnation of kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence and for renewed talks on kosovo 's status .
international pressure in july , the international court of justice ruled that the declaration of independence violated no international law , and welcomed " the readiness of the eu to facilitate the process of dialogue " between serbia and kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last december serbia applied to begin talks on eu membership serbia also agreed to move the venue of talks from the un to the eu , where 22 of the 27 member states have recognized kosovo as an independent country .
serbian president boris tadic said in a statement that the resolution defends his country 's interests " by peaceful and diplomatic means . "
he added that belgrade was acting " on an honest wish to resolve all issues in a partner ship with the eu and other important international players . "
however , serbian nationalists and kosovo serbs have sharply criticized the compromise .
the opposition democratic party of serbia described the move as a " capitulation to ultimatums from western powers and confiscation of kosovo . "
paving the way for a serbia-kosovo dialogue analysts believe the diplomatic bargaining has recognized the eu as the key player in possible talks between belgrade and pristina .
ashton met tadic late on tuesday in brussels , with a breakthrough coming on wednesday .
serbia is keen to become a member of the european union , but questions remain over its stance on kosovo .
kosovo declared independence from serbia in february 2008 , 11 years after nato ousted serbian forces from the region , ending an ethnic conflict .
the new country has been recognized by the united states and most eu nations .
serbia had originally planned to use the un resolution to challenge kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence .
the new draft was due to be presented later on thursday .
german and british foreign ministers warned during recent visits to belgrade that the country was risking its ties with the eu by focusing its entire diplomatic efforts on the issue .

the european union 's top diplomat welcomed the decision . after weeks of diplomatic pressure from european union nations , including germany and france , belgrade indicated on wednesday that it had struck a " compromise " with the eu on a joint text for a resolution at the united nations general assembly . it no longer directly challenges kosovo 's independence .
serbia also agreed to a call for a " dialogue " with kosovo .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle welcomed serbia 's decision .
" this is a clear signal that serbia sees its future in the eu , " westerwelle said .
" i call on all parties to begin these talks rapidly ... and lead to concrete results for the people . "
the eu 's high representative for foreign policy also reacted positively .
" i warmly welcome the announcement , " catherine ashton said in a statement .
the move was seen as bolstering the eu 's mediating role in the region .
" this draft resolution will now be a resolution put forward by 28 european countries , " ashton added .
" all 27 eu member states and serbia will be co-sponsoring this draft resolution . "
in the new text , serbia has dropped calls for the condemnation of kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence and for renewed talks on kosovo 's status .
international pressure in july , the international court of justice ruled that the declaration of independence violated no international law , and welcomed " the readiness of the eu to facilitate the process of dialogue " between serbia and kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last december serbia applied to begin talks on eu membership serbia also agreed to move the venue of talks from the un to the eu , where 22 of the 27 member states have recognized kosovo as an independent country .
serbian president boris tadic said in a statement that the resolution defends his country 's interests " by peaceful and diplomatic means . "
he added that belgrade was acting " on an honest wish to resolve all issues in a partner ship with the eu and other important international players . "
however , serbian nationalists and kosovo serbs have sharply criticized the compromise .
the opposition democratic party of serbia described the move as a " capitulation to ultimatums from western powers and confiscation of kosovo . "
paving the way for a serbia-kosovo dialogue analysts believe the diplomatic bargaining has recognized the eu as the key player in possible talks between belgrade and pristina .
ashton met tadic late on tuesday in brussels , with a breakthrough coming on wednesday .
serbia is keen to become a member of the european union , but questions remain over its stance on kosovo .
kosovo declared independence from serbia in february 2008 , 11 years after nato ousted serbian forces from the region , ending an ethnic conflict .
the new country has been recognized by the united states and most eu nations .
serbia had originally planned to use the un resolution to challenge kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence .
the new draft was due to be presented later on thursday .
german and british foreign ministers warned during recent visits to belgrade that the country was risking its ties with the eu by focusing its entire diplomatic efforts on the issue .

reinforcing media reform and the transition to civil society ” .
dw-akademie aims to support zimbabwean media over a three-year period in “ working on a new , free media system and supporting independent journalism in zimbabwe , ” emphasizes patrick leusch , head of dw-akademie project development .
eu assistance makes this possible .
“ the project is very important to us because it ’ s the result of close cooperation between zimbabwean and european partners . ”
particularly benefiting from the support will be existing networks of media companies and media aid agencies in zimbabwe , with a special focus on members of the “ media alliance of zimbabwe ” -lrb- maz -rrb- .
this project concentrates primarily on four areas : media law reform ; institutional advanced training ; expertise development ; and professionalization of the media sector .
the project also aims to strengthen the connection between the media and civil society .
despite the restructuring of the government two years ago , the media situation in this crisis-shaken southern african country has hardly improved .
independent reporting is still not possible , say media and human rights organizations .
and contrary to promises made , no media reforms have been undertaken since the power-sharing agreement between robert mugabe ’ s government and the opposition came into effect .
in fact , the opposite is true : journalists still suffer censorship and persecution .
according to a report from human rights watch , not one independent radio or television broadcaster received a license last year .
primarily , dw-akademie would like to have a coordinating role in the project .
nine partners in total are involved , including the european organization ims in denmark , iwpr in london , press now in the netherlands and fojo in sweden .
four zimbabwean media organizations and networks are also involved .
the project is financed by the eu human rights program “ instrument for democracy and human rights ” -lrb- eidhr -rrb- .
the european commission received more than 200 applications for project funding as part of this program .
eleven were chosen , including the dw-akademie zimbabwe project .

the lower castes are particularly affected since the upper castes also deny them food and shelter . more than 60-thousand people affected by floods now live in a vegetable market in hyderabad , the second largest city of the sindh province of pakistan .
around a thousand of of these are low caste hindus who have been confined to an area of the market that has no roof .
begi rasiya is one of the flood affected women .
the flood washed away her house but she managed to save her four children : " all of us hindus were enrolled in a camp , then somebody took our enrolment papers away from us and has not returned them .
we don ’ t know where to go from here .
the police beat us because we are poor hindus .
the people in charge of the camp also do n't take care of us . "
bildunterschrift : at an aid camp in sukkar , sindh province fighting for aid the feudal system is very much in place in the sindh province .
few of the poor fight for their rights .
many of them are fearful of retaliation from upper caste hindus and muslims .
30 year old ganga has been living without shelter for more than three weeks .
her two children have diarrhoea : " my parents and i are pakistanis and we want to live in pakistan .
we don ’ t get any ration , any food or water .
people come and call us hindu and say that hindus will never get anything .
why are we being punished ? "
amir ali shah jhmoot is a relief worker in charge of camps in hyderabad .
he is also a member of the national assembly of pakistan .
he says that many hindus do n't belong here . " i know they are not from this area and are not affected from the flood . but even then we provide all facilities to them . "
optimism in the face of adversity mohit kohli is a member of the hindu community and a religious person .
his family live in a tent which he received from the government .
he says it is not good to complain all the time .
" we are satisfied with the response from the government and the common people and everyone is doing what he can do .
i pray to all to be happy .
it is good that at least we get something .
people now at least get something which is fine . "
mohit is playing music with his friends to please his god .
45 year old wage labourer yadev is sitting beside mohit .
he joins the chanting .
yadev regularly participates in songs since the flood destroyed his house .

the lower castes are particularly affected since the upper castes also deny them food and shelter . more than 60-thousand people affected by floods now live in a vegetable market in hyderabad , the second largest city of the sindh province of pakistan .
around a thousand of of these are low caste hindus who have been confined to an area of the market that has no roof .
begi rasiya is one of the flood affected women .
the flood washed away her house but she managed to save her four children : " all of us hindus were enrolled in a camp , then somebody took our enrolment papers away from us and has not returned them .
we don ’ t know where to go from here .
the police beat us because we are poor hindus .
the people in charge of the camp also do n't take care of us . "
bildunterschrift : at an aid camp in sukkar , sindh province fighting for aid the feudal system is very much in place in the sindh province .
few of the poor fight for their rights .
many of them are fearful of retaliation from upper caste hindus and muslims .
30 year old ganga has been living without shelter for more than three weeks .
her two children have diarrhoea : " my parents and i are pakistanis and we want to live in pakistan .
we don ’ t get any ration , any food or water .
people come and call us hindu and say that hindus will never get anything .
why are we being punished ? "
amir ali shah jhmoot is a relief worker in charge of camps in hyderabad .
he is also a member of the national assembly of pakistan .
he says that many hindus do n't belong here . " i know they are not from this area and are not affected from the flood . but even then we provide all facilities to them . "
optimism in the face of adversity mohit kohli is a member of the hindu community and a religious person .
his family live in a tent which he received from the government .
he says it is not good to complain all the time .
" we are satisfied with the response from the government and the common people and everyone is doing what he can do .
i pray to all to be happy .
it is good that at least we get something .
people now at least get something which is fine . "
mohit is playing music with his friends to please his god .
45 year old wage labourer yadev is sitting beside mohit .
he joins the chanting .
yadev regularly participates in songs since the flood destroyed his house .
" the flood has taken away most of the worldly items .
mother ganga has to wash away the sins which people commit . "
in the entire camp , these two are the only hindus who are somewhat satisfied .
one of them is satisfied because he receives aid from the camp management while the other says everything will become normal soon .
in sindh province , the flood waters have not receded and many homes are still flooded .
some expect it will be months before people can return to their homes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 09.09.2010 swiss aviators power ahead with solar plane project großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high in the sky : the ' solar impulse ' does what it does best two months after the ' solar impulse ' flew around the clock using nothing but the energy from the sun as fuel , the minds behind the aircraft say they are gearing up to reach new heights . when the solar-powered plane takes to the skies again sometime later this month , it wo n't be testing the endurance of its batteries , but rather will be making sure that its ground crew is ready to make flights of this kind a success .
andre borschberg , both the pilot of the ' solar impulse ' and one of its leaders , announced this week that the plane would be entering its next testing phase sometime in september .
the plan is to make three short-distance hops over swiss territory - from payerne to geneva , geneva to zurich , zurich to payerne - to see how well the aircraft can be integrated into the flow of everyday business at an international airport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertrand picard and andre borschberg in the hanger borshberg added that the upcoming jaunts are crictical if they are ever to take the plane beyond swiss borders and land at major foreign airports .
" our airplane is quite special , it flies slowly , it is very light and is sensitive to turbulence , " he said .
" we have to know what logistics need to be put in place and to see what kind of collaboration we need to develop with big airports because . "
a training exercise given the plane 's relatively slow cruising speeds - 50 kilometers per hour -lrb- or about 31 mph -rrb- as compared to the standard 250 kilometers per hour -lrb- or 155 mph -rrb- for larger aircraft - the ground crew has time to drive from payerne to geneva and arrive before it lands .
it might sound like a strange exercise on paper , but borschberg insists that it is all part of getting everyone acquainted with the solar-generated newcomer .
" we have to train the team , " borschberg said , " and see what kind of difficulties we have with traffic arriving and departing . "
and that cuts both ways .
it is not only the pilot and the ground crew dedicated to the ' solar impuse ' that have to get used to operating in a very busy environment , but the other aircraft that have to become accustomed to its presence .
the fact that the plane , which has solar panels attached to the 63 meter span of its wings , it is so easily thrown off by turbulence means the time between it landing and taking has to be adapted accordingly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plane on the ground " it is quite difficult for people in the control towers , because they are not used to it , " borschberg said .
" it is an experiment to get their feedback , to see how it works so that when we fly to another international airport next year , we can propose a way to operate that has been tested and in which we have experience . "
commercial potential ?
as yet there is no solid information about exactly where the non-domestic flights might take the ' solar impulse . '
but wherever it goes , there is a good chance it will attract a lot of attention .
the idea of a plane which can fly without spluttering more emissions into the already choking skies , is a welcome thought , both environmentally and economically .
" ten years ago fuel was 10 percent of airlines cost and now it is nearly 30 percent , " geoff van klaveren , aviation expert with the deutsche bank told deutsche welle .
" any kind of alternative fuel is a thing we have to research . "

or is it ?
yet anyone hoping to see this state-of-the-art clean technology ground the world 's current airline fleet is in for a long-haul wait .
commercialization , the ' solar impulse ' pilot insists , is still a very small dot on the horizon .
in reference to the decades it took between the wright brothers ' first aircraft success and the first commercial transatlantic flight , he stressed that it is a slow process .
" i think we will have to wait a while before we can do the same with passengers , but we have to start somewhere , " borschberg said .
making history , changing lives and that it has .
in july , ' solar impulse ' became the first aircraft in history to stay in the air for 26 consecutive hours without any fuel .
the plane took off in the early hours of the morning and spent 14 hours in the air during sunlight hours , enough time for its batteries to charge for the night-time portion of the experiment .
bildunterschrift : solar-powered night flight speaking shortly after the landing , swiss adventurer and brainchild of the project bertrand piccard told reporters that the round-the-clock flight had taken them closer to " the myth of perpetual flight . "
but that is not the only goal they have in mind .
both piccard and borschberg believe that to make the world aware of how much can be achieved with just four six kilowatt electric motors , is to open eyes to the possibilities on the ground .
" at this stage the purpose of the project is not so much to develop a commercial application but to show what we can do today with this technology , " borschberg added .
he said that as much as anything it is about making people see how with the right technology they can use less energy yet still maintain the same quality of life .

the french government remains defiant on the issue . the european parliament passed a resolution condemning france 's policy of roma deportation on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament said the actions breached eu law the resolution , which was adopted by 337 votes to 245 , expresses " deep concern at measures taken by france and other member states targeting roma and travelers " and " urges those authorities immediately to suspend all expulsions of roma . "
parliamentarians in strasbourg also called on the european commission , the european council and on individual eu governments to " intervene with the same request . "
the resolution stressed that " mass expulsions are prohibited " under eu law , " since they amount to discrimination on the basis of race and ethnicity . "

" of course we are not going to submit to a political diktat , " besson said .

after a bumpy round one - and an even worse performance a week later - they 'll try to get it together this week . match day three in the bundesliga is upon us , and dw 's team of football freaks are seeking redemption - and hoping that when it comes to picks , it 's a case of third time 's a charm .
-lrb- or at the very least for things to go back to normal . -rrb-
after a weak first round - when , admittedly there 's not much to go on when filling out your bet slip - the bundesliga gods belched up one of their most unexpected sets of results in recent memory : a match day with seven away wins and a bona fide shocker in bayern 's loss to promoted team kaiserslautern .
as you might expect , the prediction squad took a hit -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but still we rise .
friday , september 10 hoffenheim - schalke the footballing playthings of sap billionaire dietmar hopp have burst into the new season at full stride , dispatching bremen at home and handling pauli away .
vedad ibisisevic is back in great form up front and ghana 's world cup run this summer appears to have done defender isaac vorsah a world of good .
the winless schalke are … a work in progress , at best .
but there is reason for hope .
benedikt hoewedes is back from suspension , which will help shore up their creaky back line , and raul no longer has a donkey named edu for his strike partner - rather he 'll have a face familiar to him from madrid in klaas-jan huntelaar .
i like them to snatch a point .
prediction : 1-1 saturday , september 11 borussia dortmund - wolfsburg bildunterschrift : mueller is fast ebcoming the man in munich dortmund have been up and down thus far , laying an egg at home to leverkusen , and then flying high away from home stuttgart .
in mario goetze , they 've unearthed another young german gem and shinji kagawa -lrb- bought for 350,000 euros - $ 446,000 -rrb- is surely the steal of the season .
wolfsburg were unlucky to lose on opening night to bayern , but just plain blew it against mainz , surrendering a three goal lead to lose 4-3 .
taking into account the injured arne friedrich 's continuing absence from the center of defense and a knock that might keep creative maestro diego out of the starting line-up , i ca n't see wolfsburg getting a result in dortmund .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 hamburg - nuremberg hsv 's ruud van nistelrooy has been chewing up bundesliga defenses , notching three goals in his first two games .
nuremberg , meanwhile , just eked out a draw at gladbach and wilted to defeat at home to lowly freiburg .
hamburg should win at a canter .
prediction : hamburg 3-1 borussia moenchengladbach - eintracht frankfurt a tough one to call , this .
if gladbach are half the side they were in their 6-3 demolition of leverkusen in week two , it 's not a contest .
then again , if they revert to their ordinary form , eintracht - who were unfortunate to go down in week one to hanover before being steamrolled by hamburg in week two - have the horses to get a draw , or even win .
home advantage and frankfurt 's injury worries in defense -lrb- vasoski is out , chris is day-to-day -rrb- should tip this for the foals .
prediction : gladbach 2-1 freiburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : van the man is getting his first taste of the millerntor stadium in any derby , observers are meant to " throw out the record books . "
so i will .
despite freiburg having picked up three points to stuttgart 's none so far this season , i reckon baden-wuerttemburg 's big boys just have too much quality to keep on stinking out stadiums every week .
new signing mauro camoranesi will steady the ship in midfield , while cacau will have a big game against a suspect freiburg back line .
prediction : stuttgart 3-1 hanover 96 - bayer leverkusen among the sides with six points after two match days , the reds are surely the most surprising .
but their results have been convincing - they fought eintracht to a stalemate before snatching a late win , and played schalke off the park .
much of this comes down to good transfer dealing which has brought much-needed quality .
emanuel pogatetz and mohamed abdelloue were inexpensive and have done the business , and i expect damarcus beasley -lrb- brought in on a free transfer -rrb- to do the same .
the only trouble is , this week they host leverkusen , who are just too fast up front for their aging defense .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 bayern munich - werder bremen per mertesacker 's injury in germany 's win over azerbaijan this week came at precisely the wrong moment for werder - just in time to weaken its back line for one of its sternest tests of the season in munich .
mikael silvestre , who bremen picked up ahead of the transfer deadline and will now have to throw into the center of defense , will probably get torched by the likes of thomas mueller , ivica olic , and franck ribery .
bremen 's only chance will be to get big games out of new boys wesley and marko arnautovic - which they may well do .
prediction : bayern 4-2 sunday , september 12 mainz - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you hear that lakic ?
dw sports says you 're due to cool off a shock table-topping clash with both sides on six points , this game is likely to see one of the two participants unmasked as a pretender for top-half status .
i see kaiserslautern as the likelier candidate .
the red devils are very solid at the back , but i do n't trust their on-fire hitman srdan lakic -lrb- three goals in two matches -rrb- to stay ablaze much longer .
mainz , on the other hand , have another year of top-flight experience under their collective belt and earned several stripes with their four-goal fight back in wolfsburg in week two .
prediction : mainz 2-1 cologne - st. pauli these two sets of supporters have a " fan friendship " - an odd german custom wherein two clubs ' ultras agree , over a period of years , to get along rather than taunt each other .
with that in mind , as well as each club 's fans ' reputation for liking a drink or four , this game ought to have a party atmosphere .
the teams may well spoil it .
st. pauli 's hell-for leather approach can be entertaining , but is low on ball skill .
and the more defensive-minded cologne , more often than not , makes for putrid viewing .
expect a draw .

after a bumpy round one - and an even worse performance a week later - they 'll try to get it together this week . match day three in the bundesliga is upon us , and dw 's team of football freaks are seeking redemption - and hoping that when it comes to picks , it 's a case of third time 's a charm .
-lrb- or at the very least for things to go back to normal . -rrb-
after a weak first round - when , admittedly there 's not much to go on when filling out your bet slip - the bundesliga gods belched up one of their most unexpected sets of results in recent memory : a match day with seven away wins and a bona fide shocker in bayern 's loss to promoted team kaiserslautern .
as you might expect , the prediction squad took a hit -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but still we rise .
friday , september 10 hoffenheim - schalke the footballing playthings of sap billionaire dietmar hopp have burst into the new season at full stride , dispatching bremen at home and handling pauli away .
vedad ibisisevic is back in great form up front and ghana 's world cup run this summer appears to have done defender isaac vorsah a world of good .
the winless schalke are … a work in progress , at best .
but there is reason for hope .
benedikt hoewedes is back from suspension , which will help shore up their creaky back line , and raul no longer has a donkey named edu for his strike partner - rather he 'll have a face familiar to him from madrid in klaas-jan huntelaar .
i like them to snatch a point .
prediction : 1-1 saturday , september 11 borussia dortmund - wolfsburg bildunterschrift : mueller is fast ebcoming the man in munich dortmund have been up and down thus far , laying an egg at home to leverkusen , and then flying high away from home stuttgart .
in mario goetze , they 've unearthed another young german gem and shinji kagawa -lrb- bought for 350,000 euros - $ 446,000 -rrb- is surely the steal of the season .
wolfsburg were unlucky to lose on opening night to bayern , but just plain blew it against mainz , surrendering a three goal lead to lose 4-3 .
taking into account the injured arne friedrich 's continuing absence from the center of defense and a knock that might keep creative maestro diego out of the starting line-up , i ca n't see wolfsburg getting a result in dortmund .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 hamburg - nuremberg hsv 's ruud van nistelrooy has been chewing up bundesliga defenses , notching three goals in his first two games .
nuremberg , meanwhile , just eked out a draw at gladbach and wilted to defeat at home to lowly freiburg .
hamburg should win at a canter .
prediction : hamburg 3-1 borussia moenchengladbach - eintracht frankfurt a tough one to call , this .
if gladbach are half the side they were in their 6-3 demolition of leverkusen in week two , it 's not a contest .
then again , if they revert to their ordinary form , eintracht - who were unfortunate to go down in week one to hanover before being steamrolled by hamburg in week two - have the horses to get a draw , or even win .
home advantage and frankfurt 's injury worries in defense -lrb- vasoski is out , chris is day-to-day -rrb- should tip this for the foals .
prediction : gladbach 2-1 freiburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : van the man is getting his first taste of the millerntor stadium in any derby , observers are meant to " throw out the record books . "
so i will .
despite freiburg having picked up three points to stuttgart 's none so far this season , i reckon baden-wuerttemburg 's big boys just have too much quality to keep on stinking out stadiums every week .
new signing mauro camoranesi will steady the ship in midfield , while cacau will have a big game against a suspect freiburg back line .
prediction : stuttgart 3-1 hanover 96 - bayer leverkusen among the sides with six points after two match days , the reds are surely the most surprising .
but their results have been convincing - they fought eintracht to a stalemate before snatching a late win , and played schalke off the park .
much of this comes down to good transfer dealing which has brought much-needed quality .
emanuel pogatetz and mohamed abdelloue were inexpensive and have done the business , and i expect damarcus beasley -lrb- brought in on a free transfer -rrb- to do the same .
the only trouble is , this week they host leverkusen , who are just too fast up front for their aging defense .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 bayern munich - werder bremen per mertesacker 's injury in germany 's win over azerbaijan this week came at precisely the wrong moment for werder - just in time to weaken its back line for one of its sternest tests of the season in munich .
mikael silvestre , who bremen picked up ahead of the transfer deadline and will now have to throw into the center of defense , will probably get torched by the likes of thomas mueller , ivica olic , and franck ribery .
bremen 's only chance will be to get big games out of new boys wesley and marko arnautovic - which they may well do .
prediction : bayern 4-2 sunday , september 12 mainz - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you hear that lakic ?
dw sports says you 're due to cool off a shock table-topping clash with both sides on six points , this game is likely to see one of the two participants unmasked as a pretender for top-half status .
i see kaiserslautern as the likelier candidate .
the red devils are very solid at the back , but i do n't trust their on-fire hitman srdan lakic -lrb- three goals in two matches -rrb- to stay ablaze much longer .
mainz , on the other hand , have another year of top-flight experience under their collective belt and earned several stripes with their four-goal fight back in wolfsburg in week two .
prediction : mainz 2-1 cologne - st. pauli these two sets of supporters have a " fan friendship " - an odd german custom wherein two clubs ' ultras agree , over a period of years , to get along rather than taunt each other .
with that in mind , as well as each club 's fans ' reputation for liking a drink or four , this game ought to have a party atmosphere .
the teams may well spoil it .
st. pauli 's hell-for leather approach can be entertaining , but is low on ball skill .
and the more defensive-minded cologne , more often than not , makes for putrid viewing .
expect a draw .

after a bumpy round one - and an even worse performance a week later - they 'll try to get it together this week . match day three in the bundesliga is upon us , and dw 's team of football freaks are seeking redemption - and hoping that when it comes to picks , it 's a case of third time 's a charm .
-lrb- or at the very least for things to go back to normal . -rrb-
after a weak first round - when , admittedly there 's not much to go on when filling out your bet slip - the bundesliga gods belched up one of their most unexpected sets of results in recent memory : a match day with seven away wins and a bona fide shocker in bayern 's loss to promoted team kaiserslautern .
as you might expect , the prediction squad took a hit -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but still we rise .
friday , september 10 hoffenheim - schalke the footballing playthings of sap billionaire dietmar hopp have burst into the new season at full stride , dispatching bremen at home and handling pauli away .
vedad ibisisevic is back in great form up front and ghana 's world cup run this summer appears to have done defender isaac vorsah a world of good .
the winless schalke are … a work in progress , at best .
but there is reason for hope .
benedikt hoewedes is back from suspension , which will help shore up their creaky back line , and raul no longer has a donkey named edu for his strike partner - rather he 'll have a face familiar to him from madrid in klaas-jan huntelaar .
i like them to snatch a point .
prediction : 1-1 saturday , september 11 borussia dortmund - wolfsburg bildunterschrift : mueller is fast ebcoming the man in munich dortmund have been up and down thus far , laying an egg at home to leverkusen , and then flying high away from home stuttgart .
in mario goetze , they 've unearthed another young german gem and shinji kagawa -lrb- bought for 350,000 euros - $ 446,000 -rrb- is surely the steal of the season .
wolfsburg were unlucky to lose on opening night to bayern , but just plain blew it against mainz , surrendering a three goal lead to lose 4-3 .
taking into account the injured arne friedrich 's continuing absence from the center of defense and a knock that might keep creative maestro diego out of the starting line-up , i ca n't see wolfsburg getting a result in dortmund .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 hamburg - nuremberg hsv 's ruud van nistelrooy has been chewing up bundesliga defenses , notching three goals in his first two games .
nuremberg , meanwhile , just eked out a draw at gladbach and wilted to defeat at home to lowly freiburg .
hamburg should win at a canter .
prediction : hamburg 3-1 borussia moenchengladbach - eintracht frankfurt a tough one to call , this .
if gladbach are half the side they were in their 6-3 demolition of leverkusen in week two , it 's not a contest .
then again , if they revert to their ordinary form , eintracht - who were unfortunate to go down in week one to hanover before being steamrolled by hamburg in week two - have the horses to get a draw , or even win .
home advantage and frankfurt 's injury worries in defense -lrb- vasoski is out , chris is day-to-day -rrb- should tip this for the foals .
prediction : gladbach 2-1 freiburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : van the man is getting his first taste of the millerntor stadium in any derby , observers are meant to " throw out the record books . "
so i will .
despite freiburg having picked up three points to stuttgart 's none so far this season , i reckon baden-wuerttemburg 's big boys just have too much quality to keep on stinking out stadiums every week .
new signing mauro camoranesi will steady the ship in midfield , while cacau will have a big game against a suspect freiburg back line .
prediction : stuttgart 3-1 hanover 96 - bayer leverkusen among the sides with six points after two match days , the reds are surely the most surprising .
but their results have been convincing - they fought eintracht to a stalemate before snatching a late win , and played schalke off the park .
much of this comes down to good transfer dealing which has brought much-needed quality .
emanuel pogatetz and mohamed abdelloue were inexpensive and have done the business , and i expect damarcus beasley -lrb- brought in on a free transfer -rrb- to do the same .
the only trouble is , this week they host leverkusen , who are just too fast up front for their aging defense .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 bayern munich - werder bremen per mertesacker 's injury in germany 's win over azerbaijan this week came at precisely the wrong moment for werder - just in time to weaken its back line for one of its sternest tests of the season in munich .
mikael silvestre , who bremen picked up ahead of the transfer deadline and will now have to throw into the center of defense , will probably get torched by the likes of thomas mueller , ivica olic , and franck ribery .
bremen 's only chance will be to get big games out of new boys wesley and marko arnautovic - which they may well do .
prediction : bayern 4-2 sunday , september 12 mainz - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you hear that lakic ?
dw sports says you 're due to cool off a shock table-topping clash with both sides on six points , this game is likely to see one of the two participants unmasked as a pretender for top-half status .
i see kaiserslautern as the likelier candidate .
the red devils are very solid at the back , but i do n't trust their on-fire hitman srdan lakic -lrb- three goals in two matches -rrb- to stay ablaze much longer .
mainz , on the other hand , have another year of top-flight experience under their collective belt and earned several stripes with their four-goal fight back in wolfsburg in week two .
prediction : mainz 2-1 cologne - st. pauli these two sets of supporters have a " fan friendship " - an odd german custom wherein two clubs ' ultras agree , over a period of years , to get along rather than taunt each other .
with that in mind , as well as each club 's fans ' reputation for liking a drink or four , this game ought to have a party atmosphere .
the teams may well spoil it .
st. pauli 's hell-for leather approach can be entertaining , but is low on ball skill .
and the more defensive-minded cologne , more often than not , makes for putrid viewing .
expect a draw .

dw-akademie aims to support zimbabwean media over a three-year period in “ working on a new , free media system and supporting independent journalism in zimbabwe , ” emphasizes patrick leusch , head of dw-akademie project development .
eu assistance makes this possible .
“ the project is very important to us because it ’ s the result of close cooperation between zimbabwean and european partners . ”
particularly benefiting from the support will be existing networks of media companies and media aid agencies in zimbabwe , with a special focus on members of the “ media alliance of zimbabwe ” -lrb- maz -rrb- .
this project concentrates primarily on four areas : media law reform ; institutional advanced training ; expertise development ; and professionalization of the media sector .
the project also aims to strengthen the connection between the media and civil society .
despite the restructuring of the government two years ago , the media situation in this crisis-shaken southern african country has hardly improved .
independent reporting is still not possible , say media and human rights organizations .
and contrary to promises made , no media reforms have been undertaken since the power-sharing agreement between robert mugabe ’ s government and the opposition came into effect .
in fact , the opposite is true : journalists still suffer censorship and persecution .
according to a report from human rights watch , not one independent radio or television broadcaster received a license last year .
primarily , dw-akademie would like to have a coordinating role in the project .
nine partners in total are involved , including the european organization ims in denmark , iwpr in london , press now in the netherlands and fojo in sweden .
four zimbabwean media organizations and networks are also involved .
the project is financed by the eu human rights program “ instrument for democracy and human rights ” -lrb- eidhr -rrb- .
the european commission received more than 200 applications for project funding as part of this program .
eleven were chosen , including the dw-akademie zimbabwe project .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 09.09.2010 beethoven 's ' blood , sweat and tears ' keep audiences coming back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's music and biography fascinate all generations composer ludwig van beethoven moved the masses with his music and still does today .
as the 2010 beethovenfest gets underway , dw asks what is it about the composer that draws people back to his works decade after decade . skepticism is in order when it comes to claims like " beethoven has been performed more than any other composer ! "
reliable statistics on the issue would be nearly impossible to assemble .
but those who see the great composer as one of the most influential musicians in the world - both then and today - are certainly not far from the truth .
" even today , beethoven remains of contemporary interest across the world , " michael ladenburger , director and curator of the beethoven house museum in bonn , told deutsche welle .
" beethoven 's music has n't been reduced to just a cultural artefact that people occasionally listen to when they 're in a certain mood .
instead , there are people across all societies who would say , ' this music enriches my life in a very personal and direct way .
in a sense , beethoven is necessary for my life . " '
beethoven worldwide there 's no shortage of examples of the composer 's enduring power : in the central african city of kinshasa , a group of amateur musicians founded the region 's first symphony orchestra and performed beethoven .
the composer is also a fixed part of the curriculum in venezuela 's " el sistema " youth program for music education .
even the prisoners in gulags and concentration camps during world war ii banded together and played beethoven 's works as a way to help cope with their anguish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's 2010 beethovenfest showcases international interest in the master composer but why does his music inspire such an impassioned response ?
" it 's partly due to the fact that people know beethoven 's life - the health problems , his deafness , the bad twists of fate and his struggle against all of those things , " said ladenburger .
but that 's not all : " even more than most composers , beethoven exerted an enormous amount of blood , sweat and tears to find the ideal form for his works . "
timeless moral message beethoven composed works for specific occasions or events , but many of his works also give expression to a moral or ethical ideal , and his fans and followers sense that .
that may help explain why beethoven enthusiasts get together and perform his pieces again and again .
but ladenburger does n't support every tradition when it comes to performing beethoven 's compositions .
" it 's regrettable that the ninth symphony is performed so much and often so thoughtlessly .
beethoven would have rolled over in his grave if he knew that people performed the ninth and other works for pleasure , with total disregard for the message behind them . "
millionaire and a hobby fisherman ?
the beethoven house in bonn is world renowned as a place to get to know the composer better .
and ever since the museum put its collection online , more questions about the master musician have come in than ever .
in the beethoven forum , people can ask whatever is on their mind , like whether beethoven liked to fish -lrb- he did n't -rrb- and how he might experience life today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , royalties could save beethoven from the financial problems he once faced according to michael ladenburger , beethoven himself reflected deeply on the question of dealing with fame and being a public figure .
" he asked himself what it meant for him to be an extraordinarily gifted person , and what obligations and practical consequences that brings . "
but ladenburger has reason to believe beethoven would have been able to get by in contemporary society , " and not just because he would n't have to subsist on occasional payments from his publishers anymore .
instead , he 'd be a millionaire several times over from royalties ! "
beethoven makes money for bonn hopefully beethoven would n't be against his hometown profiting today from the heritage of its famous son - both financially and in terms of image .
bonn 's mayor juergen nimptsch confirmed that beethoven brings hefty returns .
" it 's more or less the case that for every euro we invest , three to four come back into the region and stay here in bonn . "
top classical musicians from all over the world are scheduled to perform at the 2010 beethovenfest bonn , including pianist helene grimaud , cellist sol gabetta , conductor kent nagano and many others .
the festival runs from september 10 - october 9 .

back to first page back 2/2 no head to cut bildunterschrift : even the use of force against the southern movement is not achieving the desired outcome since 2007 the southern movement has grown steadily .
according to observers it has no unified leadership .
" there is no central nervous system , which , paradoxically , has made it a lot more formidable , as there is no head to cut , " said abdul-ghani aryani , a sanaa based political analyst .
the movement includes several political factions , most importantly the former ruling party of south yemen , the yemeni socialist party -lrb- ysp -rrb- .
while many consider ali salem al-beidh , who served as vice president of yemen until he was forced into exile in germany , the champion of their cause , some observers argue he is only a nominal figurehead .
instead , they point to exiled haydar al-attas , former prime minister , as the most effective leader and former south yemen president ali nasser muhammad , who fled in 1986 .
while the movement 's support base is mainly from the south , members of the islah party , the northern-based islamist opposition party , have also expressed backing for the movement .
sympathy for the movement is even found among members of the president 's ruling party , the general people 's congress -lrb- gpc -rrb- .
one former staunch supporter of president saleh and the gpc , tareq al-fadhli , joined the movement in 2009 .
a month later nasser al-wahayshi , leader of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- announced his support for the movement .
whilst the defection by al-fadhli , a former mujahedeen who allegedly fought alongside osama bin laden in afghanistan and later against the ysp in the early 1990 's was interpreted by some as the southern movement developing ties with al qaeda , many see it as a deepening divide between the north and south .
" he was obviously disgruntled by the marginalization he and other southerners suffer from for the benefit of northern tribal elite , " said abdul-ghani aryani .
neither evidence nor shared ideology has been found to link the southern movement to al qaeda .
although al-fadhli has stated that he supports an independent southern state , led by former ysp leader ali salem al-beidh , he has recently been sidelined in the movement .
southern tribes such as the large balharis tribe of shebwa and the bakazim of abyan have also declared their solidarity with the movement .
cracking down as the southern movement has grown the government in sanaa has retorted with violence and repression .
in an august 2010 report the human rights organisation amnesty international accused yemeni authorities of sacrificing human rights in the name of security .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is resorting to media repression to quell the unrest the report argued that the government " has increasingly resorted to unlawful means , including enforced disappearances , unlawful killings , arbitrary detention and excessive use of force . "
at the same time newspapers have been closed down , journalists , editors and proprietors detained , held incommunicado , ill-treated and jailed on spurious charges after unfair trials , said amnesty .
" journalists are in danger of arbitrary arrest by the state and are subjected to beatings and charges of causing riots in the streets , " said abdul-khaliq al-hout , who has worked for al-diyar newspaper in aden for six years .
al-hout said writing about the southern movement is a " complex " issue .
" i can feel the lack of freedom of expression and of providing information and facts to the public . "
restrictive laws and the repressive practices of security forces and special courts have undermined freedom of expression in yemen , though it is enshrined in the constitution .
the press and publications law of 1990 and the establishment of the specialized press and publications court in may 2009 have made it possible for the authorities to imprison " anyone who incites -lsb- -rsb- unrest . " like many other journalists al-hout was detained after writing an article about the southern movement .
after two months in prison human rights watch helped to secure his release .
" there is a growing fear among journalists of the press court where journalists are treated as criminals , " he said .
a revolution in the making ?
since the beginning of 2009 , more than 66 people have been killed in or near demonstrations and 251 have been wounded .
fifteen members of the security forces have also been killed , according to media reports .
analysts warn that as violence by government forces increases , so too does the call for independence .
while some of their leaders have called for secession from the north , ysp , according to analysts , would consider federalism as would pro-southern movement elements within the islah party .
members within the gpc have called for a local government in the south .
in response , on 22 may , the 20th anniversary of yemen 's unification , president saleh called for a revival of national dialogue and offered to form a national unity government .
according to abdel karim aryani , a long-time adviser to the president , decentralization in the north and local rule for the south is being discussed .
" this is what they -lsb- the southern movement -rsb- are asking for , " he said .
however , the more radical calls for independence now come from the general population of the south who bear the brunt of the government 's crack down .
the president 's olive branch was greeted with scepticism within the movement which says it has been let down too many times before .
" it will not change anything .
it will be written in pencil so it can be easily erased , " said former brigadier al-qawi .
" we have lost confidence in the government ; their promises are always broken . "
according to human rights lawyer mohammed al-saqqaf , local rule under a decentralised north may be too little too late : " protesters repeat the same song they used to sing during the british rule : ‘ out of our country imperialism , " ' he said .
" the depth of grievance in the south is such that they are unlikely to go away , " said a sanaa-based analyst , who did not want his name published .
with no central command the southern movement remains a fluid force .
however , the analyst warned that if the cycle of violence in the south continues , what has until now been a disparate protest movement could merge and harden into an organized rebellion , tipping a low intensity conflict over into full-blown civil war .
" the emergence of a unified leadership is imminent , as soon as they turn to fully fledged violence , which is equally imminent . "

according to yemeni officials this came after members of the opposition group known as the southern movement , some of whose factions call for independence from northern yemen , ambushed a military patrol and wounded three soldiers .
the attack followed shortly on from the twice attempted assassination of an army brigade commander by members of the southern movement the week earlier .
in south yemen scenes like these repeat themselves at increasingly shorter intervals .
besieged by conflicts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen 's president ali abdullah saleh is facing growing unrest from his palace in the mountain capital of sanaa president ali abdullah saleh seems besieged by conflicts .
to the north , a recent peace agreement quelling six years of rebellion by the zaidi shia houthi clan , who fight a government they accuse of marginalising them politically as well as economically , has been breaking down , threatening a return to war .
in the unruly tribal strongholds of east yemen saleh 's troops face an al qaeda branch well integrated into the local community and whose failed attempt to bring down a us airliner last christmas day showed they are a menace not just to yemen , but to international security as well .
however , to the government in sanaa , no conflict is more serious than the growing power of the southern movement , whose call for independence from the north threatens the territorial integrity of the state .
economic injustices the key grievance levelled by the southern movement against president saleh is economic : southerners complain bitterly that despite their small numbers , just 3.5 million compared to 20 million living in the north , and despite the south being home to the majority of yemen 's oil and gas fields -lrb- which account for 75 percent of the government 's revenue -rrb- the south has not witnessed anything like the economic growth and development of the north , limited though that is .
the movement accuses the president of favoritism of northerners , working through tribal patronage networks from which southerners are largely excluded , of arbitrary land confiscation and political disenfranchisement .
the grievances date back to the unification between north and south yemen in 1990 , which was viewed by many southern leaders as failed .
they were politically outnumbered by their northern colleagues , the two armies were never integrated and assassinations of southern leaders created a deep mistrust of the north .
after elections in 1993 , leaders of former south yemen called for a new federal constitutional system which would decentralize power .
instead , a year later a brief but bloody civil war erupted with northern troops occupying the south .
in the wake of the victory of north over south , president saleh amended the constitution , removing institutions of joint north-south rule and granting himself power to rule by decree .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yemeni army is coming under increasing attacks from opposition rebels since then , a growing sense injustice has simmered in the south , but it was not until 2007 that the southern movement emerged , coalescing around a group of former south yemen army officers , part of a group of 20,000 military personnel forced into early retirement after the 1994 war , who rose up after their pensions were not paid .
former brigadier nasser al-qawi from the aviation brigade of al-anad air base was one of those officers and is today one of the movement 's leaders .
" the authorities ' refusal to address the issues of the south , the looting of its resources for the benefit of the ruling family and the corruption have led -lsb- the south -rsb- to demand secession from the north , " said al-qawi in an interview .
he insisted that southern movement demonstrations had always been peaceful , but blamed sanaa for a violent response .
" it seems the authorities want to drag us towards violence to find a justification to suppress the movement . " " the language of violence and repression used against the people of the south reflects the failure and inability of the government to provide solutions . -lsb- ... -rsb-
for southerners the dream faded away and turned into a nightmare .
people feel the south is under occupation by the north . "

the movement accuses the president of favoritism of northerners , working through tribal patronage networks from which southerners are largely excluded , of arbitrary land confiscation and political disenfranchisement .
the grievances date back to the unification between north and south yemen in 1990 , which was viewed by many southern leaders as failed .
they were politically outnumbered by their northern colleagues , the two armies were never integrated and assassinations of southern leaders created a deep mistrust of the north .
after elections in 1993 , leaders of former south yemen called for a new federal constitutional system which would decentralize power .
instead , a year later a brief but bloody civil war erupted with northern troops occupying the south .
in the wake of the victory of north over south , president saleh amended the constitution , removing institutions of joint north-south rule and granting himself power to rule by decree .

as the military crackdown against the movement intensifies , protests have turned violent . as temperatures soar above 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in aden , the great port city of south yemen , homes become airless .
daily power cuts leave residents sweating through dark nights .
in a region where resentment of the government in the north has been festering for a decade , such daily indignities are enough to spark fury in the people .
earlier this week thousands took to the streets in protest .
car tyres were burned , property vandalised and gun shots fired .
police were pelted with stones .
according to yemeni officials this came after members of the opposition group known as the southern movement , some of whose factions call for independence from northern yemen , ambushed a military patrol and wounded three soldiers .
the attack followed shortly on from the twice attempted assassination of an army brigade commander by members of the southern movement the week earlier .
in south yemen scenes like these repeat themselves at increasingly shorter intervals .
besieged by conflicts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen 's president ali abdullah saleh is facing growing unrest from his palace in the mountain capital of sanaa president ali abdullah saleh seems besieged by conflicts .
to the north , a recent peace agreement quelling six years of rebellion by the zaidi shia houthi clan , who fight a government they accuse of marginalising them politically as well as economically , has been breaking down , threatening a return to war .
in the unruly tribal strongholds of east yemen saleh 's troops face an al qaeda branch well integrated into the local community and whose failed attempt to bring down a us airliner last christmas day showed they are a menace not just to yemen , but to international security as well .
however , to the government in sanaa , no conflict is more serious than the growing power of the southern movement , whose call for independence from the north threatens the territorial integrity of the state .
economic injustices the key grievance levelled by the southern movement against president saleh is economic : southerners complain bitterly that despite their small numbers , just 3.5 million compared to 20 million living in the north , and despite the south being home to the majority of yemen 's oil and gas fields -lrb- which account for 75 percent of the government 's revenue -rrb- the south has not witnessed anything like the economic growth and development of the north , limited though that is .

but it was a contemporary form of anti-semitism that got the exhibit off the ground . the project started after four neo-nazis firebombed a synagogue in the northern german town of luebeck on the eve of passover in 1994 , according to mark grellert , who has been creating virtual reconstructions of synagogues at darmstadt technical university since that firebombing both as a student and now professor in the architecture department . " i do n't remember where i heard this about the arson attack , but i think a couple of minutes afterwards and i got the idea , we have to do something against this , " he told deutsche welle . his idea was to virtually reconstruct some of the synagogues that were destroyed on kristallnacht , or the night of the broken glass , on november 10 , 1938 .
that was one of the most heinous attacks against jews , synagogues and jewish businesses in german history . their efforts culminated in an exhibition in bonn in 2000 . that exhibition has now come to the united states for the first time at the holocaust memorial center zekelman family campus in farmington hills , michigan .
the exhibit opened on august 29 and will run through the end of november . back in 1994 , grellert and his team started with three synagogues in frankfurt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.09.2010 spain slashes solar energy subsidies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels produce about 3 percent of spain 's energy as german alternative energy firms lament berlin 's decision to continue using nuclear power , spain is planning to cut solar subsidies .
critics say madrid is strangling investment in renewables - and the wider economy . about five years ago , spanish farmers realized they could make more money harvesting the sun than they could planting crops .
on the dusty plains of castilla y leon , for instance , fields of sunflowers gave way to solar panels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate activists have put their own form of pressure on spain 's government that growth was spurred by alternative electricity subsidies that are now endangered .
industry minister miguel sebastian has announced subsidies for new , ground-based solar parks will be cut by 45 percent .
state support for rooftop installations will fall by 25 percent , while smaller installations will see cuts of 5 percent .
eduardo collado , technical director at the photovoltaic industry association -lrb- asif -rrb- , described the plan as short-sighted .
by 2020 , renewable energy could be less expensive than conventional and nuclear power , which still enjoys annual subsidies worth billions of euros , he said .
“ it 's very bad news , " he told deutsche welle .
" -lrb- spanish leaders -rrb- are in a deep crisis , so they have to save money where they can , but they are not taking account of the investments that are the future of spain 's energy industry .
it is n't spending , it 's investment .
you have to look 10 or 15 years ahead … if the price of oil goes up , the cost of renewables will be nothing in comparison . "
sector not self-sufficient spain 's government says the cuts reflect improved efficiency in solar technologies , but the sector is not competitive yet .
it contributed 1.2 billion euros towards country 's gdp in 2008 and collected 3 billion euros worth of subsidies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when resources become scarce , solar energy will be invaluable , advocates say however , the solar sector is innovative and dynamic , and in a matter of years has grown rapidly to account for 3 percent of spain 's energy production .
with news of the cuts , anger and frustration has echoed across its trade associations .
carlos navarro , the founder of siliken , a solar panel manufacturer that employs 1,000 people , said the subsidy rollback is the latest in a long line of errors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 09.09.2010 beethoven 's ' blood , sweat and tears ' keep audiences coming back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's music and biography fascinate all generations composer ludwig van beethoven moved the masses with his music and still does today .
as the 2010 beethovenfest gets underway , dw asks what is it about the composer that draws people back to his works decade after decade . skepticism is in order when it comes to claims like " beethoven has been performed more than any other composer ! "
reliable statistics on the issue would be nearly impossible to assemble .
but those who see the great composer as one of the most influential musicians in the world - both then and today - are certainly not far from the truth .
" even today , beethoven remains of contemporary interest across the world , " michael ladenburger , director and curator of the beethoven house museum in bonn , told deutsche welle .
" beethoven 's music has n't been reduced to just a cultural artefact that people occasionally listen to when they 're in a certain mood .
instead , there are people across all societies who would say , ' this music enriches my life in a very personal and direct way .
in a sense , beethoven is necessary for my life . " '
beethoven worldwide there 's no shortage of examples of the composer 's enduring power : in the central african city of kinshasa , a group of amateur musicians founded the region 's first symphony orchestra and performed beethoven .
the composer is also a fixed part of the curriculum in venezuela 's " el sistema " youth program for music education .
even the prisoners in gulags and concentration camps during world war ii banded together and played beethoven 's works as a way to help cope with their anguish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's 2010 beethovenfest showcases international interest in the master composer but why does his music inspire such an impassioned response ?
" it 's partly due to the fact that people know beethoven 's life - the health problems , his deafness , the bad twists of fate and his struggle against all of those things , " said ladenburger .
but that 's not all : " even more than most composers , beethoven exerted an enormous amount of blood , sweat and tears to find the ideal form for his works . "
timeless moral message beethoven composed works for specific occasions or events , but many of his works also give expression to a moral or ethical ideal , and his fans and followers sense that .
that may help explain why beethoven enthusiasts get together and perform his pieces again and again .
but ladenburger does n't support every tradition when it comes to performing beethoven 's compositions .
" it 's regrettable that the ninth symphony is performed so much and often so thoughtlessly .
beethoven would have rolled over in his grave if he knew that people performed the ninth and other works for pleasure , with total disregard for the message behind them . "
millionaire and a hobby fisherman ?
the beethoven house in bonn is world renowned as a place to get to know the composer better .
and ever since the museum put its collection online , more questions about the master musician have come in than ever .
in the beethoven forum , people can ask whatever is on their mind , like whether beethoven liked to fish -lrb- he did n't -rrb- and how he might experience life today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , royalties could save beethoven from the financial problems he once faced according to michael ladenburger , beethoven himself reflected deeply on the question of dealing with fame and being a public figure .
" he asked himself what it meant for him to be an extraordinarily gifted person , and what obligations and practical consequences that brings . "
but ladenburger has reason to believe beethoven would have been able to get by in contemporary society , " and not just because he would n't have to subsist on occasional payments from his publishers anymore .
instead , he 'd be a millionaire several times over from royalties ! "
beethoven makes money for bonn hopefully beethoven would n't be against his hometown profiting today from the heritage of its famous son - both financially and in terms of image .

after a bumpy round one - and an even worse performance a week later - they 'll try to get it together this week . match day three in the bundesliga is upon us , and dw 's team of football freaks are seeking redemption - and hoping that when it comes to picks , it 's a case of third time 's a charm .
-lrb- or at the very least for things to go back to normal . -rrb-
after a weak first round - when , admittedly there 's not much to go on when filling out your bet slip - the bundesliga gods belched up one of their most unexpected sets of results in recent memory : a match day with seven away wins and a bona fide shocker in bayern 's loss to promoted team kaiserslautern .
as you might expect , the prediction squad took a hit -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but still we rise .
friday , september 10 hoffenheim - schalke the footballing playthings of sap billionaire dietmar hopp have burst into the new season at full stride , dispatching bremen at home and handling pauli away .
vedad ibisisevic is back in great form up front and ghana 's world cup run this summer appears to have done defender isaac vorsah a world of good .
the winless schalke are … a work in progress , at best .
but there is reason for hope .
benedikt hoewedes is back from suspension , which will help shore up their creaky back line , and raul no longer has a donkey named edu for his strike partner - rather he 'll have a face familiar to him from madrid in klaas-jan huntelaar .
i like them to snatch a point .
prediction : 1-1 saturday , september 11 borussia dortmund - wolfsburg bildunterschrift : mueller is fast ebcoming the man in munich dortmund have been up and down thus far , laying an egg at home to leverkusen , and then flying high away from home stuttgart .
in mario goetze , they 've unearthed another young german gem and shinji kagawa -lrb- bought for 350,000 euros - $ 446,000 -rrb- is surely the steal of the season .
wolfsburg were unlucky to lose on opening night to bayern , but just plain blew it against mainz , surrendering a three goal lead to lose 4-3 .
taking into account the injured arne friedrich 's continuing absence from the center of defense and a knock that might keep creative maestro diego out of the starting line-up , i ca n't see wolfsburg getting a result in dortmund .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 hamburg - nuremberg hsv 's ruud van nistelrooy has been chewing up bundesliga defenses , notching three goals in his first two games .
nuremberg , meanwhile , just eked out a draw at gladbach and wilted to defeat at home to lowly freiburg .
hamburg should win at a canter .
prediction : hamburg 3-1 borussia moenchengladbach - eintracht frankfurt a tough one to call , this .
if gladbach are half the side they were in their 6-3 demolition of leverkusen in week two , it 's not a contest .
then again , if they revert to their ordinary form , eintracht - who were unfortunate to go down in week one to hanover before being steamrolled by hamburg in week two - have the horses to get a draw , or even win .
home advantage and frankfurt 's injury worries in defense -lrb- vasoski is out , chris is day-to-day -rrb- should tip this for the foals .
prediction : gladbach 2-1 freiburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : van the man is getting his first taste of the millerntor stadium in any derby , observers are meant to " throw out the record books . "
so i will .
despite freiburg having picked up three points to stuttgart 's none so far this season , i reckon baden-wuerttemburg 's big boys just have too much quality to keep on stinking out stadiums every week .
new signing mauro camoranesi will steady the ship in midfield , while cacau will have a big game against a suspect freiburg back line .
prediction : stuttgart 3-1 hanover 96 - bayer leverkusen among the sides with six points after two match days , the reds are surely the most surprising .
but their results have been convincing - they fought eintracht to a stalemate before snatching a late win , and played schalke off the park .
much of this comes down to good transfer dealing which has brought much-needed quality .
emanuel pogatetz and mohamed abdelloue were inexpensive and have done the business , and i expect damarcus beasley -lrb- brought in on a free transfer -rrb- to do the same .
the only trouble is , this week they host leverkusen , who are just too fast up front for their aging defense .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 bayern munich - werder bremen per mertesacker 's injury in germany 's win over azerbaijan this week came at precisely the wrong moment for werder - just in time to weaken its back line for one of its sternest tests of the season in munich .
mikael silvestre , who bremen picked up ahead of the transfer deadline and will now have to throw into the center of defense , will probably get torched by the likes of thomas mueller , ivica olic , and franck ribery .
bremen 's only chance will be to get big games out of new boys wesley and marko arnautovic - which they may well do .
prediction : bayern 4-2 sunday , september 12 mainz - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you hear that lakic ?
dw sports says you 're due to cool off a shock table-topping clash with both sides on six points , this game is likely to see one of the two participants unmasked as a pretender for top-half status .
i see kaiserslautern as the likelier candidate .
the red devils are very solid at the back , but i do n't trust their on-fire hitman srdan lakic -lrb- three goals in two matches -rrb- to stay ablaze much longer .
mainz , on the other hand , have another year of top-flight experience under their collective belt and earned several stripes with their four-goal fight back in wolfsburg in week two .
prediction : mainz 2-1 cologne - st. pauli these two sets of supporters have a " fan friendship " - an odd german custom wherein two clubs ' ultras agree , over a period of years , to get along rather than taunt each other .
with that in mind , as well as each club 's fans ' reputation for liking a drink or four , this game ought to have a party atmosphere .
the teams may well spoil it .
st. pauli 's hell-for leather approach can be entertaining , but is low on ball skill .
and the more defensive-minded cologne , more often than not , makes for putrid viewing .
expect a draw .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 09.09.2010 swiss aviators power ahead with solar plane project großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high in the sky : the ' solar impulse ' does what it does best two months after the ' solar impulse ' flew around the clock using nothing but the energy from the sun as fuel , the minds behind the aircraft say they are gearing up to reach new heights . when the solar-powered plane takes to the skies again sometime later this month , it wo n't be testing the endurance of its batteries , but rather will be making sure that its ground crew is ready to make flights of this kind a success .
andre borschberg , both the pilot of the ' solar impulse ' and one of its leaders , announced this week that the plane would be entering its next testing phase sometime in september .
the plan is to make three short-distance hops over swiss territory - from payerne to geneva , geneva to zurich , zurich to payerne - to see how well the aircraft can be integrated into the flow of everyday business at an international airport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertrand picard and andre borschberg in the hanger borshberg added that the upcoming jaunts are crictical if they are ever to take the plane beyond swiss borders and land at major foreign airports .
" our airplane is quite special , it flies slowly , it is very light and is sensitive to turbulence , " he said .
" we have to know what logistics need to be put in place and to see what kind of collaboration we need to develop with big airports because . "
a training exercise given the plane 's relatively slow cruising speeds - 50 kilometers per hour -lrb- or about 31 mph -rrb- as compared to the standard 250 kilometers per hour -lrb- or 155 mph -rrb- for larger aircraft - the ground crew has time to drive from payerne to geneva and arrive before it lands .
it might sound like a strange exercise on paper , but borschberg insists that it is all part of getting everyone acquainted with the solar-generated newcomer .
" we have to train the team , " borschberg said , " and see what kind of difficulties we have with traffic arriving and departing . "
and that cuts both ways .
it is not only the pilot and the ground crew dedicated to the ' solar impuse ' that have to get used to operating in a very busy environment , but the other aircraft that have to become accustomed to its presence .
the fact that the plane , which has solar panels attached to the 63 meter span of its wings , it is so easily thrown off by turbulence means the time between it landing and taking has to be adapted accordingly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plane on the ground " it is quite difficult for people in the control towers , because they are not used to it , " borschberg said .
" it is an experiment to get their feedback , to see how it works so that when we fly to another international airport next year , we can propose a way to operate that has been tested and in which we have experience . "
commercial potential ?
as yet there is no solid information about exactly where the non-domestic flights might take the ' solar impulse . '
but wherever it goes , there is a good chance it will attract a lot of attention .
the idea of a plane which can fly without spluttering more emissions into the already choking skies , is a welcome thought , both environmentally and economically .
" ten years ago fuel was 10 percent of airlines cost and now it is nearly 30 percent , " geoff van klaveren , aviation expert with the deutsche bank told deutsche welle .
" any kind of alternative fuel is a thing we have to research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky is the limit .
or is it ?
yet anyone hoping to see this state-of-the-art clean technology ground the world 's current airline fleet is in for a long-haul wait .
commercialization , the ' solar impulse ' pilot insists , is still a very small dot on the horizon .
in reference to the decades it took between the wright brothers ' first aircraft success and the first commercial transatlantic flight , he stressed that it is a slow process .
" i think we will have to wait a while before we can do the same with passengers , but we have to start somewhere , " borschberg said .
making history , changing lives and that it has .
in july , ' solar impulse ' became the first aircraft in history to stay in the air for 26 consecutive hours without any fuel .
the plane took off in the early hours of the morning and spent 14 hours in the air during sunlight hours , enough time for its batteries to charge for the night-time portion of the experiment .
bildunterschrift : solar-powered night flight speaking shortly after the landing , swiss adventurer and brainchild of the project bertrand piccard told reporters that the round-the-clock flight had taken them closer to " the myth of perpetual flight . "
but that is not the only goal they have in mind .
both piccard and borschberg believe that to make the world aware of how much can be achieved with just four six kilowatt electric motors , is to open eyes to the possibilities on the ground .
" at this stage the purpose of the project is not so much to develop a commercial application but to show what we can do today with this technology , " borschberg added .
he said that as much as anything it is about making people see how with the right technology they can use less energy yet still maintain the same quality of life .

the goal is to support independent journalism in this southern african country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrick leusch , head of dw-akademie project development , and barbara plinkert , chargé d 'affaires , ec delegation harare the european commission will support a long-term dw-akademie project in zimbabwe with 1.1 million euros .
the project is called “ media in zimbabwe : the key factor in defending human rights and freedom of opinion .
reinforcing media reform and the transition to civil society ” .
dw-akademie aims to support zimbabwean media over a three-year period in “ working on a new , free media system and supporting independent journalism in zimbabwe , ” emphasizes patrick leusch , head of dw-akademie project development .
eu assistance makes this possible .
“ the project is very important to us because it ’ s the result of close cooperation between zimbabwean and european partners . ”
particularly benefiting from the support will be existing networks of media companies and media aid agencies in zimbabwe , with a special focus on members of the “ media alliance of zimbabwe ” -lrb- maz -rrb- .
this project concentrates primarily on four areas : media law reform ; institutional advanced training ; expertise development ; and professionalization of the media sector .
the project also aims to strengthen the connection between the media and civil society .
despite the restructuring of the government two years ago , the media situation in this crisis-shaken southern african country has hardly improved .
independent reporting is still not possible , say media and human rights organizations .
and contrary to promises made , no media reforms have been undertaken since the power-sharing agreement between robert mugabe ’ s government and the opposition came into effect .
in fact , the opposite is true : journalists still suffer censorship and persecution .
according to a report from human rights watch , not one independent radio or television broadcaster received a license last year .
primarily , dw-akademie would like to have a coordinating role in the project .
nine partners in total are involved , including the european organization ims in denmark , iwpr in london , press now in the netherlands and fojo in sweden .
four zimbabwean media organizations and networks are also involved .
the project is financed by the eu human rights program “ instrument for democracy and human rights ” -lrb- eidhr -rrb- .
the european commission received more than 200 applications for project funding as part of this program .
eleven were chosen , including the dw-akademie zimbabwe project .

critics say madrid is strangling investment in renewables - and the wider economy . about five years ago , spanish farmers realized they could make more money harvesting the sun than they could planting crops .
on the dusty plains of castilla y leon , for instance , fields of sunflowers gave way to solar panels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate activists have put their own form of pressure on spain 's government that growth was spurred by alternative electricity subsidies that are now endangered .
industry minister miguel sebastian has announced subsidies for new , ground-based solar parks will be cut by 45 percent .
state support for rooftop installations will fall by 25 percent , while smaller installations will see cuts of 5 percent .
eduardo collado , technical director at the photovoltaic industry association -lrb- asif -rrb- , described the plan as short-sighted .
by 2020 , renewable energy could be less expensive than conventional and nuclear power , which still enjoys annual subsidies worth billions of euros , he said .
“ it 's very bad news , " he told deutsche welle .
" -lrb- spanish leaders -rrb- are in a deep crisis , so they have to save money where they can , but they are not taking account of the investments that are the future of spain 's energy industry .
it is n't spending , it 's investment .
you have to look 10 or 15 years ahead … if the price of oil goes up , the cost of renewables will be nothing in comparison . "
sector not self-sufficient spain 's government says the cuts reflect improved efficiency in solar technologies , but the sector is not competitive yet .
it contributed 1.2 billion euros towards country 's gdp in 2008 and collected 3 billion euros worth of subsidies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when resources become scarce , solar energy will be invaluable , advocates say however , the solar sector is innovative and dynamic , and in a matter of years has grown rapidly to account for 3 percent of spain 's energy production .
with news of the cuts , anger and frustration has echoed across its trade associations .
carlos navarro , the founder of siliken , a solar panel manufacturer that employs 1,000 people , said the subsidy rollback is the latest in a long line of errors .
the looming cuts have put 10 billion euros worth of projects on hold and lines of credit are now nearly impossible to obtain from banks , he said .
" we have always felt that spain was not so consistent in the program of photovoltaic development , " he told deutsche welle .
" almost every year we have had changes in the policy and the targets and the volumes . "
" the real problem is not the question of the tariff , it 's the uncertainty they are constantly sending to the markets – especially the financial institutions – about the security of their investment … the market is completely stopped right now . "
jobs lost according to asif , the lack of clarity over tariffs has led to significant job losses .
the sector employed 40,000 people in 2008 , when a record-breaking 3,000 megawatts of solar capacity were installed .
now that new investments have ground to a halt , the 2010 workforce consists of just 13,500 workers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's austerity measures have drawn widespread protest many in the industry blame big conventional energy companies for pressuring the government to defend them against competition from renewable energy , which has forced conventional power stations to reduce output .
carlos navarro said big energy companies pushed the government towards austerity measures in the photovoltaic sector because its fragmented composition made it an easy target .
" the problem is that the companies are not running the plants as much as they were before , " he said .
" demand has been cut 5 percent because of the crisis , so they are making a lot of noise and they are trying to find enemies .
well , photovoltaics is a very good enemy because the portfolio of owners is very spread out .
there are no big companies with an interest in photovoltaic energy . "

but it was a contemporary form of anti-semitism that got the exhibit off the ground . the project started after four neo-nazis firebombed a synagogue in the northern german town of luebeck on the eve of passover in 1994 , according to mark grellert , who has been creating virtual reconstructions of synagogues at darmstadt technical university since that firebombing both as a student and now professor in the architecture department .

that was one of the most heinous attacks against jews , synagogues and jewish businesses in german history . their efforts culminated in an exhibition in bonn in 2000 . that exhibition has now come to the united states for the first time at the holocaust memorial center zekelman family campus in farmington hills , michigan .
the exhibit opened on august 29 and will run through the end of november . back in 1994 , grellert and his team started with three synagogues in frankfurt .
but he said they quickly realized that the project would n't move as quickly as they hoped as it would take them almost one year to finish a single synagogue . getting the plans the first step was to find blueprints or old photographs showing the synagogue 's floor plan then grellert and his team would reach out to people who remembered the original appearance of the synagogue .

when the project started back in 1994 , 3d modeling technology was less advanced primitive than today . but in recent years , grellert added , the team has been able to account for the detail of the synagogues decor , including ornate chandeliers , stained-glass windows , and red brick exterior . the end result of all the work is 14 virtually reconstructed synagogues from all over germany presented in an exhibit divided three parts : perception , escalation , and reconstruction . the exhibit starts by putting a context around germany 's anti-semitic laws in the 1930s , followed by the names of the 1,200 places in germany where synagogues were destroyed on kristallnacht . the final room , reconstruction , displays the 14 virtually reconstructed synagogues .
the display begins with the synagogue ’ s exterior then shows the interior with special attention paid to details like the shadows cast by balconies and refracted light rays coming in through the windows . the intricate digital displays recreate the importance the houses of worship held in germany before their destruction , according to stephen goldman , executive director of the holocaust memorial center in farmington hills , in the us state of michigan - where the exhibit is currently located .

the goal is to support independent journalism in this southern african country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrick leusch , head of dw-akademie project development , and barbara plinkert , chargé d 'affaires , ec delegation harare the european commission will support a long-term dw-akademie project in zimbabwe with 1.1 million euros .
the project is called “ media in zimbabwe : the key factor in defending human rights and freedom of opinion .
reinforcing media reform and the transition to civil society ” .
dw-akademie aims to support zimbabwean media over a three-year period in “ working on a new , free media system and supporting independent journalism in zimbabwe , ” emphasizes patrick leusch , head of dw-akademie project development .
eu assistance makes this possible .
“ the project is very important to us because it ’ s the result of close cooperation between zimbabwean and european partners . ”
particularly benefiting from the support will be existing networks of media companies and media aid agencies in zimbabwe , with a special focus on members of the “ media alliance of zimbabwe ” -lrb- maz -rrb- .
this project concentrates primarily on four areas : media law reform ; institutional advanced training ; expertise development ; and professionalization of the media sector .
the project also aims to strengthen the connection between the media and civil society .
despite the restructuring of the government two years ago , the media situation in this crisis-shaken southern african country has hardly improved .
independent reporting is still not possible , say media and human rights organizations .
and contrary to promises made , no media reforms have been undertaken since the power-sharing agreement between robert mugabe ’ s government and the opposition came into effect .
in fact , the opposite is true : journalists still suffer censorship and persecution .
according to a report from human rights watch , not one independent radio or television broadcaster received a license last year .
primarily , dw-akademie would like to have a coordinating role in the project .
nine partners in total are involved , including the european organization ims in denmark , iwpr in london , press now in the netherlands and fojo in sweden .
four zimbabwean media organizations and networks are also involved .
the project is financed by the eu human rights program “ instrument for democracy and human rights ” -lrb- eidhr -rrb- .
the european commission received more than 200 applications for project funding as part of this program .
eleven were chosen , including the dw-akademie zimbabwe project .

the project is called “ media in zimbabwe : the key factor in defending human rights and freedom of opinion .

dw-akademie aims to support zimbabwean media over a three-year period in “ working on a new , free media system and supporting independent journalism in zimbabwe , ” emphasizes patrick leusch , head of dw-akademie project development .

“ the project is very important to us because it ’ s the result of close cooperation between zimbabwean and european partners . ”
particularly benefiting from the support will be existing networks of media companies and media aid agencies in zimbabwe , with a special focus on members of the “ media alliance of zimbabwe ” -lrb- maz -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 09.09.2010 beethoven 's ' blood , sweat and tears ' keep audiences coming back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's music and biography fascinate all generations composer ludwig van beethoven moved the masses with his music and still does today .
as the 2010 beethovenfest gets underway , dw asks what is it about the composer that draws people back to his works decade after decade . skepticism is in order when it comes to claims like " beethoven has been performed more than any other composer ! "
reliable statistics on the issue would be nearly impossible to assemble .
but those who see the great composer as one of the most influential musicians in the world - both then and today - are certainly not far from the truth .
" even today , beethoven remains of contemporary interest across the world , " michael ladenburger , director and curator of the beethoven house museum in bonn , told deutsche welle .
" beethoven 's music has n't been reduced to just a cultural artefact that people occasionally listen to when they 're in a certain mood .
instead , there are people across all societies who would say , ' this music enriches my life in a very personal and direct way .
in a sense , beethoven is necessary for my life . " '
beethoven worldwide there 's no shortage of examples of the composer 's enduring power : in the central african city of kinshasa , a group of amateur musicians founded the region 's first symphony orchestra and performed beethoven .
the composer is also a fixed part of the curriculum in venezuela 's " el sistema " youth program for music education .
even the prisoners in gulags and concentration camps during world war ii banded together and played beethoven 's works as a way to help cope with their anguish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's 2010 beethovenfest showcases international interest in the master composer but why does his music inspire such an impassioned response ?
" it 's partly due to the fact that people know beethoven 's life - the health problems , his deafness , the bad twists of fate and his struggle against all of those things , " said ladenburger .
but that 's not all : " even more than most composers , beethoven exerted an enormous amount of blood , sweat and tears to find the ideal form for his works . "
timeless moral message beethoven composed works for specific occasions or events , but many of his works also give expression to a moral or ethical ideal , and his fans and followers sense that .
that may help explain why beethoven enthusiasts get together and perform his pieces again and again .
but ladenburger does n't support every tradition when it comes to performing beethoven 's compositions .
" it 's regrettable that the ninth symphony is performed so much and often so thoughtlessly .
beethoven would have rolled over in his grave if he knew that people performed the ninth and other works for pleasure , with total disregard for the message behind them . "
millionaire and a hobby fisherman ?
the beethoven house in bonn is world renowned as a place to get to know the composer better .
and ever since the museum put its collection online , more questions about the master musician have come in than ever .
in the beethoven forum , people can ask whatever is on their mind , like whether beethoven liked to fish -lrb- he did n't -rrb- and how he might experience life today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , royalties could save beethoven from the financial problems he once faced according to michael ladenburger , beethoven himself reflected deeply on the question of dealing with fame and being a public figure .
" he asked himself what it meant for him to be an extraordinarily gifted person , and what obligations and practical consequences that brings . "
but ladenburger has reason to believe beethoven would have been able to get by in contemporary society , " and not just because he would n't have to subsist on occasional payments from his publishers anymore .
instead , he 'd be a millionaire several times over from royalties ! "
beethoven makes money for bonn hopefully beethoven would n't be against his hometown profiting today from the heritage of its famous son - both financially and in terms of image .
bonn 's mayor juergen nimptsch confirmed that beethoven brings hefty returns .
" it 's more or less the case that for every euro we invest , three to four come back into the region and stay here in bonn . "
top classical musicians from all over the world are scheduled to perform at the 2010 beethovenfest bonn , including pianist helene grimaud , cellist sol gabetta , conductor kent nagano and many others .
the festival runs from september 10 - october 9 .

as the 2010 beethovenfest gets underway , dw asks what is it about the composer that draws people back to his works decade after decade . skepticism is in order when it comes to claims like " beethoven has been performed more than any other composer ! "
reliable statistics on the issue would be nearly impossible to assemble .
but those who see the great composer as one of the most influential musicians in the world - both then and today - are certainly not far from the truth .
" even today , beethoven remains of contemporary interest across the world , " michael ladenburger , director and curator of the beethoven house museum in bonn , told deutsche welle .
" beethoven 's music has n't been reduced to just a cultural artefact that people occasionally listen to when they 're in a certain mood .
instead , there are people across all societies who would say , ' this music enriches my life in a very personal and direct way .
in a sense , beethoven is necessary for my life . " '
beethoven worldwide there 's no shortage of examples of the composer 's enduring power : in the central african city of kinshasa , a group of amateur musicians founded the region 's first symphony orchestra and performed beethoven .
the composer is also a fixed part of the curriculum in venezuela 's " el sistema " youth program for music education .
even the prisoners in gulags and concentration camps during world war ii banded together and played beethoven 's works as a way to help cope with their anguish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's 2010 beethovenfest showcases international interest in the master composer but why does his music inspire such an impassioned response ?
" it 's partly due to the fact that people know beethoven 's life - the health problems , his deafness , the bad twists of fate and his struggle against all of those things , " said ladenburger .
but that 's not all : " even more than most composers , beethoven exerted an enormous amount of blood , sweat and tears to find the ideal form for his works . "
timeless moral message beethoven composed works for specific occasions or events , but many of his works also give expression to a moral or ethical ideal , and his fans and followers sense that .
that may help explain why beethoven enthusiasts get together and perform his pieces again and again .
but ladenburger does n't support every tradition when it comes to performing beethoven 's compositions .
" it 's regrettable that the ninth symphony is performed so much and often so thoughtlessly .
beethoven would have rolled over in his grave if he knew that people performed the ninth and other works for pleasure , with total disregard for the message behind them . "
millionaire and a hobby fisherman ?
the beethoven house in bonn is world renowned as a place to get to know the composer better .
and ever since the museum put its collection online , more questions about the master musician have come in than ever .
in the beethoven forum , people can ask whatever is on their mind , like whether beethoven liked to fish -lrb- he did n't -rrb- and how he might experience life today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , royalties could save beethoven from the financial problems he once faced according to michael ladenburger , beethoven himself reflected deeply on the question of dealing with fame and being a public figure .
" he asked himself what it meant for him to be an extraordinarily gifted person , and what obligations and practical consequences that brings . "
but ladenburger has reason to believe beethoven would have been able to get by in contemporary society , " and not just because he would n't have to subsist on occasional payments from his publishers anymore .
instead , he 'd be a millionaire several times over from royalties ! "
beethoven makes money for bonn hopefully beethoven would n't be against his hometown profiting today from the heritage of its famous son - both financially and in terms of image .
bonn 's mayor juergen nimptsch confirmed that beethoven brings hefty returns .
" it 's more or less the case that for every euro we invest , three to four come back into the region and stay here in bonn . "
top classical musicians from all over the world are scheduled to perform at the 2010 beethovenfest bonn , including pianist helene grimaud , cellist sol gabetta , conductor kent nagano and many others .
the festival runs from september 10 - october 9 .

the european union 's top diplomat welcomed the decision . after weeks of diplomatic pressure from european union nations , including germany and france , belgrade indicated on wednesday that it had struck a " compromise " with the eu on a joint text for a resolution at the united nations general assembly . it no longer directly challenges kosovo 's independence .
serbia also agreed to a call for a " dialogue " with kosovo .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle welcomed serbia 's decision .
" this is a clear signal that serbia sees its future in the eu , " westerwelle said .
" i call on all parties to begin these talks rapidly ... and lead to concrete results for the people . "
the eu 's high representative for foreign policy also reacted positively .
" i warmly welcome the announcement , " catherine ashton said in a statement .
the move was seen as bolstering the eu 's mediating role in the region .
" this draft resolution will now be a resolution put forward by 28 european countries , " ashton added .
" all 27 eu member states and serbia will be co-sponsoring this draft resolution . "
in the new text , serbia has dropped calls for the condemnation of kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence and for renewed talks on kosovo 's status .
international pressure in july , the international court of justice ruled that the declaration of independence violated no international law , and welcomed " the readiness of the eu to facilitate the process of dialogue " between serbia and kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last december serbia applied to begin talks on eu membership serbia also agreed to move the venue of talks from the un to the eu , where 22 of the 27 member states have recognized kosovo as an independent country .
serbian president boris tadic said in a statement that the resolution defends his country 's interests " by peaceful and diplomatic means . "
he added that belgrade was acting " on an honest wish to resolve all issues in a partner ship with the eu and other important international players . "
however , serbian nationalists and kosovo serbs have sharply criticized the compromise .
the opposition democratic party of serbia described the move as a " capitulation to ultimatums from western powers and confiscation of kosovo . "
paving the way for a serbia-kosovo dialogue analysts believe the diplomatic bargaining has recognized the eu as the key player in possible talks between belgrade and pristina .
ashton met tadic late on tuesday in brussels , with a breakthrough coming on wednesday .
serbia is keen to become a member of the european union , but questions remain over its stance on kosovo .
kosovo declared independence from serbia in february 2008 , 11 years after nato ousted serbian forces from the region , ending an ethnic conflict .
the new country has been recognized by the united states and most eu nations .
serbia had originally planned to use the un resolution to challenge kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence .
the new draft was due to be presented later on thursday .
german and british foreign ministers warned during recent visits to belgrade that the country was risking its ties with the eu by focusing its entire diplomatic efforts on the issue .

in sweden , the iranian ambassador was summoned to stockholm to assert the government 's concerns . european union officials welcomed iran 's decision to suspend the stoning sentence on a woman charged with adultery , but said that it all charges should now be dropped against her .
sakineh mohammadi ashtiani , a 43-year-old mother of two has been convicted of adultery in iran and faced a sentence of death by stoning .
ashtiani 's case has drawn criticism from much of the international community .
iran 's foreign ministry announced the decision to suspend the sentence in a statement released on wednesday .
the eu 's high representative for foreign affairs , catherine ashton , described it as " a step in the right direction . "
however it is unclear whether ashtiani still faces the death penalty , or if the sentence could be applied at a later date .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ashtiani 's defense lawyer has fled to europe earlier on wednesday , the european parliament increased pressure on iran to drop ashtiani 's sentence by passing a resolution condemning it .
the legislative resolution condemning tehran won by a vote of 658-to-1 in strasbourg .
' disgusting form of punishment ' in sweden , the iranian ambassador was summoned to stockholm over the ashtiani case .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt told swedish public radio that the government condemned the sentence .
" we are against capital punishment in any case , but stoning is a particularly disgusting form of capital punishment , and iran should realise that this is completely unacceptable , " bildt said .
the minister argued that the international uproar over the case had had " influence . "
" if we had not acted as we have over these past months , she would have presumably been killed by stoning by now , " he said .

but it was a contemporary form of anti-semitism that got the exhibit off the ground . the project started after four neo-nazis firebombed a synagogue in the northern german town of luebeck on the eve of passover in 1994 , according to mark grellert , who has been creating virtual reconstructions of synagogues at darmstadt technical university since that firebombing both as a student and now professor in the architecture department . " i do n't remember where i heard this about the arson attack , but i think a couple of minutes afterwards and i got the idea , we have to do something against this , " he told deutsche welle . his idea was to virtually reconstruct some of the synagogues that were destroyed on kristallnacht , or the night of the broken glass , on november 10 , 1938 .
that was one of the most heinous attacks against jews , synagogues and jewish businesses in german history . their efforts culminated in an exhibition in bonn in 2000 . that exhibition has now come to the united states for the first time at the holocaust memorial center zekelman family campus in farmington hills , michigan .
the exhibit opened on august 29 and will run through the end of november . back in 1994 , grellert and his team started with three synagogues in frankfurt .
but he said they quickly realized that the project would n't move as quickly as they hoped as it would take them almost one year to finish a single synagogue . getting the plans the first step was to find blueprints or old photographs showing the synagogue 's floor plan then grellert and his team would reach out to people who remembered the original appearance of the synagogue . " in many synagogues , you have only black-and-white photographs , " grellert said .
" so we ask them if they have remembrance of the colors of the synagogues . " bildunterschrift : cologne 's synagogue was built in a neo-islamic style , recalling centuries-old mosques from there , the students redraw the blueprints into computers to create 3d models .
when the project started back in 1994 , 3d modeling technology was less advanced primitive than today . but in recent years , grellert added , the team has been able to account for the detail of the synagogues decor , including ornate chandeliers , stained-glass windows , and red brick exterior . the end result of all the work is 14 virtually reconstructed synagogues from all over germany presented in an exhibit divided three parts : perception , escalation , and reconstruction . the exhibit starts by putting a context around germany 's anti-semitic laws in the 1930s , followed by the names of the 1,200 places in germany where synagogues were destroyed on kristallnacht . the final room , reconstruction , displays the 14 virtually reconstructed synagogues .
the display begins with the synagogue ’ s exterior then shows the interior with special attention paid to details like the shadows cast by balconies and refracted light rays coming in through the windows . the intricate digital displays recreate the importance the houses of worship held in germany before their destruction , according to stephen goldman , executive director of the holocaust memorial center in farmington hills , in the us state of michigan - where the exhibit is currently located . " these were big , prominent institutions , " he told deutsche welle .
" often looking exactly like the cathedrals across the street and done by prominent and well-known german architects . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's synagogue was built in 1861 and destroyed in 1938 ruined communities goldman added that by destroying the synagogues , the nazis tore apart more than individual buildings . " the destruction of a house of worship is very different than the destruction of a home , or even a school , because this effects a whole population , " he said .
" it 's saying , ' we 're no longer safe in our houses of worship ... in our cities , in the buildings we expect to shelter us and cradle us in safety . " ' but goldman admitted that while the digital reconstructions would not have the significance of an actual house of worship , they could serve as a reminder of what was . " it 's not listening to somebody speak to you , but it reminds you of that person , " he said .
" these are speaking in those styles .
these are speaking in the voices of the past . " those voices spoke powerfully to ruth schnee , who attended the exhibit 's opening in michigan .
originally from duesseldorf , she has lived in the united states since 1939 and vividly remembers kristallnacht . " i remember the synagogue in duesseldorf , which was our synagogue , being put on fire , and the rabbi ran into the building to save the torah , and perished in the building , " she said .
" the fire brigade was trained to protect the adjoining buildings , and not of course the synagogues .
the art , the furniture , everything was demolished . " the duesseldorf synagogue has not been recreated by grellert and his team , though they continue to work on the project with his students 10 years after its launch . author : zak rosen -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after a bumpy round one - and an even worse performance a week later - they 'll try to get it together this week . match day three in the bundesliga is upon us , and dw 's team of football freaks are seeking redemption - and hoping that when it comes to picks , it 's a case of third time 's a charm .
-lrb- or at the very least for things to go back to normal . -rrb-
after a weak first round - when , admittedly there 's not much to go on when filling out your bet slip - the bundesliga gods belched up one of their most unexpected sets of results in recent memory : a match day with seven away wins and a bona fide shocker in bayern 's loss to promoted team kaiserslautern .
as you might expect , the prediction squad took a hit -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but still we rise .
friday , september 10 hoffenheim - schalke the footballing playthings of sap billionaire dietmar hopp have burst into the new season at full stride , dispatching bremen at home and handling pauli away .
vedad ibisisevic is back in great form up front and ghana 's world cup run this summer appears to have done defender isaac vorsah a world of good .
the winless schalke are … a work in progress , at best .
but there is reason for hope .
benedikt hoewedes is back from suspension , which will help shore up their creaky back line , and raul no longer has a donkey named edu for his strike partner - rather he 'll have a face familiar to him from madrid in klaas-jan huntelaar .
i like them to snatch a point .
prediction : 1-1 saturday , september 11 borussia dortmund - wolfsburg bildunterschrift : mueller is fast ebcoming the man in munich dortmund have been up and down thus far , laying an egg at home to leverkusen , and then flying high away from home stuttgart .
in mario goetze , they 've unearthed another young german gem and shinji kagawa -lrb- bought for 350,000 euros - $ 446,000 -rrb- is surely the steal of the season .
wolfsburg were unlucky to lose on opening night to bayern , but just plain blew it against mainz , surrendering a three goal lead to lose 4-3 .
taking into account the injured arne friedrich 's continuing absence from the center of defense and a knock that might keep creative maestro diego out of the starting line-up , i ca n't see wolfsburg getting a result in dortmund .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 hamburg - nuremberg hsv 's ruud van nistelrooy has been chewing up bundesliga defenses , notching three goals in his first two games .
nuremberg , meanwhile , just eked out a draw at gladbach and wilted to defeat at home to lowly freiburg .
hamburg should win at a canter .
prediction : hamburg 3-1 borussia moenchengladbach - eintracht frankfurt a tough one to call , this .
if gladbach are half the side they were in their 6-3 demolition of leverkusen in week two , it 's not a contest .
then again , if they revert to their ordinary form , eintracht - who were unfortunate to go down in week one to hanover before being steamrolled by hamburg in week two - have the horses to get a draw , or even win .
home advantage and frankfurt 's injury worries in defense -lrb- vasoski is out , chris is day-to-day -rrb- should tip this for the foals .
prediction : gladbach 2-1 freiburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : van the man is getting his first taste of the millerntor stadium in any derby , observers are meant to " throw out the record books . "
so i will .
despite freiburg having picked up three points to stuttgart 's none so far this season , i reckon baden-wuerttemburg 's big boys just have too much quality to keep on stinking out stadiums every week .
new signing mauro camoranesi will steady the ship in midfield , while cacau will have a big game against a suspect freiburg back line .
prediction : stuttgart 3-1 hanover 96 - bayer leverkusen among the sides with six points after two match days , the reds are surely the most surprising .
but their results have been convincing - they fought eintracht to a stalemate before snatching a late win , and played schalke off the park .
much of this comes down to good transfer dealing which has brought much-needed quality .
emanuel pogatetz and mohamed abdelloue were inexpensive and have done the business , and i expect damarcus beasley -lrb- brought in on a free transfer -rrb- to do the same .
the only trouble is , this week they host leverkusen , who are just too fast up front for their aging defense .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 bayern munich - werder bremen per mertesacker 's injury in germany 's win over azerbaijan this week came at precisely the wrong moment for werder - just in time to weaken its back line for one of its sternest tests of the season in munich .
mikael silvestre , who bremen picked up ahead of the transfer deadline and will now have to throw into the center of defense , will probably get torched by the likes of thomas mueller , ivica olic , and franck ribery .
bremen 's only chance will be to get big games out of new boys wesley and marko arnautovic - which they may well do .
prediction : bayern 4-2 sunday , september 12 mainz - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you hear that lakic ?
dw sports says you 're due to cool off a shock table-topping clash with both sides on six points , this game is likely to see one of the two participants unmasked as a pretender for top-half status .
i see kaiserslautern as the likelier candidate .
the red devils are very solid at the back , but i do n't trust their on-fire hitman srdan lakic -lrb- three goals in two matches -rrb- to stay ablaze much longer .
mainz , on the other hand , have another year of top-flight experience under their collective belt and earned several stripes with their four-goal fight back in wolfsburg in week two .
prediction : mainz 2-1 cologne - st. pauli these two sets of supporters have a " fan friendship " - an odd german custom wherein two clubs ' ultras agree , over a period of years , to get along rather than taunt each other .
with that in mind , as well as each club 's fans ' reputation for liking a drink or four , this game ought to have a party atmosphere .
the teams may well spoil it .
st. pauli 's hell-for leather approach can be entertaining , but is low on ball skill .
and the more defensive-minded cologne , more often than not , makes for putrid viewing .
expect a draw .
prediction : 1-1 last week 's result : 4 points kaiserslautern – bayern munich 2:0 -lrb- dw prediction 2:2 , no points -rrb- schalke - hanover 1:2 -lrb- dw prediction 3:1 , no points -rrb- bremen - cologne 4:2 -lrb- dw prediction 3:0 , one point -rrb- wolfsburg - mainz 3:4 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- frankfurt - hamburg 1:3 -lrb- dw prediction 0:1 , one point -rrb- nuremburg - freiburg 1:2 -lrb- dw prediction 1:1 , no points -rrb- st. pauli - hoffenheim 0:1 -lrb- dw prediction 0:2 , one point -rrb- leverkusen - moenchengladbach 3:6 -lrb- dw prediction 3:1 , no points -rrb- stuttgart - dortmund 1:3 -lrb- dw prediction 1:2 , one point -rrb- total for the season : 9 three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : matt hermann editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nationalism -pipe- 09.09.2010 a revolution in the making in yemen ? 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen is turning into an increasingly seditious country largely peaceful demonstrations in south yemen have grown into a widespread movement demanding independence from the north .
as the military crackdown against the movement intensifies , protests have turned violent . as temperatures soar above 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in aden , the great port city of south yemen , homes become airless .
daily power cuts leave residents sweating through dark nights .
in a region where resentment of the government in the north has been festering for a decade , such daily indignities are enough to spark fury in the people .
earlier this week thousands took to the streets in protest .
car tyres were burned , property vandalised and gun shots fired .
police were pelted with stones .
according to yemeni officials this came after members of the opposition group known as the southern movement , some of whose factions call for independence from northern yemen , ambushed a military patrol and wounded three soldiers .
the attack followed shortly on from the twice attempted assassination of an army brigade commander by members of the southern movement the week earlier .
in south yemen scenes like these repeat themselves at increasingly shorter intervals .
besieged by conflicts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen 's president ali abdullah saleh is facing growing unrest from his palace in the mountain capital of sanaa president ali abdullah saleh seems besieged by conflicts .
to the north , a recent peace agreement quelling six years of rebellion by the zaidi shia houthi clan , who fight a government they accuse of marginalising them politically as well as economically , has been breaking down , threatening a return to war .
in the unruly tribal strongholds of east yemen saleh 's troops face an al qaeda branch well integrated into the local community and whose failed attempt to bring down a us airliner last christmas day showed they are a menace not just to yemen , but to international security as well .
however , to the government in sanaa , no conflict is more serious than the growing power of the southern movement , whose call for independence from the north threatens the territorial integrity of the state .
economic injustices the key grievance levelled by the southern movement against president saleh is economic : southerners complain bitterly that despite their small numbers , just 3.5 million compared to 20 million living in the north , and despite the south being home to the majority of yemen 's oil and gas fields -lrb- which account for 75 percent of the government 's revenue -rrb- the south has not witnessed anything like the economic growth and development of the north , limited though that is .
the movement accuses the president of favoritism of northerners , working through tribal patronage networks from which southerners are largely excluded , of arbitrary land confiscation and political disenfranchisement .
the grievances date back to the unification between north and south yemen in 1990 , which was viewed by many southern leaders as failed .
they were politically outnumbered by their northern colleagues , the two armies were never integrated and assassinations of southern leaders created a deep mistrust of the north .
after elections in 1993 , leaders of former south yemen called for a new federal constitutional system which would decentralize power .
instead , a year later a brief but bloody civil war erupted with northern troops occupying the south .
in the wake of the victory of north over south , president saleh amended the constitution , removing institutions of joint north-south rule and granting himself power to rule by decree .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yemeni army is coming under increasing attacks from opposition rebels since then , a growing sense injustice has simmered in the south , but it was not until 2007 that the southern movement emerged , coalescing around a group of former south yemen army officers , part of a group of 20,000 military personnel forced into early retirement after the 1994 war , who rose up after their pensions were not paid .
former brigadier nasser al-qawi from the aviation brigade of al-anad air base was one of those officers and is today one of the movement 's leaders .
" the authorities ' refusal to address the issues of the south , the looting of its resources for the benefit of the ruling family and the corruption have led -lsb- the south -rsb- to demand secession from the north , " said al-qawi in an interview .
he insisted that southern movement demonstrations had always been peaceful , but blamed sanaa for a violent response .
" it seems the authorities want to drag us towards violence to find a justification to suppress the movement . " " the language of violence and repression used against the people of the south reflects the failure and inability of the government to provide solutions . -lsb- ... -rsb-
for southerners the dream faded away and turned into a nightmare .
people feel the south is under occupation by the north . "

back to first page back 2/2 no head to cut bildunterschrift : even the use of force against the southern movement is not achieving the desired outcome since 2007 the southern movement has grown steadily .
according to observers it has no unified leadership .
" there is no central nervous system , which , paradoxically , has made it a lot more formidable , as there is no head to cut , " said abdul-ghani aryani , a sanaa based political analyst .
the movement includes several political factions , most importantly the former ruling party of south yemen , the yemeni socialist party -lrb- ysp -rrb- .
while many consider ali salem al-beidh , who served as vice president of yemen until he was forced into exile in germany , the champion of their cause , some observers argue he is only a nominal figurehead .
instead , they point to exiled haydar al-attas , former prime minister , as the most effective leader and former south yemen president ali nasser muhammad , who fled in 1986 .
while the movement 's support base is mainly from the south , members of the islah party , the northern-based islamist opposition party , have also expressed backing for the movement .
sympathy for the movement is even found among members of the president 's ruling party , the general people 's congress -lrb- gpc -rrb- .
one former staunch supporter of president saleh and the gpc , tareq al-fadhli , joined the movement in 2009 .
a month later nasser al-wahayshi , leader of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- announced his support for the movement .
whilst the defection by al-fadhli , a former mujahedeen who allegedly fought alongside osama bin laden in afghanistan and later against the ysp in the early 1990 's was interpreted by some as the southern movement developing ties with al qaeda , many see it as a deepening divide between the north and south .
" he was obviously disgruntled by the marginalization he and other southerners suffer from for the benefit of northern tribal elite , " said abdul-ghani aryani .
neither evidence nor shared ideology has been found to link the southern movement to al qaeda .
although al-fadhli has stated that he supports an independent southern state , led by former ysp leader ali salem al-beidh , he has recently been sidelined in the movement .
southern tribes such as the large balharis tribe of shebwa and the bakazim of abyan have also declared their solidarity with the movement .
cracking down as the southern movement has grown the government in sanaa has retorted with violence and repression .
in an august 2010 report the human rights organisation amnesty international accused yemeni authorities of sacrificing human rights in the name of security .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is resorting to media repression to quell the unrest the report argued that the government " has increasingly resorted to unlawful means , including enforced disappearances , unlawful killings , arbitrary detention and excessive use of force . "
at the same time newspapers have been closed down , journalists , editors and proprietors detained , held incommunicado , ill-treated and jailed on spurious charges after unfair trials , said amnesty .
" journalists are in danger of arbitrary arrest by the state and are subjected to beatings and charges of causing riots in the streets , " said abdul-khaliq al-hout , who has worked for al-diyar newspaper in aden for six years .
al-hout said writing about the southern movement is a " complex " issue .
" i can feel the lack of freedom of expression and of providing information and facts to the public . "
restrictive laws and the repressive practices of security forces and special courts have undermined freedom of expression in yemen , though it is enshrined in the constitution .
the press and publications law of 1990 and the establishment of the specialized press and publications court in may 2009 have made it possible for the authorities to imprison " anyone who incites -lsb- -rsb- unrest . " like many other journalists al-hout was detained after writing an article about the southern movement .
after two months in prison human rights watch helped to secure his release .
" there is a growing fear among journalists of the press court where journalists are treated as criminals , " he said .
a revolution in the making ?
since the beginning of 2009 , more than 66 people have been killed in or near demonstrations and 251 have been wounded .
fifteen members of the security forces have also been killed , according to media reports .
analysts warn that as violence by government forces increases , so too does the call for independence .
while some of their leaders have called for secession from the north , ysp , according to analysts , would consider federalism as would pro-southern movement elements within the islah party .
members within the gpc have called for a local government in the south .
in response , on 22 may , the 20th anniversary of yemen 's unification , president saleh called for a revival of national dialogue and offered to form a national unity government .
according to abdel karim aryani , a long-time adviser to the president , decentralization in the north and local rule for the south is being discussed .
" this is what they -lsb- the southern movement -rsb- are asking for , " he said .
however , the more radical calls for independence now come from the general population of the south who bear the brunt of the government 's crack down .
the president 's olive branch was greeted with scepticism within the movement which says it has been let down too many times before .
" it will not change anything .
it will be written in pencil so it can be easily erased , " said former brigadier al-qawi .
" we have lost confidence in the government ; their promises are always broken . "
according to human rights lawyer mohammed al-saqqaf , local rule under a decentralised north may be too little too late : " protesters repeat the same song they used to sing during the british rule : ‘ out of our country imperialism , " ' he said .
" the depth of grievance in the south is such that they are unlikely to go away , " said a sanaa-based analyst , who did not want his name published .
with no central command the southern movement remains a fluid force .
however , the analyst warned that if the cycle of violence in the south continues , what has until now been a disparate protest movement could merge and harden into an organized rebellion , tipping a low intensity conflict over into full-blown civil war .
" the emergence of a unified leadership is imminent , as soon as they turn to fully fledged violence , which is equally imminent . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 09.09.2010 swiss aviators power ahead with solar plane project großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high in the sky : the ' solar impulse ' does what it does best two months after the ' solar impulse ' flew around the clock using nothing but the energy from the sun as fuel , the minds behind the aircraft say they are gearing up to reach new heights . when the solar-powered plane takes to the skies again sometime later this month , it wo n't be testing the endurance of its batteries , but rather will be making sure that its ground crew is ready to make flights of this kind a success .
andre borschberg , both the pilot of the ' solar impulse ' and one of its leaders , announced this week that the plane would be entering its next testing phase sometime in september .
the plan is to make three short-distance hops over swiss territory - from payerne to geneva , geneva to zurich , zurich to payerne - to see how well the aircraft can be integrated into the flow of everyday business at an international airport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertrand picard and andre borschberg in the hanger borshberg added that the upcoming jaunts are crictical if they are ever to take the plane beyond swiss borders and land at major foreign airports .
" our airplane is quite special , it flies slowly , it is very light and is sensitive to turbulence , " he said .
" we have to know what logistics need to be put in place and to see what kind of collaboration we need to develop with big airports because . "
a training exercise given the plane 's relatively slow cruising speeds - 50 kilometers per hour -lrb- or about 31 mph -rrb- as compared to the standard 250 kilometers per hour -lrb- or 155 mph -rrb- for larger aircraft - the ground crew has time to drive from payerne to geneva and arrive before it lands .
it might sound like a strange exercise on paper , but borschberg insists that it is all part of getting everyone acquainted with the solar-generated newcomer .
" we have to train the team , " borschberg said , " and see what kind of difficulties we have with traffic arriving and departing . "
and that cuts both ways .
it is not only the pilot and the ground crew dedicated to the ' solar impuse ' that have to get used to operating in a very busy environment , but the other aircraft that have to become accustomed to its presence .
the fact that the plane , which has solar panels attached to the 63 meter span of its wings , it is so easily thrown off by turbulence means the time between it landing and taking has to be adapted accordingly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plane on the ground " it is quite difficult for people in the control towers , because they are not used to it , " borschberg said .
" it is an experiment to get their feedback , to see how it works so that when we fly to another international airport next year , we can propose a way to operate that has been tested and in which we have experience . "
commercial potential ?
as yet there is no solid information about exactly where the non-domestic flights might take the ' solar impulse . '
but wherever it goes , there is a good chance it will attract a lot of attention .
the idea of a plane which can fly without spluttering more emissions into the already choking skies , is a welcome thought , both environmentally and economically .
" ten years ago fuel was 10 percent of airlines cost and now it is nearly 30 percent , " geoff van klaveren , aviation expert with the deutsche bank told deutsche welle .
" any kind of alternative fuel is a thing we have to research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky is the limit .
or is it ?
yet anyone hoping to see this state-of-the-art clean technology ground the world 's current airline fleet is in for a long-haul wait .
commercialization , the ' solar impulse ' pilot insists , is still a very small dot on the horizon .
in reference to the decades it took between the wright brothers ' first aircraft success and the first commercial transatlantic flight , he stressed that it is a slow process .
" i think we will have to wait a while before we can do the same with passengers , but we have to start somewhere , " borschberg said .
making history , changing lives and that it has .
in july , ' solar impulse ' became the first aircraft in history to stay in the air for 26 consecutive hours without any fuel .
the plane took off in the early hours of the morning and spent 14 hours in the air during sunlight hours , enough time for its batteries to charge for the night-time portion of the experiment .
bildunterschrift : solar-powered night flight speaking shortly after the landing , swiss adventurer and brainchild of the project bertrand piccard told reporters that the round-the-clock flight had taken them closer to " the myth of perpetual flight . "
but that is not the only goal they have in mind .
both piccard and borschberg believe that to make the world aware of how much can be achieved with just four six kilowatt electric motors , is to open eyes to the possibilities on the ground .
" at this stage the purpose of the project is not so much to develop a commercial application but to show what we can do today with this technology , " borschberg added .
he said that as much as anything it is about making people see how with the right technology they can use less energy yet still maintain the same quality of life .

he is set to wrap up his visit to switzerland with stops in lausanne and zurich . germany and switzerland have agreed to resolve differences over tax policy that has soured relations between the two countries over last year .
on the first day of his visit to switzerland , german president christian wulff said it was not unusual for " even the best of neighbors to have differing interests and perceptions . "
the two sides have been at odds over a decision by germany to purchase data obtained illegally about german tax evaders in switzerland .
the stolen cds contained the names of hundreds of germans with secret bank accounts in switzerland .
in august , tax investigators raided german branches of the swiss bank credit suisse as part of an ongoing investigation into tax fraud .
wulff 's swiss counterpart , doris leuthard , said the two countries were determined to resolve their differences in the spirit of good neighbors .
the fact that wulff had chosen switzerland for his first state visit since becoming president in july was a " significant signal , " president leuthard said . the visit had been planned by former president horst koehler , who stepped down in may . this is the first visit to switzerland by a german head of state in 10 years .

the winless schalke are … a work in progress , at best .
but there is reason for hope .
benedikt hoewedes is back from suspension , which will help shore up their creaky back line , and raul no longer has a donkey named edu for his strike partner - rather he 'll have a face familiar to him from madrid in klaas-jan huntelaar .
i like them to snatch a point .
prediction : 1-1 saturday , september 11 borussia dortmund - wolfsburg bildunterschrift : mueller is fast ebcoming the man in munich dortmund have been up and down thus far , laying an egg at home to leverkusen , and then flying high away from home stuttgart .
in mario goetze , they 've unearthed another young german gem and shinji kagawa -lrb- bought for 350,000 euros - $ 446,000 -rrb- is surely the steal of the season .
wolfsburg were unlucky to lose on opening night to bayern , but just plain blew it against mainz , surrendering a three goal lead to lose 4-3 .
taking into account the injured arne friedrich 's continuing absence from the center of defense and a knock that might keep creative maestro diego out of the starting line-up , i ca n't see wolfsburg getting a result in dortmund .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 hamburg - nuremberg hsv 's ruud van nistelrooy has been chewing up bundesliga defenses , notching three goals in his first two games .
nuremberg , meanwhile , just eked out a draw at gladbach and wilted to defeat at home to lowly freiburg .
hamburg should win at a canter .
prediction : hamburg 3-1 borussia moenchengladbach - eintracht frankfurt a tough one to call , this .
if gladbach are half the side they were in their 6-3 demolition of leverkusen in week two , it 's not a contest .
then again , if they revert to their ordinary form , eintracht - who were unfortunate to go down in week one to hanover before being steamrolled by hamburg in week two - have the horses to get a draw , or even win .
home advantage and frankfurt 's injury worries in defense -lrb- vasoski is out , chris is day-to-day -rrb- should tip this for the foals .
prediction : gladbach 2-1 freiburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : van the man is getting his first taste of the millerntor stadium in any derby , observers are meant to " throw out the record books . "
so i will .
despite freiburg having picked up three points to stuttgart 's none so far this season , i reckon baden-wuerttemburg 's big boys just have too much quality to keep on stinking out stadiums every week .
new signing mauro camoranesi will steady the ship in midfield , while cacau will have a big game against a suspect freiburg back line .
prediction : stuttgart 3-1 hanover 96 - bayer leverkusen among the sides with six points after two match days , the reds are surely the most surprising .
but their results have been convincing - they fought eintracht to a stalemate before snatching a late win , and played schalke off the park .
much of this comes down to good transfer dealing which has brought much-needed quality .
emanuel pogatetz and mohamed abdelloue were inexpensive and have done the business , and i expect damarcus beasley -lrb- brought in on a free transfer -rrb- to do the same .
the only trouble is , this week they host leverkusen , who are just too fast up front for their aging defense .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 bayern munich - werder bremen per mertesacker 's injury in germany 's win over azerbaijan this week came at precisely the wrong moment for werder - just in time to weaken its back line for one of its sternest tests of the season in munich .
mikael silvestre , who bremen picked up ahead of the transfer deadline and will now have to throw into the center of defense , will probably get torched by the likes of thomas mueller , ivica olic , and franck ribery .
bremen 's only chance will be to get big games out of new boys wesley and marko arnautovic - which they may well do .
prediction : bayern 4-2 sunday , september 12 mainz - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you hear that lakic ?
dw sports says you 're due to cool off a shock table-topping clash with both sides on six points , this game is likely to see one of the two participants unmasked as a pretender for top-half status .
i see kaiserslautern as the likelier candidate .
the red devils are very solid at the back , but i do n't trust their on-fire hitman srdan lakic -lrb- three goals in two matches -rrb- to stay ablaze much longer .
mainz , on the other hand , have another year of top-flight experience under their collective belt and earned several stripes with their four-goal fight back in wolfsburg in week two .
prediction : mainz 2-1 cologne - st. pauli these two sets of supporters have a " fan friendship " - an odd german custom wherein two clubs ' ultras agree , over a period of years , to get along rather than taunt each other .
with that in mind , as well as each club 's fans ' reputation for liking a drink or four , this game ought to have a party atmosphere .
the teams may well spoil it .
st. pauli 's hell-for leather approach can be entertaining , but is low on ball skill .
and the more defensive-minded cologne , more often than not , makes for putrid viewing .
expect a draw .

but still we rise .
friday , september 10 hoffenheim - schalke the footballing playthings of sap billionaire dietmar hopp have burst into the new season at full stride , dispatching bremen at home and handling pauli away .
vedad ibisisevic is back in great form up front and ghana 's world cup run this summer appears to have done defender isaac vorsah a world of good .
the winless schalke are … a work in progress , at best .
but there is reason for hope .
benedikt hoewedes is back from suspension , which will help shore up their creaky back line , and raul no longer has a donkey named edu for his strike partner - rather he 'll have a face familiar to him from madrid in klaas-jan huntelaar .
i like them to snatch a point .
prediction : 1-1 saturday , september 11 borussia dortmund - wolfsburg bildunterschrift : mueller is fast ebcoming the man in munich dortmund have been up and down thus far , laying an egg at home to leverkusen , and then flying high away from home stuttgart .
in mario goetze , they 've unearthed another young german gem and shinji kagawa -lrb- bought for 350,000 euros - $ 446,000 -rrb- is surely the steal of the season .
wolfsburg were unlucky to lose on opening night to bayern , but just plain blew it against mainz , surrendering a three goal lead to lose 4-3 .
taking into account the injured arne friedrich 's continuing absence from the center of defense and a knock that might keep creative maestro diego out of the starting line-up , i ca n't see wolfsburg getting a result in dortmund .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 hamburg - nuremberg hsv 's ruud van nistelrooy has been chewing up bundesliga defenses , notching three goals in his first two games .
nuremberg , meanwhile , just eked out a draw at gladbach and wilted to defeat at home to lowly freiburg .
hamburg should win at a canter .
prediction : hamburg 3-1 borussia moenchengladbach - eintracht frankfurt a tough one to call , this .
if gladbach are half the side they were in their 6-3 demolition of leverkusen in week two , it 's not a contest .
then again , if they revert to their ordinary form , eintracht - who were unfortunate to go down in week one to hanover before being steamrolled by hamburg in week two - have the horses to get a draw , or even win .
home advantage and frankfurt 's injury worries in defense -lrb- vasoski is out , chris is day-to-day -rrb- should tip this for the foals .
prediction : gladbach 2-1 freiburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : van the man is getting his first taste of the millerntor stadium in any derby , observers are meant to " throw out the record books . "
so i will .
despite freiburg having picked up three points to stuttgart 's none so far this season , i reckon baden-wuerttemburg 's big boys just have too much quality to keep on stinking out stadiums every week .
new signing mauro camoranesi will steady the ship in midfield , while cacau will have a big game against a suspect freiburg back line .
prediction : stuttgart 3-1 hanover 96 - bayer leverkusen among the sides with six points after two match days , the reds are surely the most surprising .
but their results have been convincing - they fought eintracht to a stalemate before snatching a late win , and played schalke off the park .
much of this comes down to good transfer dealing which has brought much-needed quality .
emanuel pogatetz and mohamed abdelloue were inexpensive and have done the business , and i expect damarcus beasley -lrb- brought in on a free transfer -rrb- to do the same .
the only trouble is , this week they host leverkusen , who are just too fast up front for their aging defense .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 bayern munich - werder bremen per mertesacker 's injury in germany 's win over azerbaijan this week came at precisely the wrong moment for werder - just in time to weaken its back line for one of its sternest tests of the season in munich .
mikael silvestre , who bremen picked up ahead of the transfer deadline and will now have to throw into the center of defense , will probably get torched by the likes of thomas mueller , ivica olic , and franck ribery .
bremen 's only chance will be to get big games out of new boys wesley and marko arnautovic - which they may well do .
prediction : bayern 4-2 sunday , september 12 mainz - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you hear that lakic ?
dw sports says you 're due to cool off a shock table-topping clash with both sides on six points , this game is likely to see one of the two participants unmasked as a pretender for top-half status .
i see kaiserslautern as the likelier candidate .
the red devils are very solid at the back , but i do n't trust their on-fire hitman srdan lakic -lrb- three goals in two matches -rrb- to stay ablaze much longer .
mainz , on the other hand , have another year of top-flight experience under their collective belt and earned several stripes with their four-goal fight back in wolfsburg in week two .
prediction : mainz 2-1 cologne - st. pauli these two sets of supporters have a " fan friendship " - an odd german custom wherein two clubs ' ultras agree , over a period of years , to get along rather than taunt each other .
with that in mind , as well as each club 's fans ' reputation for liking a drink or four , this game ought to have a party atmosphere .
the teams may well spoil it .
st. pauli 's hell-for leather approach can be entertaining , but is low on ball skill .
and the more defensive-minded cologne , more often than not , makes for putrid viewing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.09.2010 spain slashes solar energy subsidies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels produce about 3 percent of spain 's energy as german alternative energy firms lament berlin 's decision to continue using nuclear power , spain is planning to cut solar subsidies .
critics say madrid is strangling investment in renewables - and the wider economy . about five years ago , spanish farmers realized they could make more money harvesting the sun than they could planting crops .
on the dusty plains of castilla y leon , for instance , fields of sunflowers gave way to solar panels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate activists have put their own form of pressure on spain 's government that growth was spurred by alternative electricity subsidies that are now endangered .
industry minister miguel sebastian has announced subsidies for new , ground-based solar parks will be cut by 45 percent .
state support for rooftop installations will fall by 25 percent , while smaller installations will see cuts of 5 percent .
eduardo collado , technical director at the photovoltaic industry association -lrb- asif -rrb- , described the plan as short-sighted .
by 2020 , renewable energy could be less expensive than conventional and nuclear power , which still enjoys annual subsidies worth billions of euros , he said .
“ it 's very bad news , " he told deutsche welle .
" -lrb- spanish leaders -rrb- are in a deep crisis , so they have to save money where they can , but they are not taking account of the investments that are the future of spain 's energy industry .
it is n't spending , it 's investment .
you have to look 10 or 15 years ahead … if the price of oil goes up , the cost of renewables will be nothing in comparison . "
sector not self-sufficient spain 's government says the cuts reflect improved efficiency in solar technologies , but the sector is not competitive yet .
it contributed 1.2 billion euros towards country 's gdp in 2008 and collected 3 billion euros worth of subsidies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when resources become scarce , solar energy will be invaluable , advocates say however , the solar sector is innovative and dynamic , and in a matter of years has grown rapidly to account for 3 percent of spain 's energy production .
with news of the cuts , anger and frustration has echoed across its trade associations .
carlos navarro , the founder of siliken , a solar panel manufacturer that employs 1,000 people , said the subsidy rollback is the latest in a long line of errors .
the looming cuts have put 10 billion euros worth of projects on hold and lines of credit are now nearly impossible to obtain from banks , he said .
" we have always felt that spain was not so consistent in the program of photovoltaic development , " he told deutsche welle .
" almost every year we have had changes in the policy and the targets and the volumes . "
" the real problem is not the question of the tariff , it 's the uncertainty they are constantly sending to the markets – especially the financial institutions – about the security of their investment … the market is completely stopped right now . "
jobs lost according to asif , the lack of clarity over tariffs has led to significant job losses .
the sector employed 40,000 people in 2008 , when a record-breaking 3,000 megawatts of solar capacity were installed .
now that new investments have ground to a halt , the 2010 workforce consists of just 13,500 workers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's austerity measures have drawn widespread protest many in the industry blame big conventional energy companies for pressuring the government to defend them against competition from renewable energy , which has forced conventional power stations to reduce output .
carlos navarro said big energy companies pushed the government towards austerity measures in the photovoltaic sector because its fragmented composition made it an easy target .
" the problem is that the companies are not running the plants as much as they were before , " he said .
" demand has been cut 5 percent because of the crisis , so they are making a lot of noise and they are trying to find enemies .
well , photovoltaics is a very good enemy because the portfolio of owners is very spread out .
there are no big companies with an interest in photovoltaic energy . "

back to first page back 2/2 no head to cut bildunterschrift : even the use of force against the southern movement is not achieving the desired outcome since 2007 the southern movement has grown steadily .
according to observers it has no unified leadership .
" there is no central nervous system , which , paradoxically , has made it a lot more formidable , as there is no head to cut , " said abdul-ghani aryani , a sanaa based political analyst .
the movement includes several political factions , most importantly the former ruling party of south yemen , the yemeni socialist party -lrb- ysp -rrb- .
while many consider ali salem al-beidh , who served as vice president of yemen until he was forced into exile in germany , the champion of their cause , some observers argue he is only a nominal figurehead .
instead , they point to exiled haydar al-attas , former prime minister , as the most effective leader and former south yemen president ali nasser muhammad , who fled in 1986 .
while the movement 's support base is mainly from the south , members of the islah party , the northern-based islamist opposition party , have also expressed backing for the movement .
sympathy for the movement is even found among members of the president 's ruling party , the general people 's congress -lrb- gpc -rrb- .
one former staunch supporter of president saleh and the gpc , tareq al-fadhli , joined the movement in 2009 .
a month later nasser al-wahayshi , leader of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- announced his support for the movement .
whilst the defection by al-fadhli , a former mujahedeen who allegedly fought alongside osama bin laden in afghanistan and later against the ysp in the early 1990 's was interpreted by some as the southern movement developing ties with al qaeda , many see it as a deepening divide between the north and south .
" he was obviously disgruntled by the marginalization he and other southerners suffer from for the benefit of northern tribal elite , " said abdul-ghani aryani .
neither evidence nor shared ideology has been found to link the southern movement to al qaeda .
although al-fadhli has stated that he supports an independent southern state , led by former ysp leader ali salem al-beidh , he has recently been sidelined in the movement .
southern tribes such as the large balharis tribe of shebwa and the bakazim of abyan have also declared their solidarity with the movement .
cracking down as the southern movement has grown the government in sanaa has retorted with violence and repression .
in an august 2010 report the human rights organisation amnesty international accused yemeni authorities of sacrificing human rights in the name of security .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is resorting to media repression to quell the unrest the report argued that the government " has increasingly resorted to unlawful means , including enforced disappearances , unlawful killings , arbitrary detention and excessive use of force . "
at the same time newspapers have been closed down , journalists , editors and proprietors detained , held incommunicado , ill-treated and jailed on spurious charges after unfair trials , said amnesty .
" journalists are in danger of arbitrary arrest by the state and are subjected to beatings and charges of causing riots in the streets , " said abdul-khaliq al-hout , who has worked for al-diyar newspaper in aden for six years .
al-hout said writing about the southern movement is a " complex " issue .
" i can feel the lack of freedom of expression and of providing information and facts to the public . "
restrictive laws and the repressive practices of security forces and special courts have undermined freedom of expression in yemen , though it is enshrined in the constitution .
the press and publications law of 1990 and the establishment of the specialized press and publications court in may 2009 have made it possible for the authorities to imprison " anyone who incites -lsb- -rsb- unrest . " like many other journalists al-hout was detained after writing an article about the southern movement .
after two months in prison human rights watch helped to secure his release .
" there is a growing fear among journalists of the press court where journalists are treated as criminals , " he said .
a revolution in the making ?
since the beginning of 2009 , more than 66 people have been killed in or near demonstrations and 251 have been wounded .
fifteen members of the security forces have also been killed , according to media reports .
analysts warn that as violence by government forces increases , so too does the call for independence .
while some of their leaders have called for secession from the north , ysp , according to analysts , would consider federalism as would pro-southern movement elements within the islah party .
members within the gpc have called for a local government in the south .
in response , on 22 may , the 20th anniversary of yemen 's unification , president saleh called for a revival of national dialogue and offered to form a national unity government .
according to abdel karim aryani , a long-time adviser to the president , decentralization in the north and local rule for the south is being discussed .
" this is what they -lsb- the southern movement -rsb- are asking for , " he said .
however , the more radical calls for independence now come from the general population of the south who bear the brunt of the government 's crack down .
the president 's olive branch was greeted with scepticism within the movement which says it has been let down too many times before .
" it will not change anything .
it will be written in pencil so it can be easily erased , " said former brigadier al-qawi .
" we have lost confidence in the government ; their promises are always broken . "
according to human rights lawyer mohammed al-saqqaf , local rule under a decentralised north may be too little too late : " protesters repeat the same song they used to sing during the british rule : ‘ out of our country imperialism , " ' he said .
" the depth of grievance in the south is such that they are unlikely to go away , " said a sanaa-based analyst , who did not want his name published .
with no central command the southern movement remains a fluid force .
however , the analyst warned that if the cycle of violence in the south continues , what has until now been a disparate protest movement could merge and harden into an organized rebellion , tipping a low intensity conflict over into full-blown civil war .
" the emergence of a unified leadership is imminent , as soon as they turn to fully fledged violence , which is equally imminent . "

back to first page back 2/2 no head to cut bildunterschrift : even the use of force against the southern movement is not achieving the desired outcome since 2007 the southern movement has grown steadily .
according to observers it has no unified leadership .
" there is no central nervous system , which , paradoxically , has made it a lot more formidable , as there is no head to cut , " said abdul-ghani aryani , a sanaa based political analyst .
the movement includes several political factions , most importantly the former ruling party of south yemen , the yemeni socialist party -lrb- ysp -rrb- .
while many consider ali salem al-beidh , who served as vice president of yemen until he was forced into exile in germany , the champion of their cause , some observers argue he is only a nominal figurehead .
instead , they point to exiled haydar al-attas , former prime minister , as the most effective leader and former south yemen president ali nasser muhammad , who fled in 1986 .
while the movement 's support base is mainly from the south , members of the islah party , the northern-based islamist opposition party , have also expressed backing for the movement .
sympathy for the movement is even found among members of the president 's ruling party , the general people 's congress -lrb- gpc -rrb- .
one former staunch supporter of president saleh and the gpc , tareq al-fadhli , joined the movement in 2009 .
a month later nasser al-wahayshi , leader of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- announced his support for the movement .
whilst the defection by al-fadhli , a former mujahedeen who allegedly fought alongside osama bin laden in afghanistan and later against the ysp in the early 1990 's was interpreted by some as the southern movement developing ties with al qaeda , many see it as a deepening divide between the north and south .
" he was obviously disgruntled by the marginalization he and other southerners suffer from for the benefit of northern tribal elite , " said abdul-ghani aryani .
neither evidence nor shared ideology has been found to link the southern movement to al qaeda .
although al-fadhli has stated that he supports an independent southern state , led by former ysp leader ali salem al-beidh , he has recently been sidelined in the movement .
southern tribes such as the large balharis tribe of shebwa and the bakazim of abyan have also declared their solidarity with the movement .
cracking down as the southern movement has grown the government in sanaa has retorted with violence and repression .
in an august 2010 report the human rights organisation amnesty international accused yemeni authorities of sacrificing human rights in the name of security .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is resorting to media repression to quell the unrest the report argued that the government " has increasingly resorted to unlawful means , including enforced disappearances , unlawful killings , arbitrary detention and excessive use of force . "
at the same time newspapers have been closed down , journalists , editors and proprietors detained , held incommunicado , ill-treated and jailed on spurious charges after unfair trials , said amnesty .
" journalists are in danger of arbitrary arrest by the state and are subjected to beatings and charges of causing riots in the streets , " said abdul-khaliq al-hout , who has worked for al-diyar newspaper in aden for six years .
al-hout said writing about the southern movement is a " complex " issue .
" i can feel the lack of freedom of expression and of providing information and facts to the public . "
restrictive laws and the repressive practices of security forces and special courts have undermined freedom of expression in yemen , though it is enshrined in the constitution .
the press and publications law of 1990 and the establishment of the specialized press and publications court in may 2009 have made it possible for the authorities to imprison " anyone who incites -lsb- -rsb- unrest .

daily power cuts leave residents sweating through dark nights .
in a region where resentment of the government in the north has been festering for a decade , such daily indignities are enough to spark fury in the people .
earlier this week thousands took to the streets in protest .
car tyres were burned , property vandalised and gun shots fired .
police were pelted with stones .
according to yemeni officials this came after members of the opposition group known as the southern movement , some of whose factions call for independence from northern yemen , ambushed a military patrol and wounded three soldiers .
the attack followed shortly on from the twice attempted assassination of an army brigade commander by members of the southern movement the week earlier .
in south yemen scenes like these repeat themselves at increasingly shorter intervals .

to the north , a recent peace agreement quelling six years of rebellion by the zaidi shia houthi clan , who fight a government they accuse of marginalising them politically as well as economically , has been breaking down , threatening a return to war .
in the unruly tribal strongholds of east yemen saleh 's troops face an al qaeda branch well integrated into the local community and whose failed attempt to bring down a us airliner last christmas day showed they are a menace not just to yemen , but to international security as well .
however , to the government in sanaa , no conflict is more serious than the growing power of the southern movement , whose call for independence from the north threatens the territorial integrity of the state .
economic injustices the key grievance levelled by the southern movement against president saleh is economic : southerners complain bitterly that despite their small numbers , just 3.5 million compared to 20 million living in the north , and despite the south being home to the majority of yemen 's oil and gas fields -lrb- which account for 75 percent of the government 's revenue -rrb- the south has not witnessed anything like the economic growth and development of the north , limited though that is .
the movement accuses the president of favoritism of northerners , working through tribal patronage networks from which southerners are largely excluded , of arbitrary land confiscation and political disenfranchisement .
the grievances date back to the unification between north and south yemen in 1990 , which was viewed by many southern leaders as failed .
they were politically outnumbered by their northern colleagues , the two armies were never integrated and assassinations of southern leaders created a deep mistrust of the north .
after elections in 1993 , leaders of former south yemen called for a new federal constitutional system which would decentralize power .
instead , a year later a brief but bloody civil war erupted with northern troops occupying the south .
in the wake of the victory of north over south , president saleh amended the constitution , removing institutions of joint north-south rule and granting himself power to rule by decree .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yemeni army is coming under increasing attacks from opposition rebels since then , a growing sense injustice has simmered in the south , but it was not until 2007 that the southern movement emerged , coalescing around a group of former south yemen army officers , part of a group of 20,000 military personnel forced into early retirement after the 1994 war , who rose up after their pensions were not paid .

as the military crackdown against the movement intensifies , protests have turned violent . as temperatures soar above 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in aden , the great port city of south yemen , homes become airless .
daily power cuts leave residents sweating through dark nights .
in a region where resentment of the government in the north has been festering for a decade , such daily indignities are enough to spark fury in the people .
earlier this week thousands took to the streets in protest .
car tyres were burned , property vandalised and gun shots fired .
police were pelted with stones .
according to yemeni officials this came after members of the opposition group known as the southern movement , some of whose factions call for independence from northern yemen , ambushed a military patrol and wounded three soldiers .
the attack followed shortly on from the twice attempted assassination of an army brigade commander by members of the southern movement the week earlier .
in south yemen scenes like these repeat themselves at increasingly shorter intervals .
besieged by conflicts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen 's president ali abdullah saleh is facing growing unrest from his palace in the mountain capital of sanaa president ali abdullah saleh seems besieged by conflicts .
to the north , a recent peace agreement quelling six years of rebellion by the zaidi shia houthi clan , who fight a government they accuse of marginalising them politically as well as economically , has been breaking down , threatening a return to war .
in the unruly tribal strongholds of east yemen saleh 's troops face an al qaeda branch well integrated into the local community and whose failed attempt to bring down a us airliner last christmas day showed they are a menace not just to yemen , but to international security as well .
however , to the government in sanaa , no conflict is more serious than the growing power of the southern movement , whose call for independence from the north threatens the territorial integrity of the state .
economic injustices the key grievance levelled by the southern movement against president saleh is economic : southerners complain bitterly that despite their small numbers , just 3.5 million compared to 20 million living in the north , and despite the south being home to the majority of yemen 's oil and gas fields -lrb- which account for 75 percent of the government 's revenue -rrb- the south has not witnessed anything like the economic growth and development of the north , limited though that is .
the movement accuses the president of favoritism of northerners , working through tribal patronage networks from which southerners are largely excluded , of arbitrary land confiscation and political disenfranchisement .
the grievances date back to the unification between north and south yemen in 1990 , which was viewed by many southern leaders as failed .
they were politically outnumbered by their northern colleagues , the two armies were never integrated and assassinations of southern leaders created a deep mistrust of the north .
after elections in 1993 , leaders of former south yemen called for a new federal constitutional system which would decentralize power .
instead , a year later a brief but bloody civil war erupted with northern troops occupying the south .
in the wake of the victory of north over south , president saleh amended the constitution , removing institutions of joint north-south rule and granting himself power to rule by decree .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yemeni army is coming under increasing attacks from opposition rebels since then , a growing sense injustice has simmered in the south , but it was not until 2007 that the southern movement emerged , coalescing around a group of former south yemen army officers , part of a group of 20,000 military personnel forced into early retirement after the 1994 war , who rose up after their pensions were not paid .
former brigadier nasser al-qawi from the aviation brigade of al-anad air base was one of those officers and is today one of the movement 's leaders .
" the authorities ' refusal to address the issues of the south , the looting of its resources for the benefit of the ruling family and the corruption have led -lsb- the south -rsb- to demand secession from the north , " said al-qawi in an interview .
he insisted that southern movement demonstrations had always been peaceful , but blamed sanaa for a violent response .
" it seems the authorities want to drag us towards violence to find a justification to suppress the movement . " " the language of violence and repression used against the people of the south reflects the failure and inability of the government to provide solutions . -lsb- ... -rsb-
for southerners the dream faded away and turned into a nightmare .
people feel the south is under occupation by the north . "

in sweden , the iranian ambassador was summoned to stockholm to assert the government 's concerns . european union officials welcomed iran 's decision to suspend the stoning sentence on a woman charged with adultery , but said that it all charges should now be dropped against her .
sakineh mohammadi ashtiani , a 43-year-old mother of two has been convicted of adultery in iran and faced a sentence of death by stoning .
ashtiani 's case has drawn criticism from much of the international community .
iran 's foreign ministry announced the decision to suspend the sentence in a statement released on wednesday .
the eu 's high representative for foreign affairs , catherine ashton , described it as " a step in the right direction . "
however it is unclear whether ashtiani still faces the death penalty , or if the sentence could be applied at a later date .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ashtiani 's defense lawyer has fled to europe earlier on wednesday , the european parliament increased pressure on iran to drop ashtiani 's sentence by passing a resolution condemning it .
the legislative resolution condemning tehran won by a vote of 658-to-1 in strasbourg .
' disgusting form of punishment ' in sweden , the iranian ambassador was summoned to stockholm over the ashtiani case .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt told swedish public radio that the government condemned the sentence .
" we are against capital punishment in any case , but stoning is a particularly disgusting form of capital punishment , and iran should realise that this is completely unacceptable , " bildt said .
the minister argued that the international uproar over the case had had " influence . "
" if we had not acted as we have over these past months , she would have presumably been killed by stoning by now , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.09.2010 spain slashes solar energy subsidies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels produce about 3 percent of spain 's energy as german alternative energy firms lament berlin 's decision to continue using nuclear power , spain is planning to cut solar subsidies .
critics say madrid is strangling investment in renewables - and the wider economy . about five years ago , spanish farmers realized they could make more money harvesting the sun than they could planting crops .
on the dusty plains of castilla y leon , for instance , fields of sunflowers gave way to solar panels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate activists have put their own form of pressure on spain 's government that growth was spurred by alternative electricity subsidies that are now endangered .
industry minister miguel sebastian has announced subsidies for new , ground-based solar parks will be cut by 45 percent .
state support for rooftop installations will fall by 25 percent , while smaller installations will see cuts of 5 percent .
eduardo collado , technical director at the photovoltaic industry association -lrb- asif -rrb- , described the plan as short-sighted .
by 2020 , renewable energy could be less expensive than conventional and nuclear power , which still enjoys annual subsidies worth billions of euros , he said .
“ it 's very bad news , " he told deutsche welle .
" -lrb- spanish leaders -rrb- are in a deep crisis , so they have to save money where they can , but they are not taking account of the investments that are the future of spain 's energy industry .
it is n't spending , it 's investment .
you have to look 10 or 15 years ahead … if the price of oil goes up , the cost of renewables will be nothing in comparison . "
sector not self-sufficient spain 's government says the cuts reflect improved efficiency in solar technologies , but the sector is not competitive yet .
it contributed 1.2 billion euros towards country 's gdp in 2008 and collected 3 billion euros worth of subsidies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when resources become scarce , solar energy will be invaluable , advocates say however , the solar sector is innovative and dynamic , and in a matter of years has grown rapidly to account for 3 percent of spain 's energy production .
with news of the cuts , anger and frustration has echoed across its trade associations .
carlos navarro , the founder of siliken , a solar panel manufacturer that employs 1,000 people , said the subsidy rollback is the latest in a long line of errors .
the looming cuts have put 10 billion euros worth of projects on hold and lines of credit are now nearly impossible to obtain from banks , he said .
" we have always felt that spain was not so consistent in the program of photovoltaic development , " he told deutsche welle .
" almost every year we have had changes in the policy and the targets and the volumes . "
" the real problem is not the question of the tariff , it 's the uncertainty they are constantly sending to the markets – especially the financial institutions – about the security of their investment … the market is completely stopped right now . "
jobs lost according to asif , the lack of clarity over tariffs has led to significant job losses .
the sector employed 40,000 people in 2008 , when a record-breaking 3,000 megawatts of solar capacity were installed .
now that new investments have ground to a halt , the 2010 workforce consists of just 13,500 workers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's austerity measures have drawn widespread protest many in the industry blame big conventional energy companies for pressuring the government to defend them against competition from renewable energy , which has forced conventional power stations to reduce output .
carlos navarro said big energy companies pushed the government towards austerity measures in the photovoltaic sector because its fragmented composition made it an easy target .
" the problem is that the companies are not running the plants as much as they were before , " he said .
" demand has been cut 5 percent because of the crisis , so they are making a lot of noise and they are trying to find enemies .
well , photovoltaics is a very good enemy because the portfolio of owners is very spread out .
there are no big companies with an interest in photovoltaic energy . "

in sweden , the iranian ambassador was summoned to stockholm to assert the government 's concerns . european union officials welcomed iran 's decision to suspend the stoning sentence on a woman charged with adultery , but said that it all charges should now be dropped against her .
sakineh mohammadi ashtiani , a 43-year-old mother of two has been convicted of adultery in iran and faced a sentence of death by stoning .
ashtiani 's case has drawn criticism from much of the international community .
iran 's foreign ministry announced the decision to suspend the sentence in a statement released on wednesday .
the eu 's high representative for foreign affairs , catherine ashton , described it as " a step in the right direction . "
however it is unclear whether ashtiani still faces the death penalty , or if the sentence could be applied at a later date .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ashtiani 's defense lawyer has fled to europe earlier on wednesday , the european parliament increased pressure on iran to drop ashtiani 's sentence by passing a resolution condemning it .
the legislative resolution condemning tehran won by a vote of 658-to-1 in strasbourg .
' disgusting form of punishment ' in sweden , the iranian ambassador was summoned to stockholm over the ashtiani case .
swedish foreign minister carl bildt told swedish public radio that the government condemned the sentence .
" we are against capital punishment in any case , but stoning is a particularly disgusting form of capital punishment , and iran should realise that this is completely unacceptable , " bildt said .
the minister argued that the international uproar over the case had had " influence . "
" if we had not acted as we have over these past months , she would have presumably been killed by stoning by now , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 09.09.2010 beethoven 's ' blood , sweat and tears ' keep audiences coming back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's music and biography fascinate all generations composer ludwig van beethoven moved the masses with his music and still does today .
as the 2010 beethovenfest gets underway , dw asks what is it about the composer that draws people back to his works decade after decade . skepticism is in order when it comes to claims like " beethoven has been performed more than any other composer ! "
reliable statistics on the issue would be nearly impossible to assemble .
but those who see the great composer as one of the most influential musicians in the world - both then and today - are certainly not far from the truth .
" even today , beethoven remains of contemporary interest across the world , " michael ladenburger , director and curator of the beethoven house museum in bonn , told deutsche welle .
" beethoven 's music has n't been reduced to just a cultural artefact that people occasionally listen to when they 're in a certain mood .
instead , there are people across all societies who would say , ' this music enriches my life in a very personal and direct way .
in a sense , beethoven is necessary for my life . " '
beethoven worldwide there 's no shortage of examples of the composer 's enduring power : in the central african city of kinshasa , a group of amateur musicians founded the region 's first symphony orchestra and performed beethoven .
the composer is also a fixed part of the curriculum in venezuela 's " el sistema " youth program for music education .
even the prisoners in gulags and concentration camps during world war ii banded together and played beethoven 's works as a way to help cope with their anguish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's 2010 beethovenfest showcases international interest in the master composer but why does his music inspire such an impassioned response ?
" it 's partly due to the fact that people know beethoven 's life - the health problems , his deafness , the bad twists of fate and his struggle against all of those things , " said ladenburger .
but that 's not all : " even more than most composers , beethoven exerted an enormous amount of blood , sweat and tears to find the ideal form for his works . "
timeless moral message beethoven composed works for specific occasions or events , but many of his works also give expression to a moral or ethical ideal , and his fans and followers sense that .
that may help explain why beethoven enthusiasts get together and perform his pieces again and again .
but ladenburger does n't support every tradition when it comes to performing beethoven 's compositions .
" it 's regrettable that the ninth symphony is performed so much and often so thoughtlessly .
beethoven would have rolled over in his grave if he knew that people performed the ninth and other works for pleasure , with total disregard for the message behind them . "
millionaire and a hobby fisherman ?
the beethoven house in bonn is world renowned as a place to get to know the composer better .
and ever since the museum put its collection online , more questions about the master musician have come in than ever .
in the beethoven forum , people can ask whatever is on their mind , like whether beethoven liked to fish -lrb- he did n't -rrb- and how he might experience life today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , royalties could save beethoven from the financial problems he once faced according to michael ladenburger , beethoven himself reflected deeply on the question of dealing with fame and being a public figure .
" he asked himself what it meant for him to be an extraordinarily gifted person , and what obligations and practical consequences that brings . "
but ladenburger has reason to believe beethoven would have been able to get by in contemporary society , " and not just because he would n't have to subsist on occasional payments from his publishers anymore .
instead , he 'd be a millionaire several times over from royalties ! "
beethoven makes money for bonn hopefully beethoven would n't be against his hometown profiting today from the heritage of its famous son - both financially and in terms of image .
bonn 's mayor juergen nimptsch confirmed that beethoven brings hefty returns .
" it 's more or less the case that for every euro we invest , three to four come back into the region and stay here in bonn . "
top classical musicians from all over the world are scheduled to perform at the 2010 beethovenfest bonn , including pianist helene grimaud , cellist sol gabetta , conductor kent nagano and many others .
the festival runs from september 10 - october 9 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when resources become scarce , solar energy will be invaluable , advocates say however , the solar sector is innovative and dynamic , and in a matter of years has grown rapidly to account for 3 percent of spain 's energy production .
with news of the cuts , anger and frustration has echoed across its trade associations .
carlos navarro , the founder of siliken , a solar panel manufacturer that employs 1,000 people , said the subsidy rollback is the latest in a long line of errors .
the looming cuts have put 10 billion euros worth of projects on hold and lines of credit are now nearly impossible to obtain from banks , he said .
" we have always felt that spain was not so consistent in the program of photovoltaic development , " he told deutsche welle .
" almost every year we have had changes in the policy and the targets and the volumes . "
" the real problem is not the question of the tariff , it 's the uncertainty they are constantly sending to the markets – especially the financial institutions – about the security of their investment … the market is completely stopped right now . "
jobs lost according to asif , the lack of clarity over tariffs has led to significant job losses .
the sector employed 40,000 people in 2008 , when a record-breaking 3,000 megawatts of solar capacity were installed .
now that new investments have ground to a halt , the 2010 workforce consists of just 13,500 workers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's austerity measures have drawn widespread protest many in the industry blame big conventional energy companies for pressuring the government to defend them against competition from renewable energy , which has forced conventional power stations to reduce output .
carlos navarro said big energy companies pushed the government towards austerity measures in the photovoltaic sector because its fragmented composition made it an easy target .
" the problem is that the companies are not running the plants as much as they were before , " he said .
" demand has been cut 5 percent because of the crisis , so they are making a lot of noise and they are trying to find enemies .
well , photovoltaics is a very good enemy because the portfolio of owners is very spread out .
there are no big companies with an interest in photovoltaic energy . "

wulff 's swiss counterpart , doris leuthard , said the two countries were determined to resolve their differences in the spiirt of good neighbors .

as the 2010 beethovenfest gets underway , dw asks what is it about the composer that draws people back to his works decade after decade . skepticism is in order when it comes to claims like " beethoven has been performed more than any other composer ! "
reliable statistics on the issue would be nearly impossible to assemble .
but those who see the great composer as one of the most influential musicians in the world - both then and today - are certainly not far from the truth .
" even today , beethoven remains of contemporary interest across the world , " michael ladenburger , director and curator of the beethoven house museum in bonn , told deutsche welle .
" beethoven 's music has n't been reduced to just a cultural artefact that people occasionally listen to when they 're in a certain mood .
instead , there are people across all societies who would say , ' this music enriches my life in a very personal and direct way .
in a sense , beethoven is necessary for my life . " '
beethoven worldwide there 's no shortage of examples of the composer 's enduring power : in the central african city of kinshasa , a group of amateur musicians founded the region 's first symphony orchestra and performed beethoven .
the composer is also a fixed part of the curriculum in venezuela 's " el sistema " youth program for music education .
even the prisoners in gulags and concentration camps during world war ii banded together and played beethoven 's works as a way to help cope with their anguish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's 2010 beethovenfest showcases international interest in the master composer but why does his music inspire such an impassioned response ?
" it 's partly due to the fact that people know beethoven 's life - the health problems , his deafness , the bad twists of fate and his struggle against all of those things , " said ladenburger .
but that 's not all : " even more than most composers , beethoven exerted an enormous amount of blood , sweat and tears to find the ideal form for his works . "
timeless moral message beethoven composed works for specific occasions or events , but many of his works also give expression to a moral or ethical ideal , and his fans and followers sense that .
that may help explain why beethoven enthusiasts get together and perform his pieces again and again .
but ladenburger does n't support every tradition when it comes to performing beethoven 's compositions .
" it 's regrettable that the ninth symphony is performed so much and often so thoughtlessly .
beethoven would have rolled over in his grave if he knew that people performed the ninth and other works for pleasure , with total disregard for the message behind them . "
millionaire and a hobby fisherman ?
the beethoven house in bonn is world renowned as a place to get to know the composer better .
and ever since the museum put its collection online , more questions about the master musician have come in than ever .
in the beethoven forum , people can ask whatever is on their mind , like whether beethoven liked to fish -lrb- he did n't -rrb- and how he might experience life today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , royalties could save beethoven from the financial problems he once faced according to michael ladenburger , beethoven himself reflected deeply on the question of dealing with fame and being a public figure .
" he asked himself what it meant for him to be an extraordinarily gifted person , and what obligations and practical consequences that brings . "
but ladenburger has reason to believe beethoven would have been able to get by in contemporary society , " and not just because he would n't have to subsist on occasional payments from his publishers anymore .
instead , he 'd be a millionaire several times over from royalties ! "
beethoven makes money for bonn hopefully beethoven would n't be against his hometown profiting today from the heritage of its famous son - both financially and in terms of image .
bonn 's mayor juergen nimptsch confirmed that beethoven brings hefty returns .
" it 's more or less the case that for every euro we invest , three to four come back into the region and stay here in bonn . "
top classical musicians from all over the world are scheduled to perform at the 2010 beethovenfest bonn , including pianist helene grimaud , cellist sol gabetta , conductor kent nagano and many others .
the festival runs from september 10 - october 9 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.09.2010 spain slashes solar energy subsidies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels produce about 3 percent of spain 's energy as german alternative energy firms lament berlin 's decision to continue using nuclear power , spain is planning to cut solar subsidies .
critics say madrid is strangling investment in renewables - and the wider economy . about five years ago , spanish farmers realized they could make more money harvesting the sun than they could planting crops .
on the dusty plains of castilla y leon , for instance , fields of sunflowers gave way to solar panels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate activists have put their own form of pressure on spain 's government that growth was spurred by alternative electricity subsidies that are now endangered .
industry minister miguel sebastian has announced subsidies for new , ground-based solar parks will be cut by 45 percent .
state support for rooftop installations will fall by 25 percent , while smaller installations will see cuts of 5 percent .
eduardo collado , technical director at the photovoltaic industry association -lrb- asif -rrb- , described the plan as short-sighted .
by 2020 , renewable energy could be less expensive than conventional and nuclear power , which still enjoys annual subsidies worth billions of euros , he said .
“ it 's very bad news , " he told deutsche welle .
" -lrb- spanish leaders -rrb- are in a deep crisis , so they have to save money where they can , but they are not taking account of the investments that are the future of spain 's energy industry .
it is n't spending , it 's investment .
you have to look 10 or 15 years ahead … if the price of oil goes up , the cost of renewables will be nothing in comparison . "
sector not self-sufficient spain 's government says the cuts reflect improved efficiency in solar technologies , but the sector is not competitive yet .
it contributed 1.2 billion euros towards country 's gdp in 2008 and collected 3 billion euros worth of subsidies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when resources become scarce , solar energy will be invaluable , advocates say however , the solar sector is innovative and dynamic , and in a matter of years has grown rapidly to account for 3 percent of spain 's energy production .
with news of the cuts , anger and frustration has echoed across its trade associations .
carlos navarro , the founder of siliken , a solar panel manufacturer that employs 1,000 people , said the subsidy rollback is the latest in a long line of errors .
the looming cuts have put 10 billion euros worth of projects on hold and lines of credit are now nearly impossible to obtain from banks , he said .
" we have always felt that spain was not so consistent in the program of photovoltaic development , " he told deutsche welle .
" almost every year we have had changes in the policy and the targets and the volumes . "
" the real problem is not the question of the tariff , it 's the uncertainty they are constantly sending to the markets – especially the financial institutions – about the security of their investment … the market is completely stopped right now . "
jobs lost according to asif , the lack of clarity over tariffs has led to significant job losses .
the sector employed 40,000 people in 2008 , when a record-breaking 3,000 megawatts of solar capacity were installed .
now that new investments have ground to a halt , the 2010 workforce consists of just 13,500 workers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's austerity measures have drawn widespread protest many in the industry blame big conventional energy companies for pressuring the government to defend them against competition from renewable energy , which has forced conventional power stations to reduce output .
carlos navarro said big energy companies pushed the government towards austerity measures in the photovoltaic sector because its fragmented composition made it an easy target .
" the problem is that the companies are not running the plants as much as they were before , " he said .
" demand has been cut 5 percent because of the crisis , so they are making a lot of noise and they are trying to find enemies .
well , photovoltaics is a very good enemy because the portfolio of owners is very spread out .
there are no big companies with an interest in photovoltaic energy . "

but it was a contemporary form of anti-semitism that got the exhibit off the ground . the project started after four neo-nazis firebombed a synagogue in the northern german town of luebeck on the eve of passover in 1994 , according to mark grellert , who has been creating virtual reconstructions of synagogues at darmstadt technical university since that firebombing both as a student and now professor in the architecture department . " i do n't remember where i heard this about the arson attack , but i think a couple of minutes afterwards and i got the idea , we have to do something against this , " he told deutsche welle . his idea was to virtually reconstruct some of the synagogues that were destroyed on kristallnacht , or the night of the broken glass , on november 10 , 1938 .
that was one of the most heinous attacks against jews , synagogues and jewish businesses in german history . their efforts culminated in an exhibition in bonn in 2000 . that exhibition has now come to the united states for the first time at the holocaust memorial center zekelman family campus in farmington hills , michigan .
the exhibit opened on august 29 and will run through the end of november . back in 1994 , grellert and his team started with three synagogues in frankfurt .
but he said they quickly realized that the project would n't move as quickly as they hoped as it would take them almost one year to finish a single synagogue . getting the plans the first step was to find blueprints or old photographs showing the synagogue 's floor plan then grellert and his team would reach out to people who remembered the original appearance of the synagogue .

while teh us budget deficit pulls the superpower further down the pecking order . germany has moved up the economic league tables to become the fifth most economically competitive country in the world and the highest-ranked eurozone country , according to a yearly study by the world economic forum .
europe 's most populous nation moved up two places since last year , when it was ranked seventh worldwide . " amid concerns about the outlook for the global economy , policymakers must not lose sight of long-term competitiveness fundamentals amid short-term challenges , " said xavier sala-i-martin , co-author of the report and an economics professor at new york 's columbia university . germany forged ahead in the rankings this year because the country 's economy as a whole improved in comparison with other large economies .
it was praised for its infrastructure and sophisticated and productive businesses but was given low marks for its inflexible labor market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's sophisticated industry stimulated economic competitiveness usa falls to fourth germany comes in just behind the usa , which this year dropped two places to fourth place .
the united states was knocked off its top spot last year by switzerland , which remained in first place this year , closely followed by sweden and singapore . although the united states is a clear leader in productivity , innovation and competitiveness , the world 's largest economy has shown growing weaknesses in recent years , the world economic forum said . sala-i-martin said there were two areas of concern in the us : " the institutional environment both public and private has deteriorated and secondly the reaction of the government to the economic crisis in the form of a huge stimulus package with huge debt and deficits has lowered its rank . " switzerland is in the lead due to its sophisticated business culture and innovation , characterized by its high level of scientific research organizations , high spending on research and development and a large number of patents , said the world economic forum . the ranking system takes into account 12 categories .
these include the stability of institutions , infrastructure , health systems , education systems , market efficiency and technological development .
when compiling the list , the world economic forum uses publicly available information , and they survey over 13,000 leading personalities in the business world . author : natalia dannenberg -lrb- dpa , afp , ap -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while teh us budget deficit pulls the superpower further down the pecking order . germany has moved up the economic league tables to become the fifth most economically competitive country in the world and the highest-ranked eurozone country , according to a yearly study by the world economic forum .
europe 's most populous nation moved up two places since last year , when it was ranked seventh worldwide . " amid concerns about the outlook for the global economy , policymakers must not lose sight of long-term competitiveness fundamentals amid short-term challenges , " said xavier sala-i-martin , co-author of the report and an economics professor at new york 's columbia university . germany forged ahead in the rankings this year because the country 's economy as a whole improved in comparison with other large economies .
it was praised for its infrastructure and sophisticated and productive businesses but was given low marks for its inflexible labor market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's sophisticated industry stimulated economic competitiveness usa falls to fourth germany comes in just behind the usa , which this year dropped two places to fourth place .
the united states was knocked off its top spot last year by switzerland , which remained in first place this year , closely followed by sweden and singapore . although the united states is a clear leader in productivity , innovation and competitiveness , the world 's largest economy has shown growing weaknesses in recent years , the world economic forum said . sala-i-martin said there were two areas of concern in the us : " the institutional environment both public and private has deteriorated and secondly the reaction of the government to the economic crisis in the form of a huge stimulus package with huge debt and deficits has lowered its rank . " switzerland is in the lead due to its sophisticated business culture and innovation , characterized by its high level of scientific research organizations , high spending on research and development and a large number of patents , said the world economic forum . the ranking system takes into account 12 categories .
these include the stability of institutions , infrastructure , health systems , education systems , market efficiency and technological development .
when compiling the list , the world economic forum uses publicly available information , and they survey over 13,000 leading personalities in the business world . author : natalia dannenberg -lrb- dpa , afp , ap -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european union 's top diplomat welcomed the decision . after weeks of diplomatic pressure from european union nations , including germany and france , belgrade indicated on wednesday that it had struck a " compromise " with the eu on a joint text for a resolution at the united nations general assembly . it no longer directly challenges kosovo 's independence .
serbia also agreed to a call for a " dialogue " with kosovo .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle welcomed serbia 's decision .
" this is a clear signal that serbia sees its future in the eu , " westerwelle said .
" i call on all parties to begin these talks rapidly ... and lead to concrete results for the people . "
the eu 's high representative for foreign policy also reacted positively .
" i warmly welcome the announcement , " catherine ashton said in a statement .
the move was seen as bolstering the eu 's mediating role in the region .
" this draft resolution will now be a resolution put forward by 28 european countries , " ashton added .
" all 27 eu member states and serbia will be co-sponsoring this draft resolution . "
in the new text , serbia has dropped calls for the condemnation of kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence and for renewed talks on kosovo 's status .
international pressure in july , the international court of justice ruled that the declaration of independence violated no international law , and welcomed " the readiness of the eu to facilitate the process of dialogue " between serbia and kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last december serbia applied to begin talks on eu membership serbia also agreed to move the venue of talks from the un to the eu , where 22 of the 27 member states have recognized kosovo as an independent country .
serbian president boris tadic said in a statement that the resolution defends his country 's interests " by peaceful and diplomatic means . "
he added that belgrade was acting " on an honest wish to resolve all issues in a partner ship with the eu and other important international players . "
however , serbian nationalists and kosovo serbs have sharply criticized the compromise .
the opposition democratic party of serbia described the move as a " capitulation to ultimatums from western powers and confiscation of kosovo . "
paving the way for a serbia-kosovo dialogue analysts believe the diplomatic bargaining has recognized the eu as the key player in possible talks between belgrade and pristina .
ashton met tadic late on tuesday in brussels , with a breakthrough coming on wednesday .
serbia is keen to become a member of the european union , but questions remain over its stance on kosovo .
kosovo declared independence from serbia in february 2008 , 11 years after nato ousted serbian forces from the region , ending an ethnic conflict .
the new country has been recognized by the united states and most eu nations .
serbia had originally planned to use the un resolution to challenge kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence .
the new draft was due to be presented later on thursday .
german and british foreign ministers warned during recent visits to belgrade that the country was risking its ties with the eu by focusing its entire diplomatic efforts on the issue .

the french government remains defiant on the issue . the european parliament passed a resolution condemning france 's policy of roma deportation on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament said the actions breached eu law the resolution , which was adopted by 337 votes to 245 , expresses " deep concern at measures taken by france and other member states targeting roma and travelers " and " urges those authorities immediately to suspend all expulsions of roma . "

while teh us budget deficit pulls the superpower further down the pecking order . germany has moved up the economic league tables to become the fifth most economically competitive country in the world and the highest-ranked eurozone country , according to a yearly study by the world economic forum .
europe 's most populous nation moved up two places since last year , when it was ranked seventh worldwide . " amid concerns about the outlook for the global economy , policymakers must not lose sight of long-term competitiveness fundamentals amid short-term challenges , " said xavier sala-i-martin , co-author of the report and an economics professor at new york 's columbia university . germany forged ahead in the rankings this year because the country 's economy as a whole improved in comparison with other large economies .
it was praised for its infrastructure and sophisticated and productive businesses but was given low marks for its inflexible labor market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's sophisticated industry stimulated economic competitiveness usa falls to fourth germany comes in just behind the usa , which this year dropped two places to fourth place .
the united states was knocked off its top spot last year by switzerland , which remained in first place this year , closely followed by sweden and singapore . although the united states is a clear leader in productivity , innovation and competitiveness , the world 's largest economy has shown growing weaknesses in recent years , the world economic forum said . sala-i-martin said there were two areas of concern in the us : " the institutional environment both public and private has deteriorated and secondly the reaction of the government to the economic crisis in the form of a huge stimulus package with huge debt and deficits has lowered its rank . " switzerland is in the lead due to its sophisticated business culture and innovation , characterized by its high level of scientific research organizations , high spending on research and development and a large number of patents , said the world economic forum . the ranking system takes into account 12 categories .
these include the stability of institutions , infrastructure , health systems , education systems , market efficiency and technological development .
when compiling the list , the world economic forum uses publicly available information , and they survey over 13,000 leading personalities in the business world . author : natalia dannenberg -lrb- dpa , afp , ap -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the french government remains defiant on the issue . the european parliament passed a resolution condemning france 's policy of roma deportation on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament said the actions breached eu law the resolution , which was adopted by 337 votes to 245 , expresses " deep concern at measures taken by france and other member states targeting roma and travelers " and " urges those authorities immediately to suspend all expulsions of roma . "
parliamentarians in strasbourg also called on the european commission , the european council and on individual eu governments to " intervene with the same request . "
the resolution stressed that " mass expulsions are prohibited " under eu law , " since they amount to discrimination on the basis of race and ethnicity . "
french immigration minister eric besson , who was in bucharest on thursday for talks with romanian authorities about the issue said there was " no question " of paris complying .
" of course we are not going to submit to a political diktat , " besson said .
romanian plea for solutions romanian president traian basescu criticized the french policy on thursday , saying that " realistic solutions " were needed .
" france is not handling this like a european state , " said basescu , adding that roma also had a responsibility to integrate into european society .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besson said there was no chance of france complying france began a security crackdown in july and has since dismantled some 100 unauthorized camps and deported almost 1,000 roma migrants to their countries of origin , principally bulgaria and romania .
officials have used a " voluntary return procedure , " in which roma are given money in exchange for a promise not to return , to press ahead with deportations .
french president nicolas sarkozy claims that the actions are necessary as part of a crackdown on crime .
the actions have prompted criticism from the united nations and the roman catholic church , as well as condemnation from within france itself .

the european union 's top diplomat welcomed the decision . after weeks of diplomatic pressure from european union nations , including germany and france , belgrade indicated on wednesday that it had struck a " compromise " with the eu on a joint text for a resolution at the united nations general assembly . it no longer directly challenges kosovo 's independence .
serbia also agreed to a call for a " dialogue " with kosovo .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle welcomed serbia 's decision .
" this is a clear signal that serbia sees its future in the eu , " westerwelle said .
" i call on all parties to begin these talks rapidly ... and lead to concrete results for the people . "
the eu 's high representative for foreign policy also reacted positively .
" i warmly welcome the announcement , " catherine ashton said in a statement .
the move was seen as bolstering the eu 's mediating role in the region .
" this draft resolution will now be a resolution put forward by 28 european countries , " ashton added .
" all 27 eu member states and serbia will be co-sponsoring this draft resolution . "
in the new text , serbia has dropped calls for the condemnation of kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence and for renewed talks on kosovo 's status .
international pressure in july , the international court of justice ruled that the declaration of independence violated no international law , and welcomed " the readiness of the eu to facilitate the process of dialogue " between serbia and kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last december serbia applied to begin talks on eu membership serbia also agreed to move the venue of talks from the un to the eu , where 22 of the 27 member states have recognized kosovo as an independent country .
serbian president boris tadic said in a statement that the resolution defends his country 's interests " by peaceful and diplomatic means . "
he added that belgrade was acting " on an honest wish to resolve all issues in a partner ship with the eu and other important international players . "
however , serbian nationalists and kosovo serbs have sharply criticized the compromise .
the opposition democratic party of serbia described the move as a " capitulation to ultimatums from western powers and confiscation of kosovo . "
paving the way for a serbia-kosovo dialogue analysts believe the diplomatic bargaining has recognized the eu as the key player in possible talks between belgrade and pristina .
ashton met tadic late on tuesday in brussels , with a breakthrough coming on wednesday .
serbia is keen to become a member of the european union , but questions remain over its stance on kosovo .
kosovo declared independence from serbia in february 2008 , 11 years after nato ousted serbian forces from the region , ending an ethnic conflict .
the new country has been recognized by the united states and most eu nations .
serbia had originally planned to use the un resolution to challenge kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence .
the new draft was due to be presented later on thursday .
german and british foreign ministers warned during recent visits to belgrade that the country was risking its ties with the eu by focusing its entire diplomatic efforts on the issue .

the european union 's top diplomat welcomed the decision . after weeks of diplomatic pressure from european union nations , including germany and france , belgrade indicated on wednesday that it had struck a " compromise " with the eu on a joint text for a resolution at the united nations general assembly . it no longer directly challenges kosovo 's independence .
serbia also agreed to a call for a " dialogue " with kosovo .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle welcomed serbia 's decision .
" this is a clear signal that serbia sees its future in the eu , " westerwelle said .
" i call on all parties to begin these talks rapidly ... and lead to concrete results for the people . "
the eu 's high representative for foreign policy also reacted positively .
" i warmly welcome the announcement , " catherine ashton said in a statement .
the move was seen as bolstering the eu 's mediating role in the region .
" this draft resolution will now be a resolution put forward by 28 european countries , " ashton added .
" all 27 eu member states and serbia will be co-sponsoring this draft resolution . "
in the new text , serbia has dropped calls for the condemnation of kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence and for renewed talks on kosovo 's status .
international pressure in july , the international court of justice ruled that the declaration of independence violated no international law , and welcomed " the readiness of the eu to facilitate the process of dialogue " between serbia and kosovo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last december serbia applied to begin talks on eu membership serbia also agreed to move the venue of talks from the un to the eu , where 22 of the 27 member states have recognized kosovo as an independent country .
serbian president boris tadic said in a statement that the resolution defends his country 's interests " by peaceful and diplomatic means . "
he added that belgrade was acting " on an honest wish to resolve all issues in a partner ship with the eu and other important international players . "
however , serbian nationalists and kosovo serbs have sharply criticized the compromise .
the opposition democratic party of serbia described the move as a " capitulation to ultimatums from western powers and confiscation of kosovo . "
paving the way for a serbia-kosovo dialogue analysts believe the diplomatic bargaining has recognized the eu as the key player in possible talks between belgrade and pristina .
ashton met tadic late on tuesday in brussels , with a breakthrough coming on wednesday .
serbia is keen to become a member of the european union , but questions remain over its stance on kosovo .
kosovo declared independence from serbia in february 2008 , 11 years after nato ousted serbian forces from the region , ending an ethnic conflict .
the new country has been recognized by the united states and most eu nations .
serbia had originally planned to use the un resolution to challenge kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence .
the new draft was due to be presented later on thursday .
german and british foreign ministers warned during recent visits to belgrade that the country was risking its ties with the eu by focusing its entire diplomatic efforts on the issue .

the goal is to support independent journalism in this southern african country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrick leusch , head of dw-akademie project development , and barbara plinkert , chargé d 'affaires , ec delegation harare the european commission will support a long-term dw-akademie project in zimbabwe with 1.1 million euros .
the project is called “ media in zimbabwe : the key factor in defending human rights and freedom of opinion .
reinforcing media reform and the transition to civil society ” .
dw-akademie aims to support zimbabwean media over a three-year period in “ working on a new , free media system and supporting independent journalism in zimbabwe , ” emphasizes patrick leusch , head of dw-akademie project development .
eu assistance makes this possible .
“ the project is very important to us because it ’ s the result of close cooperation between zimbabwean and european partners . ”
particularly benefiting from the support will be existing networks of media companies and media aid agencies in zimbabwe , with a special focus on members of the “ media alliance of zimbabwe ” -lrb- maz -rrb- .
this project concentrates primarily on four areas : media law reform ; institutional advanced training ; expertise development ; and professionalization of the media sector .
the project also aims to strengthen the connection between the media and civil society .
despite the restructuring of the government two years ago , the media situation in this crisis-shaken southern african country has hardly improved .
independent reporting is still not possible , say media and human rights organizations .
and contrary to promises made , no media reforms have been undertaken since the power-sharing agreement between robert mugabe ’ s government and the opposition came into effect .
in fact , the opposite is true : journalists still suffer censorship and persecution .
according to a report from human rights watch , not one independent radio or television broadcaster received a license last year .
primarily , dw-akademie would like to have a coordinating role in the project .
nine partners in total are involved , including the european organization ims in denmark , iwpr in london , press now in the netherlands and fojo in sweden .
four zimbabwean media organizations and networks are also involved .
the project is financed by the eu human rights program “ instrument for democracy and human rights ” -lrb- eidhr -rrb- .
the european commission received more than 200 applications for project funding as part of this program .
eleven were chosen , including the dw-akademie zimbabwe project .

but ladenburger does n't support every tradition when it comes to performing beethoven 's compositions .
" it 's regrettable that the ninth symphony is performed so much and often so thoughtlessly .
beethoven would have rolled over in his grave if he knew that people performed the ninth and other works for pleasure , with total disregard for the message behind them . "
millionaire and a hobby fisherman ?
the beethoven house in bonn is world renowned as a place to get to know the composer better .
and ever since the museum put its collection online , more questions about the master musician have come in than ever .
in the beethoven forum , people can ask whatever is on their mind , like whether beethoven liked to fish -lrb- he did n't -rrb- and how he might experience life today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , royalties could save beethoven from the financial problems he once faced according to michael ladenburger , beethoven himself reflected deeply on the question of dealing with fame and being a public figure .
" he asked himself what it meant for him to be an extraordinarily gifted person , and what obligations and practical consequences that brings . "
but ladenburger has reason to believe beethoven would have been able to get by in contemporary society , " and not just because he would n't have to subsist on occasional payments from his publishers anymore .
instead , he 'd be a millionaire several times over from royalties ! "
beethoven makes money for bonn hopefully beethoven would n't be against his hometown profiting today from the heritage of its famous son - both financially and in terms of image .
bonn 's mayor juergen nimptsch confirmed that beethoven brings hefty returns .
" it 's more or less the case that for every euro we invest , three to four come back into the region and stay here in bonn . "
top classical musicians from all over the world are scheduled to perform at the 2010 beethovenfest bonn , including pianist helene grimaud , cellist sol gabetta , conductor kent nagano and many others .
the festival runs from september 10 - october 9 .

but it was a contemporary form of anti-semitism that got the exhibit off the ground . the project started after four neo-nazis firebombed a synagogue in the northern german town of luebeck on the eve of passover in 1994 , according to mark grellert , who has been creating virtual reconstructions of synagogues at darmstadt technical university since that firebombing both as a student and now professor in the architecture department . " i do n't remember where i heard this about the arson attack , but i think a couple of minutes afterwards and i got the idea , we have to do something against this , " he told deutsche welle . his idea was to virtually reconstruct some of the synagogues that were destroyed on kristallnacht , or the night of the broken glass , on november 10 , 1938 .
that was one of the most heinous attacks against jews , synagogues and jewish businesses in german history . their efforts culminated in an exhibition in bonn in 2000 . that exhibition has now come to the united states for the first time at the holocaust memorial center zekelman family campus in farmington hills , michigan .
the exhibit opened on august 29 and will run through the end of november . back in 1994 , grellert and his team started with three synagogues in frankfurt .
but he said they quickly realized that the project would n't move as quickly as they hoped as it would take them almost one year to finish a single synagogue . getting the plans the first step was to find blueprints or old photographs showing the synagogue 's floor plan then grellert and his team would reach out to people who remembered the original appearance of the synagogue . " in many synagogues , you have only black-and-white photographs , " grellert said .
" so we ask them if they have remembrance of the colors of the synagogues . " bildunterschrift : cologne 's synagogue was built in a neo-islamic style , recalling centuries-old mosques from there , the students redraw the blueprints into computers to create 3d models .
when the project started back in 1994 , 3d modeling technology was less advanced primitive than today . but in recent years , grellert added , the team has been able to account for the detail of the synagogues decor , including ornate chandeliers , stained-glass windows , and red brick exterior . the end result of all the work is 14 virtually reconstructed synagogues from all over germany presented in an exhibit divided three parts : perception , escalation , and reconstruction . the exhibit starts by putting a context around germany 's anti-semitic laws in the 1930s , followed by the names of the 1,200 places in germany where synagogues were destroyed on kristallnacht . the final room , reconstruction , displays the 14 virtually reconstructed synagogues .
the display begins with the synagogue ’ s exterior then shows the interior with special attention paid to details like the shadows cast by balconies and refracted light rays coming in through the windows . the intricate digital displays recreate the importance the houses of worship held in germany before their destruction , according to stephen goldman , executive director of the holocaust memorial center in farmington hills , in the us state of michigan - where the exhibit is currently located . " these were big , prominent institutions , " he told deutsche welle .
" often looking exactly like the cathedrals across the street and done by prominent and well-known german architects . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's synagogue was built in 1861 and destroyed in 1938 ruined communities goldman added that by destroying the synagogues , the nazis tore apart more than individual buildings . " the destruction of a house of worship is very different than the destruction of a home , or even a school , because this effects a whole population , " he said .
" it 's saying , ' we 're no longer safe in our houses of worship ... in our cities , in the buildings we expect to shelter us and cradle us in safety . " ' but goldman admitted that while the digital reconstructions would not have the significance of an actual house of worship , they could serve as a reminder of what was . " it 's not listening to somebody speak to you , but it reminds you of that person , " he said .
" these are speaking in those styles .
these are speaking in the voices of the past . " those voices spoke powerfully to ruth schnee , who attended the exhibit 's opening in michigan .
originally from duesseldorf , she has lived in the united states since 1939 and vividly remembers kristallnacht . " i remember the synagogue in duesseldorf , which was our synagogue , being put on fire , and the rabbi ran into the building to save the torah , and perished in the building , " she said .
" the fire brigade was trained to protect the adjoining buildings , and not of course the synagogues .
the art , the furniture , everything was demolished . " the duesseldorf synagogue has not been recreated by grellert and his team , though they continue to work on the project with his students 10 years after its launch . author : zak rosen -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european union 's top diplomat welcomed the decision . after weeks of diplomatic pressure from european union nations , including germany and france , belgrade indicated on wednesday that it had struck a " compromise " with the eu on a joint text for a resolution at the united nations general assembly . it no longer directly challenges kosovo 's independence .
serbia also agreed to a call for a " dialogue " with kosovo .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle welcomed serbia 's decision .
" this is a clear signal that serbia sees its future in the eu , " westerwelle said .
" i call on all parties to begin these talks rapidly ... and lead to concrete results for the people . "
the eu 's high representative for foreign policy also reacted positively .
" i warmly welcome the announcement , " catherine ashton said in a statement .
the move was seen as bolstering the eu 's mediating role in the region .
" this draft resolution will now be a resolution put forward by 28 european countries , " ashton added .
" all 27 eu member states and serbia will be co-sponsoring this draft resolution . "
in the new text , serbia has dropped calls for the condemnation of kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence and for renewed talks on kosovo 's status .
international pressure in july , the international court of justice ruled that the declaration of independence violated no international law , and welcomed " the readiness of the eu to facilitate the process of dialogue " between serbia and kosovo .

he added that belgrade was acting " on an honest wish to resolve all issues in a partner ship with the eu and other important international players . "
however , serbian nationalists and kosovo serbs have sharply criticized the compromise .
the opposition democratic party of serbia described the move as a " capitulation to ultimatums from western powers and confiscation of kosovo . "
paving the way for a serbia-kosovo dialogue analysts believe the diplomatic bargaining has recognized the eu as the key player in possible talks between belgrade and pristina .
ashton met tadic late on tuesday in brussels , with a breakthrough coming on wednesday .
serbia is keen to become a member of the european union , but questions remain over its stance on kosovo .
kosovo declared independence from serbia in february 2008 , 11 years after nato ousted serbian forces from the region , ending an ethnic conflict .
the new country has been recognized by the united states and most eu nations .
serbia had originally planned to use the un resolution to challenge kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence .
the new draft was due to be presented later on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 09.09.2010 swiss aviators power ahead with solar plane project großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high in the sky : the ' solar impulse ' does what it does best two months after the ' solar impulse ' flew around the clock using nothing but the energy from the sun as fuel , the minds behind the aircraft say they are gearing up to reach new heights . when the solar-powered plane takes to the skies again sometime later this month , it wo n't be testing the endurance of its batteries , but rather will be making sure that its ground crew is ready to make flights of this kind a success .
andre borschberg , both the pilot of the ' solar impulse ' and one of its leaders , announced this week that the plane would be entering its next testing phase sometime in september .
the plan is to make three short-distance hops over swiss territory - from payerne to geneva , geneva to zurich , zurich to payerne - to see how well the aircraft can be integrated into the flow of everyday business at an international airport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertrand picard and andre borschberg in the hanger borshberg added that the upcoming jaunts are crictical if they are ever to take the plane beyond swiss borders and land at major foreign airports .
" our airplane is quite special , it flies slowly , it is very light and is sensitive to turbulence , " he said .
" we have to know what logistics need to be put in place and to see what kind of collaboration we need to develop with big airports because . "
a training exercise given the plane 's relatively slow cruising speeds - 50 kilometers per hour -lrb- or about 31 mph -rrb- as compared to the standard 250 kilometers per hour -lrb- or 155 mph -rrb- for larger aircraft - the ground crew has time to drive from payerne to geneva and arrive before it lands .
it might sound like a strange exercise on paper , but borschberg insists that it is all part of getting everyone acquainted with the solar-generated newcomer .
" we have to train the team , " borschberg said , " and see what kind of difficulties we have with traffic arriving and departing . "
and that cuts both ways .
it is not only the pilot and the ground crew dedicated to the ' solar impuse ' that have to get used to operating in a very busy environment , but the other aircraft that have to become accustomed to its presence .
the fact that the plane , which has solar panels attached to the 63 meter span of its wings , it is so easily thrown off by turbulence means the time between it landing and taking has to be adapted accordingly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plane on the ground " it is quite difficult for people in the control towers , because they are not used to it , " borschberg said .
" it is an experiment to get their feedback , to see how it works so that when we fly to another international airport next year , we can propose a way to operate that has been tested and in which we have experience . "
commercial potential ?
as yet there is no solid information about exactly where the non-domestic flights might take the ' solar impulse . '
but wherever it goes , there is a good chance it will attract a lot of attention .
the idea of a plane which can fly without spluttering more emissions into the already choking skies , is a welcome thought , both environmentally and economically .
" ten years ago fuel was 10 percent of airlines cost and now it is nearly 30 percent , " geoff van klaveren , aviation expert with the deutsche bank told deutsche welle .
" any kind of alternative fuel is a thing we have to research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky is the limit .
or is it ?
yet anyone hoping to see this state-of-the-art clean technology ground the world 's current airline fleet is in for a long-haul wait .
commercialization , the ' solar impulse ' pilot insists , is still a very small dot on the horizon .
in reference to the decades it took between the wright brothers ' first aircraft success and the first commercial transatlantic flight , he stressed that it is a slow process .
" i think we will have to wait a while before we can do the same with passengers , but we have to start somewhere , " borschberg said .
making history , changing lives and that it has .
in july , ' solar impulse ' became the first aircraft in history to stay in the air for 26 consecutive hours without any fuel .
the plane took off in the early hours of the morning and spent 14 hours in the air during sunlight hours , enough time for its batteries to charge for the night-time portion of the experiment .
bildunterschrift : solar-powered night flight speaking shortly after the landing , swiss adventurer and brainchild of the project bertrand piccard told reporters that the round-the-clock flight had taken them closer to " the myth of perpetual flight . "
but that is not the only goal they have in mind .
both piccard and borschberg believe that to make the world aware of how much can be achieved with just four six kilowatt electric motors , is to open eyes to the possibilities on the ground .
" at this stage the purpose of the project is not so much to develop a commercial application but to show what we can do today with this technology , " borschberg added .
he said that as much as anything it is about making people see how with the right technology they can use less energy yet still maintain the same quality of life .

benedikt hoewedes is back from suspension , which will help shore up their creaky back line , and raul no longer has a donkey named edu for his strike partner - rather he 'll have a face familiar to him from madrid in klaas-jan huntelaar .
i like them to snatch a point .
prediction : 1-1 saturday , september 11 borussia dortmund - wolfsburg bildunterschrift : mueller is fast ebcoming the man in munich dortmund have been up and down thus far , laying an egg at home to leverkusen , and then flying high away from home stuttgart .
in mario goetze , they 've unearthed another young german gem and shinji kagawa -lrb- bought for 350,000 euros - $ 446,000 -rrb- is surely the steal of the season .
wolfsburg were unlucky to lose on opening night to bayern , but just plain blew it against mainz , surrendering a three goal lead to lose 4-3 .
taking into account the injured arne friedrich 's continuing absence from the center of defense and a knock that might keep creative maestro diego out of the starting line-up , i ca n't see wolfsburg getting a result in dortmund .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 hamburg - nuremberg hsv 's ruud van nistelrooy has been chewing up bundesliga defenses , notching three goals in his first two games .
nuremberg , meanwhile , just eked out a draw at gladbach and wilted to defeat at home to lowly freiburg .
hamburg should win at a canter .
prediction : hamburg 3-1 borussia moenchengladbach - eintracht frankfurt a tough one to call , this .
if gladbach are half the side they were in their 6-3 demolition of leverkusen in week two , it 's not a contest .
then again , if they revert to their ordinary form , eintracht - who were unfortunate to go down in week one to hanover before being steamrolled by hamburg in week two - have the horses to get a draw , or even win .
home advantage and frankfurt 's injury worries in defense -lrb- vasoski is out , chris is day-to-day -rrb- should tip this for the foals .
prediction : gladbach 2-1 freiburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : van the man is getting his first taste of the millerntor stadium in any derby , observers are meant to " throw out the record books . "
so i will .
despite freiburg having picked up three points to stuttgart 's none so far this season , i reckon baden-wuerttemburg 's big boys just have too much quality to keep on stinking out stadiums every week .
new signing mauro camoranesi will steady the ship in midfield , while cacau will have a big game against a suspect freiburg back line .
prediction : stuttgart 3-1 hanover 96 - bayer leverkusen among the sides with six points after two match days , the reds are surely the most surprising .
but their results have been convincing - they fought eintracht to a stalemate before snatching a late win , and played schalke off the park .
much of this comes down to good transfer dealing which has brought much-needed quality .
emanuel pogatetz and mohamed abdelloue were inexpensive and have done the business , and i expect damarcus beasley -lrb- brought in on a free transfer -rrb- to do the same .
the only trouble is , this week they host leverkusen , who are just too fast up front for their aging defense .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 bayern munich - werder bremen per mertesacker 's injury in germany 's win over azerbaijan this week came at precisely the wrong moment for werder - just in time to weaken its back line for one of its sternest tests of the season in munich .
mikael silvestre , who bremen picked up ahead of the transfer deadline and will now have to throw into the center of defense , will probably get torched by the likes of thomas mueller , ivica olic , and franck ribery .
bremen 's only chance will be to get big games out of new boys wesley and marko arnautovic - which they may well do .
prediction : bayern 4-2 sunday , september 12 mainz - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you hear that lakic ?
dw sports says you 're due to cool off a shock table-topping clash with both sides on six points , this game is likely to see one of the two participants unmasked as a pretender for top-half status .
i see kaiserslautern as the likelier candidate .
the red devils are very solid at the back , but i do n't trust their on-fire hitman srdan lakic -lrb- three goals in two matches -rrb- to stay ablaze much longer .
mainz , on the other hand , have another year of top-flight experience under their collective belt and earned several stripes with their four-goal fight back in wolfsburg in week two .
prediction : mainz 2-1 cologne - st. pauli these two sets of supporters have a " fan friendship " - an odd german custom wherein two clubs ' ultras agree , over a period of years , to get along rather than taunt each other .
with that in mind , as well as each club 's fans ' reputation for liking a drink or four , this game ought to have a party atmosphere .
the teams may well spoil it .
st. pauli 's hell-for leather approach can be entertaining , but is low on ball skill .
and the more defensive-minded cologne , more often than not , makes for putrid viewing .
expect a draw .

dw sports says you 're due to cool off a shock table-topping clash with both sides on six points , this game is likely to see one of the two participants unmasked as a pretender for top-half status .
i see kaiserslautern as the likelier candidate .
the red devils are very solid at the back , but i do n't trust their on-fire hitman srdan lakic -lrb- three goals in two matches -rrb- to stay ablaze much longer .
mainz , on the other hand , have another year of top-flight experience under their collective belt and earned several stripes with their four-goal fight back in wolfsburg in week two .
prediction : mainz 2-1 cologne - st. pauli these two sets of supporters have a " fan friendship " - an odd german custom wherein two clubs ' ultras agree , over a period of years , to get along rather than taunt each other .
with that in mind , as well as each club 's fans ' reputation for liking a drink or four , this game ought to have a party atmosphere .
the teams may well spoil it .
st. pauli 's hell-for leather approach can be entertaining , but is low on ball skill .
and the more defensive-minded cologne , more often than not , makes for putrid viewing .
expect a draw .

vedad ibisisevic is back in great form up front and ghana 's world cup run this summer appears to have done defender isaac vorsah a world of good .

i like them to snatch a point .
prediction : 1-1 saturday , september 11 borussia dortmund - wolfsburg bildunterschrift : mueller is fast ebcoming the man in munich dortmund have been up and down thus far , laying an egg at home to leverkusen , and then flying high away from home stuttgart .
in mario goetze , they 've unearthed another young german gem and shinji kagawa -lrb- bought for 350,000 euros - $ 446,000 -rrb- is surely the steal of the season .
wolfsburg were unlucky to lose on opening night to bayern , but just plain blew it against mainz , surrendering a three goal lead to lose 4-3 .
taking into account the injured arne friedrich 's continuing absence from the center of defense and a knock that might keep creative maestro diego out of the starting line-up , i ca n't see wolfsburg getting a result in dortmund .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 hamburg - nuremberg hsv 's ruud van nistelrooy has been chewing up bundesliga defenses , notching three goals in his first two games .
nuremberg , meanwhile , just eked out a draw at gladbach and wilted to defeat at home to lowly freiburg .
hamburg should win at a canter .
prediction : hamburg 3-1 borussia moenchengladbach - eintracht frankfurt a tough one to call , this .
if gladbach are half the side they were in their 6-3 demolition of leverkusen in week two , it 's not a contest .
then again , if they revert to their ordinary form , eintracht - who were unfortunate to go down in week one to hanover before being steamrolled by hamburg in week two - have the horses to get a draw , or even win .
home advantage and frankfurt 's injury worries in defense -lrb- vasoski is out , chris is day-to-day -rrb- should tip this for the foals .
prediction : gladbach 2-1 freiburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : van the man is getting his first taste of the millerntor stadium in any derby , observers are meant to " throw out the record books . "
so i will .
despite freiburg having picked up three points to stuttgart 's none so far this season , i reckon baden-wuerttemburg 's big boys just have too much quality to keep on stinking out stadiums every week .
new signing mauro camoranesi will steady the ship in midfield , while cacau will have a big game against a suspect freiburg back line .
prediction : stuttgart 3-1 hanover 96 - bayer leverkusen among the sides with six points after two match days , the reds are surely the most surprising .
but their results have been convincing - they fought eintracht to a stalemate before snatching a late win , and played schalke off the park .
much of this comes down to good transfer dealing which has brought much-needed quality .
emanuel pogatetz and mohamed abdelloue were inexpensive and have done the business , and i expect damarcus beasley -lrb- brought in on a free transfer -rrb- to do the same .
the only trouble is , this week they host leverkusen , who are just too fast up front for their aging defense .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 bayern munich - werder bremen per mertesacker 's injury in germany 's win over azerbaijan this week came at precisely the wrong moment for werder - just in time to weaken its back line for one of its sternest tests of the season in munich .
mikael silvestre , who bremen picked up ahead of the transfer deadline and will now have to throw into the center of defense , will probably get torched by the likes of thomas mueller , ivica olic , and franck ribery .
bremen 's only chance will be to get big games out of new boys wesley and marko arnautovic - which they may well do .

if gladbach are half the side they were in their 6-3 demolition of leverkusen in week two , it 's not a contest .
then again , if they revert to their ordinary form , eintracht - who were unfortunate to go down in week one to hanover before being steamrolled by hamburg in week two - have the horses to get a draw , or even win .
home advantage and frankfurt 's injury worries in defense -lrb- vasoski is out , chris is day-to-day -rrb- should tip this for the foals .
prediction : gladbach 2-1 freiburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : van the man is getting his first taste of the millerntor stadium in any derby , observers are meant to " throw out the record books . "
so i will .
despite freiburg having picked up three points to stuttgart 's none so far this season , i reckon baden-wuerttemburg 's big boys just have too much quality to keep on stinking out stadiums every week .
new signing mauro camoranesi will steady the ship in midfield , while cacau will have a big game against a suspect freiburg back line .
prediction : stuttgart 3-1 hanover 96 - bayer leverkusen among the sides with six points after two match days , the reds are surely the most surprising .
but their results have been convincing - they fought eintracht to a stalemate before snatching a late win , and played schalke off the park .
much of this comes down to good transfer dealing which has brought much-needed quality .
emanuel pogatetz and mohamed abdelloue were inexpensive and have done the business , and i expect damarcus beasley -lrb- brought in on a free transfer -rrb- to do the same .
the only trouble is , this week they host leverkusen , who are just too fast up front for their aging defense .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 bayern munich - werder bremen per mertesacker 's injury in germany 's win over azerbaijan this week came at precisely the wrong moment for werder - just in time to weaken its back line for one of its sternest tests of the season in munich .
mikael silvestre , who bremen picked up ahead of the transfer deadline and will now have to throw into the center of defense , will probably get torched by the likes of thomas mueller , ivica olic , and franck ribery .
bremen 's only chance will be to get big games out of new boys wesley and marko arnautovic - which they may well do .
prediction : bayern 4-2 sunday , september 12 mainz - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you hear that lakic ?
dw sports says you 're due to cool off a shock table-topping clash with both sides on six points , this game is likely to see one of the two participants unmasked as a pretender for top-half status .
i see kaiserslautern as the likelier candidate .
the red devils are very solid at the back , but i do n't trust their on-fire hitman srdan lakic -lrb- three goals in two matches -rrb- to stay ablaze much longer .
mainz , on the other hand , have another year of top-flight experience under their collective belt and earned several stripes with their four-goal fight back in wolfsburg in week two .
prediction : mainz 2-1 cologne - st. pauli these two sets of supporters have a " fan friendship " - an odd german custom wherein two clubs ' ultras agree , over a period of years , to get along rather than taunt each other .
with that in mind , as well as each club 's fans ' reputation for liking a drink or four , this game ought to have a party atmosphere .
the teams may well spoil it .
st. pauli 's hell-for leather approach can be entertaining , but is low on ball skill .
and the more defensive-minded cologne , more often than not , makes for putrid viewing .
expect a draw .

as the military crackdown against the movement intensifies , protests have turned violent . as temperatures soar above 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in aden , the great port city of south yemen , homes become airless .
daily power cuts leave residents sweating through dark nights .
in a region where resentment of the government in the north has been festering for a decade , such daily indignities are enough to spark fury in the people .
earlier this week thousands took to the streets in protest .
car tyres were burned , property vandalised and gun shots fired .
police were pelted with stones .
according to yemeni officials this came after members of the opposition group known as the southern movement , some of whose factions call for independence from northern yemen , ambushed a military patrol and wounded three soldiers .
the attack followed shortly on from the twice attempted assassination of an army brigade commander by members of the southern movement the week earlier .
in south yemen scenes like these repeat themselves at increasingly shorter intervals .
besieged by conflicts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen 's president ali abdullah saleh is facing growing unrest from his palace in the mountain capital of sanaa president ali abdullah saleh seems besieged by conflicts .
to the north , a recent peace agreement quelling six years of rebellion by the zaidi shia houthi clan , who fight a government they accuse of marginalising them politically as well as economically , has been breaking down , threatening a return to war .
in the unruly tribal strongholds of east yemen saleh 's troops face an al qaeda branch well integrated into the local community and whose failed attempt to bring down a us airliner last christmas day showed they are a menace not just to yemen , but to international security as well .
however , to the government in sanaa , no conflict is more serious than the growing power of the southern movement , whose call for independence from the north threatens the territorial integrity of the state .
economic injustices the key grievance levelled by the southern movement against president saleh is economic : southerners complain bitterly that despite their small numbers , just 3.5 million compared to 20 million living in the north , and despite the south being home to the majority of yemen 's oil and gas fields -lrb- which account for 75 percent of the government 's revenue -rrb- the south has not witnessed anything like the economic growth and development of the north , limited though that is .
the movement accuses the president of favoritism of northerners , working through tribal patronage networks from which southerners are largely excluded , of arbitrary land confiscation and political disenfranchisement .
the grievances date back to the unification between north and south yemen in 1990 , which was viewed by many southern leaders as failed .
they were politically outnumbered by their northern colleagues , the two armies were never integrated and assassinations of southern leaders created a deep mistrust of the north .
after elections in 1993 , leaders of former south yemen called for a new federal constitutional system which would decentralize power .
instead , a year later a brief but bloody civil war erupted with northern troops occupying the south .
in the wake of the victory of north over south , president saleh amended the constitution , removing institutions of joint north-south rule and granting himself power to rule by decree .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yemeni army is coming under increasing attacks from opposition rebels since then , a growing sense injustice has simmered in the south , but it was not until 2007 that the southern movement emerged , coalescing around a group of former south yemen army officers , part of a group of 20,000 military personnel forced into early retirement after the 1994 war , who rose up after their pensions were not paid .
former brigadier nasser al-qawi from the aviation brigade of al-anad air base was one of those officers and is today one of the movement 's leaders .
" the authorities ' refusal to address the issues of the south , the looting of its resources for the benefit of the ruling family and the corruption have led -lsb- the south -rsb- to demand secession from the north , " said al-qawi in an interview .
he insisted that southern movement demonstrations had always been peaceful , but blamed sanaa for a violent response .
" it seems the authorities want to drag us towards violence to find a justification to suppress the movement . " " the language of violence and repression used against the people of the south reflects the failure and inability of the government to provide solutions . -lsb- ... -rsb-
for southerners the dream faded away and turned into a nightmare .
people feel the south is under occupation by the north . "

back to first page back 2/2 no head to cut bildunterschrift : even the use of force against the southern movement is not achieving the desired outcome since 2007 the southern movement has grown steadily .
according to observers it has no unified leadership .
" there is no central nervous system , which , paradoxically , has made it a lot more formidable , as there is no head to cut , " said abdul-ghani aryani , a sanaa based political analyst .
the movement includes several political factions , most importantly the former ruling party of south yemen , the yemeni socialist party -lrb- ysp -rrb- .
while many consider ali salem al-beidh , who served as vice president of yemen until he was forced into exile in germany , the champion of their cause , some observers argue he is only a nominal figurehead .
instead , they point to exiled haydar al-attas , former prime minister , as the most effective leader and former south yemen president ali nasser muhammad , who fled in 1986 .
while the movement 's support base is mainly from the south , members of the islah party , the northern-based islamist opposition party , have also expressed backing for the movement .
sympathy for the movement is even found among members of the president 's ruling party , the general people 's congress -lrb- gpc -rrb- .
one former staunch supporter of president saleh and the gpc , tareq al-fadhli , joined the movement in 2009 .
a month later nasser al-wahayshi , leader of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- announced his support for the movement .
whilst the defection by al-fadhli , a former mujahedeen who allegedly fought alongside osama bin laden in afghanistan and later against the ysp in the early 1990 's was interpreted by some as the southern movement developing ties with al qaeda , many see it as a deepening divide between the north and south .
" he was obviously disgruntled by the marginalization he and other southerners suffer from for the benefit of northern tribal elite , " said abdul-ghani aryani .
neither evidence nor shared ideology has been found to link the southern movement to al qaeda .
although al-fadhli has stated that he supports an independent southern state , led by former ysp leader ali salem al-beidh , he has recently been sidelined in the movement .
southern tribes such as the large balharis tribe of shebwa and the bakazim of abyan have also declared their solidarity with the movement .
cracking down as the southern movement has grown the government in sanaa has retorted with violence and repression .
in an august 2010 report the human rights organisation amnesty international accused yemeni authorities of sacrificing human rights in the name of security .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is resorting to media repression to quell the unrest the report argued that the government " has increasingly resorted to unlawful means , including enforced disappearances , unlawful killings , arbitrary detention and excessive use of force . "
at the same time newspapers have been closed down , journalists , editors and proprietors detained , held incommunicado , ill-treated and jailed on spurious charges after unfair trials , said amnesty .
" journalists are in danger of arbitrary arrest by the state and are subjected to beatings and charges of causing riots in the streets , " said abdul-khaliq al-hout , who has worked for al-diyar newspaper in aden for six years .
al-hout said writing about the southern movement is a " complex " issue .
" i can feel the lack of freedom of expression and of providing information and facts to the public . "
restrictive laws and the repressive practices of security forces and special courts have undermined freedom of expression in yemen , though it is enshrined in the constitution .
the press and publications law of 1990 and the establishment of the specialized press and publications court in may 2009 have made it possible for the authorities to imprison " anyone who incites -lsb- -rsb- unrest . " like many other journalists al-hout was detained after writing an article about the southern movement .
after two months in prison human rights watch helped to secure his release .
" there is a growing fear among journalists of the press court where journalists are treated as criminals , " he said .
a revolution in the making ?
since the beginning of 2009 , more than 66 people have been killed in or near demonstrations and 251 have been wounded .
fifteen members of the security forces have also been killed , according to media reports .
analysts warn that as violence by government forces increases , so too does the call for independence .
while some of their leaders have called for secession from the north , ysp , according to analysts , would consider federalism as would pro-southern movement elements within the islah party .
members within the gpc have called for a local government in the south .
in response , on 22 may , the 20th anniversary of yemen 's unification , president saleh called for a revival of national dialogue and offered to form a national unity government .
according to abdel karim aryani , a long-time adviser to the president , decentralization in the north and local rule for the south is being discussed .
" this is what they -lsb- the southern movement -rsb- are asking for , " he said .
however , the more radical calls for independence now come from the general population of the south who bear the brunt of the government 's crack down .
the president 's olive branch was greeted with scepticism within the movement which says it has been let down too many times before .
" it will not change anything .
it will be written in pencil so it can be easily erased , " said former brigadier al-qawi .
" we have lost confidence in the government ; their promises are always broken . "
according to human rights lawyer mohammed al-saqqaf , local rule under a decentralised north may be too little too late : " protesters repeat the same song they used to sing during the british rule : ‘ out of our country imperialism , " ' he said .
" the depth of grievance in the south is such that they are unlikely to go away , " said a sanaa-based analyst , who did not want his name published .
with no central command the southern movement remains a fluid force .
however , the analyst warned that if the cycle of violence in the south continues , what has until now been a disparate protest movement could merge and harden into an organized rebellion , tipping a low intensity conflict over into full-blown civil war .
" the emergence of a unified leadership is imminent , as soon as they turn to fully fledged violence , which is equally imminent . "

while teh us budget deficit pulls the superpower further down the pecking order . germany has moved up the economic league tables to become the fifth most economically competitive country in the world and the highest-ranked eurozone country , according to a yearly study by the world economic forum .
europe 's most populous nation moved up two places since last year , when it was ranked seventh worldwide . " amid concerns about the outlook for the global economy , policymakers must not lose sight of long-term competitiveness fundamentals amid short-term challenges , " said xavier sala-i-martin , co-author of the report and an economics professor at new york 's columbia university . germany forged ahead in the rankings this year because the country 's economy as a whole improved in comparison with other large economies .
it was praised for its infrastructure and sophisticated and productive businesses but was given low marks for its inflexible labor market .

the united states was knocked off its top spot last year by switzerland , which remained in first place this year , closely followed by sweden and singapore . although the united states is a clear leader in productivity , innovation and competitiveness , the world 's largest economy has shown growing weaknesses in recent years , the world economic forum said . sala-i-martin said there were two areas of concern in the us : " the institutional environment both public and private has deteriorated and secondly the reaction of the government to the economic crisis in the form of a huge stimulus package with huge debt and deficits has lowered its rank . " switzerland is in the lead due to its sophisticated business culture and innovation , characterized by its high level of scientific research organizations , high spending on research and development and a large number of patents , said the world economic forum . the ranking system takes into account 12 categories .
these include the stability of institutions , infrastructure , health systems , education systems , market efficiency and technological development .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 09.09.2010 beethoven 's ' blood , sweat and tears ' keep audiences coming back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's music and biography fascinate all generations composer ludwig van beethoven moved the masses with his music and still does today .
as the 2010 beethovenfest gets underway , dw asks what is it about the composer that draws people back to his works decade after decade . skepticism is in order when it comes to claims like " beethoven has been performed more than any other composer ! "
reliable statistics on the issue would be nearly impossible to assemble .
but those who see the great composer as one of the most influential musicians in the world - both then and today - are certainly not far from the truth .
" even today , beethoven remains of contemporary interest across the world , " michael ladenburger , director and curator of the beethoven house museum in bonn , told deutsche welle .
" beethoven 's music has n't been reduced to just a cultural artefact that people occasionally listen to when they 're in a certain mood .
instead , there are people across all societies who would say , ' this music enriches my life in a very personal and direct way .
in a sense , beethoven is necessary for my life . " '
beethoven worldwide there 's no shortage of examples of the composer 's enduring power : in the central african city of kinshasa , a group of amateur musicians founded the region 's first symphony orchestra and performed beethoven .
the composer is also a fixed part of the curriculum in venezuela 's " el sistema " youth program for music education .
even the prisoners in gulags and concentration camps during world war ii banded together and played beethoven 's works as a way to help cope with their anguish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's 2010 beethovenfest showcases international interest in the master composer but why does his music inspire such an impassioned response ?
" it 's partly due to the fact that people know beethoven 's life - the health problems , his deafness , the bad twists of fate and his struggle against all of those things , " said ladenburger .
but that 's not all : " even more than most composers , beethoven exerted an enormous amount of blood , sweat and tears to find the ideal form for his works . "
timeless moral message beethoven composed works for specific occasions or events , but many of his works also give expression to a moral or ethical ideal , and his fans and followers sense that .
that may help explain why beethoven enthusiasts get together and perform his pieces again and again .
but ladenburger does n't support every tradition when it comes to performing beethoven 's compositions .
" it 's regrettable that the ninth symphony is performed so much and often so thoughtlessly .
beethoven would have rolled over in his grave if he knew that people performed the ninth and other works for pleasure , with total disregard for the message behind them . "
millionaire and a hobby fisherman ?
the beethoven house in bonn is world renowned as a place to get to know the composer better .
and ever since the museum put its collection online , more questions about the master musician have come in than ever .
in the beethoven forum , people can ask whatever is on their mind , like whether beethoven liked to fish -lrb- he did n't -rrb- and how he might experience life today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , royalties could save beethoven from the financial problems he once faced according to michael ladenburger , beethoven himself reflected deeply on the question of dealing with fame and being a public figure .
" he asked himself what it meant for him to be an extraordinarily gifted person , and what obligations and practical consequences that brings . "
but ladenburger has reason to believe beethoven would have been able to get by in contemporary society , " and not just because he would n't have to subsist on occasional payments from his publishers anymore .
instead , he 'd be a millionaire several times over from royalties ! "
beethoven makes money for bonn hopefully beethoven would n't be against his hometown profiting today from the heritage of its famous son - both financially and in terms of image .
bonn 's mayor juergen nimptsch confirmed that beethoven brings hefty returns .
" it 's more or less the case that for every euro we invest , three to four come back into the region and stay here in bonn . "
top classical musicians from all over the world are scheduled to perform at the 2010 beethovenfest bonn , including pianist helene grimaud , cellist sol gabetta , conductor kent nagano and many others .
the festival runs from september 10 - october 9 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's sophisticated industry stimulated economic competitiveness usa falls to fourth germany comes in just behind the usa , which this year dropped two places to fourth place .
the united states was knocked off its top spot last year by switzerland , which remained in first place this year , closely followed by sweden and singapore . although the united states is a clear leader in productivity , innovation and competitiveness , the world 's largest economy has shown growing weaknesses in recent years , the world economic forum said . sala-i-martin said there were two areas of concern in the us : " the institutional environment both public and private has deteriorated and secondly the reaction of the government to the economic crisis in the form of a huge stimulus package with huge debt and deficits has lowered its rank . " switzerland is in the lead due to its sophisticated business culture and innovation , characterized by its high level of scientific research organizations , high spending on research and development and a large number of patents , said the world economic forum . the ranking system takes into account 12 categories .
these include the stability of institutions , infrastructure , health systems , education systems , market efficiency and technological development .
when compiling the list , the world economic forum uses publicly available information , and they survey over 13,000 leading personalities in the business world . author : natalia dannenberg -lrb- dpa , afp , ap -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it was a contemporary form of anti-semitism that got the exhibit off the ground . the project started after four neo-nazis firebombed a synagogue in the northern german town of luebeck on the eve of passover in 1994 , according to mark grellert , who has been creating virtual reconstructions of synagogues at darmstadt technical university since that firebombing both as a student and now professor in the architecture department . " i do n't remember where i heard this about the arson attack , but i think a couple of minutes afterwards and i got the idea , we have to do something against this , " he told deutsche welle . his idea was to virtually reconstruct some of the synagogues that were destroyed on kristallnacht , or the night of the broken glass , on november 10 , 1938 .
that was one of the most heinous attacks against jews , synagogues and jewish businesses in german history . their efforts culminated in an exhibition in bonn in 2000 . that exhibition has now come to the united states for the first time at the holocaust memorial center zekelman family campus in farmington hills , michigan .
the exhibit opened on august 29 and will run through the end of november . back in 1994 , grellert and his team started with three synagogues in frankfurt .
but he said they quickly realized that the project would n't move as quickly as they hoped as it would take them almost one year to finish a single synagogue . getting the plans the first step was to find blueprints or old photographs showing the synagogue 's floor plan then grellert and his team would reach out to people who remembered the original appearance of the synagogue . " in many synagogues , you have only black-and-white photographs , " grellert said .
" so we ask them if they have remembrance of the colors of the synagogues . " bildunterschrift : cologne 's synagogue was built in a neo-islamic style , recalling centuries-old mosques from there , the students redraw the blueprints into computers to create 3d models .
when the project started back in 1994 , 3d modeling technology was less advanced primitive than today . but in recent years , grellert added , the team has been able to account for the detail of the synagogues decor , including ornate chandeliers , stained-glass windows , and red brick exterior . the end result of all the work is 14 virtually reconstructed synagogues from all over germany presented in an exhibit divided three parts : perception , escalation , and reconstruction . the exhibit starts by putting a context around germany 's anti-semitic laws in the 1930s , followed by the names of the 1,200 places in germany where synagogues were destroyed on kristallnacht . the final room , reconstruction , displays the 14 virtually reconstructed synagogues .
the display begins with the synagogue ’ s exterior then shows the interior with special attention paid to details like the shadows cast by balconies and refracted light rays coming in through the windows . the intricate digital displays recreate the importance the houses of worship held in germany before their destruction , according to stephen goldman , executive director of the holocaust memorial center in farmington hills , in the us state of michigan - where the exhibit is currently located . " these were big , prominent institutions , " he told deutsche welle .
" often looking exactly like the cathedrals across the street and done by prominent and well-known german architects . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's synagogue was built in 1861 and destroyed in 1938 ruined communities goldman added that by destroying the synagogues , the nazis tore apart more than individual buildings . " the destruction of a house of worship is very different than the destruction of a home , or even a school , because this effects a whole population , " he said .
" it 's saying , ' we 're no longer safe in our houses of worship ... in our cities , in the buildings we expect to shelter us and cradle us in safety . " ' but goldman admitted that while the digital reconstructions would not have the significance of an actual house of worship , they could serve as a reminder of what was . " it 's not listening to somebody speak to you , but it reminds you of that person , " he said .
" these are speaking in those styles .
these are speaking in the voices of the past . " those voices spoke powerfully to ruth schnee , who attended the exhibit 's opening in michigan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 09.09.2010 beethoven 's ' blood , sweat and tears ' keep audiences coming back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's music and biography fascinate all generations composer ludwig van beethoven moved the masses with his music and still does today .
as the 2010 beethovenfest gets underway , dw asks what is it about the composer that draws people back to his works decade after decade . skepticism is in order when it comes to claims like " beethoven has been performed more than any other composer ! "
reliable statistics on the issue would be nearly impossible to assemble .
but those who see the great composer as one of the most influential musicians in the world - both then and today - are certainly not far from the truth .
" even today , beethoven remains of contemporary interest across the world , " michael ladenburger , director and curator of the beethoven house museum in bonn , told deutsche welle .
" beethoven 's music has n't been reduced to just a cultural artefact that people occasionally listen to when they 're in a certain mood .
instead , there are people across all societies who would say , ' this music enriches my life in a very personal and direct way .
in a sense , beethoven is necessary for my life . " '
beethoven worldwide there 's no shortage of examples of the composer 's enduring power : in the central african city of kinshasa , a group of amateur musicians founded the region 's first symphony orchestra and performed beethoven .
the composer is also a fixed part of the curriculum in venezuela 's " el sistema " youth program for music education .
even the prisoners in gulags and concentration camps during world war ii banded together and played beethoven 's works as a way to help cope with their anguish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's 2010 beethovenfest showcases international interest in the master composer but why does his music inspire such an impassioned response ?
" it 's partly due to the fact that people know beethoven 's life - the health problems , his deafness , the bad twists of fate and his struggle against all of those things , " said ladenburger .
but that 's not all : " even more than most composers , beethoven exerted an enormous amount of blood , sweat and tears to find the ideal form for his works . "
timeless moral message beethoven composed works for specific occasions or events , but many of his works also give expression to a moral or ethical ideal , and his fans and followers sense that .
that may help explain why beethoven enthusiasts get together and perform his pieces again and again .
but ladenburger does n't support every tradition when it comes to performing beethoven 's compositions .
" it 's regrettable that the ninth symphony is performed so much and often so thoughtlessly .
beethoven would have rolled over in his grave if he knew that people performed the ninth and other works for pleasure , with total disregard for the message behind them . "
millionaire and a hobby fisherman ?
the beethoven house in bonn is world renowned as a place to get to know the composer better .
and ever since the museum put its collection online , more questions about the master musician have come in than ever .
in the beethoven forum , people can ask whatever is on their mind , like whether beethoven liked to fish -lrb- he did n't -rrb- and how he might experience life today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , royalties could save beethoven from the financial problems he once faced according to michael ladenburger , beethoven himself reflected deeply on the question of dealing with fame and being a public figure .
" he asked himself what it meant for him to be an extraordinarily gifted person , and what obligations and practical consequences that brings . "
but ladenburger has reason to believe beethoven would have been able to get by in contemporary society , " and not just because he would n't have to subsist on occasional payments from his publishers anymore .
instead , he 'd be a millionaire several times over from royalties ! "
beethoven makes money for bonn hopefully beethoven would n't be against his hometown profiting today from the heritage of its famous son - both financially and in terms of image .
bonn 's mayor juergen nimptsch confirmed that beethoven brings hefty returns .
" it 's more or less the case that for every euro we invest , three to four come back into the region and stay here in bonn . "
top classical musicians from all over the world are scheduled to perform at the 2010 beethovenfest bonn , including pianist helene grimaud , cellist sol gabetta , conductor kent nagano and many others .
the festival runs from september 10 - october 9 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 09.09.2010 swiss aviators power ahead with solar plane project großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : high in the sky : the ' solar impulse ' does what it does best two months after the ' solar impulse ' flew around the clock using nothing but the energy from the sun as fuel , the minds behind the aircraft say they are gearing up to reach new heights . when the solar-powered plane takes to the skies again sometime later this month , it wo n't be testing the endurance of its batteries , but rather will be making sure that its ground crew is ready to make flights of this kind a success .
andre borschberg , both the pilot of the ' solar impulse ' and one of its leaders , announced this week that the plane would be entering its next testing phase sometime in september .
the plan is to make three short-distance hops over swiss territory - from payerne to geneva , geneva to zurich , zurich to payerne - to see how well the aircraft can be integrated into the flow of everyday business at an international airport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertrand picard and andre borschberg in the hanger borshberg added that the upcoming jaunts are crictical if they are ever to take the plane beyond swiss borders and land at major foreign airports .
" our airplane is quite special , it flies slowly , it is very light and is sensitive to turbulence , " he said .
" we have to know what logistics need to be put in place and to see what kind of collaboration we need to develop with big airports because . "
a training exercise given the plane 's relatively slow cruising speeds - 50 kilometers per hour -lrb- or about 31 mph -rrb- as compared to the standard 250 kilometers per hour -lrb- or 155 mph -rrb- for larger aircraft - the ground crew has time to drive from payerne to geneva and arrive before it lands .
it might sound like a strange exercise on paper , but borschberg insists that it is all part of getting everyone acquainted with the solar-generated newcomer .
" we have to train the team , " borschberg said , " and see what kind of difficulties we have with traffic arriving and departing . "
and that cuts both ways .
it is not only the pilot and the ground crew dedicated to the ' solar impuse ' that have to get used to operating in a very busy environment , but the other aircraft that have to become accustomed to its presence .
the fact that the plane , which has solar panels attached to the 63 meter span of its wings , it is so easily thrown off by turbulence means the time between it landing and taking has to be adapted accordingly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plane on the ground " it is quite difficult for people in the control towers , because they are not used to it , " borschberg said .
" it is an experiment to get their feedback , to see how it works so that when we fly to another international airport next year , we can propose a way to operate that has been tested and in which we have experience . "
commercial potential ?
as yet there is no solid information about exactly where the non-domestic flights might take the ' solar impulse . '
but wherever it goes , there is a good chance it will attract a lot of attention .
the idea of a plane which can fly without spluttering more emissions into the already choking skies , is a welcome thought , both environmentally and economically .
" ten years ago fuel was 10 percent of airlines cost and now it is nearly 30 percent , " geoff van klaveren , aviation expert with the deutsche bank told deutsche welle .
" any kind of alternative fuel is a thing we have to research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky is the limit .
or is it ?
yet anyone hoping to see this state-of-the-art clean technology ground the world 's current airline fleet is in for a long-haul wait .
commercialization , the ' solar impulse ' pilot insists , is still a very small dot on the horizon .
in reference to the decades it took between the wright brothers ' first aircraft success and the first commercial transatlantic flight , he stressed that it is a slow process .
" i think we will have to wait a while before we can do the same with passengers , but we have to start somewhere , " borschberg said .
making history , changing lives and that it has .
in july , ' solar impulse ' became the first aircraft in history to stay in the air for 26 consecutive hours without any fuel .
the plane took off in the early hours of the morning and spent 14 hours in the air during sunlight hours , enough time for its batteries to charge for the night-time portion of the experiment .
bildunterschrift : solar-powered night flight speaking shortly after the landing , swiss adventurer and brainchild of the project bertrand piccard told reporters that the round-the-clock flight had taken them closer to " the myth of perpetual flight . "
but that is not the only goal they have in mind .
both piccard and borschberg believe that to make the world aware of how much can be achieved with just four six kilowatt electric motors , is to open eyes to the possibilities on the ground .
" at this stage the purpose of the project is not so much to develop a commercial application but to show what we can do today with this technology , " borschberg added .
he said that as much as anything it is about making people see how with the right technology they can use less energy yet still maintain the same quality of life .

after a bumpy round one - and an even worse performance a week later - they 'll try to get it together this week . match day three in the bundesliga is upon us , and dw 's team of football freaks are seeking redemption - and hoping that when it comes to picks , it 's a case of third time 's a charm .
-lrb- or at the very least for things to go back to normal . -rrb-
after a weak first round - when , admittedly there 's not much to go on when filling out your bet slip - the bundesliga gods belched up one of their most unexpected sets of results in recent memory : a match day with seven away wins and a bona fide shocker in bayern 's loss to promoted team kaiserslautern .
as you might expect , the prediction squad took a hit -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but still we rise .
friday , september 10 hoffenheim - schalke the footballing playthings of sap billionaire dietmar hopp have burst into the new season at full stride , dispatching bremen at home and handling pauli away .
vedad ibisisevic is back in great form up front and ghana 's world cup run this summer appears to have done defender isaac vorsah a world of good .
the winless schalke are … a work in progress , at best .
but there is reason for hope .
benedikt hoewedes is back from suspension , which will help shore up their creaky back line , and raul no longer has a donkey named edu for his strike partner - rather he 'll have a face familiar to him from madrid in klaas-jan huntelaar .
i like them to snatch a point .
prediction : 1-1 saturday , september 11 borussia dortmund - wolfsburg bildunterschrift : mueller is fast ebcoming the man in munich dortmund have been up and down thus far , laying an egg at home to leverkusen , and then flying high away from home stuttgart .
in mario goetze , they 've unearthed another young german gem and shinji kagawa -lrb- bought for 350,000 euros - $ 446,000 -rrb- is surely the steal of the season .
wolfsburg were unlucky to lose on opening night to bayern , but just plain blew it against mainz , surrendering a three goal lead to lose 4-3 .
taking into account the injured arne friedrich 's continuing absence from the center of defense and a knock that might keep creative maestro diego out of the starting line-up , i ca n't see wolfsburg getting a result in dortmund .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 hamburg - nuremberg hsv 's ruud van nistelrooy has been chewing up bundesliga defenses , notching three goals in his first two games .
nuremberg , meanwhile , just eked out a draw at gladbach and wilted to defeat at home to lowly freiburg .
hamburg should win at a canter .
prediction : hamburg 3-1 borussia moenchengladbach - eintracht frankfurt a tough one to call , this .
if gladbach are half the side they were in their 6-3 demolition of leverkusen in week two , it 's not a contest .
then again , if they revert to their ordinary form , eintracht - who were unfortunate to go down in week one to hanover before being steamrolled by hamburg in week two - have the horses to get a draw , or even win .
home advantage and frankfurt 's injury worries in defense -lrb- vasoski is out , chris is day-to-day -rrb- should tip this for the foals .
prediction : gladbach 2-1 freiburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : van the man is getting his first taste of the millerntor stadium in any derby , observers are meant to " throw out the record books . "
so i will .
despite freiburg having picked up three points to stuttgart 's none so far this season , i reckon baden-wuerttemburg 's big boys just have too much quality to keep on stinking out stadiums every week .
new signing mauro camoranesi will steady the ship in midfield , while cacau will have a big game against a suspect freiburg back line .
prediction : stuttgart 3-1 hanover 96 - bayer leverkusen among the sides with six points after two match days , the reds are surely the most surprising .
but their results have been convincing - they fought eintracht to a stalemate before snatching a late win , and played schalke off the park .
much of this comes down to good transfer dealing which has brought much-needed quality .
emanuel pogatetz and mohamed abdelloue were inexpensive and have done the business , and i expect damarcus beasley -lrb- brought in on a free transfer -rrb- to do the same .
the only trouble is , this week they host leverkusen , who are just too fast up front for their aging defense .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 bayern munich - werder bremen per mertesacker 's injury in germany 's win over azerbaijan this week came at precisely the wrong moment for werder - just in time to weaken its back line for one of its sternest tests of the season in munich .
mikael silvestre , who bremen picked up ahead of the transfer deadline and will now have to throw into the center of defense , will probably get torched by the likes of thomas mueller , ivica olic , and franck ribery .
bremen 's only chance will be to get big games out of new boys wesley and marko arnautovic - which they may well do .
prediction : bayern 4-2 sunday , september 12 mainz - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you hear that lakic ?
dw sports says you 're due to cool off a shock table-topping clash with both sides on six points , this game is likely to see one of the two participants unmasked as a pretender for top-half status .
i see kaiserslautern as the likelier candidate .
the red devils are very solid at the back , but i do n't trust their on-fire hitman srdan lakic -lrb- three goals in two matches -rrb- to stay ablaze much longer .
mainz , on the other hand , have another year of top-flight experience under their collective belt and earned several stripes with their four-goal fight back in wolfsburg in week two .
prediction : mainz 2-1 cologne - st. pauli these two sets of supporters have a " fan friendship " - an odd german custom wherein two clubs ' ultras agree , over a period of years , to get along rather than taunt each other .
with that in mind , as well as each club 's fans ' reputation for liking a drink or four , this game ought to have a party atmosphere .
the teams may well spoil it .
st. pauli 's hell-for leather approach can be entertaining , but is low on ball skill .
and the more defensive-minded cologne , more often than not , makes for putrid viewing .
expect a draw .

andre borschberg , both the pilot of the ' solar impulse ' and one of its leaders , announced this week that the plane would be entering its next testing phase sometime in september .
the plan is to make three short-distance hops over swiss territory - from payerne to geneva , geneva to zurich , zurich to payerne - to see how well the aircraft can be integrated into the flow of everyday business at an international airport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertrand picard and andre borschberg in the hanger borshberg added that the upcoming jaunts are crictical if they are ever to take the plane beyond swiss borders and land at major foreign airports .
" our airplane is quite special , it flies slowly , it is very light and is sensitive to turbulence , " he said .
" we have to know what logistics need to be put in place and to see what kind of collaboration we need to develop with big airports because . "
a training exercise given the plane 's relatively slow cruising speeds - 50 kilometers per hour -lrb- or about 31 mph -rrb- as compared to the standard 250 kilometers per hour -lrb- or 155 mph -rrb- for larger aircraft - the ground crew has time to drive from payerne to geneva and arrive before it lands .
it might sound like a strange exercise on paper , but borschberg insists that it is all part of getting everyone acquainted with the solar-generated newcomer .
" we have to train the team , " borschberg said , " and see what kind of difficulties we have with traffic arriving and departing . "
and that cuts both ways .
it is not only the pilot and the ground crew dedicated to the ' solar impuse ' that have to get used to operating in a very busy environment , but the other aircraft that have to become accustomed to its presence .
the fact that the plane , which has solar panels attached to the 63 meter span of its wings , it is so easily thrown off by turbulence means the time between it landing and taking has to be adapted accordingly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plane on the ground " it is quite difficult for people in the control towers , because they are not used to it , " borschberg said .
" it is an experiment to get their feedback , to see how it works so that when we fly to another international airport next year , we can propose a way to operate that has been tested and in which we have experience . "
commercial potential ?
as yet there is no solid information about exactly where the non-domestic flights might take the ' solar impulse . '
but wherever it goes , there is a good chance it will attract a lot of attention .
the idea of a plane which can fly without spluttering more emissions into the already choking skies , is a welcome thought , both environmentally and economically .
" ten years ago fuel was 10 percent of airlines cost and now it is nearly 30 percent , " geoff van klaveren , aviation expert with the deutsche bank told deutsche welle .
" any kind of alternative fuel is a thing we have to research . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky is the limit .
or is it ?
yet anyone hoping to see this state-of-the-art clean technology ground the world 's current airline fleet is in for a long-haul wait .
commercialization , the ' solar impulse ' pilot insists , is still a very small dot on the horizon .
in reference to the decades it took between the wright brothers ' first aircraft success and the first commercial transatlantic flight , he stressed that it is a slow process .
" i think we will have to wait a while before we can do the same with passengers , but we have to start somewhere , " borschberg said .
making history , changing lives and that it has .
in july , ' solar impulse ' became the first aircraft in history to stay in the air for 26 consecutive hours without any fuel .
the plane took off in the early hours of the morning and spent 14 hours in the air during sunlight hours , enough time for its batteries to charge for the night-time portion of the experiment .
bildunterschrift : solar-powered night flight speaking shortly after the landing , swiss adventurer and brainchild of the project bertrand piccard told reporters that the round-the-clock flight had taken them closer to " the myth of perpetual flight . "
but that is not the only goal they have in mind .
both piccard and borschberg believe that to make the world aware of how much can be achieved with just four six kilowatt electric motors , is to open eyes to the possibilities on the ground .
" at this stage the purpose of the project is not so much to develop a commercial application but to show what we can do today with this technology , " borschberg added .
he said that as much as anything it is about making people see how with the right technology they can use less energy yet still maintain the same quality of life .

but it was a contemporary form of anti-semitism that got the exhibit off the ground . the project started after four neo-nazis firebombed a synagogue in the northern german town of luebeck on the eve of passover in 1994 , according to mark grellert , who has been creating virtual reconstructions of synagogues at darmstadt technical university since that firebombing both as a student and now professor in the architecture department . " i do n't remember where i heard this about the arson attack , but i think a couple of minutes afterwards and i got the idea , we have to do something against this , " he told deutsche welle . his idea was to virtually reconstruct some of the synagogues that were destroyed on kristallnacht , or the night of the broken glass , on november 10 , 1938 .
that was one of the most heinous attacks against jews , synagogues and jewish businesses in german history . their efforts culminated in an exhibition in bonn in 2000 . that exhibition has now come to the united states for the first time at the holocaust memorial center zekelman family campus in farmington hills , michigan .
the exhibit opened on august 29 and will run through the end of november . back in 1994 , grellert and his team started with three synagogues in frankfurt .
but he said they quickly realized that the project would n't move as quickly as they hoped as it would take them almost one year to finish a single synagogue . getting the plans the first step was to find blueprints or old photographs showing the synagogue 's floor plan then grellert and his team would reach out to people who remembered the original appearance of the synagogue . " in many synagogues , you have only black-and-white photographs , " grellert said .
" so we ask them if they have remembrance of the colors of the synagogues . " bildunterschrift : cologne 's synagogue was built in a neo-islamic style , recalling centuries-old mosques from there , the students redraw the blueprints into computers to create 3d models .
when the project started back in 1994 , 3d modeling technology was less advanced primitive than today . but in recent years , grellert added , the team has been able to account for the detail of the synagogues decor , including ornate chandeliers , stained-glass windows , and red brick exterior . the end result of all the work is 14 virtually reconstructed synagogues from all over germany presented in an exhibit divided three parts : perception , escalation , and reconstruction . the exhibit starts by putting a context around germany 's anti-semitic laws in the 1930s , followed by the names of the 1,200 places in germany where synagogues were destroyed on kristallnacht . the final room , reconstruction , displays the 14 virtually reconstructed synagogues .
the display begins with the synagogue ’ s exterior then shows the interior with special attention paid to details like the shadows cast by balconies and refracted light rays coming in through the windows . the intricate digital displays recreate the importance the houses of worship held in germany before their destruction , according to stephen goldman , executive director of the holocaust memorial center in farmington hills , in the us state of michigan - where the exhibit is currently located .

" it 's saying , ' we 're no longer safe in our houses of worship ... in our cities , in the buildings we expect to shelter us and cradle us in safety . " ' but goldman admitted that while the digital reconstructions would not have the significance of an actual house of worship , they could serve as a reminder of what was . " it 's not listening to somebody speak to you , but it reminds you of that person , " he said .
" these are speaking in those styles .
these are speaking in the voices of the past . " those voices spoke powerfully to ruth schnee , who attended the exhibit 's opening in michigan .
originally from duesseldorf , she has lived in the united states since 1939 and vividly remembers kristallnacht . " i remember the synagogue in duesseldorf , which was our synagogue , being put on fire , and the rabbi ran into the building to save the torah , and perished in the building , " she said .
" the fire brigade was trained to protect the adjoining buildings , and not of course the synagogues .
the art , the furniture , everything was demolished .

" ' but goldman admitted that while the digital reconstructions would not have the significance of an actual house of worship , they could serve as a reminder of what was . " it 's not listening to somebody speak to you , but it reminds you of that person , " he said .
" these are speaking in those styles .
these are speaking in the voices of the past . " those voices spoke powerfully to ruth schnee , who attended the exhibit 's opening in michigan .
originally from duesseldorf , she has lived in the united states since 1939 and vividly remembers kristallnacht . " i remember the synagogue in duesseldorf , which was our synagogue , being put on fire , and the rabbi ran into the building to save the torah , and perished in the building , " she said .
" the fire brigade was trained to protect the adjoining buildings , and not of course the synagogues .
the art , the furniture , everything was demolished . " the duesseldorf synagogue has not been recreated by grellert and his team , though they continue to work on the project with his students 10 years after its launch . author : zak rosen -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the military crackdown against the movement intensifies , protests have turned violent . as temperatures soar above 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- in aden , the great port city of south yemen , homes become airless .
daily power cuts leave residents sweating through dark nights .
in a region where resentment of the government in the north has been festering for a decade , such daily indignities are enough to spark fury in the people .
earlier this week thousands took to the streets in protest .
car tyres were burned , property vandalised and gun shots fired .
police were pelted with stones .
according to yemeni officials this came after members of the opposition group known as the southern movement , some of whose factions call for independence from northern yemen , ambushed a military patrol and wounded three soldiers .
the attack followed shortly on from the twice attempted assassination of an army brigade commander by members of the southern movement the week earlier .
in south yemen scenes like these repeat themselves at increasingly shorter intervals .
besieged by conflicts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen 's president ali abdullah saleh is facing growing unrest from his palace in the mountain capital of sanaa president ali abdullah saleh seems besieged by conflicts .
to the north , a recent peace agreement quelling six years of rebellion by the zaidi shia houthi clan , who fight a government they accuse of marginalising them politically as well as economically , has been breaking down , threatening a return to war .
in the unruly tribal strongholds of east yemen saleh 's troops face an al qaeda branch well integrated into the local community and whose failed attempt to bring down a us airliner last christmas day showed they are a menace not just to yemen , but to international security as well .
however , to the government in sanaa , no conflict is more serious than the growing power of the southern movement , whose call for independence from the north threatens the territorial integrity of the state .
economic injustices the key grievance levelled by the southern movement against president saleh is economic : southerners complain bitterly that despite their small numbers , just 3.5 million compared to 20 million living in the north , and despite the south being home to the majority of yemen 's oil and gas fields -lrb- which account for 75 percent of the government 's revenue -rrb- the south has not witnessed anything like the economic growth and development of the north , limited though that is .
the movement accuses the president of favoritism of northerners , working through tribal patronage networks from which southerners are largely excluded , of arbitrary land confiscation and political disenfranchisement .
the grievances date back to the unification between north and south yemen in 1990 , which was viewed by many southern leaders as failed .
they were politically outnumbered by their northern colleagues , the two armies were never integrated and assassinations of southern leaders created a deep mistrust of the north .
after elections in 1993 , leaders of former south yemen called for a new federal constitutional system which would decentralize power .
instead , a year later a brief but bloody civil war erupted with northern troops occupying the south .
in the wake of the victory of north over south , president saleh amended the constitution , removing institutions of joint north-south rule and granting himself power to rule by decree .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yemeni army is coming under increasing attacks from opposition rebels since then , a growing sense injustice has simmered in the south , but it was not until 2007 that the southern movement emerged , coalescing around a group of former south yemen army officers , part of a group of 20,000 military personnel forced into early retirement after the 1994 war , who rose up after their pensions were not paid .
former brigadier nasser al-qawi from the aviation brigade of al-anad air base was one of those officers and is today one of the movement 's leaders .
" the authorities ' refusal to address the issues of the south , the looting of its resources for the benefit of the ruling family and the corruption have led -lsb- the south -rsb- to demand secession from the north , " said al-qawi in an interview .
he insisted that southern movement demonstrations had always been peaceful , but blamed sanaa for a violent response .
" it seems the authorities want to drag us towards violence to find a justification to suppress the movement . " " the language of violence and repression used against the people of the south reflects the failure and inability of the government to provide solutions . -lsb- ... -rsb-
for southerners the dream faded away and turned into a nightmare .
people feel the south is under occupation by the north . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 09.09.2010 beethoven 's ' blood , sweat and tears ' keep audiences coming back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's music and biography fascinate all generations composer ludwig van beethoven moved the masses with his music and still does today .
as the 2010 beethovenfest gets underway , dw asks what is it about the composer that draws people back to his works decade after decade . skepticism is in order when it comes to claims like " beethoven has been performed more than any other composer ! "
reliable statistics on the issue would be nearly impossible to assemble .
but those who see the great composer as one of the most influential musicians in the world - both then and today - are certainly not far from the truth .
" even today , beethoven remains of contemporary interest across the world , " michael ladenburger , director and curator of the beethoven house museum in bonn , told deutsche welle .
" beethoven 's music has n't been reduced to just a cultural artefact that people occasionally listen to when they 're in a certain mood .
instead , there are people across all societies who would say , ' this music enriches my life in a very personal and direct way .
in a sense , beethoven is necessary for my life . " '
beethoven worldwide there 's no shortage of examples of the composer 's enduring power : in the central african city of kinshasa , a group of amateur musicians founded the region 's first symphony orchestra and performed beethoven .
the composer is also a fixed part of the curriculum in venezuela 's " el sistema " youth program for music education .
even the prisoners in gulags and concentration camps during world war ii banded together and played beethoven 's works as a way to help cope with their anguish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's 2010 beethovenfest showcases international interest in the master composer but why does his music inspire such an impassioned response ?
" it 's partly due to the fact that people know beethoven 's life - the health problems , his deafness , the bad twists of fate and his struggle against all of those things , " said ladenburger .
but that 's not all : " even more than most composers , beethoven exerted an enormous amount of blood , sweat and tears to find the ideal form for his works . "
timeless moral message beethoven composed works for specific occasions or events , but many of his works also give expression to a moral or ethical ideal , and his fans and followers sense that .
that may help explain why beethoven enthusiasts get together and perform his pieces again and again .
but ladenburger does n't support every tradition when it comes to performing beethoven 's compositions .
" it 's regrettable that the ninth symphony is performed so much and often so thoughtlessly .
beethoven would have rolled over in his grave if he knew that people performed the ninth and other works for pleasure , with total disregard for the message behind them . "
millionaire and a hobby fisherman ?
the beethoven house in bonn is world renowned as a place to get to know the composer better .
and ever since the museum put its collection online , more questions about the master musician have come in than ever .
in the beethoven forum , people can ask whatever is on their mind , like whether beethoven liked to fish -lrb- he did n't -rrb- and how he might experience life today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , royalties could save beethoven from the financial problems he once faced according to michael ladenburger , beethoven himself reflected deeply on the question of dealing with fame and being a public figure .
" he asked himself what it meant for him to be an extraordinarily gifted person , and what obligations and practical consequences that brings . "
but ladenburger has reason to believe beethoven would have been able to get by in contemporary society , " and not just because he would n't have to subsist on occasional payments from his publishers anymore .
instead , he 'd be a millionaire several times over from royalties ! "
beethoven makes money for bonn hopefully beethoven would n't be against his hometown profiting today from the heritage of its famous son - both financially and in terms of image .
bonn 's mayor juergen nimptsch confirmed that beethoven brings hefty returns .
" it 's more or less the case that for every euro we invest , three to four come back into the region and stay here in bonn . "
top classical musicians from all over the world are scheduled to perform at the 2010 beethovenfest bonn , including pianist helene grimaud , cellist sol gabetta , conductor kent nagano and many others .
the festival runs from september 10 - october 9 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 09.09.2010 dw pundits look to get back on track with bundesliga week three picks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a poor start , dw reckons a big week is in the cards this season , the dw sports team are predicting the results of all bundesliga matches .
after a bumpy round one - and an even worse performance a week later - they 'll try to get it together this week . match day three in the bundesliga is upon us , and dw 's team of football freaks are seeking redemption - and hoping that when it comes to picks , it 's a case of third time 's a charm .
-lrb- or at the very least for things to go back to normal . -rrb-
after a weak first round - when , admittedly there 's not much to go on when filling out your bet slip - the bundesliga gods belched up one of their most unexpected sets of results in recent memory : a match day with seven away wins and a bona fide shocker in bayern 's loss to promoted team kaiserslautern .
as you might expect , the prediction squad took a hit -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but still we rise .
friday , september 10 hoffenheim - schalke the footballing playthings of sap billionaire dietmar hopp have burst into the new season at full stride , dispatching bremen at home and handling pauli away .
vedad ibisisevic is back in great form up front and ghana 's world cup run this summer appears to have done defender isaac vorsah a world of good .
the winless schalke are … a work in progress , at best .
but there is reason for hope .
benedikt hoewedes is back from suspension , which will help shore up their creaky back line , and raul no longer has a donkey named edu for his strike partner - rather he 'll have a face familiar to him from madrid in klaas-jan huntelaar .
i like them to snatch a point .
prediction : 1-1 saturday , september 11 borussia dortmund - wolfsburg bildunterschrift : mueller is fast ebcoming the man in munich dortmund have been up and down thus far , laying an egg at home to leverkusen , and then flying high away from home stuttgart .
in mario goetze , they 've unearthed another young german gem and shinji kagawa -lrb- bought for 350,000 euros - $ 446,000 -rrb- is surely the steal of the season .
wolfsburg were unlucky to lose on opening night to bayern , but just plain blew it against mainz , surrendering a three goal lead to lose 4-3 .
taking into account the injured arne friedrich 's continuing absence from the center of defense and a knock that might keep creative maestro diego out of the starting line-up , i ca n't see wolfsburg getting a result in dortmund .
prediction : dortmund 2-0 hamburg - nuremberg hsv 's ruud van nistelrooy has been chewing up bundesliga defenses , notching three goals in his first two games .
nuremberg , meanwhile , just eked out a draw at gladbach and wilted to defeat at home to lowly freiburg .
hamburg should win at a canter .
prediction : hamburg 3-1 borussia moenchengladbach - eintracht frankfurt a tough one to call , this .
if gladbach are half the side they were in their 6-3 demolition of leverkusen in week two , it 's not a contest .
then again , if they revert to their ordinary form , eintracht - who were unfortunate to go down in week one to hanover before being steamrolled by hamburg in week two - have the horses to get a draw , or even win .
home advantage and frankfurt 's injury worries in defense -lrb- vasoski is out , chris is day-to-day -rrb- should tip this for the foals .
prediction : gladbach 2-1 freiburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : van the man is getting his first taste of the millerntor stadium in any derby , observers are meant to " throw out the record books . "
so i will .
despite freiburg having picked up three points to stuttgart 's none so far this season , i reckon baden-wuerttemburg 's big boys just have too much quality to keep on stinking out stadiums every week .
new signing mauro camoranesi will steady the ship in midfield , while cacau will have a big game against a suspect freiburg back line .
prediction : stuttgart 3-1 hanover 96 - bayer leverkusen among the sides with six points after two match days , the reds are surely the most surprising .
but their results have been convincing - they fought eintracht to a stalemate before snatching a late win , and played schalke off the park .
much of this comes down to good transfer dealing which has brought much-needed quality .
emanuel pogatetz and mohamed abdelloue were inexpensive and have done the business , and i expect damarcus beasley -lrb- brought in on a free transfer -rrb- to do the same .
the only trouble is , this week they host leverkusen , who are just too fast up front for their aging defense .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 bayern munich - werder bremen per mertesacker 's injury in germany 's win over azerbaijan this week came at precisely the wrong moment for werder - just in time to weaken its back line for one of its sternest tests of the season in munich .
mikael silvestre , who bremen picked up ahead of the transfer deadline and will now have to throw into the center of defense , will probably get torched by the likes of thomas mueller , ivica olic , and franck ribery .
bremen 's only chance will be to get big games out of new boys wesley and marko arnautovic - which they may well do .
prediction : bayern 4-2 sunday , september 12 mainz - kaiserslautern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you hear that lakic ?
dw sports says you 're due to cool off a shock table-topping clash with both sides on six points , this game is likely to see one of the two participants unmasked as a pretender for top-half status .
i see kaiserslautern as the likelier candidate .
the red devils are very solid at the back , but i do n't trust their on-fire hitman srdan lakic -lrb- three goals in two matches -rrb- to stay ablaze much longer .
mainz , on the other hand , have another year of top-flight experience under their collective belt and earned several stripes with their four-goal fight back in wolfsburg in week two .
prediction : mainz 2-1 cologne - st. pauli these two sets of supporters have a " fan friendship " - an odd german custom wherein two clubs ' ultras agree , over a period of years , to get along rather than taunt each other .
with that in mind , as well as each club 's fans ' reputation for liking a drink or four , this game ought to have a party atmosphere .
the teams may well spoil it .
st. pauli 's hell-for leather approach can be entertaining , but is low on ball skill .
and the more defensive-minded cologne , more often than not , makes for putrid viewing .
expect a draw .

but it was a contemporary form of anti-semitism that got the exhibit off the ground . the project started after four neo-nazis firebombed a synagogue in the northern german town of luebeck on the eve of passover in 1994 , according to mark grellert , who has been creating virtual reconstructions of synagogues at darmstadt technical university since that firebombing both as a student and now professor in the architecture department . " i do n't remember where i heard this about the arson attack , but i think a couple of minutes afterwards and i got the idea , we have to do something against this , " he told deutsche welle . his idea was to virtually reconstruct some of the synagogues that were destroyed on kristallnacht , or the night of the broken glass , on november 10 , 1938 .
that was one of the most heinous attacks against jews , synagogues and jewish businesses in german history . their efforts culminated in an exhibition in bonn in 2000 . that exhibition has now come to the united states for the first time at the holocaust memorial center zekelman family campus in farmington hills , michigan .
the exhibit opened on august 29 and will run through the end of november . back in 1994 , grellert and his team started with three synagogues in frankfurt .
but he said they quickly realized that the project would n't move as quickly as they hoped as it would take them almost one year to finish a single synagogue . getting the plans the first step was to find blueprints or old photographs showing the synagogue 's floor plan then grellert and his team would reach out to people who remembered the original appearance of the synagogue . " in many synagogues , you have only black-and-white photographs , " grellert said .
" so we ask them if they have remembrance of the colors of the synagogues . " bildunterschrift : cologne 's synagogue was built in a neo-islamic style , recalling centuries-old mosques from there , the students redraw the blueprints into computers to create 3d models .
when the project started back in 1994 , 3d modeling technology was less advanced primitive than today . but in recent years , grellert added , the team has been able to account for the detail of the synagogues decor , including ornate chandeliers , stained-glass windows , and red brick exterior . the end result of all the work is 14 virtually reconstructed synagogues from all over germany presented in an exhibit divided three parts : perception , escalation , and reconstruction . the exhibit starts by putting a context around germany 's anti-semitic laws in the 1930s , followed by the names of the 1,200 places in germany where synagogues were destroyed on kristallnacht . the final room , reconstruction , displays the 14 virtually reconstructed synagogues .
the display begins with the synagogue ’ s exterior then shows the interior with special attention paid to details like the shadows cast by balconies and refracted light rays coming in through the windows . the intricate digital displays recreate the importance the houses of worship held in germany before their destruction , according to stephen goldman , executive director of the holocaust memorial center in farmington hills , in the us state of michigan - where the exhibit is currently located . " these were big , prominent institutions , " he told deutsche welle .
" often looking exactly like the cathedrals across the street and done by prominent and well-known german architects . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne 's synagogue was built in 1861 and destroyed in 1938 ruined communities goldman added that by destroying the synagogues , the nazis tore apart more than individual buildings . " the destruction of a house of worship is very different than the destruction of a home , or even a school , because this effects a whole population , " he said .
" it 's saying , ' we 're no longer safe in our houses of worship ... in our cities , in the buildings we expect to shelter us and cradle us in safety . " ' but goldman admitted that while the digital reconstructions would not have the significance of an actual house of worship , they could serve as a reminder of what was . " it 's not listening to somebody speak to you , but it reminds you of that person , " he said .
" these are speaking in those styles .
these are speaking in the voices of the past . " those voices spoke powerfully to ruth schnee , who attended the exhibit 's opening in michigan .
originally from duesseldorf , she has lived in the united states since 1939 and vividly remembers kristallnacht . " i remember the synagogue in duesseldorf , which was our synagogue , being put on fire , and the rabbi ran into the building to save the torah , and perished in the building , " she said .
" the fire brigade was trained to protect the adjoining buildings , and not of course the synagogues .
the art , the furniture , everything was demolished . " the duesseldorf synagogue has not been recreated by grellert and his team , though they continue to work on the project with his students 10 years after its launch . author : zak rosen -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the 2010 beethovenfest gets underway , dw asks what is it about the composer that draws people back to his works decade after decade . skepticism is in order when it comes to claims like " beethoven has been performed more than any other composer ! "
reliable statistics on the issue would be nearly impossible to assemble .
but those who see the great composer as one of the most influential musicians in the world - both then and today - are certainly not far from the truth .
" even today , beethoven remains of contemporary interest across the world , " michael ladenburger , director and curator of the beethoven house museum in bonn , told deutsche welle .
" beethoven 's music has n't been reduced to just a cultural artefact that people occasionally listen to when they 're in a certain mood .
instead , there are people across all societies who would say , ' this music enriches my life in a very personal and direct way .
in a sense , beethoven is necessary for my life . " '
beethoven worldwide there 's no shortage of examples of the composer 's enduring power : in the central african city of kinshasa , a group of amateur musicians founded the region 's first symphony orchestra and performed beethoven .
the composer is also a fixed part of the curriculum in venezuela 's " el sistema " youth program for music education .
even the prisoners in gulags and concentration camps during world war ii banded together and played beethoven 's works as a way to help cope with their anguish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's 2010 beethovenfest showcases international interest in the master composer but why does his music inspire such an impassioned response ?
" it 's partly due to the fact that people know beethoven 's life - the health problems , his deafness , the bad twists of fate and his struggle against all of those things , " said ladenburger .
but that 's not all : " even more than most composers , beethoven exerted an enormous amount of blood , sweat and tears to find the ideal form for his works . "
timeless moral message beethoven composed works for specific occasions or events , but many of his works also give expression to a moral or ethical ideal , and his fans and followers sense that .
that may help explain why beethoven enthusiasts get together and perform his pieces again and again .
but ladenburger does n't support every tradition when it comes to performing beethoven 's compositions .
" it 's regrettable that the ninth symphony is performed so much and often so thoughtlessly .
beethoven would have rolled over in his grave if he knew that people performed the ninth and other works for pleasure , with total disregard for the message behind them . "
millionaire and a hobby fisherman ?
the beethoven house in bonn is world renowned as a place to get to know the composer better .
and ever since the museum put its collection online , more questions about the master musician have come in than ever .
in the beethoven forum , people can ask whatever is on their mind , like whether beethoven liked to fish -lrb- he did n't -rrb- and how he might experience life today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today , royalties could save beethoven from the financial problems he once faced according to michael ladenburger , beethoven himself reflected deeply on the question of dealing with fame and being a public figure .
" he asked himself what it meant for him to be an extraordinarily gifted person , and what obligations and practical consequences that brings . "
but ladenburger has reason to believe beethoven would have been able to get by in contemporary society , " and not just because he would n't have to subsist on occasional payments from his publishers anymore .
instead , he 'd be a millionaire several times over from royalties ! "
beethoven makes money for bonn hopefully beethoven would n't be against his hometown profiting today from the heritage of its famous son - both financially and in terms of image .
bonn 's mayor juergen nimptsch confirmed that beethoven brings hefty returns .
" it 's more or less the case that for every euro we invest , three to four come back into the region and stay here in bonn . "
top classical musicians from all over the world are scheduled to perform at the 2010 beethovenfest bonn , including pianist helene grimaud , cellist sol gabetta , conductor kent nagano and many others .
the festival runs from september 10 - october 9 .
