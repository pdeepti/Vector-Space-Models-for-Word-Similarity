shortly before ramadan , hamburg deemed the mosque 's extreme islamist ideology as sufficient grounds for a ban . hamburg police early monday morning raided a mosque with a known history of breeding jihadists , city authorities reported .
at 6 a.m.
monday morning 20 police officers reportedly entered the mosque searching for evidence of islamist radicalization .
hamburg 's interior minister , christoph ahlhaus , deemed the group 's islamist ideology reason enough to close the center for good .
" the mosque is now being sealed up , so that the phantom behind the walls on steindamm street has come to an end , " announced ahlhaus , who ordered that the mosque 's community be banned - and the homes of four members of the supporting taiba arab-german culture association searched .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahlhaus called the mosque a ' phantom ' ahlhaus said in a press conference hours after the raid that hamburg could not allow " a point of contact for a group that advocates islamist social order and will not shy away from violence to assert it . " 9/11 notoriety the taiba mosque in hamburg 's st. georg neighborhood received international attention under its former name , al quds , when it became known that the september 11 suicide pilot mohammed attah had used his contacts there to forge a terrorist cell .
according to manfred murck , deputy director of hamburg 's internal intelligence service , the mosque had continued to serve " as a symbolic location for jihadists from all over germany and even abroad , because it had the perpetrators as its nimbus . "
" the mosque also continued to serve as a center of radicalization , " he said . lothar bergmann , head of hamburg 's anti-terrorism unit , referred to the taiba mosque 's leader , syrian-german mamoun darkazanli , as a " preacher of hate , " adding that his teachings and sermons as well as texts published on the community 's website promoted jihad . the investigation had gone on for months as strong evidence was needed to close the house of worship , murck said . bad timing , or strategic timing ? yet , after a decade of suspicion against the mosque , the timing of the raid has come under question , especially considering the proximity to hamburg 's august 25 mayoral election , in which ahlhaus is a prime candidate to win the office . aiman mazyek , secretary general of the central council of muslims in germany , told deutsche welle he also found it " regretful that this -lsb- raid and ban -rsb- had to take place just before ramadan . " " politicians should want to get peaceful muslims on their side ...
maybe they should have tried to do this at a different date , not just before ramadan - and an election , " mazyek added . mazyek , whose organization represents nearly 2,600 muslim communities , also fears that the pursuit of islamists will have a negative impact on peaceful muslims living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the community says it planned to vacate anyway he said studies had proven that the " war on terror " had increased extremist violence against muslims and mosques . staying on guard authorities estimate that hamburg is home to 45 jihad supporters and that around 200 people regularly attended friday services at the mosque , which they believe to have been particularly aggressive in ideology . hamburg 's jihadists have continued to make the news since the world trade center attacks .
authorities say that 11 young muslims went on from the taiba mosque to train in militant camps on the afghan-pakistani border .
one of them , known as rami m. , found his way into a terrorist militia in the region before he was arrested in march 2009 . yet the problem is not specific to hamburg , according to rolf tophoven of the institute for terrorism research and security policy . tophoven said there were centers of radicalization all over germany and europe , but that most - working under the guise of mosques and koran schools - were focused on indoctrination rather than militant training . misorienting muslim youth " not all these cells are looking for a terrorist operation , " he said , adding that germany in particular was threatened by " islamist centers , which are going to infiltrate the minds of young muslim people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear -pipe- 09.08.2010 nagasaki commemorates atomic bombing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : representatives of 32 countries attended the ceremony in nagasaki on 9 aug .
2010 the japanese port of nagasaki has marked 65 years since it was flattened by a us atom bomb , that killed over 70,000 people .
the debate on whether the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki were at all justified rages on . when " little boy " - the first atom bomb - was dropped on hiroshima , the reactions among the scientists who had worked for years on perfecting the technology were mixed . " a few people laughed , a few people cried , most people were silent , " recalled robert oppenheimer , the scientific director of the manhattan project . although his colleagues later said that oppenheimer was triumphant about his part in developing the technology , he is famous for the following quote from hindu mythology : " now i have become death , the destroyer of worlds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert oppenheimer was the wartime director of the manhattan project that developed the atom bomb flash burns , falling debris and radiation sickness nobody had known exactly how devastating the impact would be and what the effect of the atom bomb on humans would be . tens of thousands were killed instantly .
flash or flame burns , falling debris , radiation sickness and other injuries and illness killed even more . us president harry truman was aware of the death and destruction in hiroshima as he made the decision to drop a second bomb - " fat man " - on nagasaki .
the plan was then to drop another in the third week of august and continue until japan surrendered . truman was relentless , announcing " if they do not now accept our terms they can expect a rain of ruin from the air the like of which has never been seen on this earth . " the main term of the potsdam declaration issued on july 26 , 1945 was that japan should surrender unconditionally .
however , sources indicate that the us was aware of how important it was for japan to be able to surrender on one condition – that of retaining the emperor , who some historians argue made it clear was in favor of surrendering . it remains unclear why the one condition that seemed of utmost importance to japan was not included in the declaration especially as after japan 's capitulation , emperor hirohito was allowed to reign on until his death in 1989 . bildunterschrift : survivors of the atomic bombings were called hibakushas sources indicate japan was on verge of surrendering what is clear is that the possibilities of ending the war without recourse to the atom bomb were not fully exhausted . sources show that japan would probably have surrendered after the threatened soviet invasion , which finally began on august 9 , and certainly before the us invasion that was planned for the autumn . yet , not only was hiroshima bombed but nagasaki too .
this is a fact that is greatly troubling to historians and many others , including the pakistani novelist kamila shamsie , whose latest novel burnt shadows has a protagonist who survives the bombing but loses all of her loved ones . " what was important to me , " she told deutsche welle , " was not just that i start with the nuclear bomb but that i start with nagasaki rather than hiroshima , which was something that i 'd been interested in since i was a student in america . " i remember going to a lecture once and someone in the middle of a conversation said : ' well , even those people who justify bombing hiroshima , how do you justify nagasaki three days later ? ' and it was something that really stuck with me : this idea of being able to obliterate a city in a second and to see the photographs of the damage that was done as we know truman did and then three days later to say ' i 'll do that again ' .
it seemed to me that more than anything else , that single moment when the bomb is dropped on nagasaki is to me a kind of acknowledgement that in war there are no limits to what we 'll do to destroy others in the pursuit of victory . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president truman took full responsibility for ordering the atomic bombs be used on japan " one million american lives were saved " the much bandied-about justification for dropping the atomic bombs was that they saved one american million lives .
even today , many americans believe this myth . however , today it is known that even the wildest of official calculations had estimated there would be a maximum of 46,000 american casualties if the us invaded japan . leading historians , such as gar alperowitz , have argued that there is strong evidence to support another reason for dropping the bombs – the desire to frighten the soviets and give the us the " upper hand in diplomatic relations " . hibakushas campaign for nuclear disarmament takai miashita is a hibakusha , " an explosion-affected person " , who volunteers at the nagasaki atomic bomb museum . " i was in class six when the atom bomb was dropped , " he recalls .
" my school was about 40 kilometers away from the epicenter .
but i saw many victims and many of my relatives , who lived in the city , died .
i will never forget this experience .
that 's why i work in this museum . " the us has never apologized for the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki .
today , it is still one of five nuclear powers allowed to have an arsenal by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . however , under president barack obama , who is a strong advocate of a world free of nuclear weapons , the us has revised its policy on the use of atomic weapons and renounced the development of any new ones . this year for the first time , the us ambassador to japan attended the ceremony in hiroshima commemorating the bombing .
nonetheless , no representative from the us attended the commemorations in nagasaki . author : anne thomas editor : disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2010 the japanese port of nagasaki has marked 65 years since it was flattened by a us atom bomb , that killed over 70,000 people .
the debate on whether the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki were at all justified rages on . when " little boy " - the first atom bomb - was dropped on hiroshima , the reactions among the scientists who had worked for years on perfecting the technology were mixed . " a few people laughed , a few people cried , most people were silent , " recalled robert oppenheimer , the scientific director of the manhattan project . although his colleagues later said that oppenheimer was triumphant about his part in developing the technology , he is famous for the following quote from hindu mythology : " now i have become death , the destroyer of worlds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert oppenheimer was the wartime director of the manhattan project that developed the atom bomb flash burns , falling debris and radiation sickness nobody had known exactly how devastating the impact would be and what the effect of the atom bomb on humans would be . tens of thousands were killed instantly .
flash or flame burns , falling debris , radiation sickness and other injuries and illness killed even more . us president harry truman was aware of the death and destruction in hiroshima as he made the decision to drop a second bomb - " fat man " - on nagasaki .
the plan was then to drop another in the third week of august and continue until japan surrendered . truman was relentless , announcing " if they do not now accept our terms they can expect a rain of ruin from the air the like of which has never been seen on this earth . " the main term of the potsdam declaration issued on july 26 , 1945 was that japan should surrender unconditionally .
however , sources indicate that the us was aware of how important it was for japan to be able to surrender on one condition – that of retaining the emperor , who some historians argue made it clear was in favor of surrendering . it remains unclear why the one condition that seemed of utmost importance to japan was not included in the declaration especially as after japan 's capitulation , emperor hirohito was allowed to reign on until his death in 1989 . bildunterschrift : survivors of the atomic bombings were called hibakushas sources indicate japan was on verge of surrendering what is clear is that the possibilities of ending the war without recourse to the atom bomb were not fully exhausted . sources show that japan would probably have surrendered after the threatened soviet invasion , which finally began on august 9 , and certainly before the us invasion that was planned for the autumn . yet , not only was hiroshima bombed but nagasaki too .
this is a fact that is greatly troubling to historians and many others , including the pakistani novelist kamila shamsie , whose latest novel burnt shadows has a protagonist who survives the bombing but loses all of her loved ones . " what was important to me , " she told deutsche welle , " was not just that i start with the nuclear bomb but that i start with nagasaki rather than hiroshima , which was something that i 'd been interested in since i was a student in america . " i remember going to a lecture once and someone in the middle of a conversation said : ' well , even those people who justify bombing hiroshima , how do you justify nagasaki three days later ? ' and it was something that really stuck with me : this idea of being able to obliterate a city in a second and to see the photographs of the damage that was done as we know truman did and then three days later to say ' i 'll do that again ' .
it seemed to me that more than anything else , that single moment when the bomb is dropped on nagasaki is to me a kind of acknowledgement that in war there are no limits to what we 'll do to destroy others in the pursuit of victory . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president truman took full responsibility for ordering the atomic bombs be used on japan " one million american lives were saved " the much bandied-about justification for dropping the atomic bombs was that they saved one american million lives .
even today , many americans believe this myth . however , today it is known that even the wildest of official calculations had estimated there would be a maximum of 46,000 american casualties if the us invaded japan . leading historians , such as gar alperowitz , have argued that there is strong evidence to support another reason for dropping the bombs – the desire to frighten the soviets and give the us the " upper hand in diplomatic relations " . hibakushas campaign for nuclear disarmament takai miashita is a hibakusha , " an explosion-affected person " , who volunteers at the nagasaki atomic bomb museum . " i was in class six when the atom bomb was dropped , " he recalls .
" my school was about 40 kilometers away from the epicenter .
but i saw many victims and many of my relatives , who lived in the city , died .
i will never forget this experience .
that 's why i work in this museum . " the us has never apologized for the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki .
today , it is still one of five nuclear powers allowed to have an arsenal by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . however , under president barack obama , who is a strong advocate of a world free of nuclear weapons , the us has revised its policy on the use of atomic weapons and renounced the development of any new ones . this year for the first time , the us ambassador to japan attended the ceremony in hiroshima commemorating the bombing .

" what was important to me , " she told deutsche welle , " was not just that i start with the nuclear bomb but that i start with nagasaki rather than hiroshima , which was something that i 'd been interested in since i was a student in america . " i remember going to a lecture once and someone in the middle of a conversation said : ' well , even those people who justify bombing hiroshima , how do you justify nagasaki three days later ? ' and it was something that really stuck with me : this idea of being able to obliterate a city in a second and to see the photographs of the damage that was done as we know truman did and then three days later to say ' i 'll do that again ' .
it seemed to me that more than anything else , that single moment when the bomb is dropped on nagasaki is to me a kind of acknowledgement that in war there are no limits to what we 'll do to destroy others in the pursuit of victory .

2010 the japanese port of nagasaki has marked 65 years since it was flattened by a us atom bomb , that killed over 70,000 people .
the debate on whether the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki were at all justified rages on . when " little boy " - the first atom bomb - was dropped on hiroshima , the reactions among the scientists who had worked for years on perfecting the technology were mixed . " a few people laughed , a few people cried , most people were silent , " recalled robert oppenheimer , the scientific director of the manhattan project . although his colleagues later said that oppenheimer was triumphant about his part in developing the technology , he is famous for the following quote from hindu mythology : " now i have become death , the destroyer of worlds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert oppenheimer was the wartime director of the manhattan project that developed the atom bomb flash burns , falling debris and radiation sickness nobody had known exactly how devastating the impact would be and what the effect of the atom bomb on humans would be . tens of thousands were killed instantly .
flash or flame burns , falling debris , radiation sickness and other injuries and illness killed even more . us president harry truman was aware of the death and destruction in hiroshima as he made the decision to drop a second bomb - " fat man " - on nagasaki .
the plan was then to drop another in the third week of august and continue until japan surrendered . truman was relentless , announcing " if they do not now accept our terms they can expect a rain of ruin from the air the like of which has never been seen on this earth . " the main term of the potsdam declaration issued on july 26 , 1945 was that japan should surrender unconditionally .
however , sources indicate that the us was aware of how important it was for japan to be able to surrender on one condition – that of retaining the emperor , who some historians argue made it clear was in favor of surrendering . it remains unclear why the one condition that seemed of utmost importance to japan was not included in the declaration especially as after japan 's capitulation , emperor hirohito was allowed to reign on until his death in 1989 . bildunterschrift : survivors of the atomic bombings were called hibakushas sources indicate japan was on verge of surrendering what is clear is that the possibilities of ending the war without recourse to the atom bomb were not fully exhausted . sources show that japan would probably have surrendered after the threatened soviet invasion , which finally began on august 9 , and certainly before the us invasion that was planned for the autumn . yet , not only was hiroshima bombed but nagasaki too .

now he 's tackling the big screen - with the story of a retired politician . what do former world leaders do once they 've said goodbye to their bodyguards and handed back the keys to the presidential palace ?
some start working on weighty memoirs ; others devote themselves to their favorite charity .
former czech president vaclav havel , on the other hand , is currently directing his first feature film .
based on his most recent play , entitled " leaving , " it tells the story of a politician trying to adjust to a new life after leaving politics .
the main character , vilem rieger , is the former chancellor of an unnamed country and finds himself locked in a battle of wills with his successor , the unsavory vlastik klein .
it 's a " lear " -like contemplation on a politician 's frustrating impotence at finding himself slowly being forced out of his beloved government villa .
inspired by real life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havel 's wife , actress dagmar havlova , stars in the film at a real villa in the town of ceska skalice , in the far north-east of the country , the former president is fulfilling his lifelong dream .
for the next few weeks , he 'll be sitting in the director 's chair , filming the screen version of his play .
i 've been quite surprised at how quick and smooth everything is , " havel told reporters , " i come up with an idea on the set , i tell the person standing next to me about it , and the next day we 're filming it .
it certainly was n't like that when i was president ! "
at first glance , there seem to be many similarities with vaclav havel 's own life .
vilem rieger 's rival and successor is named vlastik klein ; havel 's real-life rival and successor as president is vaclav klaus .
in the family nevertheless , havel has denied that the story is strictly autobiographical , saying he first began toying with the idea back in the 1970 's .
he wrote the main female role - the chancellor 's wife , irena - for his own wife , actress dagmar havlova .
" it 's obviously a real honor to play the part , but i have to point out that vaclav wrote the role for me , not about me , " commented havlova .
" i was there when he wrote the script , i remember reading the first draft , so i 'm so happy to finally get the chance to act in it . "
vaclav havel 's resume is already impressive : world-renowned playwright , anti-communist dissident , denim-clad revolutionary , and , of course , president of his country for more than a decade .
now , at the tender age of 73 , he 's adding another string to his bow and , as he explained , film is very much in his blood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havel says directing a film is more efficient than politics " i come from a filmmaking family ; my uncle basically founded the czech cinema industry , so i grew up around film people , " said havel .
" so i always wanted to be a film director , but the political atmosphere in the 50 's and 60 's meant i was n't allowed to go to film school . "
a daring director havel has been involved in theater for most of his adult life , from the 1950 's onwards , and many of the roles in " leaving " have been filled with his close friends from the business , including well-known czech actress eva holubova .
" vaclav havel , for me , is not only president ; he is vaclav havel , " said holubova .
" he 's a very clever director , a very funny director , and he is n't afraid - never . "
filming is scheduled to be completed on august 21 , the anniversary of the soviet-led invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 . reviews for the stage version of " leaving " were mixed , with some critics saying it was nowhere near as good as havel 's earlier work .

i 've been quite surprised at how quick and smooth everything is , " havel told reporters , " i come up with an idea on the set , i tell the person standing next to me about it , and the next day we 're filming it .

in the family nevertheless , havel has denied that the story is strictly autobiographical , saying he first began toying with the idea back in the 1970 's .
he wrote the main female role - the chancellor 's wife , irena - for his own wife , actress dagmar havlova .
" it 's obviously a real honor to play the part , but i have to point out that vaclav wrote the role for me , not about me , " commented havlova .

shortly before ramadan , hamburg deemed the mosque 's extreme islamist ideology as sufficient grounds for a ban . hamburg police early monday morning raided a mosque with a known history of breeding jihadists , city authorities reported .
at 6 a.m.
monday morning 20 police officers reportedly entered the mosque searching for evidence of islamist radicalization .
hamburg 's interior minister , christoph ahlhaus , deemed the group 's islamist ideology reason enough to close the center for good .
" the mosque is now being sealed up , so that the phantom behind the walls on steindamm street has come to an end , " announced ahlhaus , who ordered that the mosque 's community be banned - and the homes of four members of the supporting taiba arab-german culture association searched .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahlhaus called the mosque a ' phantom ' ahlhaus said in a press conference hours after the raid that hamburg could not allow " a point of contact for a group that advocates islamist social order and will not shy away from violence to assert it . " 9/11 notoriety the taiba mosque in hamburg 's st. georg neighborhood received international attention under its former name , al quds , when it became known that the september 11 suicide pilot mohammed attah had used his contacts there to forge a terrorist cell .
according to manfred murck , deputy director of hamburg 's internal intelligence service , the mosque had continued to serve " as a symbolic location for jihadists from all over germany and even abroad , because it had the perpetrators as its nimbus . "
" the mosque also continued to serve as a center of radicalization , " he said . lothar bergmann , head of hamburg 's anti-terrorism unit , referred to the taiba mosque 's leader , syrian-german mamoun darkazanli , as a " preacher of hate , " adding that his teachings and sermons as well as texts published on the community 's website promoted jihad . the investigation had gone on for months as strong evidence was needed to close the house of worship , murck said . bad timing , or strategic timing ? yet , after a decade of suspicion against the mosque , the timing of the raid has come under question , especially considering the proximity to hamburg 's august 25 mayoral election , in which ahlhaus is a prime candidate to win the office . aiman mazyek , secretary general of the central council of muslims in germany , told deutsche welle he also found it " regretful that this -lsb- raid and ban -rsb- had to take place just before ramadan . " " politicians should want to get peaceful muslims on their side ...
maybe they should have tried to do this at a different date , not just before ramadan - and an election , " mazyek added . mazyek , whose organization represents nearly 2,600 muslim communities , also fears that the pursuit of islamists will have a negative impact on peaceful muslims living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the community says it planned to vacate anyway he said studies had proven that the " war on terror " had increased extremist violence against muslims and mosques . staying on guard authorities estimate that hamburg is home to 45 jihad supporters and that around 200 people regularly attended friday services at the mosque , which they believe to have been particularly aggressive in ideology . hamburg 's jihadists have continued to make the news since the world trade center attacks .
authorities say that 11 young muslims went on from the taiba mosque to train in militant camps on the afghan-pakistani border .
one of them , known as rami m. , found his way into a terrorist militia in the region before he was arrested in march 2009 . yet the problem is not specific to hamburg , according to rolf tophoven of the institute for terrorism research and security policy . tophoven said there were centers of radicalization all over germany and europe , but that most - working under the guise of mosques and koran schools - were focused on indoctrination rather than militant training . misorienting muslim youth " not all these cells are looking for a terrorist operation , " he said , adding that germany in particular was threatened by " islamist centers , which are going to infiltrate the minds of young muslim people .

shortly before ramadan , hamburg deemed the mosque 's extreme islamist ideology as sufficient grounds for a ban . hamburg police early monday morning raided a mosque with a known history of breeding jihadists , city authorities reported .
at 6 a.m.
monday morning 20 police officers reportedly entered the mosque searching for evidence of islamist radicalization .
hamburg 's interior minister , christoph ahlhaus , deemed the group 's islamist ideology reason enough to close the center for good .
" the mosque is now being sealed up , so that the phantom behind the walls on steindamm street has come to an end , " announced ahlhaus , who ordered that the mosque 's community be banned - and the homes of four members of the supporting taiba arab-german culture association searched .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahlhaus called the mosque a ' phantom ' ahlhaus said in a press conference hours after the raid that hamburg could not allow " a point of contact for a group that advocates islamist social order and will not shy away from violence to assert it . " 9/11 notoriety the taiba mosque in hamburg 's st. georg neighborhood received international attention under its former name , al quds , when it became known that the september 11 suicide pilot mohammed attah had used his contacts there to forge a terrorist cell .
according to manfred murck , deputy director of hamburg 's internal intelligence service , the mosque had continued to serve " as a symbolic location for jihadists from all over germany and even abroad , because it had the perpetrators as its nimbus . "
" the mosque also continued to serve as a center of radicalization , " he said . lothar bergmann , head of hamburg 's anti-terrorism unit , referred to the taiba mosque 's leader , syrian-german mamoun darkazanli , as a " preacher of hate , " adding that his teachings and sermons as well as texts published on the community 's website promoted jihad . the investigation had gone on for months as strong evidence was needed to close the house of worship , murck said . bad timing , or strategic timing ? yet , after a decade of suspicion against the mosque , the timing of the raid has come under question , especially considering the proximity to hamburg 's august 25 mayoral election , in which ahlhaus is a prime candidate to win the office . aiman mazyek , secretary general of the central council of muslims in germany , told deutsche welle he also found it " regretful that this -lsb- raid and ban -rsb- had to take place just before ramadan . " " politicians should want to get peaceful muslims on their side ...
maybe they should have tried to do this at a different date , not just before ramadan - and an election , " mazyek added . mazyek , whose organization represents nearly 2,600 muslim communities , also fears that the pursuit of islamists will have a negative impact on peaceful muslims living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the community says it planned to vacate anyway he said studies had proven that the " war on terror " had increased extremist violence against muslims and mosques . staying on guard authorities estimate that hamburg is home to 45 jihad supporters and that around 200 people regularly attended friday services at the mosque , which they believe to have been particularly aggressive in ideology . hamburg 's jihadists have continued to make the news since the world trade center attacks .

" i am convinced that at the end of your investigation , it will become clear that the state of israel and the idf -lrb- israeli defense forces -rrb- acted in accordance with international law , " netanyahu told members of the tirkel commission as he began testifying about the raid .
netanyahu was the first witness to testify at the internal investigation , which was set up following intense international pressure on the israeli government following the commando raid in may . the raid , on six ships attempting to break a naval blockade of the gaza strip , killed nine turkish activists and wounded many others .

" the turkish government did not consider the confrontation between turkish activists and israel to be against its interests . "
netanyahu added that he ordered troops to make a " supreme effort " to avoid harming any passengers on board the aid ships .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 09.08.2010 hamburg authorities shut down mosque suspected of radicalization großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police only found one man in the mosque in their 6 a.m. raid authorities in hamburg raided and shut down a mosque visited by september 11 jihadists on monday .
shortly before ramadan , hamburg deemed the mosque 's extreme islamist ideology as sufficient grounds for a ban . hamburg police early monday morning raided a mosque with a known history of breeding jihadists , city authorities reported .
at 6 a.m.
monday morning 20 police officers reportedly entered the mosque searching for evidence of islamist radicalization .
hamburg 's interior minister , christoph ahlhaus , deemed the group 's islamist ideology reason enough to close the center for good .
" the mosque is now being sealed up , so that the phantom behind the walls on steindamm street has come to an end , " announced ahlhaus , who ordered that the mosque 's community be banned - and the homes of four members of the supporting taiba arab-german culture association searched .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahlhaus called the mosque a ' phantom ' ahlhaus said in a press conference hours after the raid that hamburg could not allow " a point of contact for a group that advocates islamist social order and will not shy away from violence to assert it . " 9/11 notoriety the taiba mosque in hamburg 's st. georg neighborhood received international attention under its former name , al quds , when it became known that the september 11 suicide pilot mohammed attah had used his contacts there to forge a terrorist cell .
according to manfred murck , deputy director of hamburg 's internal intelligence service , the mosque had continued to serve " as a symbolic location for jihadists from all over germany and even abroad , because it had the perpetrators as its nimbus . "
" the mosque also continued to serve as a center of radicalization , " he said . lothar bergmann , head of hamburg 's anti-terrorism unit , referred to the taiba mosque 's leader , syrian-german mamoun darkazanli , as a " preacher of hate , " adding that his teachings and sermons as well as texts published on the community 's website promoted jihad . the investigation had gone on for months as strong evidence was needed to close the house of worship , murck said . bad timing , or strategic timing ? yet , after a decade of suspicion against the mosque , the timing of the raid has come under question , especially considering the proximity to hamburg 's august 25 mayoral election , in which ahlhaus is a prime candidate to win the office . aiman mazyek , secretary general of the central council of muslims in germany , told deutsche welle he also found it " regretful that this -lsb- raid and ban -rsb- had to take place just before ramadan . " " politicians should want to get peaceful muslims on their side ...
maybe they should have tried to do this at a different date , not just before ramadan - and an election , " mazyek added . mazyek , whose organization represents nearly 2,600 muslim communities , also fears that the pursuit of islamists will have a negative impact on peaceful muslims living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the community says it planned to vacate anyway he said studies had proven that the " war on terror " had increased extremist violence against muslims and mosques . staying on guard authorities estimate that hamburg is home to 45 jihad supporters and that around 200 people regularly attended friday services at the mosque , which they believe to have been particularly aggressive in ideology . hamburg 's jihadists have continued to make the news since the world trade center attacks .
authorities say that 11 young muslims went on from the taiba mosque to train in militant camps on the afghan-pakistani border .
one of them , known as rami m. , found his way into a terrorist militia in the region before he was arrested in march 2009 . yet the problem is not specific to hamburg , according to rolf tophoven of the institute for terrorism research and security policy . tophoven said there were centers of radicalization all over germany and europe , but that most - working under the guise of mosques and koran schools - were focused on indoctrination rather than militant training . misorienting muslim youth " not all these cells are looking for a terrorist operation , " he said , adding that germany in particular was threatened by " islamist centers , which are going to infiltrate the minds of young muslim people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu askar is a known jihadist , formerly from hamburg " if you have a young muslim student , who is not centralized in his family , who is looking for orientation , and this man falls in the hands of a radical imam or scholar , then often he will leave his family and look for jihad training in afghanistan , and especially on the afghan-pakistani border on the pakistani side , " tophoven said . furthermore , he added , local terrorist cells in europe had become more sophisticated and no longer needed operational orders from above . " they know how to recruit perpetrators .
the ideological framework is the credo of osama bin laden : every good muslim has the duty to fight the so-called non-muslim community . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 09.08.2010 hamburg authorities shut down mosque suspected of radicalization großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police only found one man in the mosque in their 6 a.m. raid authorities in hamburg raided and shut down a mosque visited by september 11 jihadists on monday .
shortly before ramadan , hamburg deemed the mosque 's extreme islamist ideology as sufficient grounds for a ban . hamburg police early monday morning raided a mosque with a known history of breeding jihadists , city authorities reported .
at 6 a.m.
monday morning 20 police officers reportedly entered the mosque searching for evidence of islamist radicalization .
hamburg 's interior minister , christoph ahlhaus , deemed the group 's islamist ideology reason enough to close the center for good .
" the mosque is now being sealed up , so that the phantom behind the walls on steindamm street has come to an end , " announced ahlhaus , who ordered that the mosque 's community be banned - and the homes of four members of the supporting taiba arab-german culture association searched .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahlhaus called the mosque a ' phantom ' ahlhaus said in a press conference hours after the raid that hamburg could not allow " a point of contact for a group that advocates islamist social order and will not shy away from violence to assert it . " 9/11 notoriety the taiba mosque in hamburg 's st. georg neighborhood received international attention under its former name , al quds , when it became known that the september 11 suicide pilot mohammed attah had used his contacts there to forge a terrorist cell .
according to manfred murck , deputy director of hamburg 's internal intelligence service , the mosque had continued to serve " as a symbolic location for jihadists from all over germany and even abroad , because it had the perpetrators as its nimbus . "
" the mosque also continued to serve as a center of radicalization , " he said . lothar bergmann , head of hamburg 's anti-terrorism unit , referred to the taiba mosque 's leader , syrian-german mamoun darkazanli , as a " preacher of hate , " adding that his teachings and sermons as well as texts published on the community 's website promoted jihad . the investigation had gone on for months as strong evidence was needed to close the house of worship , murck said . bad timing , or strategic timing ? yet , after a decade of suspicion against the mosque , the timing of the raid has come under question , especially considering the proximity to hamburg 's august 25 mayoral election , in which ahlhaus is a prime candidate to win the office . aiman mazyek , secretary general of the central council of muslims in germany , told deutsche welle he also found it " regretful that this -lsb- raid and ban -rsb- had to take place just before ramadan . " " politicians should want to get peaceful muslims on their side ...
maybe they should have tried to do this at a different date , not just before ramadan - and an election , " mazyek added . mazyek , whose organization represents nearly 2,600 muslim communities , also fears that the pursuit of islamists will have a negative impact on peaceful muslims living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the community says it planned to vacate anyway he said studies had proven that the " war on terror " had increased extremist violence against muslims and mosques . staying on guard authorities estimate that hamburg is home to 45 jihad supporters and that around 200 people regularly attended friday services at the mosque , which they believe to have been particularly aggressive in ideology . hamburg 's jihadists have continued to make the news since the world trade center attacks .
authorities say that 11 young muslims went on from the taiba mosque to train in militant camps on the afghan-pakistani border .
one of them , known as rami m. , found his way into a terrorist militia in the region before he was arrested in march 2009 . yet the problem is not specific to hamburg , according to rolf tophoven of the institute for terrorism research and security policy . tophoven said there were centers of radicalization all over germany and europe , but that most - working under the guise of mosques and koran schools - were focused on indoctrination rather than militant training . misorienting muslim youth " not all these cells are looking for a terrorist operation , " he said , adding that germany in particular was threatened by " islamist centers , which are going to infiltrate the minds of young muslim people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu askar is a known jihadist , formerly from hamburg " if you have a young muslim student , who is not centralized in his family , who is looking for orientation , and this man falls in the hands of a radical imam or scholar , then often he will leave his family and look for jihad training in afghanistan , and especially on the afghan-pakistani border on the pakistani side , " tophoven said . furthermore , he added , local terrorist cells in europe had become more sophisticated and no longer needed operational orders from above . " they know how to recruit perpetrators .
the ideological framework is the credo of osama bin laden : every good muslim has the duty to fight the so-called non-muslim community . "

2010 the japanese port of nagasaki has marked 65 years since it was flattened by a us atom bomb , that killed over 70,000 people .
the debate on whether the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki were at all justified rages on . when " little boy " - the first atom bomb - was dropped on hiroshima , the reactions among the scientists who had worked for years on perfecting the technology were mixed . " a few people laughed , a few people cried , most people were silent , " recalled robert oppenheimer , the scientific director of the manhattan project . although his colleagues later said that oppenheimer was triumphant about his part in developing the technology , he is famous for the following quote from hindu mythology : " now i have become death , the destroyer of worlds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert oppenheimer was the wartime director of the manhattan project that developed the atom bomb flash burns , falling debris and radiation sickness nobody had known exactly how devastating the impact would be and what the effect of the atom bomb on humans would be . tens of thousands were killed instantly .
flash or flame burns , falling debris , radiation sickness and other injuries and illness killed even more . us president harry truman was aware of the death and destruction in hiroshima as he made the decision to drop a second bomb - " fat man " - on nagasaki .
the plan was then to drop another in the third week of august and continue until japan surrendered . truman was relentless , announcing " if they do not now accept our terms they can expect a rain of ruin from the air the like of which has never been seen on this earth . " the main term of the potsdam declaration issued on july 26 , 1945 was that japan should surrender unconditionally .
however , sources indicate that the us was aware of how important it was for japan to be able to surrender on one condition – that of retaining the emperor , who some historians argue made it clear was in favor of surrendering . it remains unclear why the one condition that seemed of utmost importance to japan was not included in the declaration especially as after japan 's capitulation , emperor hirohito was allowed to reign on until his death in 1989 . bildunterschrift : survivors of the atomic bombings were called hibakushas sources indicate japan was on verge of surrendering what is clear is that the possibilities of ending the war without recourse to the atom bomb were not fully exhausted . sources show that japan would probably have surrendered after the threatened soviet invasion , which finally began on august 9 , and certainly before the us invasion that was planned for the autumn . yet , not only was hiroshima bombed but nagasaki too .
this is a fact that is greatly troubling to historians and many others , including the pakistani novelist kamila shamsie , whose latest novel burnt shadows has a protagonist who survives the bombing but loses all of her loved ones . " what was important to me , " she told deutsche welle , " was not just that i start with the nuclear bomb but that i start with nagasaki rather than hiroshima , which was something that i 'd been interested in since i was a student in america . " i remember going to a lecture once and someone in the middle of a conversation said : ' well , even those people who justify bombing hiroshima , how do you justify nagasaki three days later ? ' and it was something that really stuck with me : this idea of being able to obliterate a city in a second and to see the photographs of the damage that was done as we know truman did and then three days later to say ' i 'll do that again ' .
it seemed to me that more than anything else , that single moment when the bomb is dropped on nagasaki is to me a kind of acknowledgement that in war there are no limits to what we 'll do to destroy others in the pursuit of victory . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president truman took full responsibility for ordering the atomic bombs be used on japan " one million american lives were saved " the much bandied-about justification for dropping the atomic bombs was that they saved one american million lives .
even today , many americans believe this myth . however , today it is known that even the wildest of official calculations had estimated there would be a maximum of 46,000 american casualties if the us invaded japan . leading historians , such as gar alperowitz , have argued that there is strong evidence to support another reason for dropping the bombs – the desire to frighten the soviets and give the us the " upper hand in diplomatic relations " . hibakushas campaign for nuclear disarmament takai miashita is a hibakusha , " an explosion-affected person " , who volunteers at the nagasaki atomic bomb museum . " i was in class six when the atom bomb was dropped , " he recalls .
" my school was about 40 kilometers away from the epicenter .
but i saw many victims and many of my relatives , who lived in the city , died .
i will never forget this experience .

today , it is still one of five nuclear powers allowed to have an arsenal by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . however , under president barack obama , who is a strong advocate of a world free of nuclear weapons , the us has revised its policy on the use of atomic weapons and renounced the development of any new ones . this year for the first time , the us ambassador to japan attended the ceremony in hiroshima commemorating the bombing .

2010 the japanese port of nagasaki has marked 65 years since it was flattened by a us atom bomb , that killed over 70,000 people .
the debate on whether the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki were at all justified rages on . when " little boy " - the first atom bomb - was dropped on hiroshima , the reactions among the scientists who had worked for years on perfecting the technology were mixed . " a few people laughed , a few people cried , most people were silent , " recalled robert oppenheimer , the scientific director of the manhattan project . although his colleagues later said that oppenheimer was triumphant about his part in developing the technology , he is famous for the following quote from hindu mythology : " now i have become death , the destroyer of worlds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert oppenheimer was the wartime director of the manhattan project that developed the atom bomb flash burns , falling debris and radiation sickness nobody had known exactly how devastating the impact would be and what the effect of the atom bomb on humans would be . tens of thousands were killed instantly .
flash or flame burns , falling debris , radiation sickness and other injuries and illness killed even more . us president harry truman was aware of the death and destruction in hiroshima as he made the decision to drop a second bomb - " fat man " - on nagasaki .
the plan was then to drop another in the third week of august and continue until japan surrendered . truman was relentless , announcing " if they do not now accept our terms they can expect a rain of ruin from the air the like of which has never been seen on this earth . " the main term of the potsdam declaration issued on july 26 , 1945 was that japan should surrender unconditionally .
however , sources indicate that the us was aware of how important it was for japan to be able to surrender on one condition – that of retaining the emperor , who some historians argue made it clear was in favor of surrendering . it remains unclear why the one condition that seemed of utmost importance to japan was not included in the declaration especially as after japan 's capitulation , emperor hirohito was allowed to reign on until his death in 1989 . bildunterschrift : survivors of the atomic bombings were called hibakushas sources indicate japan was on verge of surrendering what is clear is that the possibilities of ending the war without recourse to the atom bomb were not fully exhausted . sources show that japan would probably have surrendered after the threatened soviet invasion , which finally began on august 9 , and certainly before the us invasion that was planned for the autumn . yet , not only was hiroshima bombed but nagasaki too .
this is a fact that is greatly troubling to historians and many others , including the pakistani novelist kamila shamsie , whose latest novel burnt shadows has a protagonist who survives the bombing but loses all of her loved ones . " what was important to me , " she told deutsche welle , " was not just that i start with the nuclear bomb but that i start with nagasaki rather than hiroshima , which was something that i 'd been interested in since i was a student in america . " i remember going to a lecture once and someone in the middle of a conversation said : ' well , even those people who justify bombing hiroshima , how do you justify nagasaki three days later ? ' and it was something that really stuck with me : this idea of being able to obliterate a city in a second and to see the photographs of the damage that was done as we know truman did and then three days later to say ' i 'll do that again ' .
it seemed to me that more than anything else , that single moment when the bomb is dropped on nagasaki is to me a kind of acknowledgement that in war there are no limits to what we 'll do to destroy others in the pursuit of victory . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president truman took full responsibility for ordering the atomic bombs be used on japan " one million american lives were saved " the much bandied-about justification for dropping the atomic bombs was that they saved one american million lives .
even today , many americans believe this myth . however , today it is known that even the wildest of official calculations had estimated there would be a maximum of 46,000 american casualties if the us invaded japan . leading historians , such as gar alperowitz , have argued that there is strong evidence to support another reason for dropping the bombs – the desire to frighten the soviets and give the us the " upper hand in diplomatic relations " . hibakushas campaign for nuclear disarmament takai miashita is a hibakusha , " an explosion-affected person " , who volunteers at the nagasaki atomic bomb museum . " i was in class six when the atom bomb was dropped , " he recalls .

foreign demand is credited with helping to boost growth in europe 's biggest economy .
germany , the world 's second-biggest exporter after china , showed provisional reports of exports of just over 86.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 115 billion -rrb- for the month - the highest level since october 2008 .
exports to germany 's 15 eurozone partners climbed 22 percent year-on-year in june , while exports to countries outside the european union soared by 37.3 percent annually .
the figures were up 28.5 percent compared with june 2009 , and have bolstered the euro single currency after months of pressure on european economies .
the euro had slumped to a four-year low against the dollar in june amid fears the debt crisis afflicting a handful of european countries would hamper the recovery from the financial crisis .

now he 's tackling the big screen - with the story of a retired politician . what do former world leaders do once they 've said goodbye to their bodyguards and handed back the keys to the presidential palace ?
some start working on weighty memoirs ; others devote themselves to their favorite charity .
former czech president vaclav havel , on the other hand , is currently directing his first feature film .
based on his most recent play , entitled " leaving , " it tells the story of a politician trying to adjust to a new life after leaving politics .
the main character , vilem rieger , is the former chancellor of an unnamed country and finds himself locked in a battle of wills with his successor , the unsavory vlastik klein .
it 's a " lear " -like contemplation on a politician 's frustrating impotence at finding himself slowly being forced out of his beloved government villa .
inspired by real life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havel 's wife , actress dagmar havlova , stars in the film at a real villa in the town of ceska skalice , in the far north-east of the country , the former president is fulfilling his lifelong dream .
for the next few weeks , he 'll be sitting in the director 's chair , filming the screen version of his play .
i 've been quite surprised at how quick and smooth everything is , " havel told reporters , " i come up with an idea on the set , i tell the person standing next to me about it , and the next day we 're filming it .
it certainly was n't like that when i was president ! "
at first glance , there seem to be many similarities with vaclav havel 's own life .
vilem rieger 's rival and successor is named vlastik klein ; havel 's real-life rival and successor as president is vaclav klaus .
in the family nevertheless , havel has denied that the story is strictly autobiographical , saying he first began toying with the idea back in the 1970 's .
he wrote the main female role - the chancellor 's wife , irena - for his own wife , actress dagmar havlova .
" it 's obviously a real honor to play the part , but i have to point out that vaclav wrote the role for me , not about me , " commented havlova .
" i was there when he wrote the script , i remember reading the first draft , so i 'm so happy to finally get the chance to act in it . "
vaclav havel 's resume is already impressive : world-renowned playwright , anti-communist dissident , denim-clad revolutionary , and , of course , president of his country for more than a decade .
now , at the tender age of 73 , he 's adding another string to his bow and , as he explained , film is very much in his blood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havel says directing a film is more efficient than politics " i come from a filmmaking family ; my uncle basically founded the czech cinema industry , so i grew up around film people , " said havel .
" so i always wanted to be a film director , but the political atmosphere in the 50 's and 60 's meant i was n't allowed to go to film school . "
a daring director havel has been involved in theater for most of his adult life , from the 1950 's onwards , and many of the roles in " leaving " have been filled with his close friends from the business , including well-known czech actress eva holubova .
" vaclav havel , for me , is not only president ; he is vaclav havel , " said holubova .
" he 's a very clever director , a very funny director , and he is n't afraid - never . "
filming is scheduled to be completed on august 21 , the anniversary of the soviet-led invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 . reviews for the stage version of " leaving " were mixed , with some critics saying it was nowhere near as good as havel 's earlier work .

now he 's tackling the big screen - with the story of a retired politician . what do former world leaders do once they 've said goodbye to their bodyguards and handed back the keys to the presidential palace ?
some start working on weighty memoirs ; others devote themselves to their favorite charity .
former czech president vaclav havel , on the other hand , is currently directing his first feature film .
based on his most recent play , entitled " leaving , " it tells the story of a politician trying to adjust to a new life after leaving politics .
the main character , vilem rieger , is the former chancellor of an unnamed country and finds himself locked in a battle of wills with his successor , the unsavory vlastik klein .
it 's a " lear " -like contemplation on a politician 's frustrating impotence at finding himself slowly being forced out of his beloved government villa .
inspired by real life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havel 's wife , actress dagmar havlova , stars in the film at a real villa in the town of ceska skalice , in the far north-east of the country , the former president is fulfilling his lifelong dream .
for the next few weeks , he 'll be sitting in the director 's chair , filming the screen version of his play .
i 've been quite surprised at how quick and smooth everything is , " havel told reporters , " i come up with an idea on the set , i tell the person standing next to me about it , and the next day we 're filming it .
it certainly was n't like that when i was president ! "
at first glance , there seem to be many similarities with vaclav havel 's own life .
vilem rieger 's rival and successor is named vlastik klein ; havel 's real-life rival and successor as president is vaclav klaus .
in the family nevertheless , havel has denied that the story is strictly autobiographical , saying he first began toying with the idea back in the 1970 's .
he wrote the main female role - the chancellor 's wife , irena - for his own wife , actress dagmar havlova .
" it 's obviously a real honor to play the part , but i have to point out that vaclav wrote the role for me , not about me , " commented havlova .
" i was there when he wrote the script , i remember reading the first draft , so i 'm so happy to finally get the chance to act in it . "
vaclav havel 's resume is already impressive : world-renowned playwright , anti-communist dissident , denim-clad revolutionary , and , of course , president of his country for more than a decade .
now , at the tender age of 73 , he 's adding another string to his bow and , as he explained , film is very much in his blood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havel says directing a film is more efficient than politics " i come from a filmmaking family ; my uncle basically founded the czech cinema industry , so i grew up around film people , " said havel .
" so i always wanted to be a film director , but the political atmosphere in the 50 's and 60 's meant i was n't allowed to go to film school . "
a daring director havel has been involved in theater for most of his adult life , from the 1950 's onwards , and many of the roles in " leaving " have been filled with his close friends from the business , including well-known czech actress eva holubova .
" vaclav havel , for me , is not only president ; he is vaclav havel , " said holubova .
" he 's a very clever director , a very funny director , and he is n't afraid - never . "
filming is scheduled to be completed on august 21 , the anniversary of the soviet-led invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 . reviews for the stage version of " leaving " were mixed , with some critics saying it was nowhere near as good as havel 's earlier work .
but vaclav havel 's uncle , who built czechoslovakia 's first film studios , and his grandfather , who built prague 's first cinema , would no doubt be proud . author : rob cameron , ceska skalice editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de medicine -pipe- 09.08.2010 german scientists discover ' needle-free ' malaria vaccine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : approximately half of all humans live in areas of the world threatened by malaria by combining antibiotics and malaria-infected mosquitos , researchers find that mice are protected .
human clinical trials will be just around the corner . deep in a lab , in carefully sealed incubators , mosquitos , which normally are malaria carriers , may this time actually be part of the solution .
kai matuschewski and his research team from the max planck institute for infection biology in berlin used mosquitoes to infect test mice with malaria .
at the same time , they gave the mice antibiotics for three days and the mice showed no signs of the disease .
matuschewski says this means that he and his research team may have discovered the first so-called " needle-free " malaria vaccine .
their research was published last month in the journal science translational medicine .
if successful , the vaccine would use a combination of drugs and the mosquito itself to prevent the onset of malaria .
it could be a boon to billions of people worldwide who are at risk for the disease , which mainly affects people living in temperate climates .
matuschewski said the idea behind their research was to " combine a classical prophylaxis aspect - which is antibiotic treatment - -lrb- that travelers use to protect themselves against malaria -rrb- , together with a natural exposure . "
" the mosquito is our sort of syringe that delivers the pathogen and we stop the parasite from growing in the liver through antibiotic prophylaxis , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malarone is a common anti-malarial drug ' the mice do n't get sick ' while feeding , a malaria-carrying mosquito injects something called a sporozoite , which is the cell form that infects the new host .
in this case , that would be the mouse .
in the real world , it could be a human .
the sporozoites migrate to the liver , where they replicate massively and mature to the disease-causing blood stage cells called merozoites .
in this new german study , the merozoites continued to develop in the liver cells , but the antibiotics prevented them from infecting the red blood cells , which meant that the mice did n't get malaria symptoms .
with this treatment the mice not only did n't get sick , but they also developed long-term immunity .
the mice were infected with sporozoites again after 40 days , four months , and six months , this time without adding antibiotics , and all the animals had complete protection against malaria .
antibiotic resistance the antibiotics the scientists used were clindamycin and azithromycin , that are both generic , cheap and readily available .
this is good news for poorer countries , but dr. michael knappik , from the berlin center for tropical and travel medicine , pointed out that there are drawbacks with using antibiotics in the long term .
" we have growing resistance against the malaria drugs we use at the moment , " he said , " and that 's a big problem especially in southeast asia , and this of course can also arise in these new antibiotic treatments . "
matuschewski and his team hope to reduce the likelihood of antibiotic resistance by administering the drugs once a year - at the onset of the rainy season .
he added that antibiotic resistance is n't as pronounced in africa as it is in western countries , so the benefits could outweigh the concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this electron micrograph shows a female anopheles stephensi mosquito , which often is a carrier of malaria clinical trials to begin next year if successful , this new treatment could dramatically lower the one million deaths worldwide from malaria every year .
around 600 germans contract the disease each year , and sebastian hofmann was one of the unlucky ones .
seven years ago at age 19 , hofmann went backpacking across west africa , and , despite the usual malaria prevention measures - including medicine , insect repellent and mosquito nets - he still contracted the disease . "
i was hallucinating .
i was sweaty , " he remembered , " i thought i was somehow in the state of being really drunk and having a really bad flu . "
hofmann contracted the worst strain of malaria and fell into a coma for three days , although he eventually recovered .
while this new treatment is n't targeted at travelers in general - because you need to be infected with malaria first for it to work - it could make a big difference for people living in severely affected regions . "
in endemic areas in kenya , in east africa , people live there for 20 years , get infected probably sometimes 100 times a year and they always develop parasites , " matuschewski said .
" so to achieve something like anti-parasitic sterile immunity is almost impossible .
so what we want is to protect against disease . "
put another way , even if children living in malaria regions are protected daily with bed nets , according to matuschewski all this does is delay their potential exposure to the disease and subsequent symptoms and complications .
so rather than trying to prevent all mosquito bites - which is virtually impossible - this new treatment uses the infection as a part of the solution in combination with the antibiotic .
because the antibiotics are readily available , matuschewski and his research team hope that clinical trials could start in sub-saharan africa , as early as the beginning of summer next year .
while they 're excited about their findings , scientists like dr johannes friesen from the max planck institute for infection biology in berlin , were careful to point out that their research is just " one component to fight the disease . "

shortly before ramadan , hamburg deemed the mosque 's extreme islamist ideology as sufficient grounds for a ban . hamburg police early monday morning raided a mosque with a known history of breeding jihadists , city authorities reported .
at 6 a.m.
monday morning 20 police officers reportedly entered the mosque searching for evidence of islamist radicalization .
hamburg 's interior minister , christoph ahlhaus , deemed the group 's islamist ideology reason enough to close the center for good .
" the mosque is now being sealed up , so that the phantom behind the walls on steindamm street has come to an end , " announced ahlhaus , who ordered that the mosque 's community be banned - and the homes of four members of the supporting taiba arab-german culture association searched .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahlhaus called the mosque a ' phantom ' ahlhaus said in a press conference hours after the raid that hamburg could not allow " a point of contact for a group that advocates islamist social order and will not shy away from violence to assert it . " 9/11 notoriety the taiba mosque in hamburg 's st. georg neighborhood received international attention under its former name , al quds , when it became known that the september 11 suicide pilot mohammed attah had used his contacts there to forge a terrorist cell .
according to manfred murck , deputy director of hamburg 's internal intelligence service , the mosque had continued to serve " as a symbolic location for jihadists from all over germany and even abroad , because it had the perpetrators as its nimbus . "
" the mosque also continued to serve as a center of radicalization , " he said . lothar bergmann , head of hamburg 's anti-terrorism unit , referred to the taiba mosque 's leader , syrian-german mamoun darkazanli , as a " preacher of hate , " adding that his teachings and sermons as well as texts published on the community 's website promoted jihad . the investigation had gone on for months as strong evidence was needed to close the house of worship , murck said . bad timing , or strategic timing ? yet , after a decade of suspicion against the mosque , the timing of the raid has come under question , especially considering the proximity to hamburg 's august 25 mayoral election , in which ahlhaus is a prime candidate to win the office . aiman mazyek , secretary general of the central council of muslims in germany , told deutsche welle he also found it " regretful that this -lsb- raid and ban -rsb- had to take place just before ramadan . " " politicians should want to get peaceful muslims on their side ...
maybe they should have tried to do this at a different date , not just before ramadan - and an election , " mazyek added . mazyek , whose organization represents nearly 2,600 muslim communities , also fears that the pursuit of islamists will have a negative impact on peaceful muslims living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the community says it planned to vacate anyway he said studies had proven that the " war on terror " had increased extremist violence against muslims and mosques . staying on guard authorities estimate that hamburg is home to 45 jihad supporters and that around 200 people regularly attended friday services at the mosque , which they believe to have been particularly aggressive in ideology . hamburg 's jihadists have continued to make the news since the world trade center attacks .
authorities say that 11 young muslims went on from the taiba mosque to train in militant camps on the afghan-pakistani border .
one of them , known as rami m. , found his way into a terrorist militia in the region before he was arrested in march 2009 . yet the problem is not specific to hamburg , according to rolf tophoven of the institute for terrorism research and security policy . tophoven said there were centers of radicalization all over germany and europe , but that most - working under the guise of mosques and koran schools - were focused on indoctrination rather than militant training . misorienting muslim youth " not all these cells are looking for a terrorist operation , " he said , adding that germany in particular was threatened by " islamist centers , which are going to infiltrate the minds of young muslim people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu askar is a known jihadist , formerly from hamburg " if you have a young muslim student , who is not centralized in his family , who is looking for orientation , and this man falls in the hands of a radical imam or scholar , then often he will leave his family and look for jihad training in afghanistan , and especially on the afghan-pakistani border on the pakistani side , " tophoven said . furthermore , he added , local terrorist cells in europe had become more sophisticated and no longer needed operational orders from above . " they know how to recruit perpetrators .
the ideological framework is the credo of osama bin laden : every good muslim has the duty to fight the so-called non-muslim community . "

monday morning 20 police officers reportedly entered the mosque searching for evidence of islamist radicalization .
hamburg 's interior minister , christoph ahlhaus , deemed the group 's islamist ideology reason enough to close the center for good .
" the mosque is now being sealed up , so that the phantom behind the walls on steindamm street has come to an end , " announced ahlhaus , who ordered that the mosque 's community be banned - and the homes of four members of the supporting taiba arab-german culture association searched .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear -pipe- 09.08.2010 nagasaki commemorates atomic bombing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : representatives of 32 countries attended the ceremony in nagasaki on 9 aug .
2010 the japanese port of nagasaki has marked 65 years since it was flattened by a us atom bomb , that killed over 70,000 people .
the debate on whether the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki were at all justified rages on . when " little boy " - the first atom bomb - was dropped on hiroshima , the reactions among the scientists who had worked for years on perfecting the technology were mixed . " a few people laughed , a few people cried , most people were silent , " recalled robert oppenheimer , the scientific director of the manhattan project . although his colleagues later said that oppenheimer was triumphant about his part in developing the technology , he is famous for the following quote from hindu mythology : " now i have become death , the destroyer of worlds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert oppenheimer was the wartime director of the manhattan project that developed the atom bomb flash burns , falling debris and radiation sickness nobody had known exactly how devastating the impact would be and what the effect of the atom bomb on humans would be . tens of thousands were killed instantly .
flash or flame burns , falling debris , radiation sickness and other injuries and illness killed even more . us president harry truman was aware of the death and destruction in hiroshima as he made the decision to drop a second bomb - " fat man " - on nagasaki .
the plan was then to drop another in the third week of august and continue until japan surrendered . truman was relentless , announcing " if they do not now accept our terms they can expect a rain of ruin from the air the like of which has never been seen on this earth . " the main term of the potsdam declaration issued on july 26 , 1945 was that japan should surrender unconditionally .
however , sources indicate that the us was aware of how important it was for japan to be able to surrender on one condition – that of retaining the emperor , who some historians argue made it clear was in favor of surrendering . it remains unclear why the one condition that seemed of utmost importance to japan was not included in the declaration especially as after japan 's capitulation , emperor hirohito was allowed to reign on until his death in 1989 . bildunterschrift : survivors of the atomic bombings were called hibakushas sources indicate japan was on verge of surrendering what is clear is that the possibilities of ending the war without recourse to the atom bomb were not fully exhausted . sources show that japan would probably have surrendered after the threatened soviet invasion , which finally began on august 9 , and certainly before the us invasion that was planned for the autumn . yet , not only was hiroshima bombed but nagasaki too .
this is a fact that is greatly troubling to historians and many others , including the pakistani novelist kamila shamsie , whose latest novel burnt shadows has a protagonist who survives the bombing but loses all of her loved ones . " what was important to me , " she told deutsche welle , " was not just that i start with the nuclear bomb but that i start with nagasaki rather than hiroshima , which was something that i 'd been interested in since i was a student in america . " i remember going to a lecture once and someone in the middle of a conversation said : ' well , even those people who justify bombing hiroshima , how do you justify nagasaki three days later ? ' and it was something that really stuck with me : this idea of being able to obliterate a city in a second and to see the photographs of the damage that was done as we know truman did and then three days later to say ' i 'll do that again ' .
it seemed to me that more than anything else , that single moment when the bomb is dropped on nagasaki is to me a kind of acknowledgement that in war there are no limits to what we 'll do to destroy others in the pursuit of victory . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president truman took full responsibility for ordering the atomic bombs be used on japan " one million american lives were saved " the much bandied-about justification for dropping the atomic bombs was that they saved one american million lives .
even today , many americans believe this myth . however , today it is known that even the wildest of official calculations had estimated there would be a maximum of 46,000 american casualties if the us invaded japan . leading historians , such as gar alperowitz , have argued that there is strong evidence to support another reason for dropping the bombs – the desire to frighten the soviets and give the us the " upper hand in diplomatic relations " . hibakushas campaign for nuclear disarmament takai miashita is a hibakusha , " an explosion-affected person " , who volunteers at the nagasaki atomic bomb museum . " i was in class six when the atom bomb was dropped , " he recalls .
" my school was about 40 kilometers away from the epicenter .
but i saw many victims and many of my relatives , who lived in the city , died .
i will never forget this experience .
that 's why i work in this museum . " the us has never apologized for the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki .
today , it is still one of five nuclear powers allowed to have an arsenal by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . however , under president barack obama , who is a strong advocate of a world free of nuclear weapons , the us has revised its policy on the use of atomic weapons and renounced the development of any new ones . this year for the first time , the us ambassador to japan attended the ceremony in hiroshima commemorating the bombing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de medicine -pipe- 09.08.2010 german scientists discover ' needle-free ' malaria vaccine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : approximately half of all humans live in areas of the world threatened by malaria by combining antibiotics and malaria-infected mosquitos , researchers find that mice are protected .
human clinical trials will be just around the corner . deep in a lab , in carefully sealed incubators , mosquitos , which normally are malaria carriers , may this time actually be part of the solution .
kai matuschewski and his research team from the max planck institute for infection biology in berlin used mosquitoes to infect test mice with malaria .
at the same time , they gave the mice antibiotics for three days and the mice showed no signs of the disease .
matuschewski says this means that he and his research team may have discovered the first so-called " needle-free " malaria vaccine .
their research was published last month in the journal science translational medicine .
if successful , the vaccine would use a combination of drugs and the mosquito itself to prevent the onset of malaria .
it could be a boon to billions of people worldwide who are at risk for the disease , which mainly affects people living in temperate climates .
matuschewski said the idea behind their research was to " combine a classical prophylaxis aspect - which is antibiotic treatment - -lrb- that travelers use to protect themselves against malaria -rrb- , together with a natural exposure . "
" the mosquito is our sort of syringe that delivers the pathogen and we stop the parasite from growing in the liver through antibiotic prophylaxis , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malarone is a common anti-malarial drug ' the mice do n't get sick ' while feeding , a malaria-carrying mosquito injects something called a sporozoite , which is the cell form that infects the new host .
in this case , that would be the mouse .
in the real world , it could be a human .
the sporozoites migrate to the liver , where they replicate massively and mature to the disease-causing blood stage cells called merozoites .
in this new german study , the merozoites continued to develop in the liver cells , but the antibiotics prevented them from infecting the red blood cells , which meant that the mice did n't get malaria symptoms .
with this treatment the mice not only did n't get sick , but they also developed long-term immunity .
the mice were infected with sporozoites again after 40 days , four months , and six months , this time without adding antibiotics , and all the animals had complete protection against malaria .
antibiotic resistance the antibiotics the scientists used were clindamycin and azithromycin , that are both generic , cheap and readily available .
this is good news for poorer countries , but dr. michael knappik , from the berlin center for tropical and travel medicine , pointed out that there are drawbacks with using antibiotics in the long term .
" we have growing resistance against the malaria drugs we use at the moment , " he said , " and that 's a big problem especially in southeast asia , and this of course can also arise in these new antibiotic treatments . "
matuschewski and his team hope to reduce the likelihood of antibiotic resistance by administering the drugs once a year - at the onset of the rainy season .
he added that antibiotic resistance is n't as pronounced in africa as it is in western countries , so the benefits could outweigh the concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this electron micrograph shows a female anopheles stephensi mosquito , which often is a carrier of malaria clinical trials to begin next year if successful , this new treatment could dramatically lower the one million deaths worldwide from malaria every year .
around 600 germans contract the disease each year , and sebastian hofmann was one of the unlucky ones .
seven years ago at age 19 , hofmann went backpacking across west africa , and , despite the usual malaria prevention measures - including medicine , insect repellent and mosquito nets - he still contracted the disease . "
i was hallucinating .
i was sweaty , " he remembered , " i thought i was somehow in the state of being really drunk and having a really bad flu . "
hofmann contracted the worst strain of malaria and fell into a coma for three days , although he eventually recovered .
while this new treatment is n't targeted at travelers in general - because you need to be infected with malaria first for it to work - it could make a big difference for people living in severely affected regions . "
in endemic areas in kenya , in east africa , people live there for 20 years , get infected probably sometimes 100 times a year and they always develop parasites , " matuschewski said .
" so to achieve something like anti-parasitic sterile immunity is almost impossible .
so what we want is to protect against disease . "
put another way , even if children living in malaria regions are protected daily with bed nets , according to matuschewski all this does is delay their potential exposure to the disease and subsequent symptoms and complications .
so rather than trying to prevent all mosquito bites - which is virtually impossible - this new treatment uses the infection as a part of the solution in combination with the antibiotic .
because the antibiotics are readily available , matuschewski and his research team hope that clinical trials could start in sub-saharan africa , as early as the beginning of summer next year .
while they 're excited about their findings , scientists like dr johannes friesen from the max planck institute for infection biology in berlin , were careful to point out that their research is just " one component to fight the disease . "

2010 the japanese port of nagasaki has marked 65 years since it was flattened by a us atom bomb , that killed over 70,000 people .
the debate on whether the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki were at all justified rages on . when " little boy " - the first atom bomb - was dropped on hiroshima , the reactions among the scientists who had worked for years on perfecting the technology were mixed . " a few people laughed , a few people cried , most people were silent , " recalled robert oppenheimer , the scientific director of the manhattan project . although his colleagues later said that oppenheimer was triumphant about his part in developing the technology , he is famous for the following quote from hindu mythology : " now i have become death , the destroyer of worlds .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert oppenheimer was the wartime director of the manhattan project that developed the atom bomb flash burns , falling debris and radiation sickness nobody had known exactly how devastating the impact would be and what the effect of the atom bomb on humans would be . tens of thousands were killed instantly .
flash or flame burns , falling debris , radiation sickness and other injuries and illness killed even more . us president harry truman was aware of the death and destruction in hiroshima as he made the decision to drop a second bomb - " fat man " - on nagasaki .
the plan was then to drop another in the third week of august and continue until japan surrendered . truman was relentless , announcing " if they do not now accept our terms they can expect a rain of ruin from the air the like of which has never been seen on this earth . " the main term of the potsdam declaration issued on july 26 , 1945 was that japan should surrender unconditionally .
however , sources indicate that the us was aware of how important it was for japan to be able to surrender on one condition – that of retaining the emperor , who some historians argue made it clear was in favor of surrendering . it remains unclear why the one condition that seemed of utmost importance to japan was not included in the declaration especially as after japan 's capitulation , emperor hirohito was allowed to reign on until his death in 1989 . bildunterschrift : survivors of the atomic bombings were called hibakushas sources indicate japan was on verge of surrendering what is clear is that the possibilities of ending the war without recourse to the atom bomb were not fully exhausted . sources show that japan would probably have surrendered after the threatened soviet invasion , which finally began on august 9 , and certainly before the us invasion that was planned for the autumn . yet , not only was hiroshima bombed but nagasaki too .
this is a fact that is greatly troubling to historians and many others , including the pakistani novelist kamila shamsie , whose latest novel burnt shadows has a protagonist who survives the bombing but loses all of her loved ones . " what was important to me , " she told deutsche welle , " was not just that i start with the nuclear bomb but that i start with nagasaki rather than hiroshima , which was something that i 'd been interested in since i was a student in america . " i remember going to a lecture once and someone in the middle of a conversation said : ' well , even those people who justify bombing hiroshima , how do you justify nagasaki three days later ? ' and it was something that really stuck with me : this idea of being able to obliterate a city in a second and to see the photographs of the damage that was done as we know truman did and then three days later to say ' i 'll do that again ' .
it seemed to me that more than anything else , that single moment when the bomb is dropped on nagasaki is to me a kind of acknowledgement that in war there are no limits to what we 'll do to destroy others in the pursuit of victory . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president truman took full responsibility for ordering the atomic bombs be used on japan " one million american lives were saved " the much bandied-about justification for dropping the atomic bombs was that they saved one american million lives .
even today , many americans believe this myth . however , today it is known that even the wildest of official calculations had estimated there would be a maximum of 46,000 american casualties if the us invaded japan . leading historians , such as gar alperowitz , have argued that there is strong evidence to support another reason for dropping the bombs – the desire to frighten the soviets and give the us the " upper hand in diplomatic relations " . hibakushas campaign for nuclear disarmament takai miashita is a hibakusha , " an explosion-affected person " , who volunteers at the nagasaki atomic bomb museum . " i was in class six when the atom bomb was dropped , " he recalls .
" my school was about 40 kilometers away from the epicenter .
but i saw many victims and many of my relatives , who lived in the city , died .
i will never forget this experience .
that 's why i work in this museum . " the us has never apologized for the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki .
today , it is still one of five nuclear powers allowed to have an arsenal by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . however , under president barack obama , who is a strong advocate of a world free of nuclear weapons , the us has revised its policy on the use of atomic weapons and renounced the development of any new ones . this year for the first time , the us ambassador to japan attended the ceremony in hiroshima commemorating the bombing .
nonetheless , no representative from the us attended the commemorations in nagasaki . author : anne thomas editor : disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 09.08.2010 hamburg authorities shut down mosque suspected of radicalization großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police only found one man in the mosque in their 6 a.m. raid authorities in hamburg raided and shut down a mosque visited by september 11 jihadists on monday .
shortly before ramadan , hamburg deemed the mosque 's extreme islamist ideology as sufficient grounds for a ban . hamburg police early monday morning raided a mosque with a known history of breeding jihadists , city authorities reported .
at 6 a.m.
monday morning 20 police officers reportedly entered the mosque searching for evidence of islamist radicalization .
hamburg 's interior minister , christoph ahlhaus , deemed the group 's islamist ideology reason enough to close the center for good .
" the mosque is now being sealed up , so that the phantom behind the walls on steindamm street has come to an end , " announced ahlhaus , who ordered that the mosque 's community be banned - and the homes of four members of the supporting taiba arab-german culture association searched .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahlhaus called the mosque a ' phantom ' ahlhaus said in a press conference hours after the raid that hamburg could not allow " a point of contact for a group that advocates islamist social order and will not shy away from violence to assert it . " 9/11 notoriety the taiba mosque in hamburg 's st. georg neighborhood received international attention under its former name , al quds , when it became known that the september 11 suicide pilot mohammed attah had used his contacts there to forge a terrorist cell .
according to manfred murck , deputy director of hamburg 's internal intelligence service , the mosque had continued to serve " as a symbolic location for jihadists from all over germany and even abroad , because it had the perpetrators as its nimbus . "
" the mosque also continued to serve as a center of radicalization , " he said . lothar bergmann , head of hamburg 's anti-terrorism unit , referred to the taiba mosque 's leader , syrian-german mamoun darkazanli , as a " preacher of hate , " adding that his teachings and sermons as well as texts published on the community 's website promoted jihad . the investigation had gone on for months as strong evidence was needed to close the house of worship , murck said . bad timing , or strategic timing ? yet , after a decade of suspicion against the mosque , the timing of the raid has come under question , especially considering the proximity to hamburg 's august 25 mayoral election , in which ahlhaus is a prime candidate to win the office . aiman mazyek , secretary general of the central council of muslims in germany , told deutsche welle he also found it " regretful that this -lsb- raid and ban -rsb- had to take place just before ramadan . " " politicians should want to get peaceful muslims on their side ...
maybe they should have tried to do this at a different date , not just before ramadan - and an election , " mazyek added . mazyek , whose organization represents nearly 2,600 muslim communities , also fears that the pursuit of islamists will have a negative impact on peaceful muslims living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the community says it planned to vacate anyway he said studies had proven that the " war on terror " had increased extremist violence against muslims and mosques . staying on guard authorities estimate that hamburg is home to 45 jihad supporters and that around 200 people regularly attended friday services at the mosque , which they believe to have been particularly aggressive in ideology . hamburg 's jihadists have continued to make the news since the world trade center attacks .
authorities say that 11 young muslims went on from the taiba mosque to train in militant camps on the afghan-pakistani border .
one of them , known as rami m. , found his way into a terrorist militia in the region before he was arrested in march 2009 . yet the problem is not specific to hamburg , according to rolf tophoven of the institute for terrorism research and security policy . tophoven said there were centers of radicalization all over germany and europe , but that most - working under the guise of mosques and koran schools - were focused on indoctrination rather than militant training . misorienting muslim youth " not all these cells are looking for a terrorist operation , " he said , adding that germany in particular was threatened by " islamist centers , which are going to infiltrate the minds of young muslim people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu askar is a known jihadist , formerly from hamburg " if you have a young muslim student , who is not centralized in his family , who is looking for orientation , and this man falls in the hands of a radical imam or scholar , then often he will leave his family and look for jihad training in afghanistan , and especially on the afghan-pakistani border on the pakistani side , " tophoven said . furthermore , he added , local terrorist cells in europe had become more sophisticated and no longer needed operational orders from above . " they know how to recruit perpetrators .
the ideological framework is the credo of osama bin laden : every good muslim has the duty to fight the so-called non-muslim community . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de theater -pipe- 09.08.2010 former czech president havel directs first movie großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film director is a new role for havel vaclav havel , the first president of the czech republic , has made a name for himself as a playwright .
now he 's tackling the big screen - with the story of a retired politician . what do former world leaders do once they 've said goodbye to their bodyguards and handed back the keys to the presidential palace ?
some start working on weighty memoirs ; others devote themselves to their favorite charity .
former czech president vaclav havel , on the other hand , is currently directing his first feature film .
based on his most recent play , entitled " leaving , " it tells the story of a politician trying to adjust to a new life after leaving politics .
the main character , vilem rieger , is the former chancellor of an unnamed country and finds himself locked in a battle of wills with his successor , the unsavory vlastik klein .
it 's a " lear " -like contemplation on a politician 's frustrating impotence at finding himself slowly being forced out of his beloved government villa .
inspired by real life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havel 's wife , actress dagmar havlova , stars in the film at a real villa in the town of ceska skalice , in the far north-east of the country , the former president is fulfilling his lifelong dream .
for the next few weeks , he 'll be sitting in the director 's chair , filming the screen version of his play .
i 've been quite surprised at how quick and smooth everything is , " havel told reporters , " i come up with an idea on the set , i tell the person standing next to me about it , and the next day we 're filming it .
it certainly was n't like that when i was president ! "
at first glance , there seem to be many similarities with vaclav havel 's own life .
vilem rieger 's rival and successor is named vlastik klein ; havel 's real-life rival and successor as president is vaclav klaus .
in the family nevertheless , havel has denied that the story is strictly autobiographical , saying he first began toying with the idea back in the 1970 's .
he wrote the main female role - the chancellor 's wife , irena - for his own wife , actress dagmar havlova .
" it 's obviously a real honor to play the part , but i have to point out that vaclav wrote the role for me , not about me , " commented havlova .
" i was there when he wrote the script , i remember reading the first draft , so i 'm so happy to finally get the chance to act in it . "
vaclav havel 's resume is already impressive : world-renowned playwright , anti-communist dissident , denim-clad revolutionary , and , of course , president of his country for more than a decade .
now , at the tender age of 73 , he 's adding another string to his bow and , as he explained , film is very much in his blood .

the incident comes after a south korea accused the north of detaining a fishing boat . the shells were fired by north korea 's batteries shortly after the south korean navy had ended five days of exercises south of their disputed sea border , south korea 's news agency yonhap reported , citing military officials . the north had threatened to retaliate against the drills , which was the south 's largest ever anti-submarine exercise . in july , the us and south korea conducted joint exercises , which north korea had threatened could start a " war . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south koreans watch the nimitz-class uss george washington leaving for joint military exercises with south korea " our navy was placed on high alert , closely watching the movement of the north korean troops , " a senior official told afp on monday .
other officials said that the south 's navy patrol ships had warned the north koreans by radio to stop firing but the warning was ignored . earlier this year , the north fired a series of artillery rounds in the same area .
tension has been high in ever since a south korean warship , the cheonan , was sunk in march , killing 46 sailors .

now he 's tackling the big screen - with the story of a retired politician . what do former world leaders do once they 've said goodbye to their bodyguards and handed back the keys to the presidential palace ?
some start working on weighty memoirs ; others devote themselves to their favorite charity .
former czech president vaclav havel , on the other hand , is currently directing his first feature film .
based on his most recent play , entitled " leaving , " it tells the story of a politician trying to adjust to a new life after leaving politics .
the main character , vilem rieger , is the former chancellor of an unnamed country and finds himself locked in a battle of wills with his successor , the unsavory vlastik klein .
it 's a " lear " -like contemplation on a politician 's frustrating impotence at finding himself slowly being forced out of his beloved government villa .
inspired by real life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havel 's wife , actress dagmar havlova , stars in the film at a real villa in the town of ceska skalice , in the far north-east of the country , the former president is fulfilling his lifelong dream .
for the next few weeks , he 'll be sitting in the director 's chair , filming the screen version of his play .
i 've been quite surprised at how quick and smooth everything is , " havel told reporters , " i come up with an idea on the set , i tell the person standing next to me about it , and the next day we 're filming it .
it certainly was n't like that when i was president ! "
at first glance , there seem to be many similarities with vaclav havel 's own life .
vilem rieger 's rival and successor is named vlastik klein ; havel 's real-life rival and successor as president is vaclav klaus .
in the family nevertheless , havel has denied that the story is strictly autobiographical , saying he first began toying with the idea back in the 1970 's .
he wrote the main female role - the chancellor 's wife , irena - for his own wife , actress dagmar havlova .
" it 's obviously a real honor to play the part , but i have to point out that vaclav wrote the role for me , not about me , " commented havlova .
" i was there when he wrote the script , i remember reading the first draft , so i 'm so happy to finally get the chance to act in it . "
vaclav havel 's resume is already impressive : world-renowned playwright , anti-communist dissident , denim-clad revolutionary , and , of course , president of his country for more than a decade .
now , at the tender age of 73 , he 's adding another string to his bow and , as he explained , film is very much in his blood .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de theater -pipe- 09.08.2010 former czech president havel directs first movie großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film director is a new role for havel vaclav havel , the first president of the czech republic , has made a name for himself as a playwright .
now he 's tackling the big screen - with the story of a retired politician . what do former world leaders do once they 've said goodbye to their bodyguards and handed back the keys to the presidential palace ?
some start working on weighty memoirs ; others devote themselves to their favorite charity .
former czech president vaclav havel , on the other hand , is currently directing his first feature film .
based on his most recent play , entitled " leaving , " it tells the story of a politician trying to adjust to a new life after leaving politics .
the main character , vilem rieger , is the former chancellor of an unnamed country and finds himself locked in a battle of wills with his successor , the unsavory vlastik klein .
it 's a " lear " -like contemplation on a politician 's frustrating impotence at finding himself slowly being forced out of his beloved government villa .
inspired by real life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havel 's wife , actress dagmar havlova , stars in the film at a real villa in the town of ceska skalice , in the far north-east of the country , the former president is fulfilling his lifelong dream .
for the next few weeks , he 'll be sitting in the director 's chair , filming the screen version of his play .
i 've been quite surprised at how quick and smooth everything is , " havel told reporters , " i come up with an idea on the set , i tell the person standing next to me about it , and the next day we 're filming it .
it certainly was n't like that when i was president ! "
at first glance , there seem to be many similarities with vaclav havel 's own life .
vilem rieger 's rival and successor is named vlastik klein ; havel 's real-life rival and successor as president is vaclav klaus .
in the family nevertheless , havel has denied that the story is strictly autobiographical , saying he first began toying with the idea back in the 1970 's .
he wrote the main female role - the chancellor 's wife , irena - for his own wife , actress dagmar havlova .
" it 's obviously a real honor to play the part , but i have to point out that vaclav wrote the role for me , not about me , " commented havlova .
" i was there when he wrote the script , i remember reading the first draft , so i 'm so happy to finally get the chance to act in it . "
vaclav havel 's resume is already impressive : world-renowned playwright , anti-communist dissident , denim-clad revolutionary , and , of course , president of his country for more than a decade .
now , at the tender age of 73 , he 's adding another string to his bow and , as he explained , film is very much in his blood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havel says directing a film is more efficient than politics " i come from a filmmaking family ; my uncle basically founded the czech cinema industry , so i grew up around film people , " said havel .
" so i always wanted to be a film director , but the political atmosphere in the 50 's and 60 's meant i was n't allowed to go to film school . "
a daring director havel has been involved in theater for most of his adult life , from the 1950 's onwards , and many of the roles in " leaving " have been filled with his close friends from the business , including well-known czech actress eva holubova .
" vaclav havel , for me , is not only president ; he is vaclav havel , " said holubova .
" he 's a very clever director , a very funny director , and he is n't afraid - never . "
filming is scheduled to be completed on august 21 , the anniversary of the soviet-led invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 . reviews for the stage version of " leaving " were mixed , with some critics saying it was nowhere near as good as havel 's earlier work .
but vaclav havel 's uncle , who built czechoslovakia 's first film studios , and his grandfather , who built prague 's first cinema , would no doubt be proud . author : rob cameron , ceska skalice editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 09.08.2010 un starts inquiry into gaza flotilla raid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mavi marmara was stormed by israeli commandos a united nations probe has begun investigating the controversial raid by israeli forces on an aid convoy headed toward the gaza strip that left nine turkish nationals dead .
an initial report is due in mid-september . a four-member united nations panel on tuesday started its investigation of a deadly raid by israel on a flotilla of ships carrying aid to the gaza strip , with israel promising its cooperation .
" israel has nothing to hide , " said israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu at a cabinet meeting .
" it is in the national interest of the state of israel to ensure that the factual truth of the overall flotilla events comes to light throughout the world . "
the jewish state has set one condition , however : that its soldiers are not questioned as part of the investigation .
" the prime minister said israel would not cooperate with any commission that would ask to question soldiers , " a spokesman for netanyahu said on tuesday .
the comments came after un secretary-general ban ki-moon denied reaching a deal with israel excluding the un panel from interviewing israeli military personnel .
the panel , headed by former new zealand prime minister geoffrey palmer and outgoing president alvaro uribe , also includes one turkish and one israeli diplomat .
the committee will present an initial report on its probe in mid-september after it has reviewed the circumstances surrounding the may 31 attack during which israeli commandos raided a six-ship convoy .
israel was trying to prevent the ships from breaking the blockade on gaza .
during the raid , nine turkish citizens , including one with both turkish and american citizenship , were killed .
at least seven israeli commandos were wounded .
the event caused an international outcry and widespread condemnation of israel 's tactics .
it also soured relations between israel and turkey , one of the jewish state 's only allies in the region with whom it shared strong economic and political ties .
new approach in the past , israel has refused to cooperate with investigations into its behavior on the international stage and responded with boycotts or by simply ignoring them .
now , however , it appears that israel is taking a new approach , although not without prompting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's refused to cooperate with an inquiry following military operations in gaza in 2009 " this time , israel sees itself now much more than in the past on the receiving end of international criticism .
they are under significantly more pressure now to cooperate , " almut moeller , a researcher at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
strong pressure on israel has come not only from the un , but from the obama administration and the europeans .
the german parliament , in an unusual move , passed a unanimous resolution in july calling for an end to israel 's blockage of the gaza strip .
israel chose not to cooperate with the goldstone probe , which looked into israeli 's attack on gaza in which more than 1,300 palstinians were killed .
israel came away from that inquiry cast in a very negative life , and it might be that israel does n't want to repeat the experience .
" this cooperation can be seen as a signal from the israeli government that it is not blind and deaf to international criticism , " margret johannsen , a senior research fellow at the hamburg-based institute for peace research and security policy , said .
ties to turkey israel 's decision to cooperate could have much to do with its desire to repair its ties with turkey , it strongest muslim and regional ally on both the economic and political level .
after the may 31 raid , relations between the two states deteriorated enormously .
in july , turkey threatened to break diplomatic ties with israel over the flotilla raid and turkey 's foreign minister said ties would only be maintained if israel either apologized or accepted the outcome of the international inquiry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister netanyahu has said israel has nothing to apologize for israel refused to apologize , but did say it was interested in avoiding any further deterioration of bilateral relations .
israel has been a major arms supplier to turkey , and the two countries have entered into multiple agreements that have seen them cooperating in several areas , especially on defense matters .
after a devastating 1999 earthquake in turkey , israel sent one of the largest international teams to help .
in 2000 , the two signed the " turkish-israeli free-trade agreement . "
turkey was the first muslim-majority country to enter into such a deal with the jewish state .
fair and balanced ?
the un investigation is but one of several going on right now .
israel is carrying out its own probe into the raid , with prime minister netanyahu giving testimony on monday .
" i am convinced that at the end of your investigation , it will become clear that the state of israel and the idf -lrb- israeli defense forces -rrb- acted in accordance with international law , " netanyahu told members of the five-person tirkel commission .
turkey reportedly began carrying out its own inquiry days after the raid , allegedly looking to make a criminal case against top israeli officials .
the un human rights council is conducting a probe , not to be confused with the un investigation starting tuesday .
but israel has refused to cooperate with that body , claiming that it is biased .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a video still purporting to show israeli soldiers aboard a vessel surrounding a turkish ship un chief ban has sought to find a way to conduct the investigation in a way that would satisfy both turkey and israel .
his choice of oezdem sanberk , a former undersecretary at the turkish foreign ministry , and joseph ciechanover , a former senior official at the israeli foreign ministry , is a tactic to dampen possible criticism that the panel could tilt to one side .
" -lsb- the panel 's makeup -rsb- increases its credibility in israel itself and makes it harder for people to present the panel as biased against israel from the outset , " said mideast expert johannsen .
whatever the panel 's findings , experts agree that there will likely be no sanctions placed on israel , even if the investigation finds fault with its actions .
sanctions depend on the un security council , and it 's very probable that the united states , a strong israel ally , would veto any sanction resolution .
still , johannsen thinks the probe is crucial not only for both turkey and israel , but also for the international community at large . " while it wo n't result in any sanctions , it 's important that the investigation take place because it highlights the importance of international law , " she said . author : kyle james , darren mara -lrb- afp / ap -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an initial report is due in mid-september . a four-member united nations panel on tuesday started its investigation of a deadly raid by israel on a flotilla of ships carrying aid to the gaza strip , with israel promising its cooperation .
" israel has nothing to hide , " said israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu at a cabinet meeting .
" it is in the national interest of the state of israel to ensure that the factual truth of the overall flotilla events comes to light throughout the world . "
the jewish state has set one condition , however : that its soldiers are not questioned as part of the investigation .
" the prime minister said israel would not cooperate with any commission that would ask to question soldiers , " a spokesman for netanyahu said on tuesday .
the comments came after un secretary-general ban ki-moon denied reaching a deal with israel excluding the un panel from interviewing israeli military personnel .
the panel , headed by former new zealand prime minister geoffrey palmer and outgoing president alvaro uribe , also includes one turkish and one israeli diplomat .
the committee will present an initial report on its probe in mid-september after it has reviewed the circumstances surrounding the may 31 attack during which israeli commandos raided a six-ship convoy .
israel was trying to prevent the ships from breaking the blockade on gaza .
during the raid , nine turkish citizens , including one with both turkish and american citizenship , were killed .
at least seven israeli commandos were wounded .
the event caused an international outcry and widespread condemnation of israel 's tactics .
it also soured relations between israel and turkey , one of the jewish state 's only allies in the region with whom it shared strong economic and political ties .
new approach in the past , israel has refused to cooperate with investigations into its behavior on the international stage and responded with boycotts or by simply ignoring them .
now , however , it appears that israel is taking a new approach , although not without prompting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's refused to cooperate with an inquiry following military operations in gaza in 2009 " this time , israel sees itself now much more than in the past on the receiving end of international criticism .
they are under significantly more pressure now to cooperate , " almut moeller , a researcher at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
strong pressure on israel has come not only from the un , but from the obama administration and the europeans .
the german parliament , in an unusual move , passed a unanimous resolution in july calling for an end to israel 's blockage of the gaza strip .
israel chose not to cooperate with the goldstone probe , which looked into israeli 's attack on gaza in which more than 1,300 palstinians were killed .
israel came away from that inquiry cast in a very negative life , and it might be that israel does n't want to repeat the experience .
" this cooperation can be seen as a signal from the israeli government that it is not blind and deaf to international criticism , " margret johannsen , a senior research fellow at the hamburg-based institute for peace research and security policy , said .
ties to turkey israel 's decision to cooperate could have much to do with its desire to repair its ties with turkey , it strongest muslim and regional ally on both the economic and political level .
after the may 31 raid , relations between the two states deteriorated enormously .
in july , turkey threatened to break diplomatic ties with israel over the flotilla raid and turkey 's foreign minister said ties would only be maintained if israel either apologized or accepted the outcome of the international inquiry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister netanyahu has said israel has nothing to apologize for israel refused to apologize , but did say it was interested in avoiding any further deterioration of bilateral relations .
israel has been a major arms supplier to turkey , and the two countries have entered into multiple agreements that have seen them cooperating in several areas , especially on defense matters .
after a devastating 1999 earthquake in turkey , israel sent one of the largest international teams to help .
in 2000 , the two signed the " turkish-israeli free-trade agreement . "
turkey was the first muslim-majority country to enter into such a deal with the jewish state .
fair and balanced ?
the un investigation is but one of several going on right now .
israel is carrying out its own probe into the raid , with prime minister netanyahu giving testimony on monday .
" i am convinced that at the end of your investigation , it will become clear that the state of israel and the idf -lrb- israeli defense forces -rrb- acted in accordance with international law , " netanyahu told members of the five-person tirkel commission .
turkey reportedly began carrying out its own inquiry days after the raid , allegedly looking to make a criminal case against top israeli officials .
the un human rights council is conducting a probe , not to be confused with the un investigation starting tuesday .
but israel has refused to cooperate with that body , claiming that it is biased .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a video still purporting to show israeli soldiers aboard a vessel surrounding a turkish ship un chief ban has sought to find a way to conduct the investigation in a way that would satisfy both turkey and israel .
his choice of oezdem sanberk , a former undersecretary at the turkish foreign ministry , and joseph ciechanover , a former senior official at the israeli foreign ministry , is a tactic to dampen possible criticism that the panel could tilt to one side .
" -lsb- the panel 's makeup -rsb- increases its credibility in israel itself and makes it harder for people to present the panel as biased against israel from the outset , " said mideast expert johannsen .
whatever the panel 's findings , experts agree that there will likely be no sanctions placed on israel , even if the investigation finds fault with its actions .
sanctions depend on the un security council , and it 's very probable that the united states , a strong israel ally , would veto any sanction resolution .
still , johannsen thinks the probe is crucial not only for both turkey and israel , but also for the international community at large . " while it wo n't result in any sanctions , it 's important that the investigation take place because it highlights the importance of international law , " she said . author : kyle james , darren mara -lrb- afp / ap -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2010 the japanese port of nagasaki has marked 65 years since it was flattened by a us atom bomb , that killed over 70,000 people .
the debate on whether the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki were at all justified rages on . when " little boy " - the first atom bomb - was dropped on hiroshima , the reactions among the scientists who had worked for years on perfecting the technology were mixed . " a few people laughed , a few people cried , most people were silent , " recalled robert oppenheimer , the scientific director of the manhattan project . although his colleagues later said that oppenheimer was triumphant about his part in developing the technology , he is famous for the following quote from hindu mythology : " now i have become death , the destroyer of worlds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert oppenheimer was the wartime director of the manhattan project that developed the atom bomb flash burns , falling debris and radiation sickness nobody had known exactly how devastating the impact would be and what the effect of the atom bomb on humans would be . tens of thousands were killed instantly .
flash or flame burns , falling debris , radiation sickness and other injuries and illness killed even more . us president harry truman was aware of the death and destruction in hiroshima as he made the decision to drop a second bomb - " fat man " - on nagasaki .
the plan was then to drop another in the third week of august and continue until japan surrendered . truman was relentless , announcing " if they do not now accept our terms they can expect a rain of ruin from the air the like of which has never been seen on this earth . " the main term of the potsdam declaration issued on july 26 , 1945 was that japan should surrender unconditionally .
however , sources indicate that the us was aware of how important it was for japan to be able to surrender on one condition – that of retaining the emperor , who some historians argue made it clear was in favor of surrendering . it remains unclear why the one condition that seemed of utmost importance to japan was not included in the declaration especially as after japan 's capitulation , emperor hirohito was allowed to reign on until his death in 1989 . bildunterschrift : survivors of the atomic bombings were called hibakushas sources indicate japan was on verge of surrendering what is clear is that the possibilities of ending the war without recourse to the atom bomb were not fully exhausted . sources show that japan would probably have surrendered after the threatened soviet invasion , which finally began on august 9 , and certainly before the us invasion that was planned for the autumn . yet , not only was hiroshima bombed but nagasaki too .
this is a fact that is greatly troubling to historians and many others , including the pakistani novelist kamila shamsie , whose latest novel burnt shadows has a protagonist who survives the bombing but loses all of her loved ones . " what was important to me , " she told deutsche welle , " was not just that i start with the nuclear bomb but that i start with nagasaki rather than hiroshima , which was something that i 'd been interested in since i was a student in america . " i remember going to a lecture once and someone in the middle of a conversation said : ' well , even those people who justify bombing hiroshima , how do you justify nagasaki three days later ? ' and it was something that really stuck with me : this idea of being able to obliterate a city in a second and to see the photographs of the damage that was done as we know truman did and then three days later to say ' i 'll do that again ' .
it seemed to me that more than anything else , that single moment when the bomb is dropped on nagasaki is to me a kind of acknowledgement that in war there are no limits to what we 'll do to destroy others in the pursuit of victory . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president truman took full responsibility for ordering the atomic bombs be used on japan " one million american lives were saved " the much bandied-about justification for dropping the atomic bombs was that they saved one american million lives .
even today , many americans believe this myth . however , today it is known that even the wildest of official calculations had estimated there would be a maximum of 46,000 american casualties if the us invaded japan . leading historians , such as gar alperowitz , have argued that there is strong evidence to support another reason for dropping the bombs – the desire to frighten the soviets and give the us the " upper hand in diplomatic relations " . hibakushas campaign for nuclear disarmament takai miashita is a hibakusha , " an explosion-affected person " , who volunteers at the nagasaki atomic bomb museum .

' and it was something that really stuck with me : this idea of being able to obliterate a city in a second and to see the photographs of the damage that was done as we know truman did and then three days later to say ' i 'll do that again ' .
it seemed to me that more than anything else , that single moment when the bomb is dropped on nagasaki is to me a kind of acknowledgement that in war there are no limits to what we 'll do to destroy others in the pursuit of victory . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president truman took full responsibility for ordering the atomic bombs be used on japan " one million american lives were saved " the much bandied-about justification for dropping the atomic bombs was that they saved one american million lives .
even today , many americans believe this myth . however , today it is known that even the wildest of official calculations had estimated there would be a maximum of 46,000 american casualties if the us invaded japan . leading historians , such as gar alperowitz , have argued that there is strong evidence to support another reason for dropping the bombs – the desire to frighten the soviets and give the us the " upper hand in diplomatic relations " . hibakushas campaign for nuclear disarmament takai miashita is a hibakusha , " an explosion-affected person " , who volunteers at the nagasaki atomic bomb museum . " i was in class six when the atom bomb was dropped , " he recalls .
" my school was about 40 kilometers away from the epicenter .
but i saw many victims and many of my relatives , who lived in the city , died .
i will never forget this experience .
that 's why i work in this museum . " the us has never apologized for the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki .
today , it is still one of five nuclear powers allowed to have an arsenal by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . however , under president barack obama , who is a strong advocate of a world free of nuclear weapons , the us has revised its policy on the use of atomic weapons and renounced the development of any new ones . this year for the first time , the us ambassador to japan attended the ceremony in hiroshima commemorating the bombing .
nonetheless , no representative from the us attended the commemorations in nagasaki . author : anne thomas editor : disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

maybe they should have tried to do this at a different date , not just before ramadan - and an election , " mazyek added . mazyek , whose organization represents nearly 2,600 muslim communities , also fears that the pursuit of islamists will have a negative impact on peaceful muslims living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the community says it planned to vacate anyway he said studies had proven that the " war on terror " had increased extremist violence against muslims and mosques . staying on guard authorities estimate that hamburg is home to 45 jihad supporters and that around 200 people regularly attended friday services at the mosque , which they believe to have been particularly aggressive in ideology . hamburg 's jihadists have continued to make the news since the world trade center attacks .
authorities say that 11 young muslims went on from the taiba mosque to train in militant camps on the afghan-pakistani border .
one of them , known as rami m. , found his way into a terrorist militia in the region before he was arrested in march 2009 . yet the problem is not specific to hamburg , according to rolf tophoven of the institute for terrorism research and security policy . tophoven said there were centers of radicalization all over germany and europe , but that most - working under the guise of mosques and koran schools - were focused on indoctrination rather than militant training . misorienting muslim youth " not all these cells are looking for a terrorist operation , " he said , adding that germany in particular was threatened by " islamist centers , which are going to infiltrate the minds of young muslim people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu askar is a known jihadist , formerly from hamburg " if you have a young muslim student , who is not centralized in his family , who is looking for orientation , and this man falls in the hands of a radical imam or scholar , then often he will leave his family and look for jihad training in afghanistan , and especially on the afghan-pakistani border on the pakistani side , " tophoven said . furthermore , he added , local terrorist cells in europe had become more sophisticated and no longer needed operational orders from above . " they know how to recruit perpetrators .
the ideological framework is the credo of osama bin laden : every good muslim has the duty to fight the so-called non-muslim community . "

2010 the japanese port of nagasaki has marked 65 years since it was flattened by a us atom bomb , that killed over 70,000 people .
the debate on whether the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki were at all justified rages on . when " little boy " - the first atom bomb - was dropped on hiroshima , the reactions among the scientists who had worked for years on perfecting the technology were mixed . " a few people laughed , a few people cried , most people were silent , " recalled robert oppenheimer , the scientific director of the manhattan project . although his colleagues later said that oppenheimer was triumphant about his part in developing the technology , he is famous for the following quote from hindu mythology : " now i have become death , the destroyer of worlds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert oppenheimer was the wartime director of the manhattan project that developed the atom bomb flash burns , falling debris and radiation sickness nobody had known exactly how devastating the impact would be and what the effect of the atom bomb on humans would be . tens of thousands were killed instantly .
flash or flame burns , falling debris , radiation sickness and other injuries and illness killed even more . us president harry truman was aware of the death and destruction in hiroshima as he made the decision to drop a second bomb - " fat man " - on nagasaki .
the plan was then to drop another in the third week of august and continue until japan surrendered . truman was relentless , announcing " if they do not now accept our terms they can expect a rain of ruin from the air the like of which has never been seen on this earth . " the main term of the potsdam declaration issued on july 26 , 1945 was that japan should surrender unconditionally .
however , sources indicate that the us was aware of how important it was for japan to be able to surrender on one condition – that of retaining the emperor , who some historians argue made it clear was in favor of surrendering . it remains unclear why the one condition that seemed of utmost importance to japan was not included in the declaration especially as after japan 's capitulation , emperor hirohito was allowed to reign on until his death in 1989 . bildunterschrift : survivors of the atomic bombings were called hibakushas sources indicate japan was on verge of surrendering what is clear is that the possibilities of ending the war without recourse to the atom bomb were not fully exhausted . sources show that japan would probably have surrendered after the threatened soviet invasion , which finally began on august 9 , and certainly before the us invasion that was planned for the autumn . yet , not only was hiroshima bombed but nagasaki too .
this is a fact that is greatly troubling to historians and many others , including the pakistani novelist kamila shamsie , whose latest novel burnt shadows has a protagonist who survives the bombing but loses all of her loved ones . " what was important to me , " she told deutsche welle , " was not just that i start with the nuclear bomb but that i start with nagasaki rather than hiroshima , which was something that i 'd been interested in since i was a student in america . " i remember going to a lecture once and someone in the middle of a conversation said : ' well , even those people who justify bombing hiroshima , how do you justify nagasaki three days later ? ' and it was something that really stuck with me : this idea of being able to obliterate a city in a second and to see the photographs of the damage that was done as we know truman did and then three days later to say ' i 'll do that again ' .
it seemed to me that more than anything else , that single moment when the bomb is dropped on nagasaki is to me a kind of acknowledgement that in war there are no limits to what we 'll do to destroy others in the pursuit of victory . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president truman took full responsibility for ordering the atomic bombs be used on japan " one million american lives were saved " the much bandied-about justification for dropping the atomic bombs was that they saved one american million lives .
even today , many americans believe this myth . however , today it is known that even the wildest of official calculations had estimated there would be a maximum of 46,000 american casualties if the us invaded japan . leading historians , such as gar alperowitz , have argued that there is strong evidence to support another reason for dropping the bombs – the desire to frighten the soviets and give the us the " upper hand in diplomatic relations " . hibakushas campaign for nuclear disarmament takai miashita is a hibakusha , " an explosion-affected person " , who volunteers at the nagasaki atomic bomb museum . " i was in class six when the atom bomb was dropped , " he recalls .
" my school was about 40 kilometers away from the epicenter .
but i saw many victims and many of my relatives , who lived in the city , died .
i will never forget this experience .
that 's why i work in this museum . " the us has never apologized for the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki .
today , it is still one of five nuclear powers allowed to have an arsenal by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . however , under president barack obama , who is a strong advocate of a world free of nuclear weapons , the us has revised its policy on the use of atomic weapons and renounced the development of any new ones . this year for the first time , the us ambassador to japan attended the ceremony in hiroshima commemorating the bombing .
nonetheless , no representative from the us attended the commemorations in nagasaki . author : anne thomas editor : disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am convinced that at the end of your investigation , it will become clear that the state of israel and the idf -lrb- israeli defense forces -rrb- acted in accordance with international law , " netanyahu told members of the tirkel commission as he began testifying about the raid .
netanyahu was the first witness to testify at the internal investigation , which was set up following intense international pressure on the israeli government following the commando raid in may . the raid , on six ships attempting to break a naval blockade of the gaza strip , killed nine turkish activists and wounded many others .
turkey ' did nothing ' the incident sparked a diplomatic crisis between israel and turkey .

" the turkish government did not consider the confrontation between turkish activists and israel to be against its interests . "
netanyahu added that he ordered troops to make a " supreme effort " to avoid harming any passengers on board the aid ships .
israel says its commandos resorted to using their weapons only after they were attacked once boarding the vessels .
however , activist survivors of the skirmishes say the soldiers opened fire immediately after rappelling aboard .
the inquiry is to question defense minister ehud barak on tuesday , followed by chief of staff gabi ashkenazi on wednesday .

now he 's tackling the big screen - with the story of a retired politician . what do former world leaders do once they 've said goodbye to their bodyguards and handed back the keys to the presidential palace ?
some start working on weighty memoirs ; others devote themselves to their favorite charity .
former czech president vaclav havel , on the other hand , is currently directing his first feature film .
based on his most recent play , entitled " leaving , " it tells the story of a politician trying to adjust to a new life after leaving politics .
the main character , vilem rieger , is the former chancellor of an unnamed country and finds himself locked in a battle of wills with his successor , the unsavory vlastik klein .
it 's a " lear " -like contemplation on a politician 's frustrating impotence at finding himself slowly being forced out of his beloved government villa .
inspired by real life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havel 's wife , actress dagmar havlova , stars in the film at a real villa in the town of ceska skalice , in the far north-east of the country , the former president is fulfilling his lifelong dream .
for the next few weeks , he 'll be sitting in the director 's chair , filming the screen version of his play .
i 've been quite surprised at how quick and smooth everything is , " havel told reporters , " i come up with an idea on the set , i tell the person standing next to me about it , and the next day we 're filming it .
it certainly was n't like that when i was president ! "
at first glance , there seem to be many similarities with vaclav havel 's own life .
vilem rieger 's rival and successor is named vlastik klein ; havel 's real-life rival and successor as president is vaclav klaus .
in the family nevertheless , havel has denied that the story is strictly autobiographical , saying he first began toying with the idea back in the 1970 's .
he wrote the main female role - the chancellor 's wife , irena - for his own wife , actress dagmar havlova .
" it 's obviously a real honor to play the part , but i have to point out that vaclav wrote the role for me , not about me , " commented havlova .
" i was there when he wrote the script , i remember reading the first draft , so i 'm so happy to finally get the chance to act in it . "
vaclav havel 's resume is already impressive : world-renowned playwright , anti-communist dissident , denim-clad revolutionary , and , of course , president of his country for more than a decade .
now , at the tender age of 73 , he 's adding another string to his bow and , as he explained , film is very much in his blood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havel says directing a film is more efficient than politics " i come from a filmmaking family ; my uncle basically founded the czech cinema industry , so i grew up around film people , " said havel .
" so i always wanted to be a film director , but the political atmosphere in the 50 's and 60 's meant i was n't allowed to go to film school . "
a daring director havel has been involved in theater for most of his adult life , from the 1950 's onwards , and many of the roles in " leaving " have been filled with his close friends from the business , including well-known czech actress eva holubova .
" vaclav havel , for me , is not only president ; he is vaclav havel , " said holubova .
" he 's a very clever director , a very funny director , and he is n't afraid - never . "
filming is scheduled to be completed on august 21 , the anniversary of the soviet-led invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 . reviews for the stage version of " leaving " were mixed , with some critics saying it was nowhere near as good as havel 's earlier work .
but vaclav havel 's uncle , who built czechoslovakia 's first film studios , and his grandfather , who built prague 's first cinema , would no doubt be proud . author : rob cameron , ceska skalice editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de theater -pipe- 09.08.2010 former czech president havel directs first movie großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film director is a new role for havel vaclav havel , the first president of the czech republic , has made a name for himself as a playwright .
now he 's tackling the big screen - with the story of a retired politician . what do former world leaders do once they 've said goodbye to their bodyguards and handed back the keys to the presidential palace ?
some start working on weighty memoirs ; others devote themselves to their favorite charity .
former czech president vaclav havel , on the other hand , is currently directing his first feature film .
based on his most recent play , entitled " leaving , " it tells the story of a politician trying to adjust to a new life after leaving politics .
the main character , vilem rieger , is the former chancellor of an unnamed country and finds himself locked in a battle of wills with his successor , the unsavory vlastik klein .
it 's a " lear " -like contemplation on a politician 's frustrating impotence at finding himself slowly being forced out of his beloved government villa .
inspired by real life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havel 's wife , actress dagmar havlova , stars in the film at a real villa in the town of ceska skalice , in the far north-east of the country , the former president is fulfilling his lifelong dream .
for the next few weeks , he 'll be sitting in the director 's chair , filming the screen version of his play .
i 've been quite surprised at how quick and smooth everything is , " havel told reporters , " i come up with an idea on the set , i tell the person standing next to me about it , and the next day we 're filming it .
it certainly was n't like that when i was president ! "
at first glance , there seem to be many similarities with vaclav havel 's own life .
vilem rieger 's rival and successor is named vlastik klein ; havel 's real-life rival and successor as president is vaclav klaus .
in the family nevertheless , havel has denied that the story is strictly autobiographical , saying he first began toying with the idea back in the 1970 's .
he wrote the main female role - the chancellor 's wife , irena - for his own wife , actress dagmar havlova .
" it 's obviously a real honor to play the part , but i have to point out that vaclav wrote the role for me , not about me , " commented havlova .
" i was there when he wrote the script , i remember reading the first draft , so i 'm so happy to finally get the chance to act in it . "
vaclav havel 's resume is already impressive : world-renowned playwright , anti-communist dissident , denim-clad revolutionary , and , of course , president of his country for more than a decade .
now , at the tender age of 73 , he 's adding another string to his bow and , as he explained , film is very much in his blood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havel says directing a film is more efficient than politics " i come from a filmmaking family ; my uncle basically founded the czech cinema industry , so i grew up around film people , " said havel .

2010 the japanese port of nagasaki has marked 65 years since it was flattened by a us atom bomb , that killed over 70,000 people .
the debate on whether the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki were at all justified rages on . when " little boy " - the first atom bomb - was dropped on hiroshima , the reactions among the scientists who had worked for years on perfecting the technology were mixed . " a few people laughed , a few people cried , most people were silent , " recalled robert oppenheimer , the scientific director of the manhattan project . although his colleagues later said that oppenheimer was triumphant about his part in developing the technology , he is famous for the following quote from hindu mythology : " now i have become death , the destroyer of worlds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert oppenheimer was the wartime director of the manhattan project that developed the atom bomb flash burns , falling debris and radiation sickness nobody had known exactly how devastating the impact would be and what the effect of the atom bomb on humans would be . tens of thousands were killed instantly .
flash or flame burns , falling debris , radiation sickness and other injuries and illness killed even more . us president harry truman was aware of the death and destruction in hiroshima as he made the decision to drop a second bomb - " fat man " - on nagasaki .
the plan was then to drop another in the third week of august and continue until japan surrendered . truman was relentless , announcing " if they do not now accept our terms they can expect a rain of ruin from the air the like of which has never been seen on this earth . " the main term of the potsdam declaration issued on july 26 , 1945 was that japan should surrender unconditionally .
however , sources indicate that the us was aware of how important it was for japan to be able to surrender on one condition – that of retaining the emperor , who some historians argue made it clear was in favor of surrendering . it remains unclear why the one condition that seemed of utmost importance to japan was not included in the declaration especially as after japan 's capitulation , emperor hirohito was allowed to reign on until his death in 1989 . bildunterschrift : survivors of the atomic bombings were called hibakushas sources indicate japan was on verge of surrendering what is clear is that the possibilities of ending the war without recourse to the atom bomb were not fully exhausted . sources show that japan would probably have surrendered after the threatened soviet invasion , which finally began on august 9 , and certainly before the us invasion that was planned for the autumn . yet , not only was hiroshima bombed but nagasaki too .
this is a fact that is greatly troubling to historians and many others , including the pakistani novelist kamila shamsie , whose latest novel burnt shadows has a protagonist who survives the bombing but loses all of her loved ones . " what was important to me , " she told deutsche welle , " was not just that i start with the nuclear bomb but that i start with nagasaki rather than hiroshima , which was something that i 'd been interested in since i was a student in america . " i remember going to a lecture once and someone in the middle of a conversation said : ' well , even those people who justify bombing hiroshima , how do you justify nagasaki three days later ? ' and it was something that really stuck with me : this idea of being able to obliterate a city in a second and to see the photographs of the damage that was done as we know truman did and then three days later to say ' i 'll do that again ' .
it seemed to me that more than anything else , that single moment when the bomb is dropped on nagasaki is to me a kind of acknowledgement that in war there are no limits to what we 'll do to destroy others in the pursuit of victory . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president truman took full responsibility for ordering the atomic bombs be used on japan " one million american lives were saved " the much bandied-about justification for dropping the atomic bombs was that they saved one american million lives .
even today , many americans believe this myth . however , today it is known that even the wildest of official calculations had estimated there would be a maximum of 46,000 american casualties if the us invaded japan . leading historians , such as gar alperowitz , have argued that there is strong evidence to support another reason for dropping the bombs – the desire to frighten the soviets and give the us the " upper hand in diplomatic relations " . hibakushas campaign for nuclear disarmament takai miashita is a hibakusha , " an explosion-affected person " , who volunteers at the nagasaki atomic bomb museum . " i was in class six when the atom bomb was dropped , " he recalls .
" my school was about 40 kilometers away from the epicenter .
but i saw many victims and many of my relatives , who lived in the city , died .
i will never forget this experience .
that 's why i work in this museum . " the us has never apologized for the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki .
today , it is still one of five nuclear powers allowed to have an arsenal by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . however , under president barack obama , who is a strong advocate of a world free of nuclear weapons , the us has revised its policy on the use of atomic weapons and renounced the development of any new ones . this year for the first time , the us ambassador to japan attended the ceremony in hiroshima commemorating the bombing .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert oppenheimer was the wartime director of the manhattan project that developed the atom bomb flash burns , falling debris and radiation sickness nobody had known exactly how devastating the impact would be and what the effect of the atom bomb on humans would be . tens of thousands were killed instantly .
flash or flame burns , falling debris , radiation sickness and other injuries and illness killed even more . us president harry truman was aware of the death and destruction in hiroshima as he made the decision to drop a second bomb - " fat man " - on nagasaki .
the plan was then to drop another in the third week of august and continue until japan surrendered . truman was relentless , announcing " if they do not now accept our terms they can expect a rain of ruin from the air the like of which has never been seen on this earth . " the main term of the potsdam declaration issued on july 26 , 1945 was that japan should surrender unconditionally .
however , sources indicate that the us was aware of how important it was for japan to be able to surrender on one condition – that of retaining the emperor , who some historians argue made it clear was in favor of surrendering . it remains unclear why the one condition that seemed of utmost importance to japan was not included in the declaration especially as after japan 's capitulation , emperor hirohito was allowed to reign on until his death in 1989 . bildunterschrift : survivors of the atomic bombings were called hibakushas sources indicate japan was on verge of surrendering what is clear is that the possibilities of ending the war without recourse to the atom bomb were not fully exhausted . sources show that japan would probably have surrendered after the threatened soviet invasion , which finally began on august 9 , and certainly before the us invasion that was planned for the autumn . yet , not only was hiroshima bombed but nagasaki too .
this is a fact that is greatly troubling to historians and many others , including the pakistani novelist kamila shamsie , whose latest novel burnt shadows has a protagonist who survives the bombing but loses all of her loved ones . " what was important to me , " she told deutsche welle , " was not just that i start with the nuclear bomb but that i start with nagasaki rather than hiroshima , which was something that i 'd been interested in since i was a student in america . " i remember going to a lecture once and someone in the middle of a conversation said : ' well , even those people who justify bombing hiroshima , how do you justify nagasaki three days later ? ' and it was something that really stuck with me : this idea of being able to obliterate a city in a second and to see the photographs of the damage that was done as we know truman did and then three days later to say ' i 'll do that again ' .
it seemed to me that more than anything else , that single moment when the bomb is dropped on nagasaki is to me a kind of acknowledgement that in war there are no limits to what we 'll do to destroy others in the pursuit of victory . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president truman took full responsibility for ordering the atomic bombs be used on japan " one million american lives were saved " the much bandied-about justification for dropping the atomic bombs was that they saved one american million lives .
even today , many americans believe this myth . however , today it is known that even the wildest of official calculations had estimated there would be a maximum of 46,000 american casualties if the us invaded japan . leading historians , such as gar alperowitz , have argued that there is strong evidence to support another reason for dropping the bombs – the desire to frighten the soviets and give the us the " upper hand in diplomatic relations " . hibakushas campaign for nuclear disarmament takai miashita is a hibakusha , " an explosion-affected person " , who volunteers at the nagasaki atomic bomb museum .

2010 the japanese port of nagasaki has marked 65 years since it was flattened by a us atom bomb , that killed over 70,000 people .
the debate on whether the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki were at all justified rages on . when " little boy " - the first atom bomb - was dropped on hiroshima , the reactions among the scientists who had worked for years on perfecting the technology were mixed . " a few people laughed , a few people cried , most people were silent , " recalled robert oppenheimer , the scientific director of the manhattan project . although his colleagues later said that oppenheimer was triumphant about his part in developing the technology , he is famous for the following quote from hindu mythology : " now i have become death , the destroyer of worlds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 09.08.2010 hamburg authorities shut down mosque suspected of radicalization großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police only found one man in the mosque in their 6 a.m. raid authorities in hamburg raided and shut down a mosque visited by september 11 jihadists on monday .
shortly before ramadan , hamburg deemed the mosque 's extreme islamist ideology as sufficient grounds for a ban . hamburg police early monday morning raided a mosque with a known history of breeding jihadists , city authorities reported .
at 6 a.m.
monday morning 20 police officers reportedly entered the mosque searching for evidence of islamist radicalization .
hamburg 's interior minister , christoph ahlhaus , deemed the group 's islamist ideology reason enough to close the center for good .
" the mosque is now being sealed up , so that the phantom behind the walls on steindamm street has come to an end , " announced ahlhaus , who ordered that the mosque 's community be banned - and the homes of four members of the supporting taiba arab-german culture association searched .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahlhaus called the mosque a ' phantom ' ahlhaus said in a press conference hours after the raid that hamburg could not allow " a point of contact for a group that advocates islamist social order and will not shy away from violence to assert it . " 9/11 notoriety the taiba mosque in hamburg 's st. georg neighborhood received international attention under its former name , al quds , when it became known that the september 11 suicide pilot mohammed attah had used his contacts there to forge a terrorist cell .
according to manfred murck , deputy director of hamburg 's internal intelligence service , the mosque had continued to serve " as a symbolic location for jihadists from all over germany and even abroad , because it had the perpetrators as its nimbus . "
" the mosque also continued to serve as a center of radicalization , " he said . lothar bergmann , head of hamburg 's anti-terrorism unit , referred to the taiba mosque 's leader , syrian-german mamoun darkazanli , as a " preacher of hate , " adding that his teachings and sermons as well as texts published on the community 's website promoted jihad . the investigation had gone on for months as strong evidence was needed to close the house of worship , murck said . bad timing , or strategic timing ? yet , after a decade of suspicion against the mosque , the timing of the raid has come under question , especially considering the proximity to hamburg 's august 25 mayoral election , in which ahlhaus is a prime candidate to win the office . aiman mazyek , secretary general of the central council of muslims in germany , told deutsche welle he also found it " regretful that this -lsb- raid and ban -rsb- had to take place just before ramadan . " " politicians should want to get peaceful muslims on their side ...

maybe they should have tried to do this at a different date , not just before ramadan - and an election , " mazyek added . mazyek , whose organization represents nearly 2,600 muslim communities , also fears that the pursuit of islamists will have a negative impact on peaceful muslims living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the community says it planned to vacate anyway he said studies had proven that the " war on terror " had increased extremist violence against muslims and mosques . staying on guard authorities estimate that hamburg is home to 45 jihad supporters and that around 200 people regularly attended friday services at the mosque , which they believe to have been particularly aggressive in ideology . hamburg 's jihadists have continued to make the news since the world trade center attacks .
authorities say that 11 young muslims went on from the taiba mosque to train in militant camps on the afghan-pakistani border .
one of them , known as rami m. , found his way into a terrorist militia in the region before he was arrested in march 2009 . yet the problem is not specific to hamburg , according to rolf tophoven of the institute for terrorism research and security policy . tophoven said there were centers of radicalization all over germany and europe , but that most - working under the guise of mosques and koran schools - were focused on indoctrination rather than militant training . misorienting muslim youth " not all these cells are looking for a terrorist operation , " he said , adding that germany in particular was threatened by " islamist centers , which are going to infiltrate the minds of young muslim people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu askar is a known jihadist , formerly from hamburg " if you have a young muslim student , who is not centralized in his family , who is looking for orientation , and this man falls in the hands of a radical imam or scholar , then often he will leave his family and look for jihad training in afghanistan , and especially on the afghan-pakistani border on the pakistani side , " tophoven said . furthermore , he added , local terrorist cells in europe had become more sophisticated and no longer needed operational orders from above . " they know how to recruit perpetrators .
the ideological framework is the credo of osama bin laden : every good muslim has the duty to fight the so-called non-muslim community . "

shortly before ramadan , hamburg deemed the mosque 's extreme islamist ideology as sufficient grounds for a ban . hamburg police early monday morning raided a mosque with a known history of breeding jihadists , city authorities reported .
at 6 a.m.
monday morning 20 police officers reportedly entered the mosque searching for evidence of islamist radicalization .
hamburg 's interior minister , christoph ahlhaus , deemed the group 's islamist ideology reason enough to close the center for good .
" the mosque is now being sealed up , so that the phantom behind the walls on steindamm street has come to an end , " announced ahlhaus , who ordered that the mosque 's community be banned - and the homes of four members of the supporting taiba arab-german culture association searched .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahlhaus called the mosque a ' phantom ' ahlhaus said in a press conference hours after the raid that hamburg could not allow " a point of contact for a group that advocates islamist social order and will not shy away from violence to assert it . " 9/11 notoriety the taiba mosque in hamburg 's st. georg neighborhood received international attention under its former name , al quds , when it became known that the september 11 suicide pilot mohammed attah had used his contacts there to forge a terrorist cell .
according to manfred murck , deputy director of hamburg 's internal intelligence service , the mosque had continued to serve " as a symbolic location for jihadists from all over germany and even abroad , because it had the perpetrators as its nimbus . "
" the mosque also continued to serve as a center of radicalization , " he said . lothar bergmann , head of hamburg 's anti-terrorism unit , referred to the taiba mosque 's leader , syrian-german mamoun darkazanli , as a " preacher of hate , " adding that his teachings and sermons as well as texts published on the community 's website promoted jihad . the investigation had gone on for months as strong evidence was needed to close the house of worship , murck said . bad timing , or strategic timing ? yet , after a decade of suspicion against the mosque , the timing of the raid has come under question , especially considering the proximity to hamburg 's august 25 mayoral election , in which ahlhaus is a prime candidate to win the office . aiman mazyek , secretary general of the central council of muslims in germany , told deutsche welle he also found it " regretful that this -lsb- raid and ban -rsb- had to take place just before ramadan .

" i am convinced that at the end of your investigation , it will become clear that the state of israel and the idf -lrb- israeli defense forces -rrb- acted in accordance with international law , " netanyahu told members of the tirkel commission as he began testifying about the raid .
netanyahu was the first witness to testify at the internal investigation , which was set up following intense international pressure on the israeli government following the commando raid in may . the raid , on six ships attempting to break a naval blockade of the gaza strip , killed nine turkish activists and wounded many others .
turkey ' did nothing ' the incident sparked a diplomatic crisis between israel and turkey .
netanyahu accused turkey of making no effort to prevent the flotilla from breaking the blockade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flotilla was carrying some 800 activists and 10,000 tons of supplies " despite our diplomatic efforts , the turkish government did nothing " to halt the flotilla , which was organized by the " radical turkish organization ihh which supports hamas , " he told the five-member panel , which is being overseen by two international observers .
" the turkish government did not consider the confrontation between turkish activists and israel to be against its interests . "
netanyahu added that he ordered troops to make a " supreme effort " to avoid harming any passengers on board the aid ships .
israel says its commandos resorted to using their weapons only after they were attacked once boarding the vessels .
however , activist survivors of the skirmishes say the soldiers opened fire immediately after rappelling aboard .
the inquiry is to question defense minister ehud barak on tuesday , followed by chief of staff gabi ashkenazi on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 09.08.2010 hamburg authorities shut down mosque suspected of radicalization großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police only found one man in the mosque in their 6 a.m. raid authorities in hamburg raided and shut down a mosque visited by september 11 jihadists on monday .
shortly before ramadan , hamburg deemed the mosque 's extreme islamist ideology as sufficient grounds for a ban . hamburg police early monday morning raided a mosque with a known history of breeding jihadists , city authorities reported .
at 6 a.m.
monday morning 20 police officers reportedly entered the mosque searching for evidence of islamist radicalization .
hamburg 's interior minister , christoph ahlhaus , deemed the group 's islamist ideology reason enough to close the center for good .
" the mosque is now being sealed up , so that the phantom behind the walls on steindamm street has come to an end , " announced ahlhaus , who ordered that the mosque 's community be banned - and the homes of four members of the supporting taiba arab-german culture association searched .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahlhaus called the mosque a ' phantom ' ahlhaus said in a press conference hours after the raid that hamburg could not allow " a point of contact for a group that advocates islamist social order and will not shy away from violence to assert it . " 9/11 notoriety the taiba mosque in hamburg 's st. georg neighborhood received international attention under its former name , al quds , when it became known that the september 11 suicide pilot mohammed attah had used his contacts there to forge a terrorist cell .
according to manfred murck , deputy director of hamburg 's internal intelligence service , the mosque had continued to serve " as a symbolic location for jihadists from all over germany and even abroad , because it had the perpetrators as its nimbus . "
" the mosque also continued to serve as a center of radicalization , " he said . lothar bergmann , head of hamburg 's anti-terrorism unit , referred to the taiba mosque 's leader , syrian-german mamoun darkazanli , as a " preacher of hate , " adding that his teachings and sermons as well as texts published on the community 's website promoted jihad . the investigation had gone on for months as strong evidence was needed to close the house of worship , murck said . bad timing , or strategic timing ? yet , after a decade of suspicion against the mosque , the timing of the raid has come under question , especially considering the proximity to hamburg 's august 25 mayoral election , in which ahlhaus is a prime candidate to win the office . aiman mazyek , secretary general of the central council of muslims in germany , told deutsche welle he also found it " regretful that this -lsb- raid and ban -rsb- had to take place just before ramadan . " " politicians should want to get peaceful muslims on their side ...
maybe they should have tried to do this at a different date , not just before ramadan - and an election , " mazyek added . mazyek , whose organization represents nearly 2,600 muslim communities , also fears that the pursuit of islamists will have a negative impact on peaceful muslims living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the community says it planned to vacate anyway he said studies had proven that the " war on terror " had increased extremist violence against muslims and mosques . staying on guard authorities estimate that hamburg is home to 45 jihad supporters and that around 200 people regularly attended friday services at the mosque , which they believe to have been particularly aggressive in ideology . hamburg 's jihadists have continued to make the news since the world trade center attacks .
authorities say that 11 young muslims went on from the taiba mosque to train in militant camps on the afghan-pakistani border .
one of them , known as rami m. , found his way into a terrorist militia in the region before he was arrested in march 2009 . yet the problem is not specific to hamburg , according to rolf tophoven of the institute for terrorism research and security policy . tophoven said there were centers of radicalization all over germany and europe , but that most - working under the guise of mosques and koran schools - were focused on indoctrination rather than militant training . misorienting muslim youth " not all these cells are looking for a terrorist operation , " he said , adding that germany in particular was threatened by " islamist centers , which are going to infiltrate the minds of young muslim people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu askar is a known jihadist , formerly from hamburg " if you have a young muslim student , who is not centralized in his family , who is looking for orientation , and this man falls in the hands of a radical imam or scholar , then often he will leave his family and look for jihad training in afghanistan , and especially on the afghan-pakistani border on the pakistani side , " tophoven said . furthermore , he added , local terrorist cells in europe had become more sophisticated and no longer needed operational orders from above . " they know how to recruit perpetrators .
the ideological framework is the credo of osama bin laden : every good muslim has the duty to fight the so-called non-muslim community . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de theater -pipe- 09.08.2010 former czech president havel directs first movie großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film director is a new role for havel vaclav havel , the first president of the czech republic , has made a name for himself as a playwright .
now he 's tackling the big screen - with the story of a retired politician . what do former world leaders do once they 've said goodbye to their bodyguards and handed back the keys to the presidential palace ?
some start working on weighty memoirs ; others devote themselves to their favorite charity .
former czech president vaclav havel , on the other hand , is currently directing his first feature film .
based on his most recent play , entitled " leaving , " it tells the story of a politician trying to adjust to a new life after leaving politics .
the main character , vilem rieger , is the former chancellor of an unnamed country and finds himself locked in a battle of wills with his successor , the unsavory vlastik klein .
it 's a " lear " -like contemplation on a politician 's frustrating impotence at finding himself slowly being forced out of his beloved government villa .
inspired by real life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havel 's wife , actress dagmar havlova , stars in the film at a real villa in the town of ceska skalice , in the far north-east of the country , the former president is fulfilling his lifelong dream .
for the next few weeks , he 'll be sitting in the director 's chair , filming the screen version of his play .
i 've been quite surprised at how quick and smooth everything is , " havel told reporters , " i come up with an idea on the set , i tell the person standing next to me about it , and the next day we 're filming it .
it certainly was n't like that when i was president ! "
at first glance , there seem to be many similarities with vaclav havel 's own life .
vilem rieger 's rival and successor is named vlastik klein ; havel 's real-life rival and successor as president is vaclav klaus .
in the family nevertheless , havel has denied that the story is strictly autobiographical , saying he first began toying with the idea back in the 1970 's .
he wrote the main female role - the chancellor 's wife , irena - for his own wife , actress dagmar havlova .
" it 's obviously a real honor to play the part , but i have to point out that vaclav wrote the role for me , not about me , " commented havlova .
" i was there when he wrote the script , i remember reading the first draft , so i 'm so happy to finally get the chance to act in it . "
vaclav havel 's resume is already impressive : world-renowned playwright , anti-communist dissident , denim-clad revolutionary , and , of course , president of his country for more than a decade .
now , at the tender age of 73 , he 's adding another string to his bow and , as he explained , film is very much in his blood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havel says directing a film is more efficient than politics " i come from a filmmaking family ; my uncle basically founded the czech cinema industry , so i grew up around film people , " said havel .
" so i always wanted to be a film director , but the political atmosphere in the 50 's and 60 's meant i was n't allowed to go to film school . "
a daring director havel has been involved in theater for most of his adult life , from the 1950 's onwards , and many of the roles in " leaving " have been filled with his close friends from the business , including well-known czech actress eva holubova .
" vaclav havel , for me , is not only president ; he is vaclav havel , " said holubova .
" he 's a very clever director , a very funny director , and he is n't afraid - never . "
filming is scheduled to be completed on august 21 , the anniversary of the soviet-led invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 . reviews for the stage version of " leaving " were mixed , with some critics saying it was nowhere near as good as havel 's earlier work .
but vaclav havel 's uncle , who built czechoslovakia 's first film studios , and his grandfather , who built prague 's first cinema , would no doubt be proud . author : rob cameron , ceska skalice editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now he 's tackling the big screen - with the story of a retired politician . what do former world leaders do once they 've said goodbye to their bodyguards and handed back the keys to the presidential palace ?
some start working on weighty memoirs ; others devote themselves to their favorite charity .
former czech president vaclav havel , on the other hand , is currently directing his first feature film .
based on his most recent play , entitled " leaving , " it tells the story of a politician trying to adjust to a new life after leaving politics .
the main character , vilem rieger , is the former chancellor of an unnamed country and finds himself locked in a battle of wills with his successor , the unsavory vlastik klein .
it 's a " lear " -like contemplation on a politician 's frustrating impotence at finding himself slowly being forced out of his beloved government villa .
inspired by real life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havel 's wife , actress dagmar havlova , stars in the film at a real villa in the town of ceska skalice , in the far north-east of the country , the former president is fulfilling his lifelong dream .
for the next few weeks , he 'll be sitting in the director 's chair , filming the screen version of his play .
i 've been quite surprised at how quick and smooth everything is , " havel told reporters , " i come up with an idea on the set , i tell the person standing next to me about it , and the next day we 're filming it .
it certainly was n't like that when i was president ! "
at first glance , there seem to be many similarities with vaclav havel 's own life .
vilem rieger 's rival and successor is named vlastik klein ; havel 's real-life rival and successor as president is vaclav klaus .
in the family nevertheless , havel has denied that the story is strictly autobiographical , saying he first began toying with the idea back in the 1970 's .
he wrote the main female role - the chancellor 's wife , irena - for his own wife , actress dagmar havlova .
" it 's obviously a real honor to play the part , but i have to point out that vaclav wrote the role for me , not about me , " commented havlova .
" i was there when he wrote the script , i remember reading the first draft , so i 'm so happy to finally get the chance to act in it . "
vaclav havel 's resume is already impressive : world-renowned playwright , anti-communist dissident , denim-clad revolutionary , and , of course , president of his country for more than a decade .
now , at the tender age of 73 , he 's adding another string to his bow and , as he explained , film is very much in his blood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havel says directing a film is more efficient than politics " i come from a filmmaking family ; my uncle basically founded the czech cinema industry , so i grew up around film people , " said havel .
" so i always wanted to be a film director , but the political atmosphere in the 50 's and 60 's meant i was n't allowed to go to film school . "
a daring director havel has been involved in theater for most of his adult life , from the 1950 's onwards , and many of the roles in " leaving " have been filled with his close friends from the business , including well-known czech actress eva holubova .
" vaclav havel , for me , is not only president ; he is vaclav havel , " said holubova .
" he 's a very clever director , a very funny director , and he is n't afraid - never . "
filming is scheduled to be completed on august 21 , the anniversary of the soviet-led invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 . reviews for the stage version of " leaving " were mixed , with some critics saying it was nowhere near as good as havel 's earlier work .
but vaclav havel 's uncle , who built czechoslovakia 's first film studios , and his grandfather , who built prague 's first cinema , would no doubt be proud . author : rob cameron , ceska skalice editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2010 the japanese port of nagasaki has marked 65 years since it was flattened by a us atom bomb , that killed over 70,000 people .
the debate on whether the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki were at all justified rages on . when " little boy " - the first atom bomb - was dropped on hiroshima , the reactions among the scientists who had worked for years on perfecting the technology were mixed . " a few people laughed , a few people cried , most people were silent , " recalled robert oppenheimer , the scientific director of the manhattan project . although his colleagues later said that oppenheimer was triumphant about his part in developing the technology , he is famous for the following quote from hindu mythology : " now i have become death , the destroyer of worlds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert oppenheimer was the wartime director of the manhattan project that developed the atom bomb flash burns , falling debris and radiation sickness nobody had known exactly how devastating the impact would be and what the effect of the atom bomb on humans would be . tens of thousands were killed instantly .
flash or flame burns , falling debris , radiation sickness and other injuries and illness killed even more . us president harry truman was aware of the death and destruction in hiroshima as he made the decision to drop a second bomb - " fat man " - on nagasaki .
the plan was then to drop another in the third week of august and continue until japan surrendered . truman was relentless , announcing " if they do not now accept our terms they can expect a rain of ruin from the air the like of which has never been seen on this earth . " the main term of the potsdam declaration issued on july 26 , 1945 was that japan should surrender unconditionally .
however , sources indicate that the us was aware of how important it was for japan to be able to surrender on one condition – that of retaining the emperor , who some historians argue made it clear was in favor of surrendering . it remains unclear why the one condition that seemed of utmost importance to japan was not included in the declaration especially as after japan 's capitulation , emperor hirohito was allowed to reign on until his death in 1989 . bildunterschrift : survivors of the atomic bombings were called hibakushas sources indicate japan was on verge of surrendering what is clear is that the possibilities of ending the war without recourse to the atom bomb were not fully exhausted . sources show that japan would probably have surrendered after the threatened soviet invasion , which finally began on august 9 , and certainly before the us invasion that was planned for the autumn . yet , not only was hiroshima bombed but nagasaki too .
this is a fact that is greatly troubling to historians and many others , including the pakistani novelist kamila shamsie , whose latest novel burnt shadows has a protagonist who survives the bombing but loses all of her loved ones . " what was important to me , " she told deutsche welle , " was not just that i start with the nuclear bomb but that i start with nagasaki rather than hiroshima , which was something that i 'd been interested in since i was a student in america . " i remember going to a lecture once and someone in the middle of a conversation said : ' well , even those people who justify bombing hiroshima , how do you justify nagasaki three days later ? ' and it was something that really stuck with me : this idea of being able to obliterate a city in a second and to see the photographs of the damage that was done as we know truman did and then three days later to say ' i 'll do that again ' .

the allegations made by german public broadcaster ndr against around 100 pharmacies are being looked into by the public prosecutors in hamburg , celle , verden , kiel and braunschweig .
it 's believed chemists illegally purchased chemical substances that are not available inside germany for lower prices on the gray market .
they then mix these with substances to produce medications at a lower cost for diseases such as cancer .
the chemists then claim the substances with german health insurance companies at the inflated german price .
it 's thought that the illegal medications include antibiotics , painkillers and even cancer treatment drugs .
the braunschweig public prosecutor has reportedly already brought charges against one pharmacy , which it suspects of wrongfully claiming up to 1.7 million euros -lrb- $ 2.26 million -rrb- of medication .
investigators are reportedly relying on the testimony of a former wholesaler of illegal medications who wanted to leave the industry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear -pipe- 09.08.2010 nagasaki commemorates atomic bombing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : representatives of 32 countries attended the ceremony in nagasaki on 9 aug .
2010 the japanese port of nagasaki has marked 65 years since it was flattened by a us atom bomb , that killed over 70,000 people .
the debate on whether the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki were at all justified rages on . when " little boy " - the first atom bomb - was dropped on hiroshima , the reactions among the scientists who had worked for years on perfecting the technology were mixed . " a few people laughed , a few people cried , most people were silent , " recalled robert oppenheimer , the scientific director of the manhattan project . although his colleagues later said that oppenheimer was triumphant about his part in developing the technology , he is famous for the following quote from hindu mythology : " now i have become death , the destroyer of worlds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert oppenheimer was the wartime director of the manhattan project that developed the atom bomb flash burns , falling debris and radiation sickness nobody had known exactly how devastating the impact would be and what the effect of the atom bomb on humans would be . tens of thousands were killed instantly .
flash or flame burns , falling debris , radiation sickness and other injuries and illness killed even more . us president harry truman was aware of the death and destruction in hiroshima as he made the decision to drop a second bomb - " fat man " - on nagasaki .
the plan was then to drop another in the third week of august and continue until japan surrendered . truman was relentless , announcing " if they do not now accept our terms they can expect a rain of ruin from the air the like of which has never been seen on this earth . " the main term of the potsdam declaration issued on july 26 , 1945 was that japan should surrender unconditionally .
however , sources indicate that the us was aware of how important it was for japan to be able to surrender on one condition – that of retaining the emperor , who some historians argue made it clear was in favor of surrendering . it remains unclear why the one condition that seemed of utmost importance to japan was not included in the declaration especially as after japan 's capitulation , emperor hirohito was allowed to reign on until his death in 1989 . bildunterschrift : survivors of the atomic bombings were called hibakushas sources indicate japan was on verge of surrendering what is clear is that the possibilities of ending the war without recourse to the atom bomb were not fully exhausted . sources show that japan would probably have surrendered after the threatened soviet invasion , which finally began on august 9 , and certainly before the us invasion that was planned for the autumn . yet , not only was hiroshima bombed but nagasaki too .
this is a fact that is greatly troubling to historians and many others , including the pakistani novelist kamila shamsie , whose latest novel burnt shadows has a protagonist who survives the bombing but loses all of her loved ones . " what was important to me , " she told deutsche welle , " was not just that i start with the nuclear bomb but that i start with nagasaki rather than hiroshima , which was something that i 'd been interested in since i was a student in america . " i remember going to a lecture once and someone in the middle of a conversation said : ' well , even those people who justify bombing hiroshima , how do you justify nagasaki three days later ? ' and it was something that really stuck with me : this idea of being able to obliterate a city in a second and to see the photographs of the damage that was done as we know truman did and then three days later to say ' i 'll do that again ' .
it seemed to me that more than anything else , that single moment when the bomb is dropped on nagasaki is to me a kind of acknowledgement that in war there are no limits to what we 'll do to destroy others in the pursuit of victory . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president truman took full responsibility for ordering the atomic bombs be used on japan " one million american lives were saved " the much bandied-about justification for dropping the atomic bombs was that they saved one american million lives .
even today , many americans believe this myth . however , today it is known that even the wildest of official calculations had estimated there would be a maximum of 46,000 american casualties if the us invaded japan . leading historians , such as gar alperowitz , have argued that there is strong evidence to support another reason for dropping the bombs – the desire to frighten the soviets and give the us the " upper hand in diplomatic relations " . hibakushas campaign for nuclear disarmament takai miashita is a hibakusha , " an explosion-affected person " , who volunteers at the nagasaki atomic bomb museum . " i was in class six when the atom bomb was dropped , " he recalls .
" my school was about 40 kilometers away from the epicenter .
but i saw many victims and many of my relatives , who lived in the city , died .
i will never forget this experience .
that 's why i work in this museum . " the us has never apologized for the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki .
today , it is still one of five nuclear powers allowed to have an arsenal by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . however , under president barack obama , who is a strong advocate of a world free of nuclear weapons , the us has revised its policy on the use of atomic weapons and renounced the development of any new ones . this year for the first time , the us ambassador to japan attended the ceremony in hiroshima commemorating the bombing .
nonetheless , no representative from the us attended the commemorations in nagasaki . author : anne thomas editor : disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

shortly before ramadan , hamburg deemed the mosque 's extreme islamist ideology as sufficient grounds for a ban . hamburg police early monday morning raided a mosque with a known history of breeding jihadists , city authorities reported .

monday morning 20 police officers reportedly entered the mosque searching for evidence of islamist radicalization .
hamburg 's interior minister , christoph ahlhaus , deemed the group 's islamist ideology reason enough to close the center for good .
" the mosque is now being sealed up , so that the phantom behind the walls on steindamm street has come to an end , " announced ahlhaus , who ordered that the mosque 's community be banned - and the homes of four members of the supporting taiba arab-german culture association searched .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahlhaus called the mosque a ' phantom ' ahlhaus said in a press conference hours after the raid that hamburg could not allow " a point of contact for a group that advocates islamist social order and will not shy away from violence to assert it .

" i am convinced that at the end of your investigation , it will become clear that the state of israel and the idf -lrb- israeli defense forces -rrb- acted in accordance with international law , " netanyahu told members of the tirkel commission as he began testifying about the raid .
netanyahu was the first witness to testify at the internal investigation , which was set up following intense international pressure on the israeli government following the commando raid in may . the raid , on six ships attempting to break a naval blockade of the gaza strip , killed nine turkish activists and wounded many others .
turkey ' did nothing ' the incident sparked a diplomatic crisis between israel and turkey .
netanyahu accused turkey of making no effort to prevent the flotilla from breaking the blockade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flotilla was carrying some 800 activists and 10,000 tons of supplies " despite our diplomatic efforts , the turkish government did nothing " to halt the flotilla , which was organized by the " radical turkish organization ihh which supports hamas , " he told the five-member panel , which is being overseen by two international observers .
" the turkish government did not consider the confrontation between turkish activists and israel to be against its interests . "
netanyahu added that he ordered troops to make a " supreme effort " to avoid harming any passengers on board the aid ships .
israel says its commandos resorted to using their weapons only after they were attacked once boarding the vessels .
however , activist survivors of the skirmishes say the soldiers opened fire immediately after rappelling aboard .
the inquiry is to question defense minister ehud barak on tuesday , followed by chief of staff gabi ashkenazi on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de medicine -pipe- 09.08.2010 german scientists discover ' needle-free ' malaria vaccine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : approximately half of all humans live in areas of the world threatened by malaria by combining antibiotics and malaria-infected mosquitos , researchers find that mice are protected .
human clinical trials will be just around the corner . deep in a lab , in carefully sealed incubators , mosquitos , which normally are malaria carriers , may this time actually be part of the solution .
kai matuschewski and his research team from the max planck institute for infection biology in berlin used mosquitoes to infect test mice with malaria .
at the same time , they gave the mice antibiotics for three days and the mice showed no signs of the disease .
matuschewski says this means that he and his research team may have discovered the first so-called " needle-free " malaria vaccine .
their research was published last month in the journal science translational medicine .
if successful , the vaccine would use a combination of drugs and the mosquito itself to prevent the onset of malaria .
it could be a boon to billions of people worldwide who are at risk for the disease , which mainly affects people living in temperate climates .
matuschewski said the idea behind their research was to " combine a classical prophylaxis aspect - which is antibiotic treatment - -lrb- that travelers use to protect themselves against malaria -rrb- , together with a natural exposure . "
" the mosquito is our sort of syringe that delivers the pathogen and we stop the parasite from growing in the liver through antibiotic prophylaxis , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malarone is a common anti-malarial drug ' the mice do n't get sick ' while feeding , a malaria-carrying mosquito injects something called a sporozoite , which is the cell form that infects the new host .
in this case , that would be the mouse .
in the real world , it could be a human .
the sporozoites migrate to the liver , where they replicate massively and mature to the disease-causing blood stage cells called merozoites .
in this new german study , the merozoites continued to develop in the liver cells , but the antibiotics prevented them from infecting the red blood cells , which meant that the mice did n't get malaria symptoms .
with this treatment the mice not only did n't get sick , but they also developed long-term immunity .
the mice were infected with sporozoites again after 40 days , four months , and six months , this time without adding antibiotics , and all the animals had complete protection against malaria .
antibiotic resistance the antibiotics the scientists used were clindamycin and azithromycin , that are both generic , cheap and readily available .
this is good news for poorer countries , but dr. michael knappik , from the berlin center for tropical and travel medicine , pointed out that there are drawbacks with using antibiotics in the long term .
" we have growing resistance against the malaria drugs we use at the moment , " he said , " and that 's a big problem especially in southeast asia , and this of course can also arise in these new antibiotic treatments . "
matuschewski and his team hope to reduce the likelihood of antibiotic resistance by administering the drugs once a year - at the onset of the rainy season .
he added that antibiotic resistance is n't as pronounced in africa as it is in western countries , so the benefits could outweigh the concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this electron micrograph shows a female anopheles stephensi mosquito , which often is a carrier of malaria clinical trials to begin next year if successful , this new treatment could dramatically lower the one million deaths worldwide from malaria every year .
around 600 germans contract the disease each year , and sebastian hofmann was one of the unlucky ones .
seven years ago at age 19 , hofmann went backpacking across west africa , and , despite the usual malaria prevention measures - including medicine , insect repellent and mosquito nets - he still contracted the disease . "
i was hallucinating .
i was sweaty , " he remembered , " i thought i was somehow in the state of being really drunk and having a really bad flu . "
hofmann contracted the worst strain of malaria and fell into a coma for three days , although he eventually recovered .
while this new treatment is n't targeted at travelers in general - because you need to be infected with malaria first for it to work - it could make a big difference for people living in severely affected regions . "
in endemic areas in kenya , in east africa , people live there for 20 years , get infected probably sometimes 100 times a year and they always develop parasites , " matuschewski said .
" so to achieve something like anti-parasitic sterile immunity is almost impossible .
so what we want is to protect against disease . "
put another way , even if children living in malaria regions are protected daily with bed nets , according to matuschewski all this does is delay their potential exposure to the disease and subsequent symptoms and complications .
so rather than trying to prevent all mosquito bites - which is virtually impossible - this new treatment uses the infection as a part of the solution in combination with the antibiotic .
because the antibiotics are readily available , matuschewski and his research team hope that clinical trials could start in sub-saharan africa , as early as the beginning of summer next year .
while they 're excited about their findings , scientists like dr johannes friesen from the max planck institute for infection biology in berlin , were careful to point out that their research is just " one component to fight the disease . "

shortly before ramadan , hamburg deemed the mosque 's extreme islamist ideology as sufficient grounds for a ban . hamburg police early monday morning raided a mosque with a known history of breeding jihadists , city authorities reported .
at 6 a.m.
monday morning 20 police officers reportedly entered the mosque searching for evidence of islamist radicalization .
hamburg 's interior minister , christoph ahlhaus , deemed the group 's islamist ideology reason enough to close the center for good .
" the mosque is now being sealed up , so that the phantom behind the walls on steindamm street has come to an end , " announced ahlhaus , who ordered that the mosque 's community be banned - and the homes of four members of the supporting taiba arab-german culture association searched .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahlhaus called the mosque a ' phantom ' ahlhaus said in a press conference hours after the raid that hamburg could not allow " a point of contact for a group that advocates islamist social order and will not shy away from violence to assert it . " 9/11 notoriety the taiba mosque in hamburg 's st. georg neighborhood received international attention under its former name , al quds , when it became known that the september 11 suicide pilot mohammed attah had used his contacts there to forge a terrorist cell .
according to manfred murck , deputy director of hamburg 's internal intelligence service , the mosque had continued to serve " as a symbolic location for jihadists from all over germany and even abroad , because it had the perpetrators as its nimbus . "
" the mosque also continued to serve as a center of radicalization , " he said . lothar bergmann , head of hamburg 's anti-terrorism unit , referred to the taiba mosque 's leader , syrian-german mamoun darkazanli , as a " preacher of hate , " adding that his teachings and sermons as well as texts published on the community 's website promoted jihad . the investigation had gone on for months as strong evidence was needed to close the house of worship , murck said . bad timing , or strategic timing ? yet , after a decade of suspicion against the mosque , the timing of the raid has come under question , especially considering the proximity to hamburg 's august 25 mayoral election , in which ahlhaus is a prime candidate to win the office . aiman mazyek , secretary general of the central council of muslims in germany , told deutsche welle he also found it " regretful that this -lsb- raid and ban -rsb- had to take place just before ramadan . " " politicians should want to get peaceful muslims on their side ...
maybe they should have tried to do this at a different date , not just before ramadan - and an election , " mazyek added . mazyek , whose organization represents nearly 2,600 muslim communities , also fears that the pursuit of islamists will have a negative impact on peaceful muslims living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the community says it planned to vacate anyway he said studies had proven that the " war on terror " had increased extremist violence against muslims and mosques . staying on guard authorities estimate that hamburg is home to 45 jihad supporters and that around 200 people regularly attended friday services at the mosque , which they believe to have been particularly aggressive in ideology . hamburg 's jihadists have continued to make the news since the world trade center attacks .
authorities say that 11 young muslims went on from the taiba mosque to train in militant camps on the afghan-pakistani border .
one of them , known as rami m. , found his way into a terrorist militia in the region before he was arrested in march 2009 . yet the problem is not specific to hamburg , according to rolf tophoven of the institute for terrorism research and security policy . tophoven said there were centers of radicalization all over germany and europe , but that most - working under the guise of mosques and koran schools - were focused on indoctrination rather than militant training . misorienting muslim youth " not all these cells are looking for a terrorist operation , " he said , adding that germany in particular was threatened by " islamist centers , which are going to infiltrate the minds of young muslim people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abu askar is a known jihadist , formerly from hamburg " if you have a young muslim student , who is not centralized in his family , who is looking for orientation , and this man falls in the hands of a radical imam or scholar , then often he will leave his family and look for jihad training in afghanistan , and especially on the afghan-pakistani border on the pakistani side , " tophoven said . furthermore , he added , local terrorist cells in europe had become more sophisticated and no longer needed operational orders from above . " they know how to recruit perpetrators .
the ideological framework is the credo of osama bin laden : every good muslim has the duty to fight the so-called non-muslim community . "

2010 the japanese port of nagasaki has marked 65 years since it was flattened by a us atom bomb , that killed over 70,000 people .
the debate on whether the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki were at all justified rages on . when " little boy " - the first atom bomb - was dropped on hiroshima , the reactions among the scientists who had worked for years on perfecting the technology were mixed . " a few people laughed , a few people cried , most people were silent , " recalled robert oppenheimer , the scientific director of the manhattan project . although his colleagues later said that oppenheimer was triumphant about his part in developing the technology , he is famous for the following quote from hindu mythology : " now i have become death , the destroyer of worlds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert oppenheimer was the wartime director of the manhattan project that developed the atom bomb flash burns , falling debris and radiation sickness nobody had known exactly how devastating the impact would be and what the effect of the atom bomb on humans would be . tens of thousands were killed instantly .
flash or flame burns , falling debris , radiation sickness and other injuries and illness killed even more . us president harry truman was aware of the death and destruction in hiroshima as he made the decision to drop a second bomb - " fat man " - on nagasaki .
the plan was then to drop another in the third week of august and continue until japan surrendered . truman was relentless , announcing " if they do not now accept our terms they can expect a rain of ruin from the air the like of which has never been seen on this earth . " the main term of the potsdam declaration issued on july 26 , 1945 was that japan should surrender unconditionally .
however , sources indicate that the us was aware of how important it was for japan to be able to surrender on one condition – that of retaining the emperor , who some historians argue made it clear was in favor of surrendering . it remains unclear why the one condition that seemed of utmost importance to japan was not included in the declaration especially as after japan 's capitulation , emperor hirohito was allowed to reign on until his death in 1989 . bildunterschrift : survivors of the atomic bombings were called hibakushas sources indicate japan was on verge of surrendering what is clear is that the possibilities of ending the war without recourse to the atom bomb were not fully exhausted . sources show that japan would probably have surrendered after the threatened soviet invasion , which finally began on august 9 , and certainly before the us invasion that was planned for the autumn . yet , not only was hiroshima bombed but nagasaki too .
this is a fact that is greatly troubling to historians and many others , including the pakistani novelist kamila shamsie , whose latest novel burnt shadows has a protagonist who survives the bombing but loses all of her loved ones . " what was important to me , " she told deutsche welle , " was not just that i start with the nuclear bomb but that i start with nagasaki rather than hiroshima , which was something that i 'd been interested in since i was a student in america . " i remember going to a lecture once and someone in the middle of a conversation said : ' well , even those people who justify bombing hiroshima , how do you justify nagasaki three days later ? ' and it was something that really stuck with me : this idea of being able to obliterate a city in a second and to see the photographs of the damage that was done as we know truman did and then three days later to say ' i 'll do that again ' .
it seemed to me that more than anything else , that single moment when the bomb is dropped on nagasaki is to me a kind of acknowledgement that in war there are no limits to what we 'll do to destroy others in the pursuit of victory . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president truman took full responsibility for ordering the atomic bombs be used on japan " one million american lives were saved " the much bandied-about justification for dropping the atomic bombs was that they saved one american million lives .
even today , many americans believe this myth . however , today it is known that even the wildest of official calculations had estimated there would be a maximum of 46,000 american casualties if the us invaded japan . leading historians , such as gar alperowitz , have argued that there is strong evidence to support another reason for dropping the bombs – the desire to frighten the soviets and give the us the " upper hand in diplomatic relations " . hibakushas campaign for nuclear disarmament takai miashita is a hibakusha , " an explosion-affected person " , who volunteers at the nagasaki atomic bomb museum . " i was in class six when the atom bomb was dropped , " he recalls .
" my school was about 40 kilometers away from the epicenter .
but i saw many victims and many of my relatives , who lived in the city , died .
i will never forget this experience .
that 's why i work in this museum . " the us has never apologized for the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki .
today , it is still one of five nuclear powers allowed to have an arsenal by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . however , under president barack obama , who is a strong advocate of a world free of nuclear weapons , the us has revised its policy on the use of atomic weapons and renounced the development of any new ones . this year for the first time , the us ambassador to japan attended the ceremony in hiroshima commemorating the bombing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de medicine -pipe- 09.08.2010 german scientists discover ' needle-free ' malaria vaccine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : approximately half of all humans live in areas of the world threatened by malaria by combining antibiotics and malaria-infected mosquitos , researchers find that mice are protected .
human clinical trials will be just around the corner . deep in a lab , in carefully sealed incubators , mosquitos , which normally are malaria carriers , may this time actually be part of the solution .
kai matuschewski and his research team from the max planck institute for infection biology in berlin used mosquitoes to infect test mice with malaria .
at the same time , they gave the mice antibiotics for three days and the mice showed no signs of the disease .
matuschewski says this means that he and his research team may have discovered the first so-called " needle-free " malaria vaccine .
their research was published last month in the journal science translational medicine .
if successful , the vaccine would use a combination of drugs and the mosquito itself to prevent the onset of malaria .
it could be a boon to billions of people worldwide who are at risk for the disease , which mainly affects people living in temperate climates .
matuschewski said the idea behind their research was to " combine a classical prophylaxis aspect - which is antibiotic treatment - -lrb- that travelers use to protect themselves against malaria -rrb- , together with a natural exposure . "
" the mosquito is our sort of syringe that delivers the pathogen and we stop the parasite from growing in the liver through antibiotic prophylaxis , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malarone is a common anti-malarial drug ' the mice do n't get sick ' while feeding , a malaria-carrying mosquito injects something called a sporozoite , which is the cell form that infects the new host .
in this case , that would be the mouse .
in the real world , it could be a human .
the sporozoites migrate to the liver , where they replicate massively and mature to the disease-causing blood stage cells called merozoites .
in this new german study , the merozoites continued to develop in the liver cells , but the antibiotics prevented them from infecting the red blood cells , which meant that the mice did n't get malaria symptoms .
with this treatment the mice not only did n't get sick , but they also developed long-term immunity .
the mice were infected with sporozoites again after 40 days , four months , and six months , this time without adding antibiotics , and all the animals had complete protection against malaria .
antibiotic resistance the antibiotics the scientists used were clindamycin and azithromycin , that are both generic , cheap and readily available .
this is good news for poorer countries , but dr. michael knappik , from the berlin center for tropical and travel medicine , pointed out that there are drawbacks with using antibiotics in the long term .
" we have growing resistance against the malaria drugs we use at the moment , " he said , " and that 's a big problem especially in southeast asia , and this of course can also arise in these new antibiotic treatments . "
matuschewski and his team hope to reduce the likelihood of antibiotic resistance by administering the drugs once a year - at the onset of the rainy season .
he added that antibiotic resistance is n't as pronounced in africa as it is in western countries , so the benefits could outweigh the concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this electron micrograph shows a female anopheles stephensi mosquito , which often is a carrier of malaria clinical trials to begin next year if successful , this new treatment could dramatically lower the one million deaths worldwide from malaria every year .
around 600 germans contract the disease each year , and sebastian hofmann was one of the unlucky ones .
seven years ago at age 19 , hofmann went backpacking across west africa , and , despite the usual malaria prevention measures - including medicine , insect repellent and mosquito nets - he still contracted the disease . "
i was hallucinating .
i was sweaty , " he remembered , " i thought i was somehow in the state of being really drunk and having a really bad flu . "
hofmann contracted the worst strain of malaria and fell into a coma for three days , although he eventually recovered .
while this new treatment is n't targeted at travelers in general - because you need to be infected with malaria first for it to work - it could make a big difference for people living in severely affected regions . "
in endemic areas in kenya , in east africa , people live there for 20 years , get infected probably sometimes 100 times a year and they always develop parasites , " matuschewski said .
" so to achieve something like anti-parasitic sterile immunity is almost impossible .
so what we want is to protect against disease . "
put another way , even if children living in malaria regions are protected daily with bed nets , according to matuschewski all this does is delay their potential exposure to the disease and subsequent symptoms and complications .
so rather than trying to prevent all mosquito bites - which is virtually impossible - this new treatment uses the infection as a part of the solution in combination with the antibiotic .
because the antibiotics are readily available , matuschewski and his research team hope that clinical trials could start in sub-saharan africa , as early as the beginning of summer next year .
while they 're excited about their findings , scientists like dr johannes friesen from the max planck institute for infection biology in berlin , were careful to point out that their research is just " one component to fight the disease . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de theater -pipe- 09.08.2010 former czech president havel directs first movie großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film director is a new role for havel vaclav havel , the first president of the czech republic , has made a name for himself as a playwright .
now he 's tackling the big screen - with the story of a retired politician . what do former world leaders do once they 've said goodbye to their bodyguards and handed back the keys to the presidential palace ?
some start working on weighty memoirs ; others devote themselves to their favorite charity .
former czech president vaclav havel , on the other hand , is currently directing his first feature film .
based on his most recent play , entitled " leaving , " it tells the story of a politician trying to adjust to a new life after leaving politics .
the main character , vilem rieger , is the former chancellor of an unnamed country and finds himself locked in a battle of wills with his successor , the unsavory vlastik klein .
it 's a " lear " -like contemplation on a politician 's frustrating impotence at finding himself slowly being forced out of his beloved government villa .
inspired by real life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havel 's wife , actress dagmar havlova , stars in the film at a real villa in the town of ceska skalice , in the far north-east of the country , the former president is fulfilling his lifelong dream .
for the next few weeks , he 'll be sitting in the director 's chair , filming the screen version of his play .
i 've been quite surprised at how quick and smooth everything is , " havel told reporters , " i come up with an idea on the set , i tell the person standing next to me about it , and the next day we 're filming it .
it certainly was n't like that when i was president ! "
at first glance , there seem to be many similarities with vaclav havel 's own life .
vilem rieger 's rival and successor is named vlastik klein ; havel 's real-life rival and successor as president is vaclav klaus .
in the family nevertheless , havel has denied that the story is strictly autobiographical , saying he first began toying with the idea back in the 1970 's .
he wrote the main female role - the chancellor 's wife , irena - for his own wife , actress dagmar havlova .
" it 's obviously a real honor to play the part , but i have to point out that vaclav wrote the role for me , not about me , " commented havlova .
" i was there when he wrote the script , i remember reading the first draft , so i 'm so happy to finally get the chance to act in it . "
vaclav havel 's resume is already impressive : world-renowned playwright , anti-communist dissident , denim-clad revolutionary , and , of course , president of his country for more than a decade .
now , at the tender age of 73 , he 's adding another string to his bow and , as he explained , film is very much in his blood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : havel says directing a film is more efficient than politics " i come from a filmmaking family ; my uncle basically founded the czech cinema industry , so i grew up around film people , " said havel .
" so i always wanted to be a film director , but the political atmosphere in the 50 's and 60 's meant i was n't allowed to go to film school . "
a daring director havel has been involved in theater for most of his adult life , from the 1950 's onwards , and many of the roles in " leaving " have been filled with his close friends from the business , including well-known czech actress eva holubova .
" vaclav havel , for me , is not only president ; he is vaclav havel , " said holubova .
" he 's a very clever director , a very funny director , and he is n't afraid - never . "
filming is scheduled to be completed on august 21 , the anniversary of the soviet-led invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 . reviews for the stage version of " leaving " were mixed , with some critics saying it was nowhere near as good as havel 's earlier work .
but vaclav havel 's uncle , who built czechoslovakia 's first film studios , and his grandfather , who built prague 's first cinema , would no doubt be proud . author : rob cameron , ceska skalice editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2010 the japanese port of nagasaki has marked 65 years since it was flattened by a us atom bomb , that killed over 70,000 people .
the debate on whether the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki were at all justified rages on . when " little boy " - the first atom bomb - was dropped on hiroshima , the reactions among the scientists who had worked for years on perfecting the technology were mixed . " a few people laughed , a few people cried , most people were silent , " recalled robert oppenheimer , the scientific director of the manhattan project . although his colleagues later said that oppenheimer was triumphant about his part in developing the technology , he is famous for the following quote from hindu mythology : " now i have become death , the destroyer of worlds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert oppenheimer was the wartime director of the manhattan project that developed the atom bomb flash burns , falling debris and radiation sickness nobody had known exactly how devastating the impact would be and what the effect of the atom bomb on humans would be . tens of thousands were killed instantly .
flash or flame burns , falling debris , radiation sickness and other injuries and illness killed even more . us president harry truman was aware of the death and destruction in hiroshima as he made the decision to drop a second bomb - " fat man " - on nagasaki .
the plan was then to drop another in the third week of august and continue until japan surrendered . truman was relentless , announcing " if they do not now accept our terms they can expect a rain of ruin from the air the like of which has never been seen on this earth . " the main term of the potsdam declaration issued on july 26 , 1945 was that japan should surrender unconditionally .
however , sources indicate that the us was aware of how important it was for japan to be able to surrender on one condition – that of retaining the emperor , who some historians argue made it clear was in favor of surrendering . it remains unclear why the one condition that seemed of utmost importance to japan was not included in the declaration especially as after japan 's capitulation , emperor hirohito was allowed to reign on until his death in 1989 . bildunterschrift : survivors of the atomic bombings were called hibakushas sources indicate japan was on verge of surrendering what is clear is that the possibilities of ending the war without recourse to the atom bomb were not fully exhausted . sources show that japan would probably have surrendered after the threatened soviet invasion , which finally began on august 9 , and certainly before the us invasion that was planned for the autumn . yet , not only was hiroshima bombed but nagasaki too .
this is a fact that is greatly troubling to historians and many others , including the pakistani novelist kamila shamsie , whose latest novel burnt shadows has a protagonist who survives the bombing but loses all of her loved ones . " what was important to me , " she told deutsche welle , " was not just that i start with the nuclear bomb but that i start with nagasaki rather than hiroshima , which was something that i 'd been interested in since i was a student in america . " i remember going to a lecture once and someone in the middle of a conversation said : ' well , even those people who justify bombing hiroshima , how do you justify nagasaki three days later ? ' and it was something that really stuck with me : this idea of being able to obliterate a city in a second and to see the photographs of the damage that was done as we know truman did and then three days later to say ' i 'll do that again ' .
it seemed to me that more than anything else , that single moment when the bomb is dropped on nagasaki is to me a kind of acknowledgement that in war there are no limits to what we 'll do to destroy others in the pursuit of victory . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president truman took full responsibility for ordering the atomic bombs be used on japan " one million american lives were saved " the much bandied-about justification for dropping the atomic bombs was that they saved one american million lives .
even today , many americans believe this myth . however , today it is known that even the wildest of official calculations had estimated there would be a maximum of 46,000 american casualties if the us invaded japan . leading historians , such as gar alperowitz , have argued that there is strong evidence to support another reason for dropping the bombs – the desire to frighten the soviets and give the us the " upper hand in diplomatic relations " . hibakushas campaign for nuclear disarmament takai miashita is a hibakusha , " an explosion-affected person " , who volunteers at the nagasaki atomic bomb museum . " i was in class six when the atom bomb was dropped , " he recalls .
" my school was about 40 kilometers away from the epicenter .
but i saw many victims and many of my relatives , who lived in the city , died .
i will never forget this experience .
that 's why i work in this museum . " the us has never apologized for the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki .
today , it is still one of five nuclear powers allowed to have an arsenal by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . however , under president barack obama , who is a strong advocate of a world free of nuclear weapons , the us has revised its policy on the use of atomic weapons and renounced the development of any new ones . this year for the first time , the us ambassador to japan attended the ceremony in hiroshima commemorating the bombing .

" i am convinced that at the end of your investigation , it will become clear that the state of israel and the idf -lrb- israeli defense forces -rrb- acted in accordance with international law , " netanyahu told members of the tirkel commission as he began testifying about the raid .
netanyahu was the first witness to testify at the internal investigation , which was set up following intense international pressure on the israeli government following the commando raid in may . the raid , on six ships attempting to break a naval blockade of the gaza strip , killed nine turkish activists and wounded many others .

" the turkish government did not consider the confrontation between turkish activists and israel to be against its interests . "
netanyahu added that he ordered troops to make a " supreme effort " to avoid harming any passengers on board the aid ships .

shortly before ramadan , hamburg deemed the mosque 's extreme islamist ideology as sufficient grounds for a ban . hamburg police early monday morning raided a mosque with a known history of breeding jihadists , city authorities reported .
at 6 a.m.
monday morning 20 police officers reportedly entered the mosque searching for evidence of islamist radicalization .
hamburg 's interior minister , christoph ahlhaus , deemed the group 's islamist ideology reason enough to close the center for good .
" the mosque is now being sealed up , so that the phantom behind the walls on steindamm street has come to an end , " announced ahlhaus , who ordered that the mosque 's community be banned - and the homes of four members of the supporting taiba arab-german culture association searched .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahlhaus called the mosque a ' phantom ' ahlhaus said in a press conference hours after the raid that hamburg could not allow " a point of contact for a group that advocates islamist social order and will not shy away from violence to assert it .

according to manfred murck , deputy director of hamburg 's internal intelligence service , the mosque had continued to serve " as a symbolic location for jihadists from all over germany and even abroad , because it had the perpetrators as its nimbus . "
" the mosque also continued to serve as a center of radicalization , " he said . lothar bergmann , head of hamburg 's anti-terrorism unit , referred to the taiba mosque 's leader , syrian-german mamoun darkazanli , as a " preacher of hate , " adding that his teachings and sermons as well as texts published on the community 's website promoted jihad . the investigation had gone on for months as strong evidence was needed to close the house of worship , murck said . bad timing , or strategic timing ? yet , after a decade of suspicion against the mosque , the timing of the raid has come under question , especially considering the proximity to hamburg 's august 25 mayoral election , in which ahlhaus is a prime candidate to win the office . aiman mazyek , secretary general of the central council of muslims in germany , told deutsche welle he also found it " regretful that this -lsb- raid and ban -rsb- had to take place just before ramadan . " " politicians should want to get peaceful muslims on their side ...
maybe they should have tried to do this at a different date , not just before ramadan - and an election , " mazyek added . mazyek , whose organization represents nearly 2,600 muslim communities , also fears that the pursuit of islamists will have a negative impact on peaceful muslims living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the community says it planned to vacate anyway he said studies had proven that the " war on terror " had increased extremist violence against muslims and mosques . staying on guard authorities estimate that hamburg is home to 45 jihad supporters and that around 200 people regularly attended friday services at the mosque , which they believe to have been particularly aggressive in ideology . hamburg 's jihadists have continued to make the news since the world trade center attacks .

shortly before ramadan , hamburg deemed the mosque 's extreme islamist ideology as sufficient grounds for a ban . hamburg police early monday morning raided a mosque with a known history of breeding jihadists , city authorities reported .
at 6 a.m.
monday morning 20 police officers reportedly entered the mosque searching for evidence of islamist radicalization .

" the mosque is now being sealed up , so that the phantom behind the walls on steindamm street has come to an end , " announced ahlhaus , who ordered that the mosque 's community be banned - and the homes of four members of the supporting taiba arab-german culture association searched .

stockholm 's olympic bid failed , but hammarby has since become a model for sustainable urban living . the hammarby sjöstad eco-town , located a few kilometers south of stockholm 's city center , was developed following the swedish capital 's failed bid to host the 2004 olympics .
what was once potentially a temporary olympic village , is now a permanent and attractive lakeside community of 25,000 people and will be increasing to 35,000 residents in 2015 .
with 11,000 flats and 10,000 working people , hammarby was deliberately designed so that residents commute to work using public transport , bicycles and carpools rather than by individually driving cars .
in 1990 , well before a global discussion on climate change was taking place in the mainstream media , the stockholm city council began detailed planning for hammarby with sewerage and service planners .
to date , the project has managed to reduce emissions by a significant 30-40 percent although still below its original 50 percent target .
hammarby 's success has even helped stockholm win the european green capital 2010 award .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from olympic village to model green city - a view of a residential area in hammarby in-built green features the hammarby model was presented by malena karlsson to an international audience at " the great transformation – greening the economy " conference in berlin earlier this year .
karlsson works for the energy- saving stockholm glashusett -lrb- glasshouse -rrb- building that functions as the information centre for the hammarby district .
she believes that the key to the village 's success is that eco-features are well integrated into the design of the whole project .
“ seventy-five percent of the environmental goals are built into the buildings , ” karlsson said .
in contrast with more bottom-up approaches , where environmentally conscious citizens band together to live sustainably , hammarby does n't rely on the environmental awareness of its citizens .
even if citizens are not eco-conscious when they enter hammarby , they will be after living there .
innovative waste recycling “ there is a recycling room in every building , ” karlsson said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relaxing in clean environs - hammarby 's pier all these rooms contain refuse chutes that are linked by underground pipes through which vacuum suction carries waste to a central collection station .
food waste is converted into “ biogas — the purest environmental fuel there is , ” as karlsson calls it .
biogas , in addition to sludge from wastewater , is used by the town 's buses and is also clean enough to naturally fertilize the area 's fields .
hammarby village 's waste system does not emit many emissions because both incinerated household waste and treated wastewater are extracted and used to heat houses .
other features include a solar panel experiment that has yielded 50 percent of energy needed for supplying heated water .
quality of life was also in the forefront of the minds of the town 's planners .
nature parks and a close proximity to water are central features of the complex , and are not just token inclusions .
“ we have a holistic approach and do not just focus on carbon alone .
we have green areas for biodiversity and well-being , ” karlsson said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hammarby 's waste recycling has drawn global attention according to her , the integrated recycling system is also designed so that different waste categories are collected at different times .
fewer trucks enter the area simultaneously , thereby reducing the risk of accident .
another ubiquitous town feature is the water system that is designed with low flushing toilets and aerated taps .
eco-towns face resistance but eco-towns such as hammarby also have their fair share of detractors . not everyone is pleased with changes to rural and urban landscapes resulting from new " eco-town " developments .
protestors in britain in 2008 were concerned that proposed eco-towns would take up large amounts of open countryside , damage biodiversity and change the rural character of their communities .
un habitat predicts that by 2050 , a whopping 5.3 billion people , or 70 percent of the world 's population , will live in urban areas .
but instead of building so-called eco-townships from scratch , several cities are implementing progressive sustainable urban development policies .
public transport-friendly munich , which aims to be majority dependent on renewal energy as early as 2025 , has a designated ‘ green zone ' wherein cars will be fined if they do not meet the required emissions criteria . this sort of thinking goes against market-orientated approaches , typical of western civilization in the twentieth century .
the availability of cheap fossil fuels has entrenched development of inefficient car-dependent suburbia in north america in particular , but also in other parts of the world we would not suspect , like egypt .
the evidence from these examples is clear : for innovative urban design strategies to succeed in the long term , they have to be supported by both city administrations and citizens .
" hammarby 's success has been achievable because of integrated planning , " said karlsson .
hammarby 's talents will be on display when stockholm hosts the building sustainability conference in october this year .

stockholm 's olympic bid failed , but hammarby has since become a model for sustainable urban living . the hammarby sjöstad eco-town , located a few kilometers south of stockholm 's city center , was developed following the swedish capital 's failed bid to host the 2004 olympics .
what was once potentially a temporary olympic village , is now a permanent and attractive lakeside community of 25,000 people and will be increasing to 35,000 residents in 2015 .
with 11,000 flats and 10,000 working people , hammarby was deliberately designed so that residents commute to work using public transport , bicycles and carpools rather than by individually driving cars .
in 1990 , well before a global discussion on climate change was taking place in the mainstream media , the stockholm city council began detailed planning for hammarby with sewerage and service planners .
to date , the project has managed to reduce emissions by a significant 30-40 percent although still below its original 50 percent target .
hammarby 's success has even helped stockholm win the european green capital 2010 award .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from olympic village to model green city - a view of a residential area in hammarby in-built green features the hammarby model was presented by malena karlsson to an international audience at " the great transformation – greening the economy " conference in berlin earlier this year .
karlsson works for the energy- saving stockholm glashusett -lrb- glasshouse -rrb- building that functions as the information centre for the hammarby district .
she believes that the key to the village 's success is that eco-features are well integrated into the design of the whole project .
“ seventy-five percent of the environmental goals are built into the buildings , ” karlsson said .
in contrast with more bottom-up approaches , where environmentally conscious citizens band together to live sustainably , hammarby does n't rely on the environmental awareness of its citizens .
even if citizens are not eco-conscious when they enter hammarby , they will be after living there .
innovative waste recycling “ there is a recycling room in every building , ” karlsson said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relaxing in clean environs - hammarby 's pier all these rooms contain refuse chutes that are linked by underground pipes through which vacuum suction carries waste to a central collection station .
food waste is converted into “ biogas — the purest environmental fuel there is , ” as karlsson calls it .
biogas , in addition to sludge from wastewater , is used by the town 's buses and is also clean enough to naturally fertilize the area 's fields .
hammarby village 's waste system does not emit many emissions because both incinerated household waste and treated wastewater are extracted and used to heat houses .
other features include a solar panel experiment that has yielded 50 percent of energy needed for supplying heated water .
quality of life was also in the forefront of the minds of the town 's planners .
nature parks and a close proximity to water are central features of the complex , and are not just token inclusions .
“ we have a holistic approach and do not just focus on carbon alone .
we have green areas for biodiversity and well-being , ” karlsson said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hammarby 's waste recycling has drawn global attention according to her , the integrated recycling system is also designed so that different waste categories are collected at different times .
fewer trucks enter the area simultaneously , thereby reducing the risk of accident .
another ubiquitous town feature is the water system that is designed with low flushing toilets and aerated taps .
eco-towns face resistance but eco-towns such as hammarby also have their fair share of detractors . not everyone is pleased with changes to rural and urban landscapes resulting from new " eco-town " developments .
protestors in britain in 2008 were concerned that proposed eco-towns would take up large amounts of open countryside , damage biodiversity and change the rural character of their communities .
un habitat predicts that by 2050 , a whopping 5.3 billion people , or 70 percent of the world 's population , will live in urban areas .
but instead of building so-called eco-townships from scratch , several cities are implementing progressive sustainable urban development policies .
public transport-friendly munich , which aims to be majority dependent on renewal energy as early as 2025 , has a designated ‘ green zone ' wherein cars will be fined if they do not meet the required emissions criteria . this sort of thinking goes against market-orientated approaches , typical of western civilization in the twentieth century .
the availability of cheap fossil fuels has entrenched development of inefficient car-dependent suburbia in north america in particular , but also in other parts of the world we would not suspect , like egypt .
the evidence from these examples is clear : for innovative urban design strategies to succeed in the long term , they have to be supported by both city administrations and citizens .
" hammarby 's success has been achievable because of integrated planning , " said karlsson .
hammarby 's talents will be on display when stockholm hosts the building sustainability conference in october this year .

stockholm 's olympic bid failed , but hammarby has since become a model for sustainable urban living . the hammarby sjöstad eco-town , located a few kilometers south of stockholm 's city center , was developed following the swedish capital 's failed bid to host the 2004 olympics .
what was once potentially a temporary olympic village , is now a permanent and attractive lakeside community of 25,000 people and will be increasing to 35,000 residents in 2015 .
with 11,000 flats and 10,000 working people , hammarby was deliberately designed so that residents commute to work using public transport , bicycles and carpools rather than by individually driving cars .
in 1990 , well before a global discussion on climate change was taking place in the mainstream media , the stockholm city council began detailed planning for hammarby with sewerage and service planners .
to date , the project has managed to reduce emissions by a significant 30-40 percent although still below its original 50 percent target .
hammarby 's success has even helped stockholm win the european green capital 2010 award .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from olympic village to model green city - a view of a residential area in hammarby in-built green features the hammarby model was presented by malena karlsson to an international audience at " the great transformation – greening the economy " conference in berlin earlier this year .
karlsson works for the energy- saving stockholm glashusett -lrb- glasshouse -rrb- building that functions as the information centre for the hammarby district .
she believes that the key to the village 's success is that eco-features are well integrated into the design of the whole project .
“ seventy-five percent of the environmental goals are built into the buildings , ” karlsson said .
in contrast with more bottom-up approaches , where environmentally conscious citizens band together to live sustainably , hammarby does n't rely on the environmental awareness of its citizens .
even if citizens are not eco-conscious when they enter hammarby , they will be after living there .
innovative waste recycling “ there is a recycling room in every building , ” karlsson said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relaxing in clean environs - hammarby 's pier all these rooms contain refuse chutes that are linked by underground pipes through which vacuum suction carries waste to a central collection station .
food waste is converted into “ biogas — the purest environmental fuel there is , ” as karlsson calls it .
biogas , in addition to sludge from wastewater , is used by the town 's buses and is also clean enough to naturally fertilize the area 's fields .
hammarby village 's waste system does not emit many emissions because both incinerated household waste and treated wastewater are extracted and used to heat houses .
other features include a solar panel experiment that has yielded 50 percent of energy needed for supplying heated water .
quality of life was also in the forefront of the minds of the town 's planners .
nature parks and a close proximity to water are central features of the complex , and are not just token inclusions .
“ we have a holistic approach and do not just focus on carbon alone .
we have green areas for biodiversity and well-being , ” karlsson said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hammarby 's waste recycling has drawn global attention according to her , the integrated recycling system is also designed so that different waste categories are collected at different times .
fewer trucks enter the area simultaneously , thereby reducing the risk of accident .
another ubiquitous town feature is the water system that is designed with low flushing toilets and aerated taps .
eco-towns face resistance but eco-towns such as hammarby also have their fair share of detractors . not everyone is pleased with changes to rural and urban landscapes resulting from new " eco-town " developments .
protestors in britain in 2008 were concerned that proposed eco-towns would take up large amounts of open countryside , damage biodiversity and change the rural character of their communities .
un habitat predicts that by 2050 , a whopping 5.3 billion people , or 70 percent of the world 's population , will live in urban areas .
but instead of building so-called eco-townships from scratch , several cities are implementing progressive sustainable urban development policies .
public transport-friendly munich , which aims to be majority dependent on renewal energy as early as 2025 , has a designated ‘ green zone ' wherein cars will be fined if they do not meet the required emissions criteria . this sort of thinking goes against market-orientated approaches , typical of western civilization in the twentieth century .
the availability of cheap fossil fuels has entrenched development of inefficient car-dependent suburbia in north america in particular , but also in other parts of the world we would not suspect , like egypt .
the evidence from these examples is clear : for innovative urban design strategies to succeed in the long term , they have to be supported by both city administrations and citizens .
" hammarby 's success has been achievable because of integrated planning , " said karlsson .
hammarby 's talents will be on display when stockholm hosts the building sustainability conference in october this year .

the incident comes after a south korea accused the north of detaining a fishing boat . the shells were fired by north korea 's batteries shortly after the south korean navy had ended five days of exercises south of their disputed sea border , south korea 's news agency yonhap reported , citing military officials . the north had threatened to retaliate against the drills , which was the south 's largest ever anti-submarine exercise . in july , the us and south korea conducted joint exercises , which north korea had threatened could start a " war .

other officials said that the south 's navy patrol ships had warned the north koreans by radio to stop firing but the warning was ignored . earlier this year , the north fired a series of artillery rounds in the same area .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 09.08.2010 un starts inquiry into gaza flotilla raid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mavi marmara was stormed by israeli commandos a united nations probe has begun investigating the controversial raid by israeli forces on an aid convoy headed toward the gaza strip that left nine turkish nationals dead .
an initial report is due in mid-september . a four-member united nations panel on tuesday started its investigation of a deadly raid by israel on a flotilla of ships carrying aid to the gaza strip , with israel promising its cooperation .
" israel has nothing to hide , " said israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu at a cabinet meeting .
" it is in the national interest of the state of israel to ensure that the factual truth of the overall flotilla events comes to light throughout the world . "
the jewish state has set one condition , however : that its soldiers are not questioned as part of the investigation .
" the prime minister said israel would not cooperate with any commission that would ask to question soldiers , " a spokesman for netanyahu said on tuesday .
the comments came after un secretary-general ban ki-moon denied reaching a deal with israel excluding the un panel from interviewing israeli military personnel .
the panel , headed by former new zealand prime minister geoffrey palmer and outgoing president alvaro uribe , also includes one turkish and one israeli diplomat .
the committee will present an initial report on its probe in mid-september after it has reviewed the circumstances surrounding the may 31 attack during which israeli commandos raided a six-ship convoy .
israel was trying to prevent the ships from breaking the blockade on gaza .
during the raid , nine turkish citizens , including one with both turkish and american citizenship , were killed .
at least seven israeli commandos were wounded .
the event caused an international outcry and widespread condemnation of israel 's tactics .
it also soured relations between israel and turkey , one of the jewish state 's only allies in the region with whom it shared strong economic and political ties .
new approach in the past , israel has refused to cooperate with investigations into its behavior on the international stage and responded with boycotts or by simply ignoring them .
now , however , it appears that israel is taking a new approach , although not without prompting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's refused to cooperate with an inquiry following military operations in gaza in 2009 " this time , israel sees itself now much more than in the past on the receiving end of international criticism .
they are under significantly more pressure now to cooperate , " almut moeller , a researcher at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
strong pressure on israel has come not only from the un , but from the obama administration and the europeans .
the german parliament , in an unusual move , passed a unanimous resolution in july calling for an end to israel 's blockage of the gaza strip .
israel chose not to cooperate with the goldstone probe , which looked into israeli 's attack on gaza in which more than 1,300 palstinians were killed .
israel came away from that inquiry cast in a very negative life , and it might be that israel does n't want to repeat the experience .
" this cooperation can be seen as a signal from the israeli government that it is not blind and deaf to international criticism , " margret johannsen , a senior research fellow at the hamburg-based institute for peace research and security policy , said .
ties to turkey israel 's decision to cooperate could have much to do with its desire to repair its ties with turkey , it strongest muslim and regional ally on both the economic and political level .
after the may 31 raid , relations between the two states deteriorated enormously .
in july , turkey threatened to break diplomatic ties with israel over the flotilla raid and turkey 's foreign minister said ties would only be maintained if israel either apologized or accepted the outcome of the international inquiry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister netanyahu has said israel has nothing to apologize for israel refused to apologize , but did say it was interested in avoiding any further deterioration of bilateral relations .
israel has been a major arms supplier to turkey , and the two countries have entered into multiple agreements that have seen them cooperating in several areas , especially on defense matters .
after a devastating 1999 earthquake in turkey , israel sent one of the largest international teams to help .
in 2000 , the two signed the " turkish-israeli free-trade agreement . "
turkey was the first muslim-majority country to enter into such a deal with the jewish state .
fair and balanced ?
the un investigation is but one of several going on right now .
israel is carrying out its own probe into the raid , with prime minister netanyahu giving testimony on monday .
" i am convinced that at the end of your investigation , it will become clear that the state of israel and the idf -lrb- israeli defense forces -rrb- acted in accordance with international law , " netanyahu told members of the five-person tirkel commission .
turkey reportedly began carrying out its own inquiry days after the raid , allegedly looking to make a criminal case against top israeli officials .
the un human rights council is conducting a probe , not to be confused with the un investigation starting tuesday .
but israel has refused to cooperate with that body , claiming that it is biased .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a video still purporting to show israeli soldiers aboard a vessel surrounding a turkish ship un chief ban has sought to find a way to conduct the investigation in a way that would satisfy both turkey and israel .
his choice of oezdem sanberk , a former undersecretary at the turkish foreign ministry , and joseph ciechanover , a former senior official at the israeli foreign ministry , is a tactic to dampen possible criticism that the panel could tilt to one side .
" -lsb- the panel 's makeup -rsb- increases its credibility in israel itself and makes it harder for people to present the panel as biased against israel from the outset , " said mideast expert johannsen .
whatever the panel 's findings , experts agree that there will likely be no sanctions placed on israel , even if the investigation finds fault with its actions .
sanctions depend on the un security council , and it 's very probable that the united states , a strong israel ally , would veto any sanction resolution .
still , johannsen thinks the probe is crucial not only for both turkey and israel , but also for the international community at large . " while it wo n't result in any sanctions , it 's important that the investigation take place because it highlights the importance of international law , " she said . author : kyle james , darren mara -lrb- afp / ap -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

foreign demand is credited with helping to boost growth in europe 's biggest economy .
germany , the world 's second-biggest exporter after china , showed provisional reports of exports of just over 86.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 115 billion -rrb- for the month - the highest level since october 2008 .
exports to germany 's 15 eurozone partners climbed 22 percent year-on-year in june , while exports to countries outside the european union soared by 37.3 percent annually .
the figures were up 28.5 percent compared with june 2009 , and have bolstered the euro single currency after months of pressure on european economies .
the euro had slumped to a four-year low against the dollar in june amid fears the debt crisis afflicting a handful of european countries would hamper the recovery from the financial crisis .
analysts had predicted that german exports would rise month-on-month by 1.8 percent in june after soaring by a revised 7.9 percent in may .
the upbeat results have raised expectations that the german economy grew strongly in the second quarter this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de medicine -pipe- 09.08.2010 german scientists discover ' needle-free ' malaria vaccine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : approximately half of all humans live in areas of the world threatened by malaria by combining antibiotics and malaria-infected mosquitos , researchers find that mice are protected .
human clinical trials will be just around the corner . deep in a lab , in carefully sealed incubators , mosquitos , which normally are malaria carriers , may this time actually be part of the solution .
kai matuschewski and his research team from the max planck institute for infection biology in berlin used mosquitoes to infect test mice with malaria .
at the same time , they gave the mice antibiotics for three days and the mice showed no signs of the disease .
matuschewski says this means that he and his research team may have discovered the first so-called " needle-free " malaria vaccine .
their research was published last month in the journal science translational medicine .
if successful , the vaccine would use a combination of drugs and the mosquito itself to prevent the onset of malaria .
it could be a boon to billions of people worldwide who are at risk for the disease , which mainly affects people living in temperate climates .
matuschewski said the idea behind their research was to " combine a classical prophylaxis aspect - which is antibiotic treatment - -lrb- that travelers use to protect themselves against malaria -rrb- , together with a natural exposure . "
" the mosquito is our sort of syringe that delivers the pathogen and we stop the parasite from growing in the liver through antibiotic prophylaxis , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malarone is a common anti-malarial drug ' the mice do n't get sick ' while feeding , a malaria-carrying mosquito injects something called a sporozoite , which is the cell form that infects the new host .
in this case , that would be the mouse .
in the real world , it could be a human .
the sporozoites migrate to the liver , where they replicate massively and mature to the disease-causing blood stage cells called merozoites .
in this new german study , the merozoites continued to develop in the liver cells , but the antibiotics prevented them from infecting the red blood cells , which meant that the mice did n't get malaria symptoms .
with this treatment the mice not only did n't get sick , but they also developed long-term immunity .
the mice were infected with sporozoites again after 40 days , four months , and six months , this time without adding antibiotics , and all the animals had complete protection against malaria .
antibiotic resistance the antibiotics the scientists used were clindamycin and azithromycin , that are both generic , cheap and readily available .
this is good news for poorer countries , but dr. michael knappik , from the berlin center for tropical and travel medicine , pointed out that there are drawbacks with using antibiotics in the long term .
" we have growing resistance against the malaria drugs we use at the moment , " he said , " and that 's a big problem especially in southeast asia , and this of course can also arise in these new antibiotic treatments . "
matuschewski and his team hope to reduce the likelihood of antibiotic resistance by administering the drugs once a year - at the onset of the rainy season .
he added that antibiotic resistance is n't as pronounced in africa as it is in western countries , so the benefits could outweigh the concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this electron micrograph shows a female anopheles stephensi mosquito , which often is a carrier of malaria clinical trials to begin next year if successful , this new treatment could dramatically lower the one million deaths worldwide from malaria every year .
around 600 germans contract the disease each year , and sebastian hofmann was one of the unlucky ones .
seven years ago at age 19 , hofmann went backpacking across west africa , and , despite the usual malaria prevention measures - including medicine , insect repellent and mosquito nets - he still contracted the disease . "
i was hallucinating .
i was sweaty , " he remembered , " i thought i was somehow in the state of being really drunk and having a really bad flu . "
hofmann contracted the worst strain of malaria and fell into a coma for three days , although he eventually recovered .
while this new treatment is n't targeted at travelers in general - because you need to be infected with malaria first for it to work - it could make a big difference for people living in severely affected regions . "
in endemic areas in kenya , in east africa , people live there for 20 years , get infected probably sometimes 100 times a year and they always develop parasites , " matuschewski said .
" so to achieve something like anti-parasitic sterile immunity is almost impossible .
so what we want is to protect against disease . "
put another way , even if children living in malaria regions are protected daily with bed nets , according to matuschewski all this does is delay their potential exposure to the disease and subsequent symptoms and complications .
so rather than trying to prevent all mosquito bites - which is virtually impossible - this new treatment uses the infection as a part of the solution in combination with the antibiotic .
because the antibiotics are readily available , matuschewski and his research team hope that clinical trials could start in sub-saharan africa , as early as the beginning of summer next year .
while they 're excited about their findings , scientists like dr johannes friesen from the max planck institute for infection biology in berlin , were careful to point out that their research is just " one component to fight the disease . "

instead , this former coal city is focusing on the service industry and reinventing itself as a cultural center . the ruhr region is the most congested urban area in germany .
it is home to 5.3 million people , and sometimes it 's hard to tell where one city ends and another begins .
with around 400,000 residents , bochum lies in the heart of this region .
like all of its neighboring towns , it could no longer rely on its coal and steel industries as the main growth source from the 1960s onwards .
luckily , in 1961 , automobile manufacturer opel started business operations here .
also , companies such as bp / aral and thyssenkrupp create some extra jobs for the local population . the rub was the first bochum is also positioning itself in the service and education sectors .

2010 the japanese port of nagasaki has marked 65 years since it was flattened by a us atom bomb , that killed over 70,000 people .
the debate on whether the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki were at all justified rages on . when " little boy " - the first atom bomb - was dropped on hiroshima , the reactions among the scientists who had worked for years on perfecting the technology were mixed . " a few people laughed , a few people cried , most people were silent , " recalled robert oppenheimer , the scientific director of the manhattan project . although his colleagues later said that oppenheimer was triumphant about his part in developing the technology , he is famous for the following quote from hindu mythology : " now i have become death , the destroyer of worlds . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert oppenheimer was the wartime director of the manhattan project that developed the atom bomb flash burns , falling debris and radiation sickness nobody had known exactly how devastating the impact would be and what the effect of the atom bomb on humans would be . tens of thousands were killed instantly .
flash or flame burns , falling debris , radiation sickness and other injuries and illness killed even more . us president harry truman was aware of the death and destruction in hiroshima as he made the decision to drop a second bomb - " fat man " - on nagasaki .
the plan was then to drop another in the third week of august and continue until japan surrendered . truman was relentless , announcing " if they do not now accept our terms they can expect a rain of ruin from the air the like of which has never been seen on this earth . " the main term of the potsdam declaration issued on july 26 , 1945 was that japan should surrender unconditionally .
however , sources indicate that the us was aware of how important it was for japan to be able to surrender on one condition – that of retaining the emperor , who some historians argue made it clear was in favor of surrendering . it remains unclear why the one condition that seemed of utmost importance to japan was not included in the declaration especially as after japan 's capitulation , emperor hirohito was allowed to reign on until his death in 1989 . bildunterschrift : survivors of the atomic bombings were called hibakushas sources indicate japan was on verge of surrendering what is clear is that the possibilities of ending the war without recourse to the atom bomb were not fully exhausted . sources show that japan would probably have surrendered after the threatened soviet invasion , which finally began on august 9 , and certainly before the us invasion that was planned for the autumn . yet , not only was hiroshima bombed but nagasaki too .
this is a fact that is greatly troubling to historians and many others , including the pakistani novelist kamila shamsie , whose latest novel burnt shadows has a protagonist who survives the bombing but loses all of her loved ones . " what was important to me , " she told deutsche welle , " was not just that i start with the nuclear bomb but that i start with nagasaki rather than hiroshima , which was something that i 'd been interested in since i was a student in america . " i remember going to a lecture once and someone in the middle of a conversation said : ' well , even those people who justify bombing hiroshima , how do you justify nagasaki three days later ? ' and it was something that really stuck with me : this idea of being able to obliterate a city in a second and to see the photographs of the damage that was done as we know truman did and then three days later to say ' i 'll do that again ' .
it seemed to me that more than anything else , that single moment when the bomb is dropped on nagasaki is to me a kind of acknowledgement that in war there are no limits to what we 'll do to destroy others in the pursuit of victory . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president truman took full responsibility for ordering the atomic bombs be used on japan " one million american lives were saved " the much bandied-about justification for dropping the atomic bombs was that they saved one american million lives .
even today , many americans believe this myth . however , today it is known that even the wildest of official calculations had estimated there would be a maximum of 46,000 american casualties if the us invaded japan . leading historians , such as gar alperowitz , have argued that there is strong evidence to support another reason for dropping the bombs – the desire to frighten the soviets and give the us the " upper hand in diplomatic relations " . hibakushas campaign for nuclear disarmament takai miashita is a hibakusha , " an explosion-affected person " , who volunteers at the nagasaki atomic bomb museum . " i was in class six when the atom bomb was dropped , " he recalls .
" my school was about 40 kilometers away from the epicenter .
but i saw many victims and many of my relatives , who lived in the city , died .
i will never forget this experience .
that 's why i work in this museum . " the us has never apologized for the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki .
today , it is still one of five nuclear powers allowed to have an arsenal by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . however , under president barack obama , who is a strong advocate of a world free of nuclear weapons , the us has revised its policy on the use of atomic weapons and renounced the development of any new ones . this year for the first time , the us ambassador to japan attended the ceremony in hiroshima commemorating the bombing .
nonetheless , no representative from the us attended the commemorations in nagasaki . author : anne thomas editor : disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was the novel " the thief lord " that catapulted her to international fame in 2002 . the story begins in detective victor getz ' office in venice .
he is commissioned to find two missing children , 12-year-old prosper and his five-year-old brother bo .
the boys had run away from home to escape their terrible aunt . their journey takes them to venice - a city their late mother had often told them about , a place of magic and wonder .
but , when prosper and bo arrive in venice , they discover an entirely different side of the city : " a damp wind had greeted them as they climbed down the steps from the station , blowing right through their thin clothes .
all they had with them was a small bag and a backpack .
prosper ’ s allowance hadn ’ t lasted long , and after the second night bo had already started coughing so badly that prosper had taken him by the hand to go and find a policeman . he had been determined to use the few bits of italian he had learned from his mother , and to say , ' scusi , we have run away from home , but my brother is sick . could you call my aunt so she can come and pick him up ? " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia funke -lrb- center -rrb- and the cast for " the thief lord , " which was filmed in 2005 however , before they make that call , prosper and bo meet up with a gang of kids who take them under their wing .
they all find shelter in an abandoned movie theater . the leader of the gang is scipio , " the thief lord . "
he is the son of a wealthy venetian and wants nothing more than to finally grow up ; he simply can not meet his father 's impossibly high expectations . scipio takes care of the other children by stealing valuable pieces of jewelry from his parents which the others then sell on the black market .
for the other kids , scipio is a hero ; they do n't know anything about his background or how he gets hold of the jewelry . everything is going fine - until victor getz gets wind of the runaway brothers ' whereabouts and the story takes a mysterious turn . success in hollywood in 2002 , cornelia funke made an international breakthrough with her novel " the thief lord .

and i always wanted to hear my own stories in english . " now , funke writes in english herself .
she and her family moved to los angeles several years ago , in part to assist with the filming of her books . making it in hollywood is a feat many other authors can only dream of .

" " the thief lord " focuses on the problem of growing up .
while the grown-ups dream of being kids again , 12-year-old prosper finally gets a taste of what it would be like to be an adult and no longer under the supervision of his evil aunt . nevertheless , he chooses not to take a ride on the magic carousel .

the incident comes after a south korea accused the north of detaining a fishing boat . the shells were fired by north korea 's batteries shortly after the south korean navy had ended five days of exercises south of their disputed sea border , south korea 's news agency yonhap reported , citing military officials . the north had threatened to retaliate against the drills , which was the south 's largest ever anti-submarine exercise . in july , the us and south korea conducted joint exercises , which north korea had threatened could start a " war . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south koreans watch the nimitz-class uss george washington leaving for joint military exercises with south korea " our navy was placed on high alert , closely watching the movement of the north korean troops , " a senior official told afp on monday .
other officials said that the south 's navy patrol ships had warned the north koreans by radio to stop firing but the warning was ignored . earlier this year , the north fired a series of artillery rounds in the same area .
tension has been high in ever since a south korean warship , the cheonan , was sunk in march , killing 46 sailors .

german employees may well be taking their legendary efficiency just a bit too far .
new figures reveal two thirds of the workforce respond to business-related correspondence outside official working hours . the figures make for unsettling reading ; a recent study by communications group bitkom shows that the majority of workers in germany regularly check and respond to work e-mails during their free time .
thanks to the upsurge in popularity of mobile internet devices such as the blackberry , germans are even staying in touch while they 're on vacation . although the problem is widespread and affects employees and freelancers in all work sectors , the media , telecommunications and it were worst affected . with more and more germans allowing work to cut into their leisure time , is the country 's workforce heading for a general meltdown ?
one of the nation 's biggest trade unions , verdi , says it need n't be . " the most important thing to remember is that no worker in germany is obliged in any way to check or respond to work-related correspondence in his or her free time , " union spokesman christian schmitz warned . " we have very strict laws here governing working hours but they also exist to protect our free time .
if an employer requires that an employee be available outside regular working hours , this has to be arranged in advance through the trade union and the employee must be paid for this . " switching off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom : setting a standard in respecting workers ' rights some forward-thinking companies are making an effort to reinforce their workers ' rights to a private life .
in a move some observers described amusingly ironic , telecommunications giant deutsche telekom recently introduced a policy encouraging staff to switch off their smartphones at the weekend . " we have to respect the free time of our employees and we have to try to make a better work-life balance , " telekom spokesman georg von wagner told deutsche welle .
" our employees have a right to their free time and should look forward to coming to work on mondays . " " we strongly encourage the executive staff to set a good example and not write e-mails on friday afternoons or on saturdays because employees would feel forced to answer and this chain reaction would go on and on .
we wanted to break that . " office days the media was identified as one of the hotspots in which workers tended to make themselves available 24/7 .
benjamin ruth , managing director of a berlin-based cross-media company , says his working day is far from easy . " i 'm in the office on an average day , 10 hours , sometimes 12 , sometimes 14 .
we communicate in multiple ways ; obviously e-mail , ichat , skype for instant messaging , most of us have a blackberry and a telephone / fax of course , " ruth explained . " i respond to my last e-mail around 1 a.m. before i go to bed , then early in the morning before i go to work and then on the weekends as well .
it 's the nature of the business .
it 's become very non-linear and in addition to that our business is global which also means we work across multiple time zones . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always online : with devices like the blackberry , logging on is always a temptation dedication … or addiction ? however , with such strict rules in place governing workers ' rights to free time , could it be that incessant replying to business mails says more about our general addiction to the internet and mobile technology than it does about our dedication to our jobs ? " if you are talking about the blackberry crowd , yes they are addicted to it and they admit it and they hate it actually , " said dr. isabella heuser , a psychologist at berlin 's charite hospital . " we all depend on e-mailing and on our computers these days , but for some reasons some people are not able to switch the damn computer off and that is what you need to do . " she also warned that addiction to the internet – classified as a non-substance addiction – was as much a health hazard as being hooked on cigarettes or alcohol . " i do have a couple of patients who have what 's called burnout - a euphemism for depression - and i actually prescribe e-mail abstinence , " she explained .
" it can be a serious thing and i advise them to only check their e-mails twice a day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working around the clock has n't led to an increase in efficiency " it 's an addiction , differing from nicotine or alcohol of course but obviously inducing similar changes in the brain .
we are just at the beginning of understanding a little bit about non-substance addictions . " it seems our constant availability and eagerness to send messages speaks volumes about our general addiction to the net but does little to improve efficiency .
just ask anyone on a large e-mail distribution list how much time they spend sorting through smartphone-generated group messages and deleting irrelevant e-mails - let alone reading and replying to the important ones . so , this friday when you sign out of your inbox , stay signed out .
after all , you can easily catch up again with all the gossip on monday morning .

monday morning 20 police officers reportedly entered the mosque searching for evidence of islamist radicalization .

it was the novel " the thief lord " that catapulted her to international fame in 2002 . the story begins in detective victor getz ' office in venice .
he is commissioned to find two missing children , 12-year-old prosper and his five-year-old brother bo .
the boys had run away from home to escape their terrible aunt . their journey takes them to venice - a city their late mother had often told them about , a place of magic and wonder .
but , when prosper and bo arrive in venice , they discover an entirely different side of the city : " a damp wind had greeted them as they climbed down the steps from the station , blowing right through their thin clothes .
all they had with them was a small bag and a backpack .
prosper ’ s allowance hadn ’ t lasted long , and after the second night bo had already started coughing so badly that prosper had taken him by the hand to go and find a policeman . he had been determined to use the few bits of italian he had learned from his mother , and to say , ' scusi , we have run away from home , but my brother is sick . could you call my aunt so she can come and pick him up ? " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia funke -lrb- center -rrb- and the cast for " the thief lord , " which was filmed in 2005 however , before they make that call , prosper and bo meet up with a gang of kids who take them under their wing .
they all find shelter in an abandoned movie theater . the leader of the gang is scipio , " the thief lord . "
he is the son of a wealthy venetian and wants nothing more than to finally grow up ; he simply can not meet his father 's impossibly high expectations . scipio takes care of the other children by stealing valuable pieces of jewelry from his parents which the others then sell on the black market .
for the other kids , scipio is a hero ; they do n't know anything about his background or how he gets hold of the jewelry . everything is going fine - until victor getz gets wind of the runaway brothers ' whereabouts and the story takes a mysterious turn . success in hollywood in 2002 , cornelia funke made an international breakthrough with her novel " the thief lord . "
the english version of the book was released the same year .
funke had asked her cousin to do a sample translation - more for sentimental reasons than anything else . " i 'm an english junkie , " funke once said in an interview .
" i love reading out loud in english .
and i always wanted to hear my own stories in english . " now , funke writes in english herself .

german employees may well be taking their legendary efficiency just a bit too far .
new figures reveal two thirds of the workforce respond to business-related correspondence outside official working hours . the figures make for unsettling reading ; a recent study by communications group bitkom shows that the majority of workers in germany regularly check and respond to work e-mails during their free time .
thanks to the upsurge in popularity of mobile internet devices such as the blackberry , germans are even staying in touch while they 're on vacation . although the problem is widespread and affects employees and freelancers in all work sectors , the media , telecommunications and it were worst affected . with more and more germans allowing work to cut into their leisure time , is the country 's workforce heading for a general meltdown ?
one of the nation 's biggest trade unions , verdi , says it need n't be . " the most important thing to remember is that no worker in germany is obliged in any way to check or respond to work-related correspondence in his or her free time , " union spokesman christian schmitz warned . " we have very strict laws here governing working hours but they also exist to protect our free time .
if an employer requires that an employee be available outside regular working hours , this has to be arranged in advance through the trade union and the employee must be paid for this . " switching off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom : setting a standard in respecting workers ' rights some forward-thinking companies are making an effort to reinforce their workers ' rights to a private life .
in a move some observers described amusingly ironic , telecommunications giant deutsche telekom recently introduced a policy encouraging staff to switch off their smartphones at the weekend . " we have to respect the free time of our employees and we have to try to make a better work-life balance , " telekom spokesman georg von wagner told deutsche welle .
" our employees have a right to their free time and should look forward to coming to work on mondays . " " we strongly encourage the executive staff to set a good example and not write e-mails on friday afternoons or on saturdays because employees would feel forced to answer and this chain reaction would go on and on .
we wanted to break that . " office days the media was identified as one of the hotspots in which workers tended to make themselves available 24/7 .
benjamin ruth , managing director of a berlin-based cross-media company , says his working day is far from easy . " i 'm in the office on an average day , 10 hours , sometimes 12 , sometimes 14 .
we communicate in multiple ways ; obviously e-mail , ichat , skype for instant messaging , most of us have a blackberry and a telephone / fax of course , " ruth explained . " i respond to my last e-mail around 1 a.m. before i go to bed , then early in the morning before i go to work and then on the weekends as well .
it 's the nature of the business .
it 's become very non-linear and in addition to that our business is global which also means we work across multiple time zones . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always online : with devices like the blackberry , logging on is always a temptation dedication … or addiction ? however , with such strict rules in place governing workers ' rights to free time , could it be that incessant replying to business mails says more about our general addiction to the internet and mobile technology than it does about our dedication to our jobs ? " if you are talking about the blackberry crowd , yes they are addicted to it and they admit it and they hate it actually , " said dr. isabella heuser , a psychologist at berlin 's charite hospital . " we all depend on e-mailing and on our computers these days , but for some reasons some people are not able to switch the damn computer off and that is what you need to do . " she also warned that addiction to the internet – classified as a non-substance addiction – was as much a health hazard as being hooked on cigarettes or alcohol . " i do have a couple of patients who have what 's called burnout - a euphemism for depression - and i actually prescribe e-mail abstinence , " she explained .
" it can be a serious thing and i advise them to only check their e-mails twice a day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working around the clock has n't led to an increase in efficiency " it 's an addiction , differing from nicotine or alcohol of course but obviously inducing similar changes in the brain .
we are just at the beginning of understanding a little bit about non-substance addictions . " it seems our constant availability and eagerness to send messages speaks volumes about our general addiction to the net but does little to improve efficiency .
just ask anyone on a large e-mail distribution list how much time they spend sorting through smartphone-generated group messages and deleting irrelevant e-mails - let alone reading and replying to the important ones . so , this friday when you sign out of your inbox , stay signed out .
after all , you can easily catch up again with all the gossip on monday morning .

it was the novel " the thief lord " that catapulted her to international fame in 2002 . the story begins in detective victor getz ' office in venice .
he is commissioned to find two missing children , 12-year-old prosper and his five-year-old brother bo .
the boys had run away from home to escape their terrible aunt . their journey takes them to venice - a city their late mother had often told them about , a place of magic and wonder .
but , when prosper and bo arrive in venice , they discover an entirely different side of the city : " a damp wind had greeted them as they climbed down the steps from the station , blowing right through their thin clothes .
all they had with them was a small bag and a backpack .
prosper ’ s allowance hadn ’ t lasted long , and after the second night bo had already started coughing so badly that prosper had taken him by the hand to go and find a policeman . he had been determined to use the few bits of italian he had learned from his mother , and to say , ' scusi , we have run away from home , but my brother is sick . could you call my aunt so she can come and pick him up ? " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia funke -lrb- center -rrb- and the cast for " the thief lord , " which was filmed in 2005 however , before they make that call , prosper and bo meet up with a gang of kids who take them under their wing .

he is the son of a wealthy venetian and wants nothing more than to finally grow up ; he simply can not meet his father 's impossibly high expectations . scipio takes care of the other children by stealing valuable pieces of jewelry from his parents which the others then sell on the black market .
for the other kids , scipio is a hero ; they do n't know anything about his background or how he gets hold of the jewelry . everything is going fine - until victor getz gets wind of the runaway brothers ' whereabouts and the story takes a mysterious turn . success in hollywood in 2002 , cornelia funke made an international breakthrough with her novel " the thief lord . "
the english version of the book was released the same year .
funke had asked her cousin to do a sample translation - more for sentimental reasons than anything else . " i 'm an english junkie , " funke once said in an interview .
" i love reading out loud in english .
and i always wanted to hear my own stories in english . " now , funke writes in english herself .
she and her family moved to los angeles several years ago , in part to assist with the filming of her books . making it in hollywood is a feat many other authors can only dream of .
funke once said she would n't wish for anything more than to tell stories that can be enjoyed in different cultures .
still , she was surprised at just how well her work was received in the us and england . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funke always dreamed of seeing her books in english " the enthusiasm i got there is so unbelievable that it 's a little bit embarrassing , " said the author . themes everyone understands funke 's children 's books have n't just become bestsellers in the us and england , but also in other countries like japan , brazil and russia .

shortly before ramadan , hamburg deemed the mosque 's extreme islamist ideology as sufficient grounds for a ban . hamburg police early monday morning raided a mosque with a known history of breeding jihadists , city authorities reported .
at 6 a.m.
monday morning 20 police officers reportedly entered the mosque searching for evidence of islamist radicalization .
hamburg 's interior minister , christoph ahlhaus , deemed the group 's islamist ideology reason enough to close the center for good .

monday morning 20 police officers reportedly entered the mosque searching for evidence of islamist radicalization .
hamburg 's interior minister , christoph ahlhaus , deemed the group 's islamist ideology reason enough to close the center for good .

it was the novel " the thief lord " that catapulted her to international fame in 2002 . the story begins in detective victor getz ' office in venice .
he is commissioned to find two missing children , 12-year-old prosper and his five-year-old brother bo .
the boys had run away from home to escape their terrible aunt . their journey takes them to venice - a city their late mother had often told them about , a place of magic and wonder .
but , when prosper and bo arrive in venice , they discover an entirely different side of the city : " a damp wind had greeted them as they climbed down the steps from the station , blowing right through their thin clothes .
all they had with them was a small bag and a backpack .
prosper ’ s allowance hadn ’ t lasted long , and after the second night bo had already started coughing so badly that prosper had taken him by the hand to go and find a policeman . he had been determined to use the few bits of italian he had learned from his mother , and to say , ' scusi , we have run away from home , but my brother is sick . could you call my aunt so she can come and pick him up ? " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia funke -lrb- center -rrb- and the cast for " the thief lord , " which was filmed in 2005 however , before they make that call , prosper and bo meet up with a gang of kids who take them under their wing .
they all find shelter in an abandoned movie theater . the leader of the gang is scipio , " the thief lord . "
he is the son of a wealthy venetian and wants nothing more than to finally grow up ; he simply can not meet his father 's impossibly high expectations . scipio takes care of the other children by stealing valuable pieces of jewelry from his parents which the others then sell on the black market .
for the other kids , scipio is a hero ; they do n't know anything about his background or how he gets hold of the jewelry . everything is going fine - until victor getz gets wind of the runaway brothers ' whereabouts and the story takes a mysterious turn . success in hollywood in 2002 , cornelia funke made an international breakthrough with her novel " the thief lord . "
the english version of the book was released the same year .
funke had asked her cousin to do a sample translation - more for sentimental reasons than anything else . " i 'm an english junkie , " funke once said in an interview .
" i love reading out loud in english .
and i always wanted to hear my own stories in english . " now , funke writes in english herself .
she and her family moved to los angeles several years ago , in part to assist with the filming of her books . making it in hollywood is a feat many other authors can only dream of .
funke once said she would n't wish for anything more than to tell stories that can be enjoyed in different cultures .
still , she was surprised at just how well her work was received in the us and england . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funke always dreamed of seeing her books in english " the enthusiasm i got there is so unbelievable that it 's a little bit embarrassing , " said the author . themes everyone understands funke 's children 's books have n't just become bestsellers in the us and england , but also in other countries like japan , brazil and russia .
" the thief lord " was translated into 41 languages ; over three million copies have been sold worldwide . funke likes to point out that her books are n't just for younger readers , but address universal " problems that have always concerned people . " " the thief lord " focuses on the problem of growing up .
while the grown-ups dream of being kids again , 12-year-old prosper finally gets a taste of what it would be like to be an adult and no longer under the supervision of his evil aunt . nevertheless , he chooses not to take a ride on the magic carousel .
in just a few minutes he could have been transformed into a grown-up .

german employees may well be taking their legendary efficiency just a bit too far .
new figures reveal two thirds of the workforce respond to business-related correspondence outside official working hours . the figures make for unsettling reading ; a recent study by communications group bitkom shows that the majority of workers in germany regularly check and respond to work e-mails during their free time .
thanks to the upsurge in popularity of mobile internet devices such as the blackberry , germans are even staying in touch while they 're on vacation . although the problem is widespread and affects employees and freelancers in all work sectors , the media , telecommunications and it were worst affected . with more and more germans allowing work to cut into their leisure time , is the country 's workforce heading for a general meltdown ?
one of the nation 's biggest trade unions , verdi , says it need n't be . " the most important thing to remember is that no worker in germany is obliged in any way to check or respond to work-related correspondence in his or her free time , " union spokesman christian schmitz warned . " we have very strict laws here governing working hours but they also exist to protect our free time .
if an employer requires that an employee be available outside regular working hours , this has to be arranged in advance through the trade union and the employee must be paid for this . " switching off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom : setting a standard in respecting workers ' rights some forward-thinking companies are making an effort to reinforce their workers ' rights to a private life .
in a move some observers described amusingly ironic , telecommunications giant deutsche telekom recently introduced a policy encouraging staff to switch off their smartphones at the weekend . " we have to respect the free time of our employees and we have to try to make a better work-life balance , " telekom spokesman georg von wagner told deutsche welle .
" our employees have a right to their free time and should look forward to coming to work on mondays . " " we strongly encourage the executive staff to set a good example and not write e-mails on friday afternoons or on saturdays because employees would feel forced to answer and this chain reaction would go on and on .
we wanted to break that . " office days the media was identified as one of the hotspots in which workers tended to make themselves available 24/7 .
benjamin ruth , managing director of a berlin-based cross-media company , says his working day is far from easy . " i 'm in the office on an average day , 10 hours , sometimes 12 , sometimes 14 .
we communicate in multiple ways ; obviously e-mail , ichat , skype for instant messaging , most of us have a blackberry and a telephone / fax of course , " ruth explained . " i respond to my last e-mail around 1 a.m. before i go to bed , then early in the morning before i go to work and then on the weekends as well .
it 's the nature of the business .
it 's become very non-linear and in addition to that our business is global which also means we work across multiple time zones . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always online : with devices like the blackberry , logging on is always a temptation dedication … or addiction ? however , with such strict rules in place governing workers ' rights to free time , could it be that incessant replying to business mails says more about our general addiction to the internet and mobile technology than it does about our dedication to our jobs ? " if you are talking about the blackberry crowd , yes they are addicted to it and they admit it and they hate it actually , " said dr. isabella heuser , a psychologist at berlin 's charite hospital . " we all depend on e-mailing and on our computers these days , but for some reasons some people are not able to switch the damn computer off and that is what you need to do . " she also warned that addiction to the internet – classified as a non-substance addiction – was as much a health hazard as being hooked on cigarettes or alcohol . " i do have a couple of patients who have what 's called burnout - a euphemism for depression - and i actually prescribe e-mail abstinence , " she explained .
" it can be a serious thing and i advise them to only check their e-mails twice a day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working around the clock has n't led to an increase in efficiency " it 's an addiction , differing from nicotine or alcohol of course but obviously inducing similar changes in the brain .
we are just at the beginning of understanding a little bit about non-substance addictions . " it seems our constant availability and eagerness to send messages speaks volumes about our general addiction to the net but does little to improve efficiency .
just ask anyone on a large e-mail distribution list how much time they spend sorting through smartphone-generated group messages and deleting irrelevant e-mails - let alone reading and replying to the important ones . so , this friday when you sign out of your inbox , stay signed out .
after all , you can easily catch up again with all the gossip on monday morning .

instead , this former coal city is focusing on the service industry and reinventing itself as a cultural center . the ruhr region is the most congested urban area in germany .
it is home to 5.3 million people , and sometimes it 's hard to tell where one city ends and another begins .
with around 400,000 residents , bochum lies in the heart of this region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de work -pipe- 09.08.2010 dedicated or addicted : german workers are reluctant to go offline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is germany 's workforce risking an e-mail induced meltdown ?
german employees may well be taking their legendary efficiency just a bit too far .
new figures reveal two thirds of the workforce respond to business-related correspondence outside official working hours . the figures make for unsettling reading ; a recent study by communications group bitkom shows that the majority of workers in germany regularly check and respond to work e-mails during their free time .
thanks to the upsurge in popularity of mobile internet devices such as the blackberry , germans are even staying in touch while they 're on vacation . although the problem is widespread and affects employees and freelancers in all work sectors , the media , telecommunications and it were worst affected . with more and more germans allowing work to cut into their leisure time , is the country 's workforce heading for a general meltdown ?
one of the nation 's biggest trade unions , verdi , says it need n't be . " the most important thing to remember is that no worker in germany is obliged in any way to check or respond to work-related correspondence in his or her free time , " union spokesman christian schmitz warned . " we have very strict laws here governing working hours but they also exist to protect our free time .
if an employer requires that an employee be available outside regular working hours , this has to be arranged in advance through the trade union and the employee must be paid for this . " switching off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom : setting a standard in respecting workers ' rights some forward-thinking companies are making an effort to reinforce their workers ' rights to a private life .
in a move some observers described amusingly ironic , telecommunications giant deutsche telekom recently introduced a policy encouraging staff to switch off their smartphones at the weekend . " we have to respect the free time of our employees and we have to try to make a better work-life balance , " telekom spokesman georg von wagner told deutsche welle .
" our employees have a right to their free time and should look forward to coming to work on mondays . " " we strongly encourage the executive staff to set a good example and not write e-mails on friday afternoons or on saturdays because employees would feel forced to answer and this chain reaction would go on and on .
we wanted to break that . " office days the media was identified as one of the hotspots in which workers tended to make themselves available 24/7 .
benjamin ruth , managing director of a berlin-based cross-media company , says his working day is far from easy . " i 'm in the office on an average day , 10 hours , sometimes 12 , sometimes 14 .
we communicate in multiple ways ; obviously e-mail , ichat , skype for instant messaging , most of us have a blackberry and a telephone / fax of course , " ruth explained . " i respond to my last e-mail around 1 a.m. before i go to bed , then early in the morning before i go to work and then on the weekends as well .
it 's the nature of the business .
it 's become very non-linear and in addition to that our business is global which also means we work across multiple time zones . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always online : with devices like the blackberry , logging on is always a temptation dedication … or addiction ? however , with such strict rules in place governing workers ' rights to free time , could it be that incessant replying to business mails says more about our general addiction to the internet and mobile technology than it does about our dedication to our jobs ? " if you are talking about the blackberry crowd , yes they are addicted to it and they admit it and they hate it actually , " said dr. isabella heuser , a psychologist at berlin 's charite hospital . " we all depend on e-mailing and on our computers these days , but for some reasons some people are not able to switch the damn computer off and that is what you need to do . " she also warned that addiction to the internet – classified as a non-substance addiction – was as much a health hazard as being hooked on cigarettes or alcohol . " i do have a couple of patients who have what 's called burnout - a euphemism for depression - and i actually prescribe e-mail abstinence , " she explained .
" it can be a serious thing and i advise them to only check their e-mails twice a day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working around the clock has n't led to an increase in efficiency " it 's an addiction , differing from nicotine or alcohol of course but obviously inducing similar changes in the brain .
we are just at the beginning of understanding a little bit about non-substance addictions . " it seems our constant availability and eagerness to send messages speaks volumes about our general addiction to the net but does little to improve efficiency .
just ask anyone on a large e-mail distribution list how much time they spend sorting through smartphone-generated group messages and deleting irrelevant e-mails - let alone reading and replying to the important ones . so , this friday when you sign out of your inbox , stay signed out .
after all , you can easily catch up again with all the gossip on monday morning .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 09.08.2010 un starts inquiry into gaza flotilla raid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mavi marmara was stormed by israeli commandos a united nations probe has begun investigating the controversial raid by israeli forces on an aid convoy headed toward the gaza strip that left nine turkish nationals dead .
an initial report is due in mid-september . a four-member united nations panel on tuesday started its investigation of a deadly raid by israel on a flotilla of ships carrying aid to the gaza strip , with israel promising its cooperation .
" israel has nothing to hide , " said israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu at a cabinet meeting .
" it is in the national interest of the state of israel to ensure that the factual truth of the overall flotilla events comes to light throughout the world . "
the jewish state has set one condition , however : that its soldiers are not questioned as part of the investigation .
" the prime minister said israel would not cooperate with any commission that would ask to question soldiers , " a spokesman for netanyahu said on tuesday .
the comments came after un secretary-general ban ki-moon denied reaching a deal with israel excluding the un panel from interviewing israeli military personnel .
the panel , headed by former new zealand prime minister geoffrey palmer and outgoing president alvaro uribe , also includes one turkish and one israeli diplomat .
the committee will present an initial report on its probe in mid-september after it has reviewed the circumstances surrounding the may 31 attack during which israeli commandos raided a six-ship convoy .
israel was trying to prevent the ships from breaking the blockade on gaza .
during the raid , nine turkish citizens , including one with both turkish and american citizenship , were killed .
at least seven israeli commandos were wounded .
the event caused an international outcry and widespread condemnation of israel 's tactics .
it also soured relations between israel and turkey , one of the jewish state 's only allies in the region with whom it shared strong economic and political ties .
new approach in the past , israel has refused to cooperate with investigations into its behavior on the international stage and responded with boycotts or by simply ignoring them .
now , however , it appears that israel is taking a new approach , although not without prompting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's refused to cooperate with an inquiry following military operations in gaza in 2009 " this time , israel sees itself now much more than in the past on the receiving end of international criticism .
they are under significantly more pressure now to cooperate , " almut moeller , a researcher at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
strong pressure on israel has come not only from the un , but from the obama administration and the europeans .
the german parliament , in an unusual move , passed a unanimous resolution in july calling for an end to israel 's blockage of the gaza strip .
israel chose not to cooperate with the goldstone probe , which looked into israeli 's attack on gaza in which more than 1,300 palstinians were killed .
israel came away from that inquiry cast in a very negative life , and it might be that israel does n't want to repeat the experience .
" this cooperation can be seen as a signal from the israeli government that it is not blind and deaf to international criticism , " margret johannsen , a senior research fellow at the hamburg-based institute for peace research and security policy , said .
ties to turkey israel 's decision to cooperate could have much to do with its desire to repair its ties with turkey , it strongest muslim and regional ally on both the economic and political level .
after the may 31 raid , relations between the two states deteriorated enormously .
in july , turkey threatened to break diplomatic ties with israel over the flotilla raid and turkey 's foreign minister said ties would only be maintained if israel either apologized or accepted the outcome of the international inquiry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister netanyahu has said israel has nothing to apologize for israel refused to apologize , but did say it was interested in avoiding any further deterioration of bilateral relations .
israel has been a major arms supplier to turkey , and the two countries have entered into multiple agreements that have seen them cooperating in several areas , especially on defense matters .
after a devastating 1999 earthquake in turkey , israel sent one of the largest international teams to help .
in 2000 , the two signed the " turkish-israeli free-trade agreement . "
turkey was the first muslim-majority country to enter into such a deal with the jewish state .
fair and balanced ?
the un investigation is but one of several going on right now .
israel is carrying out its own probe into the raid , with prime minister netanyahu giving testimony on monday .
" i am convinced that at the end of your investigation , it will become clear that the state of israel and the idf -lrb- israeli defense forces -rrb- acted in accordance with international law , " netanyahu told members of the five-person tirkel commission .
turkey reportedly began carrying out its own inquiry days after the raid , allegedly looking to make a criminal case against top israeli officials .
the un human rights council is conducting a probe , not to be confused with the un investigation starting tuesday .
but israel has refused to cooperate with that body , claiming that it is biased .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a video still purporting to show israeli soldiers aboard a vessel surrounding a turkish ship un chief ban has sought to find a way to conduct the investigation in a way that would satisfy both turkey and israel .
his choice of oezdem sanberk , a former undersecretary at the turkish foreign ministry , and joseph ciechanover , a former senior official at the israeli foreign ministry , is a tactic to dampen possible criticism that the panel could tilt to one side .
" -lsb- the panel 's makeup -rsb- increases its credibility in israel itself and makes it harder for people to present the panel as biased against israel from the outset , " said mideast expert johannsen .
whatever the panel 's findings , experts agree that there will likely be no sanctions placed on israel , even if the investigation finds fault with its actions .
sanctions depend on the un security council , and it 's very probable that the united states , a strong israel ally , would veto any sanction resolution .
still , johannsen thinks the probe is crucial not only for both turkey and israel , but also for the international community at large . " while it wo n't result in any sanctions , it 's important that the investigation take place because it highlights the importance of international law , " she said . author : kyle james , darren mara -lrb- afp / ap -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de medicine -pipe- 09.08.2010 german scientists discover ' needle-free ' malaria vaccine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : approximately half of all humans live in areas of the world threatened by malaria by combining antibiotics and malaria-infected mosquitos , researchers find that mice are protected .
human clinical trials will be just around the corner . deep in a lab , in carefully sealed incubators , mosquitos , which normally are malaria carriers , may this time actually be part of the solution .
kai matuschewski and his research team from the max planck institute for infection biology in berlin used mosquitoes to infect test mice with malaria .
at the same time , they gave the mice antibiotics for three days and the mice showed no signs of the disease .
matuschewski says this means that he and his research team may have discovered the first so-called " needle-free " malaria vaccine .
their research was published last month in the journal science translational medicine .
if successful , the vaccine would use a combination of drugs and the mosquito itself to prevent the onset of malaria .
it could be a boon to billions of people worldwide who are at risk for the disease , which mainly affects people living in temperate climates .
matuschewski said the idea behind their research was to " combine a classical prophylaxis aspect - which is antibiotic treatment - -lrb- that travelers use to protect themselves against malaria -rrb- , together with a natural exposure . "
" the mosquito is our sort of syringe that delivers the pathogen and we stop the parasite from growing in the liver through antibiotic prophylaxis , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malarone is a common anti-malarial drug ' the mice do n't get sick ' while feeding , a malaria-carrying mosquito injects something called a sporozoite , which is the cell form that infects the new host .
in this case , that would be the mouse .
in the real world , it could be a human .
the sporozoites migrate to the liver , where they replicate massively and mature to the disease-causing blood stage cells called merozoites .
in this new german study , the merozoites continued to develop in the liver cells , but the antibiotics prevented them from infecting the red blood cells , which meant that the mice did n't get malaria symptoms .
with this treatment the mice not only did n't get sick , but they also developed long-term immunity .
the mice were infected with sporozoites again after 40 days , four months , and six months , this time without adding antibiotics , and all the animals had complete protection against malaria .
antibiotic resistance the antibiotics the scientists used were clindamycin and azithromycin , that are both generic , cheap and readily available .
this is good news for poorer countries , but dr. michael knappik , from the berlin center for tropical and travel medicine , pointed out that there are drawbacks with using antibiotics in the long term .
" we have growing resistance against the malaria drugs we use at the moment , " he said , " and that 's a big problem especially in southeast asia , and this of course can also arise in these new antibiotic treatments . "
matuschewski and his team hope to reduce the likelihood of antibiotic resistance by administering the drugs once a year - at the onset of the rainy season .
he added that antibiotic resistance is n't as pronounced in africa as it is in western countries , so the benefits could outweigh the concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this electron micrograph shows a female anopheles stephensi mosquito , which often is a carrier of malaria clinical trials to begin next year if successful , this new treatment could dramatically lower the one million deaths worldwide from malaria every year .
around 600 germans contract the disease each year , and sebastian hofmann was one of the unlucky ones .
seven years ago at age 19 , hofmann went backpacking across west africa , and , despite the usual malaria prevention measures - including medicine , insect repellent and mosquito nets - he still contracted the disease . "
i was hallucinating .
i was sweaty , " he remembered , " i thought i was somehow in the state of being really drunk and having a really bad flu . "
hofmann contracted the worst strain of malaria and fell into a coma for three days , although he eventually recovered .
while this new treatment is n't targeted at travelers in general - because you need to be infected with malaria first for it to work - it could make a big difference for people living in severely affected regions . "
in endemic areas in kenya , in east africa , people live there for 20 years , get infected probably sometimes 100 times a year and they always develop parasites , " matuschewski said .
" so to achieve something like anti-parasitic sterile immunity is almost impossible .
so what we want is to protect against disease . "
put another way , even if children living in malaria regions are protected daily with bed nets , according to matuschewski all this does is delay their potential exposure to the disease and subsequent symptoms and complications .
so rather than trying to prevent all mosquito bites - which is virtually impossible - this new treatment uses the infection as a part of the solution in combination with the antibiotic .
because the antibiotics are readily available , matuschewski and his research team hope that clinical trials could start in sub-saharan africa , as early as the beginning of summer next year .
while they 're excited about their findings , scientists like dr johannes friesen from the max planck institute for infection biology in berlin , were careful to point out that their research is just " one component to fight the disease . "

foreign demand is credited with helping to boost growth in europe 's biggest economy .
germany , the world 's second-biggest exporter after china , showed provisional reports of exports of just over 86.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 115 billion -rrb- for the month - the highest level since october 2008 .
exports to germany 's 15 eurozone partners climbed 22 percent year-on-year in june , while exports to countries outside the european union soared by 37.3 percent annually .
the figures were up 28.5 percent compared with june 2009 , and have bolstered the euro single currency after months of pressure on european economies .
the euro had slumped to a four-year low against the dollar in june amid fears the debt crisis afflicting a handful of european countries would hamper the recovery from the financial crisis .
analysts had predicted that german exports would rise month-on-month by 1.8 percent in june after soaring by a revised 7.9 percent in may .
the upbeat results have raised expectations that the german economy grew strongly in the second quarter this year .

" i am convinced that at the end of your investigation , it will become clear that the state of israel and the idf -lrb- israeli defense forces -rrb- acted in accordance with international law , " netanyahu told members of the tirkel commission as he began testifying about the raid .
netanyahu was the first witness to testify at the internal investigation , which was set up following intense international pressure on the israeli government following the commando raid in may . the raid , on six ships attempting to break a naval blockade of the gaza strip , killed nine turkish activists and wounded many others .

" the turkish government did not consider the confrontation between turkish activists and israel to be against its interests . "
netanyahu added that he ordered troops to make a " supreme effort " to avoid harming any passengers on board the aid ships .
israel says its commandos resorted to using their weapons only after they were attacked once boarding the vessels .

germany , the world 's second-biggest exporter after china , showed provisional reports of exports of just over 86.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 115 billion -rrb- for the month - the highest level since october 2008 .
exports to germany 's 15 eurozone partners climbed 22 percent year-on-year in june , while exports to countries outside the european union soared by 37.3 percent annually .
the figures were up 28.5 percent compared with june 2009 , and have bolstered the euro single currency after months of pressure on european economies .
the euro had slumped to a four-year low against the dollar in june amid fears the debt crisis afflicting a handful of european countries would hamper the recovery from the financial crisis .
analysts had predicted that german exports would rise month-on-month by 1.8 percent in june after soaring by a revised 7.9 percent in may .
the upbeat results have raised expectations that the german economy grew strongly in the second quarter this year .

human clinical trials will be just around the corner . deep in a lab , in carefully sealed incubators , mosquitos , which normally are malaria carriers , may this time actually be part of the solution .
kai matuschewski and his research team from the max planck institute for infection biology in berlin used mosquitoes to infect test mice with malaria .
at the same time , they gave the mice antibiotics for three days and the mice showed no signs of the disease .
matuschewski says this means that he and his research team may have discovered the first so-called " needle-free " malaria vaccine .
their research was published last month in the journal science translational medicine .
if successful , the vaccine would use a combination of drugs and the mosquito itself to prevent the onset of malaria .
it could be a boon to billions of people worldwide who are at risk for the disease , which mainly affects people living in temperate climates .
matuschewski said the idea behind their research was to " combine a classical prophylaxis aspect - which is antibiotic treatment - -lrb- that travelers use to protect themselves against malaria -rrb- , together with a natural exposure . "
" the mosquito is our sort of syringe that delivers the pathogen and we stop the parasite from growing in the liver through antibiotic prophylaxis , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : malarone is a common anti-malarial drug ' the mice do n't get sick ' while feeding , a malaria-carrying mosquito injects something called a sporozoite , which is the cell form that infects the new host .
in this case , that would be the mouse .
in the real world , it could be a human .
the sporozoites migrate to the liver , where they replicate massively and mature to the disease-causing blood stage cells called merozoites .
in this new german study , the merozoites continued to develop in the liver cells , but the antibiotics prevented them from infecting the red blood cells , which meant that the mice did n't get malaria symptoms .
with this treatment the mice not only did n't get sick , but they also developed long-term immunity .
the mice were infected with sporozoites again after 40 days , four months , and six months , this time without adding antibiotics , and all the animals had complete protection against malaria .
antibiotic resistance the antibiotics the scientists used were clindamycin and azithromycin , that are both generic , cheap and readily available .
this is good news for poorer countries , but dr. michael knappik , from the berlin center for tropical and travel medicine , pointed out that there are drawbacks with using antibiotics in the long term .
" we have growing resistance against the malaria drugs we use at the moment , " he said , " and that 's a big problem especially in southeast asia , and this of course can also arise in these new antibiotic treatments . "
matuschewski and his team hope to reduce the likelihood of antibiotic resistance by administering the drugs once a year - at the onset of the rainy season .
he added that antibiotic resistance is n't as pronounced in africa as it is in western countries , so the benefits could outweigh the concerns .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this electron micrograph shows a female anopheles stephensi mosquito , which often is a carrier of malaria clinical trials to begin next year if successful , this new treatment could dramatically lower the one million deaths worldwide from malaria every year .
around 600 germans contract the disease each year , and sebastian hofmann was one of the unlucky ones .
seven years ago at age 19 , hofmann went backpacking across west africa , and , despite the usual malaria prevention measures - including medicine , insect repellent and mosquito nets - he still contracted the disease . "
i was hallucinating .
i was sweaty , " he remembered , " i thought i was somehow in the state of being really drunk and having a really bad flu . "
hofmann contracted the worst strain of malaria and fell into a coma for three days , although he eventually recovered .
while this new treatment is n't targeted at travelers in general - because you need to be infected with malaria first for it to work - it could make a big difference for people living in severely affected regions . "
in endemic areas in kenya , in east africa , people live there for 20 years , get infected probably sometimes 100 times a year and they always develop parasites , " matuschewski said .
" so to achieve something like anti-parasitic sterile immunity is almost impossible .
so what we want is to protect against disease . "
put another way , even if children living in malaria regions are protected daily with bed nets , according to matuschewski all this does is delay their potential exposure to the disease and subsequent symptoms and complications .
so rather than trying to prevent all mosquito bites - which is virtually impossible - this new treatment uses the infection as a part of the solution in combination with the antibiotic .
because the antibiotics are readily available , matuschewski and his research team hope that clinical trials could start in sub-saharan africa , as early as the beginning of summer next year .
while they 're excited about their findings , scientists like dr johannes friesen from the max planck institute for infection biology in berlin , were careful to point out that their research is just " one component to fight the disease . "

it was the novel " the thief lord " that catapulted her to international fame in 2002 . the story begins in detective victor getz ' office in venice .
he is commissioned to find two missing children , 12-year-old prosper and his five-year-old brother bo .
the boys had run away from home to escape their terrible aunt . their journey takes them to venice - a city their late mother had often told them about , a place of magic and wonder .
but , when prosper and bo arrive in venice , they discover an entirely different side of the city : " a damp wind had greeted them as they climbed down the steps from the station , blowing right through their thin clothes .
all they had with them was a small bag and a backpack .
prosper ’ s allowance hadn ’ t lasted long , and after the second night bo had already started coughing so badly that prosper had taken him by the hand to go and find a policeman . he had been determined to use the few bits of italian he had learned from his mother , and to say , ' scusi , we have run away from home , but my brother is sick . could you call my aunt so she can come and pick him up ? " ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia funke -lrb- center -rrb- and the cast for " the thief lord , " which was filmed in 2005 however , before they make that call , prosper and bo meet up with a gang of kids who take them under their wing .
they all find shelter in an abandoned movie theater . the leader of the gang is scipio , " the thief lord . "
he is the son of a wealthy venetian and wants nothing more than to finally grow up ; he simply can not meet his father 's impossibly high expectations . scipio takes care of the other children by stealing valuable pieces of jewelry from his parents which the others then sell on the black market .
for the other kids , scipio is a hero ; they do n't know anything about his background or how he gets hold of the jewelry . everything is going fine - until victor getz gets wind of the runaway brothers ' whereabouts and the story takes a mysterious turn . success in hollywood in 2002 , cornelia funke made an international breakthrough with her novel " the thief lord . "
the english version of the book was released the same year .
funke had asked her cousin to do a sample translation - more for sentimental reasons than anything else . " i 'm an english junkie , " funke once said in an interview .
" i love reading out loud in english .
and i always wanted to hear my own stories in english . " now , funke writes in english herself .
she and her family moved to los angeles several years ago , in part to assist with the filming of her books . making it in hollywood is a feat many other authors can only dream of .
funke once said she would n't wish for anything more than to tell stories that can be enjoyed in different cultures .
still , she was surprised at just how well her work was received in the us and england . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funke always dreamed of seeing her books in english " the enthusiasm i got there is so unbelievable that it 's a little bit embarrassing , " said the author . themes everyone understands funke 's children 's books have n't just become bestsellers in the us and england , but also in other countries like japan , brazil and russia .
" the thief lord " was translated into 41 languages ; over three million copies have been sold worldwide . funke likes to point out that her books are n't just for younger readers , but address universal " problems that have always concerned people . " " the thief lord " focuses on the problem of growing up .
while the grown-ups dream of being kids again , 12-year-old prosper finally gets a taste of what it would be like to be an adult and no longer under the supervision of his evil aunt . nevertheless , he chooses not to take a ride on the magic carousel .
in just a few minutes he could have been transformed into a grown-up .
but then maybe sometime he would just dream of being a kid again . author : petra lambeck -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german employees may well be taking their legendary efficiency just a bit too far .
new figures reveal two thirds of the workforce respond to business-related correspondence outside official working hours . the figures make for unsettling reading ; a recent study by communications group bitkom shows that the majority of workers in germany regularly check and respond to work e-mails during their free time .
thanks to the upsurge in popularity of mobile internet devices such as the blackberry , germans are even staying in touch while they 're on vacation . although the problem is widespread and affects employees and freelancers in all work sectors , the media , telecommunications and it were worst affected . with more and more germans allowing work to cut into their leisure time , is the country 's workforce heading for a general meltdown ?
one of the nation 's biggest trade unions , verdi , says it need n't be . " the most important thing to remember is that no worker in germany is obliged in any way to check or respond to work-related correspondence in his or her free time , " union spokesman christian schmitz warned .

the boys had run away from home to escape their terrible aunt . their journey takes them to venice - a city their late mother had often told them about , a place of magic and wonder .
but , when prosper and bo arrive in venice , they discover an entirely different side of the city : " a damp wind had greeted them as they climbed down the steps from the station , blowing right through their thin clothes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de work -pipe- 09.08.2010 dedicated or addicted : german workers are reluctant to go offline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is germany 's workforce risking an e-mail induced meltdown ?
german employees may well be taking their legendary efficiency just a bit too far .
new figures reveal two thirds of the workforce respond to business-related correspondence outside official working hours . the figures make for unsettling reading ; a recent study by communications group bitkom shows that the majority of workers in germany regularly check and respond to work e-mails during their free time .
thanks to the upsurge in popularity of mobile internet devices such as the blackberry , germans are even staying in touch while they 're on vacation . although the problem is widespread and affects employees and freelancers in all work sectors , the media , telecommunications and it were worst affected . with more and more germans allowing work to cut into their leisure time , is the country 's workforce heading for a general meltdown ?
one of the nation 's biggest trade unions , verdi , says it need n't be . " the most important thing to remember is that no worker in germany is obliged in any way to check or respond to work-related correspondence in his or her free time , " union spokesman christian schmitz warned . " we have very strict laws here governing working hours but they also exist to protect our free time .
if an employer requires that an employee be available outside regular working hours , this has to be arranged in advance through the trade union and the employee must be paid for this . " switching off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom : setting a standard in respecting workers ' rights some forward-thinking companies are making an effort to reinforce their workers ' rights to a private life .
in a move some observers described amusingly ironic , telecommunications giant deutsche telekom recently introduced a policy encouraging staff to switch off their smartphones at the weekend . " we have to respect the free time of our employees and we have to try to make a better work-life balance , " telekom spokesman georg von wagner told deutsche welle .
" our employees have a right to their free time and should look forward to coming to work on mondays . " " we strongly encourage the executive staff to set a good example and not write e-mails on friday afternoons or on saturdays because employees would feel forced to answer and this chain reaction would go on and on .
we wanted to break that . " office days the media was identified as one of the hotspots in which workers tended to make themselves available 24/7 .
benjamin ruth , managing director of a berlin-based cross-media company , says his working day is far from easy . " i 'm in the office on an average day , 10 hours , sometimes 12 , sometimes 14 .
we communicate in multiple ways ; obviously e-mail , ichat , skype for instant messaging , most of us have a blackberry and a telephone / fax of course , " ruth explained . " i respond to my last e-mail around 1 a.m. before i go to bed , then early in the morning before i go to work and then on the weekends as well .
it 's the nature of the business .
it 's become very non-linear and in addition to that our business is global which also means we work across multiple time zones . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : always online : with devices like the blackberry , logging on is always a temptation dedication … or addiction ? however , with such strict rules in place governing workers ' rights to free time , could it be that incessant replying to business mails says more about our general addiction to the internet and mobile technology than it does about our dedication to our jobs ? " if you are talking about the blackberry crowd , yes they are addicted to it and they admit it and they hate it actually , " said dr. isabella heuser , a psychologist at berlin 's charite hospital . " we all depend on e-mailing and on our computers these days , but for some reasons some people are not able to switch the damn computer off and that is what you need to do . " she also warned that addiction to the internet – classified as a non-substance addiction – was as much a health hazard as being hooked on cigarettes or alcohol . " i do have a couple of patients who have what 's called burnout - a euphemism for depression - and i actually prescribe e-mail abstinence , " she explained .
" it can be a serious thing and i advise them to only check their e-mails twice a day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working around the clock has n't led to an increase in efficiency " it 's an addiction , differing from nicotine or alcohol of course but obviously inducing similar changes in the brain .
we are just at the beginning of understanding a little bit about non-substance addictions . " it seems our constant availability and eagerness to send messages speaks volumes about our general addiction to the net but does little to improve efficiency .
just ask anyone on a large e-mail distribution list how much time they spend sorting through smartphone-generated group messages and deleting irrelevant e-mails - let alone reading and replying to the important ones . so , this friday when you sign out of your inbox , stay signed out .
after all , you can easily catch up again with all the gossip on monday morning .

german employees may well be taking their legendary efficiency just a bit too far .
new figures reveal two thirds of the workforce respond to business-related correspondence outside official working hours . the figures make for unsettling reading ; a recent study by communications group bitkom shows that the majority of workers in germany regularly check and respond to work e-mails during their free time .
thanks to the upsurge in popularity of mobile internet devices such as the blackberry , germans are even staying in touch while they 're on vacation . although the problem is widespread and affects employees and freelancers in all work sectors , the media , telecommunications and it were worst affected . with more and more germans allowing work to cut into their leisure time , is the country 's workforce heading for a general meltdown ?
one of the nation 's biggest trade unions , verdi , says it need n't be . " the most important thing to remember is that no worker in germany is obliged in any way to check or respond to work-related correspondence in his or her free time , " union spokesman christian schmitz warned . " we have very strict laws here governing working hours but they also exist to protect our free time .
if an employer requires that an employee be available outside regular working hours , this has to be arranged in advance through the trade union and the employee must be paid for this . " switching off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom : setting a standard in respecting workers ' rights some forward-thinking companies are making an effort to reinforce their workers ' rights to a private life .
in a move some observers described amusingly ironic , telecommunications giant deutsche telekom recently introduced a policy encouraging staff to switch off their smartphones at the weekend . " we have to respect the free time of our employees and we have to try to make a better work-life balance , " telekom spokesman georg von wagner told deutsche welle .
" our employees have a right to their free time and should look forward to coming to work on mondays . " " we strongly encourage the executive staff to set a good example and not write e-mails on friday afternoons or on saturdays because employees would feel forced to answer and this chain reaction would go on and on .
we wanted to break that . " office days the media was identified as one of the hotspots in which workers tended to make themselves available 24/7 .
benjamin ruth , managing director of a berlin-based cross-media company , says his working day is far from easy . " i 'm in the office on an average day , 10 hours , sometimes 12 , sometimes 14 .
we communicate in multiple ways ; obviously e-mail , ichat , skype for instant messaging , most of us have a blackberry and a telephone / fax of course , " ruth explained . " i respond to my last e-mail around 1 a.m. before i go to bed , then early in the morning before i go to work and then on the weekends as well .
it 's the nature of the business .
it 's become very non-linear and in addition to that our business is global which also means we work across multiple time zones .
