brutal protests and clashes have escalated since the shooting of an extremist soccer fan on december 5 . moscow police arrested at least 1,300 russian nationalist and north caucasian youths on saturday in a bid to avoid ethnically motivated clashes after tensions and violence increased in recent days . a police source told the interfax news agency that the detainees belonged to both groups and that numerous weapons had been seized . a large contingent of armed security forces had been deployed throughout moscow after ultra-nationalist and migrant groups issued calls over the internet to rally .
earlier reports had put the number of arrests at 250 . outside the capital , some 100 youths were temporarily detained in the southwestern city of samara when they tried to gather in a park .

" ultra-nationalists have continued to plan protests over the fan 's death .

the imf also warned of tough times ahead for greece , and debt-laden ireland . the international monetary fund on friday released a 2.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- installment of loans for greece , and praised the country 's progress with stringent austerity measures , while also warning of tougher times to come . this was the latest tranche of the country 's 110 billion euro loan package that rescued athens from bankruptcy in may ; so far greece has received 10.58 billion euros from the eu and the imf . athens had to embark on a series of strict spending cuts to qualify for the loans . " the greek authorities are to be commended for their determined implementation of difficult and ambitious macroeconomic policies and structural reforms , " senior imf official murilo portugal said .
" inflation is falling and competitiveness improving … -lsb- the -rsb- overall fiscal adjustment to date has been impressive . " however , the changes have come at a price , recognized both by disgruntled greeks protesting the cuts , and by the imf 's economic experts . the organization warned that a cocktail of recession , high interest rates and draconian budget cuts would cause the country 's economy to shrink by 3 percent in 2011 , more than originally predicted .
the imf also said athens must do more to accelerate structural reforms , particularly in the tourism , retail , and labor markets . the greek government this week announced its latest cost-cutting drive , a plan to raise seven billion euros by selling or otherwise monetizing state companies and other assets . the capital athens was gripped on wednesday by sometimes violent protests against the austerity drive . " significant risks " to irish rescue plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not just irish prime minister brian cowen who 's taking hits in a separate report on ireland , the imf said dublin faced major risks that could ultimately jeopardize its ability to repay emergency loans provided by the eu and imf . " there are significant risks to the program that could affect ireland 's capability to repay the fund , " the imf statement , published on friday but pre-dated , read . weaknesses in the banking sector and the possibility of further government rescues of major corporations are among the greater irish concerns , as well as the chance that dublin 's ambitious four year savings plan might drive the struggling economy into a prolonged downturn . the organization also predicted that the country would not be able to meet an eu target of cutting its deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by 2015 .
without further fiscal measures , the imf forecast a deficit of 5.1 percent of gdp by 2014 , and 4.8 percent by 2015 . the imf made particular reference to the irish banking sector , acknowledging measures taken to strengthen it , but still saying that " vulnerabilities remain acute . "
and further upheaval in ireland could affect other debt-laden eurozone members , according to the international monetary fund . " given market perceptions , spillover effects to other peripheral euro-area economies could be large , " the statement said .
" greece , portugal and spain are the most vulnerable to volatility from an event in ireland . " author : mark hallam -lrb- afp , dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the chancellor 's third trip to the country has been marked by sadness , with news of the death of a 21-year-old soldier . chancellor angela merkel flew into afghanistan for a surprise visit early on saturday , accompanied by defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg and bundeswehr chief of staff volker wieker .
for security reasons the chancellor 's trip was kept secret ahead of her arrival . at the german military camp in kunduz , merkel paid her respects at the memorial to the fallen , and the chancellor then talked to some soldiers about their mission . " until now , we only knew of stories like this from war books , " merkel said after listening to soldiers describing a heated four-day offensive against taliban militants in the volatile char darah district last month .
" the reason why i 'm here is to say ' thank you . '
we know what you are doing is an extremely dangerous undertaking . " soldier 's death casts pall shortly before merkel arrived in kunduz , a 21-year-old german soldier died in an emergency operation .
medical personnel were operating after the soldier was discovered with a severe gunshot wound at an outpost in baghlan province .

eight german soldiers have been killed in the field in 2010 , making it the bloodiest year of the bundeswehr 's mission to afghanistan , where it is part of nato 's international security assistance force . the afghan mission is becoming increasingly unpopular in germany , with most opinion polls showing that the majority of people oppose the bundeswehr 's presence there .
opposition political parties are also ramping up pressure on merkel 's government to commit more firmly to their current plan to start gradually withdrawing soldiers starting at the end of 2011 . withdrawal plans however , the security situation on the ground - if anything - is deteriorating , as the nature of the chancellor 's visit on saturday showed . on her last trip to afghanistan in april 2009 , merkel visited the german bases in kunduz and masar-i-sharif , and she also went to a field hospital and a police training center . this time , merkel is confined to barracks ; having flown in with heavy security , she is not planning any trips beyond the confines of the kunduz base because of security concerns . bildunterschrift : this was a rare chance for merkel to discuss the afghan mission with the people executing it as merkel , guttenberg and the rest of the government try to find a balance between meeting the demands of a war-weary populace and fulfilling their pledges in afghanistan , military leaders have been calling on western governments not to think in terms of " theoretical and inflexible timetables . " " if , as a firefighter , you were fighting a blaze in a high-rise building , you 'd never say to yourself : ' ok , my shift finishes at 7 - whether it 's still burning or not , " ' isaf spokesman josef blotz said in a recent interview with the dpa news agency .
" and even once you 've put the fire out , you 'd station a guard at the site to make sure the flames do n't rekindle . " german foreign minister guido westerwelle reiterated the plan to begin a troop withdrawal in 2011 in his address to parliament in berlin on thursday - in one of the government 's clearest statements so far on the issue .
however , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg - who said nothing in those discussions - had advised against setting too many fixed dates for winding down the mission . guttenberg also travelled to kunduz with merkel on saturday , days after his latest , somewhat controversial trip to the country .

but the chancellor 's third trip to the country has been marked by sadness , with news of the death of a 21-year-old soldier . chancellor angela merkel flew into afghanistan for a surprise visit early on saturday , accompanied by defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg and bundeswehr chief of staff volker wieker .
for security reasons the chancellor 's trip was kept secret ahead of her arrival . at the german military camp in kunduz , merkel paid her respects at the memorial to the fallen , and the chancellor then talked to some soldiers about their mission . " until now , we only knew of stories like this from war books , " merkel said after listening to soldiers describing a heated four-day offensive against taliban militants in the volatile char darah district last month .
" the reason why i 'm here is to say ' thank you . '

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 18.12.2010 major european players submit eu budget freeze appeal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameron has led the battle cry for budget cuts british prime minister david cameron has secured an alliance with france , germany , the netherlands and finland in a quest to keep eu spending under control .
the move has angered eastern european member states . ahead of tough budget negotiations next year , britain , france , germany , finland , and the netherlands submitted a joint letter to the european commission on saturday , stating their stance against overspending .
" european public spending can not be exempted from member states ' considerable efforts to get their public spending under control , " the letter , which was released by the french presidency , said .
the joint appeal was signed by french president nicolas sarkozy , german chancellor angela merkel , dutch prime minister mark rutte , finnish prime minister mari kiviniemi , and british prime minister david cameron .
" all around europe , countries are tightening their belts to deal with their deficits .
-lsb- the eu -rsb- can not be immune from that , " cameron told a news conference on friday at the close of a two-day eu summit , which set up a permanent crisis fund for the euro .
the british premier , who is implementing an unpuopular austerity drive at home and campaigned on reining in european spending in an election earlier this year , used the summit closure as an opportunity to drum up support for the initiative .
cameron said he wanted to " keep the momentum " on limiting eu largesse after successfully leading attempts to curb the 2011 budget rise to 2.91 percent , down from the 6 percent proposed by the european commission and the european parliament .
" we want to do better than we did in 2011 " for the eu 's annual budget in 2012 and 2013 , cameron insisted .
more stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy have joined forces with britain at the end of the summit , cameron circulated a draft letter calling for the eu 's next seven-year budget , which is to run from 2014 to 2020 , to be capped in line with inflation .
" the challenge for the european union in the coming years will not be to spend more , but to spend better , " the letter said .
sarkozy told journalists the aim was not to slash the eu budget but to " stabilize " it .
" at a time when all eu member countries are making extremely important efforts to stabilize , even reduce , their budgets , it is not the right moment for the european budget to rise more than is appropriate , " sarkozy said .
cameron denied striking secret deals to gain support from his allies , despite britain 's drive to retain a two-decade-old rebate that returns billions of euros annually to london in place of farm payments to france and germany .
" there are no backroom deals or secret agreements .
i will defend very , very strongly the british rebate .
we are big net contributors to the eu , " he said .
" that rebate is justified . "
he also denied he risks alienating new eu members in eastern europe who fear cuts in the bloc 's budget will mean a reduction in crucial regional development aid .
but poland expressed displeasure at britain 's new move against eu spending .
fierce resistance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schulz says cameron , merkel and sarkozy will have a fight on their hands " i do n't think it 's necessary , i do n't think it 's useful , i do n't think it 's going to show europe some vision , " said poland 's europe minister mikolaj dowgielewicz .
the head of the european parliament 's second largest bloc , socialist leader martin schulz from germany , is gearing up for battle against the big three 's anti-spending drive .
schulz described the british move as a " provocation " .
" cameron 's initative is doomed to failure because it wo n't stand a chance in the eu parliament " , schulz told the afp news agency .
" i do n't understand why countries like france and germany allow themselves to be led by this agitator , " he added .
greens / european free alliance co-president rebecca harms charged : " this budgetary coup has very little to do with fiscal responsibility and owes far more to the populist whims of cameron , sarkozy and merkel . "
lithuanian president dalia grybauskaite , who formerly served as eu budget commissioner , said the stance was normal .
" and it 's mainly playing , not for europe , but for internal politics . "
budget talks are traditionally the most cut-throat negotiations in eu politics , but the formal debate is not due to begin until june 2011 , once the eu executive , the european commission , makes a draft .
next year 's budget is worth 126.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 166 billion -rrb- , with roughly three quarters of that sum allocated for agriculture subsidies and aid for poorer regions . author : natalia dannenberg , mark hallam -lrb- afp , reuters , dpa -rrb- editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " if , as a firefighter , you were fighting a blaze in a high-rise building , you 'd never say to yourself : ' ok , my shift finishes at 7 - whether it 's still burning or not , " ' isaf spokesman josef blotz said in a recent interview with the dpa news agency .
" and even once you 've put the fire out , you 'd station a guard at the site to make sure the flames do n't rekindle . " german foreign minister guido westerwelle reiterated the plan to begin a troop withdrawal in 2011 in his address to parliament in berlin on thursday - in one of the government 's clearest statements so far on the issue .
however , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg - who said nothing in those discussions - had advised against setting too many fixed dates for winding down the mission . guttenberg also travelled to kunduz with merkel on saturday , days after his latest , somewhat controversial trip to the country .

we know what you are doing is an extremely dangerous undertaking . " soldier 's death casts pall shortly before merkel arrived in kunduz , a 21-year-old german soldier died in an emergency operation .

but the chancellor 's third trip to the country has been marked by sadness , with news of the death of a 21-year-old soldier . chancellor angela merkel flew into afghanistan for a surprise visit early on saturday , accompanied by defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg and bundeswehr chief of staff volker wieker .
for security reasons the chancellor 's trip was kept secret ahead of her arrival . at the german military camp in kunduz , merkel paid her respects at the memorial to the fallen , and the chancellor then talked to some soldiers about their mission . " until now , we only knew of stories like this from war books , " merkel said after listening to soldiers describing a heated four-day offensive against taliban militants in the volatile char darah district last month .
" the reason why i 'm here is to say ' thank you . '
we know what you are doing is an extremely dangerous undertaking . " soldier 's death casts pall shortly before merkel arrived in kunduz , a 21-year-old german soldier died in an emergency operation .
medical personnel were operating after the soldier was discovered with a severe gunshot wound at an outpost in baghlan province .
the details behind the incident are unclear , but a military spokesman at bundeswehr headquarters in potsdam said the man was not injured in a combat situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has now lost 45 soldiers in afghanistan in total , 45 german troops have now lost their lives in afghanistan - 27 of them in combat .
eight german soldiers have been killed in the field in 2010 , making it the bloodiest year of the bundeswehr 's mission to afghanistan , where it is part of nato 's international security assistance force . the afghan mission is becoming increasingly unpopular in germany , with most opinion polls showing that the majority of people oppose the bundeswehr 's presence there .
opposition political parties are also ramping up pressure on merkel 's government to commit more firmly to their current plan to start gradually withdrawing soldiers starting at the end of 2011 . withdrawal plans however , the security situation on the ground - if anything - is deteriorating , as the nature of the chancellor 's visit on saturday showed . on her last trip to afghanistan in april 2009 , merkel visited the german bases in kunduz and masar-i-sharif , and she also went to a field hospital and a police training center . this time , merkel is confined to barracks ; having flown in with heavy security , she is not planning any trips beyond the confines of the kunduz base because of security concerns . bildunterschrift : this was a rare chance for merkel to discuss the afghan mission with the people executing it as merkel , guttenberg and the rest of the government try to find a balance between meeting the demands of a war-weary populace and fulfilling their pledges in afghanistan , military leaders have been calling on western governments not to think in terms of " theoretical and inflexible timetables . " " if , as a firefighter , you were fighting a blaze in a high-rise building , you 'd never say to yourself : ' ok , my shift finishes at 7 - whether it 's still burning or not , " ' isaf spokesman josef blotz said in a recent interview with the dpa news agency .
" and even once you 've put the fire out , you 'd station a guard at the site to make sure the flames do n't rekindle . " german foreign minister guido westerwelle reiterated the plan to begin a troop withdrawal in 2011 in his address to parliament in berlin on thursday - in one of the government 's clearest statements so far on the issue .
however , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg - who said nothing in those discussions - had advised against setting too many fixed dates for winding down the mission . guttenberg also travelled to kunduz with merkel on saturday , days after his latest , somewhat controversial trip to the country .
the defense minister went to the kundus and masar-i-sharif bases on monday , travelling with his wife and a television chat show host - a trip the opposition lambasted as a pr stunt .
the defense minister has been to afghanistan eight times since taking office last year . author : mark hallam -lrb- apn , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the chancellor 's third trip to the country has been marked by sadness , with news of the death of a 21-year-old soldier . chancellor angela merkel flew into afghanistan for a surprise visit early on saturday , accompanied by defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg and bundeswehr chief of staff volker wieker .
for security reasons the chancellor 's trip was kept secret ahead of her arrival . at the german military camp in kunduz , merkel paid her respects at the memorial to the fallen , and the chancellor then talked to some soldiers about their mission . " until now , we only knew of stories like this from war books , " merkel said after listening to soldiers describing a heated four-day offensive against taliban militants in the volatile char darah district last month .
" the reason why i 'm here is to say ' thank you . '
we know what you are doing is an extremely dangerous undertaking . " soldier 's death casts pall shortly before merkel arrived in kunduz , a 21-year-old german soldier died in an emergency operation .
medical personnel were operating after the soldier was discovered with a severe gunshot wound at an outpost in baghlan province .
the details behind the incident are unclear , but a military spokesman at bundeswehr headquarters in potsdam said the man was not injured in a combat situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has now lost 45 soldiers in afghanistan in total , 45 german troops have now lost their lives in afghanistan - 27 of them in combat .
eight german soldiers have been killed in the field in 2010 , making it the bloodiest year of the bundeswehr 's mission to afghanistan , where it is part of nato 's international security assistance force . the afghan mission is becoming increasingly unpopular in germany , with most opinion polls showing that the majority of people oppose the bundeswehr 's presence there .
opposition political parties are also ramping up pressure on merkel 's government to commit more firmly to their current plan to start gradually withdrawing soldiers starting at the end of 2011 . withdrawal plans however , the security situation on the ground - if anything - is deteriorating , as the nature of the chancellor 's visit on saturday showed . on her last trip to afghanistan in april 2009 , merkel visited the german bases in kunduz and masar-i-sharif , and she also went to a field hospital and a police training center . this time , merkel is confined to barracks ; having flown in with heavy security , she is not planning any trips beyond the confines of the kunduz base because of security concerns . bildunterschrift : this was a rare chance for merkel to discuss the afghan mission with the people executing it as merkel , guttenberg and the rest of the government try to find a balance between meeting the demands of a war-weary populace and fulfilling their pledges in afghanistan , military leaders have been calling on western governments not to think in terms of " theoretical and inflexible timetables . " " if , as a firefighter , you were fighting a blaze in a high-rise building , you 'd never say to yourself : ' ok , my shift finishes at 7 - whether it 's still burning or not , " ' isaf spokesman josef blotz said in a recent interview with the dpa news agency .

activities drew people from around the world to the former coal-mining region . the ruhr2010 culture capital program went out with a bang on saturday , with fireworks , breakdancers , and brass bands performing in four cities of the ruhr valley region . it was an event of superlatives - the ruhr2010 culture capital year kicked off in january with a fulminant , televised opening show outside , despite a major snow storm and well-below freezing temperatures .
the spectacle demonstrated the ruhr valley 's aim of changing its face from being a region that produced coal to one that produces culture that goes beyond mining museums . ruhr2010 continued to impress throughout the year - drawing over 10 million visitors , offering 5,500 events and tallying up costs of around 60 million euros -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- for cultural events . closing down the highway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the major a40 highway was closed down during one event major events have marked the program highlights .
one such event , " shaft signs , " saw over 300 gigantic yellow balloons hovering 80 meters -lrb- 262 feet -rrb- above the ground for a week , marking the location of former coalmine shafts .
thousands of people visited the places to learn more about the history of the coal-mining region . another major attraction was " stilllife a40 , " in which part of the ruhr 's main traffic artery - the a40 highway- was vacated of cars for an entire day .
visitors were invited to stage their own performance or party along the 60-kilometer stretch of highway .
they showcased their best in poetry , song , dance or story-telling . the " ! sing - day of song " event saw the ruhr region transformed into a metropolis of choirs - with over 600 concerts , in which thousands of singers and visitors were invited to sing along . small but mighty there were also other , smaller events , such as the " twins " project .
" one hundred sister-city partnerships were created in which intense exchanges took place , " noted oliver scheytt , managing director of the ruhr2010 company .
" look at the group of young people from nizhny novgorod , russia and essen , who hooked up and turned letters from a soldier on the war front in 1942 into a theater project . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruhr museum displays the area 's coalmining history like " twins , " all of the projects of the culture capital year have delved into the identity of the ruhr valley and its inhabitants .
but the colorful cultural program of ruhr2010 has also been successful in going beyond its borders , said thomas laue , head dramatic adviser at bochum 's schauspielhaus theater . " this ruhr2010 year has really grabbed major attention to this region , " he said .
" the culture capital year has heightened awareness among the residents for the area where they live , but i think it 's pepped up the image and importance of the ruhr valley in the minds of people beyond here . " tapping young people 's potential in cooperation with other theaters , laue organized a project aimed at the future called " the next generation . " " we worked with young people to establish nine ' houses of the future ' in very diverse districts in duisburg , essen , bochum and herne , " he explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the " shaft sign " locations " we asked them how they envisioned a place where they would want to live in the future based on how and where they were currently living , " laue added .
" we asked them what their wishes , dreams , and aspirations were and what made them feel desperate .
how should this future place be designed ? " the young people searched for answers to those questions together , with their work turned into a theater piece that premiered in october .
it is now a part of the bochum schauspielhaus program . if left up to ruhr2010 organizers , this year 's experiences should continue to inspire cultural events and projects in the future .
dieter gorny , creator of the music fair popkom and former ceo of the music channel viva , is artistic director of the theme area of creative economy at ruhr2010 .
originally hailing from essen in the ruhr region , his aim - also as a cultural and media studies teacher - is to promote creativity both in economic sectors , as well as in the ruhr metropolitan areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : creative mind dieter gorny he said he wants to tap into branches of the economy that have been overlooked by common business development plans .
part of his project consists of creating spaces where designers and musicians can work productively in his " city of creativity . " " one can certainly say that we have pointed to the fact that these creative areas have already existed - we have just made people more aware of them , " gorny said . a look to the future future cultural projects and expansion of cultural networks , of course , cost money , managing director scheytt noted . " we are discussing ways of securing permanent funding for the culture capital program , and the state of north rhine-westfalia is considering whether it will contribute , " he said . despite all of the " positives " of this year 's ruhr2010 culture capital activities , a cloud still hangs over the project : the mass panic tragedy that claimed the lives of 21 people and injured around 500 others during the love parade music festival in duisburg in july .

the imf also warned of tough times ahead for greece , and debt-laden ireland . the international monetary fund on friday released a 2.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- installment of loans for greece , and praised the country 's progress with stringent austerity measures , while also warning of tougher times to come . this was the latest tranche of the country 's 110 billion euro loan package that rescued athens from bankruptcy in may ; so far greece has received 10.58 billion euros from the eu and the imf . athens had to embark on a series of strict spending cuts to qualify for the loans . " the greek authorities are to be commended for their determined implementation of difficult and ambitious macroeconomic policies and structural reforms , " senior imf official murilo portugal said .
" inflation is falling and competitiveness improving … -lsb- the -rsb- overall fiscal adjustment to date has been impressive . " however , the changes have come at a price , recognized both by disgruntled greeks protesting the cuts , and by the imf 's economic experts . the organization warned that a cocktail of recession , high interest rates and draconian budget cuts would cause the country 's economy to shrink by 3 percent in 2011 , more than originally predicted .
the imf also said athens must do more to accelerate structural reforms , particularly in the tourism , retail , and labor markets . the greek government this week announced its latest cost-cutting drive , a plan to raise seven billion euros by selling or otherwise monetizing state companies and other assets . the capital athens was gripped on wednesday by sometimes violent protests against the austerity drive . " significant risks " to irish rescue plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not just irish prime minister brian cowen who 's taking hits in a separate report on ireland , the imf said dublin faced major risks that could ultimately jeopardize its ability to repay emergency loans provided by the eu and imf . " there are significant risks to the program that could affect ireland 's capability to repay the fund , " the imf statement , published on friday but pre-dated , read . weaknesses in the banking sector and the possibility of further government rescues of major corporations are among the greater irish concerns , as well as the chance that dublin 's ambitious four year savings plan might drive the struggling economy into a prolonged downturn . the organization also predicted that the country would not be able to meet an eu target of cutting its deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by 2015 .
without further fiscal measures , the imf forecast a deficit of 5.1 percent of gdp by 2014 , and 4.8 percent by 2015 . the imf made particular reference to the irish banking sector , acknowledging measures taken to strengthen it , but still saying that " vulnerabilities remain acute . "
and further upheaval in ireland could affect other debt-laden eurozone members , according to the international monetary fund . " given market perceptions , spillover effects to other peripheral euro-area economies could be large , " the statement said .

activities drew people from around the world to the former coal-mining region . the ruhr2010 culture capital program went out with a bang on saturday , with fireworks , breakdancers , and brass bands performing in four cities of the ruhr valley region . it was an event of superlatives - the ruhr2010 culture capital year kicked off in january with a fulminant , televised opening show outside , despite a major snow storm and well-below freezing temperatures .
the spectacle demonstrated the ruhr valley 's aim of changing its face from being a region that produced coal to one that produces culture that goes beyond mining museums . ruhr2010 continued to impress throughout the year - drawing over 10 million visitors , offering 5,500 events and tallying up costs of around 60 million euros -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- for cultural events . closing down the highway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the major a40 highway was closed down during one event major events have marked the program highlights .
one such event , " shaft signs , " saw over 300 gigantic yellow balloons hovering 80 meters -lrb- 262 feet -rrb- above the ground for a week , marking the location of former coalmine shafts .
thousands of people visited the places to learn more about the history of the coal-mining region . another major attraction was " stilllife a40 , " in which part of the ruhr 's main traffic artery - the a40 highway- was vacated of cars for an entire day .
visitors were invited to stage their own performance or party along the 60-kilometer stretch of highway .
they showcased their best in poetry , song , dance or story-telling . the " ! sing - day of song " event saw the ruhr region transformed into a metropolis of choirs - with over 600 concerts , in which thousands of singers and visitors were invited to sing along . small but mighty there were also other , smaller events , such as the " twins " project .
" one hundred sister-city partnerships were created in which intense exchanges took place , " noted oliver scheytt , managing director of the ruhr2010 company .
" look at the group of young people from nizhny novgorod , russia and essen , who hooked up and turned letters from a soldier on the war front in 1942 into a theater project . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruhr museum displays the area 's coalmining history like " twins , " all of the projects of the culture capital year have delved into the identity of the ruhr valley and its inhabitants .
but the colorful cultural program of ruhr2010 has also been successful in going beyond its borders , said thomas laue , head dramatic adviser at bochum 's schauspielhaus theater . " this ruhr2010 year has really grabbed major attention to this region , " he said .
" the culture capital year has heightened awareness among the residents for the area where they live , but i think it 's pepped up the image and importance of the ruhr valley in the minds of people beyond here . " tapping young people 's potential in cooperation with other theaters , laue organized a project aimed at the future called " the next generation . " " we worked with young people to establish nine ' houses of the future ' in very diverse districts in duisburg , essen , bochum and herne , " he explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the " shaft sign " locations " we asked them how they envisioned a place where they would want to live in the future based on how and where they were currently living , " laue added .
" we asked them what their wishes , dreams , and aspirations were and what made them feel desperate .
how should this future place be designed ? " the young people searched for answers to those questions together , with their work turned into a theater piece that premiered in october .
it is now a part of the bochum schauspielhaus program . if left up to ruhr2010 organizers , this year 's experiences should continue to inspire cultural events and projects in the future .
dieter gorny , creator of the music fair popkom and former ceo of the music channel viva , is artistic director of the theme area of creative economy at ruhr2010 .
originally hailing from essen in the ruhr region , his aim - also as a cultural and media studies teacher - is to promote creativity both in economic sectors , as well as in the ruhr metropolitan areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : creative mind dieter gorny he said he wants to tap into branches of the economy that have been overlooked by common business development plans .
part of his project consists of creating spaces where designers and musicians can work productively in his " city of creativity . " " one can certainly say that we have pointed to the fact that these creative areas have already existed - we have just made people more aware of them , " gorny said . a look to the future future cultural projects and expansion of cultural networks , of course , cost money , managing director scheytt noted . " we are discussing ways of securing permanent funding for the culture capital program , and the state of north rhine-westfalia is considering whether it will contribute , " he said . despite all of the " positives " of this year 's ruhr2010 culture capital activities , a cloud still hangs over the project : the mass panic tragedy that claimed the lives of 21 people and injured around 500 others during the love parade music festival in duisburg in july .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 18.12.2010 chancellor merkel thanks troops on surprise visit to afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's merkel 's first trip to afghanistan since april 2009 chancellor angela merkel has paid german soldiers serving in afghanistan a surprise visit .
but the chancellor 's third trip to the country has been marked by sadness , with news of the death of a 21-year-old soldier . chancellor angela merkel flew into afghanistan for a surprise visit early on saturday , accompanied by defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg and bundeswehr chief of staff volker wieker .
for security reasons the chancellor 's trip was kept secret ahead of her arrival . at the german military camp in kunduz , merkel paid her respects at the memorial to the fallen , and the chancellor then talked to some soldiers about their mission . " until now , we only knew of stories like this from war books , " merkel said after listening to soldiers describing a heated four-day offensive against taliban militants in the volatile char darah district last month .
" the reason why i 'm here is to say ' thank you . '
we know what you are doing is an extremely dangerous undertaking . " soldier 's death casts pall shortly before merkel arrived in kunduz , a 21-year-old german soldier died in an emergency operation .
medical personnel were operating after the soldier was discovered with a severe gunshot wound at an outpost in baghlan province .
the details behind the incident are unclear , but a military spokesman at bundeswehr headquarters in potsdam said the man was not injured in a combat situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has now lost 45 soldiers in afghanistan in total , 45 german troops have now lost their lives in afghanistan - 27 of them in combat .
eight german soldiers have been killed in the field in 2010 , making it the bloodiest year of the bundeswehr 's mission to afghanistan , where it is part of nato 's international security assistance force . the afghan mission is becoming increasingly unpopular in germany , with most opinion polls showing that the majority of people oppose the bundeswehr 's presence there .
opposition political parties are also ramping up pressure on merkel 's government to commit more firmly to their current plan to start gradually withdrawing soldiers starting at the end of 2011 . withdrawal plans however , the security situation on the ground - if anything - is deteriorating , as the nature of the chancellor 's visit on saturday showed . on her last trip to afghanistan in april 2009 , merkel visited the german bases in kunduz and masar-i-sharif , and she also went to a field hospital and a police training center . this time , merkel is confined to barracks ; having flown in with heavy security , she is not planning any trips beyond the confines of the kunduz base because of security concerns . bildunterschrift : this was a rare chance for merkel to discuss the afghan mission with the people executing it as merkel , guttenberg and the rest of the government try to find a balance between meeting the demands of a war-weary populace and fulfilling their pledges in afghanistan , military leaders have been calling on western governments not to think in terms of " theoretical and inflexible timetables . " " if , as a firefighter , you were fighting a blaze in a high-rise building , you 'd never say to yourself : ' ok , my shift finishes at 7 - whether it 's still burning or not , " ' isaf spokesman josef blotz said in a recent interview with the dpa news agency .
" and even once you 've put the fire out , you 'd station a guard at the site to make sure the flames do n't rekindle . " german foreign minister guido westerwelle reiterated the plan to begin a troop withdrawal in 2011 in his address to parliament in berlin on thursday - in one of the government 's clearest statements so far on the issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 18.12.2010 chancellor merkel thanks troops on surprise visit to afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's merkel 's first trip to afghanistan since april 2009 chancellor angela merkel has paid german soldiers serving in afghanistan a surprise visit .
but the chancellor 's third trip to the country has been marked by sadness , with news of the death of a 21-year-old soldier . chancellor angela merkel flew into afghanistan for a surprise visit early on saturday , accompanied by defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg and bundeswehr chief of staff volker wieker .
for security reasons the chancellor 's trip was kept secret ahead of her arrival . at the german military camp in kunduz , merkel paid her respects at the memorial to the fallen , and the chancellor then talked to some soldiers about their mission . " until now , we only knew of stories like this from war books , " merkel said after listening to soldiers describing a heated four-day offensive against taliban militants in the volatile char darah district last month .
" the reason why i 'm here is to say ' thank you . '
we know what you are doing is an extremely dangerous undertaking . " soldier 's death casts pall shortly before merkel arrived in kunduz , a 21-year-old german soldier died in an emergency operation .
medical personnel were operating after the soldier was discovered with a severe gunshot wound at an outpost in baghlan province .
the details behind the incident are unclear , but a military spokesman at bundeswehr headquarters in potsdam said the man was not injured in a combat situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has now lost 45 soldiers in afghanistan in total , 45 german troops have now lost their lives in afghanistan - 27 of them in combat .
eight german soldiers have been killed in the field in 2010 , making it the bloodiest year of the bundeswehr 's mission to afghanistan , where it is part of nato 's international security assistance force . the afghan mission is becoming increasingly unpopular in germany , with most opinion polls showing that the majority of people oppose the bundeswehr 's presence there .
opposition political parties are also ramping up pressure on merkel 's government to commit more firmly to their current plan to start gradually withdrawing soldiers starting at the end of 2011 . withdrawal plans however , the security situation on the ground - if anything - is deteriorating , as the nature of the chancellor 's visit on saturday showed . on her last trip to afghanistan in april 2009 , merkel visited the german bases in kunduz and masar-i-sharif , and she also went to a field hospital and a police training center . this time , merkel is confined to barracks ; having flown in with heavy security , she is not planning any trips beyond the confines of the kunduz base because of security concerns . bildunterschrift : this was a rare chance for merkel to discuss the afghan mission with the people executing it as merkel , guttenberg and the rest of the government try to find a balance between meeting the demands of a war-weary populace and fulfilling their pledges in afghanistan , military leaders have been calling on western governments not to think in terms of " theoretical and inflexible timetables . " " if , as a firefighter , you were fighting a blaze in a high-rise building , you 'd never say to yourself : ' ok , my shift finishes at 7 - whether it 's still burning or not , " ' isaf spokesman josef blotz said in a recent interview with the dpa news agency .
" and even once you 've put the fire out , you 'd station a guard at the site to make sure the flames do n't rekindle . " german foreign minister guido westerwelle reiterated the plan to begin a troop withdrawal in 2011 in his address to parliament in berlin on thursday - in one of the government 's clearest statements so far on the issue .
however , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg - who said nothing in those discussions - had advised against setting too many fixed dates for winding down the mission . guttenberg also travelled to kunduz with merkel on saturday , days after his latest , somewhat controversial trip to the country .

" there are significant risks to the program that could affect ireland 's capability to repay the fund , " the imf statement , published on friday but pre-dated , read . weaknesses in the banking sector and the possibility of further government rescues of major corporations are among the greater irish concerns , as well as the chance that dublin 's ambitious four year savings plan might drive the struggling economy into a prolonged downturn . the organization also predicted that the country would not be able to meet an eu target of cutting its deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by 2015 .
without further fiscal measures , the imf forecast a deficit of 5.1 percent of gdp by 2014 , and 4.8 percent by 2015 . the imf made particular reference to the irish banking sector , acknowledging measures taken to strengthen it , but still saying that " vulnerabilities remain acute . "
and further upheaval in ireland could affect other debt-laden eurozone members , according to the international monetary fund . " given market perceptions , spillover effects to other peripheral euro-area economies could be large , " the statement said .

for security reasons the chancellor 's trip was kept secret ahead of her arrival . at the german military camp in kunduz , merkel paid her respects at the memorial to the fallen , and the chancellor then talked to some soldiers about their mission . " until now , we only knew of stories like this from war books , " merkel said after listening to soldiers describing a heated four-day offensive against taliban militants in the volatile char darah district last month .
" the reason why i 'm here is to say ' thank you . '
we know what you are doing is an extremely dangerous undertaking . " soldier 's death casts pall shortly before merkel arrived in kunduz , a 21-year-old german soldier died in an emergency operation .

opposition political parties are also ramping up pressure on merkel 's government to commit more firmly to their current plan to start gradually withdrawing soldiers starting at the end of 2011 . withdrawal plans however , the security situation on the ground - if anything - is deteriorating , as the nature of the chancellor 's visit on saturday showed . on her last trip to afghanistan in april 2009 , merkel visited the german bases in kunduz and masar-i-sharif , and she also went to a field hospital and a police training center . this time , merkel is confined to barracks ; having flown in with heavy security , she is not planning any trips beyond the confines of the kunduz base because of security concerns . bildunterschrift : this was a rare chance for merkel to discuss the afghan mission with the people executing it as merkel , guttenberg and the rest of the government try to find a balance between meeting the demands of a war-weary populace and fulfilling their pledges in afghanistan , military leaders have been calling on western governments not to think in terms of " theoretical and inflexible timetables .

" and even once you 've put the fire out , you 'd station a guard at the site to make sure the flames do n't rekindle .

however , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg - who said nothing in those discussions - had advised against setting too many fixed dates for winding down the mission . guttenberg also travelled to kunduz with merkel on saturday , days after his latest , somewhat controversial trip to the country .

but the chancellor 's third trip to the country has been marked by sadness , with news of the death of a 21-year-old soldier . chancellor angela merkel flew into afghanistan for a surprise visit early on saturday , accompanied by defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg and bundeswehr chief of staff volker wieker .
for security reasons the chancellor 's trip was kept secret ahead of her arrival . at the german military camp in kunduz , merkel paid her respects at the memorial to the fallen , and the chancellor then talked to some soldiers about their mission . " until now , we only knew of stories like this from war books , " merkel said after listening to soldiers describing a heated four-day offensive against taliban militants in the volatile char darah district last month .
" the reason why i 'm here is to say ' thank you . '
we know what you are doing is an extremely dangerous undertaking . " soldier 's death casts pall shortly before merkel arrived in kunduz , a 21-year-old german soldier died in an emergency operation .
medical personnel were operating after the soldier was discovered with a severe gunshot wound at an outpost in baghlan province .
the details behind the incident are unclear , but a military spokesman at bundeswehr headquarters in potsdam said the man was not injured in a combat situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has now lost 45 soldiers in afghanistan in total , 45 german troops have now lost their lives in afghanistan - 27 of them in combat .
eight german soldiers have been killed in the field in 2010 , making it the bloodiest year of the bundeswehr 's mission to afghanistan , where it is part of nato 's international security assistance force . the afghan mission is becoming increasingly unpopular in germany , with most opinion polls showing that the majority of people oppose the bundeswehr 's presence there .
opposition political parties are also ramping up pressure on merkel 's government to commit more firmly to their current plan to start gradually withdrawing soldiers starting at the end of 2011 . withdrawal plans however , the security situation on the ground - if anything - is deteriorating , as the nature of the chancellor 's visit on saturday showed . on her last trip to afghanistan in april 2009 , merkel visited the german bases in kunduz and masar-i-sharif , and she also went to a field hospital and a police training center . this time , merkel is confined to barracks ; having flown in with heavy security , she is not planning any trips beyond the confines of the kunduz base because of security concerns . bildunterschrift : this was a rare chance for merkel to discuss the afghan mission with the people executing it as merkel , guttenberg and the rest of the government try to find a balance between meeting the demands of a war-weary populace and fulfilling their pledges in afghanistan , military leaders have been calling on western governments not to think in terms of " theoretical and inflexible timetables . " " if , as a firefighter , you were fighting a blaze in a high-rise building , you 'd never say to yourself : ' ok , my shift finishes at 7 - whether it 's still burning or not , " ' isaf spokesman josef blotz said in a recent interview with the dpa news agency .
" and even once you 've put the fire out , you 'd station a guard at the site to make sure the flames do n't rekindle . " german foreign minister guido westerwelle reiterated the plan to begin a troop withdrawal in 2011 in his address to parliament in berlin on thursday - in one of the government 's clearest statements so far on the issue .
however , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg - who said nothing in those discussions - had advised against setting too many fixed dates for winding down the mission . guttenberg also travelled to kunduz with merkel on saturday , days after his latest , somewhat controversial trip to the country .
the defense minister went to the kundus and masar-i-sharif bases on monday , travelling with his wife and a television chat show host - a trip the opposition lambasted as a pr stunt .
the defense minister has been to afghanistan eight times since taking office last year . author : mark hallam -lrb- apn , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

activities drew people from around the world to the former coal-mining region . the ruhr2010 culture capital program went out with a bang on saturday , with fireworks , breakdancers , and brass bands performing in four cities of the ruhr valley region . it was an event of superlatives - the ruhr2010 culture capital year kicked off in january with a fulminant , televised opening show outside , despite a major snow storm and well-below freezing temperatures .
the spectacle demonstrated the ruhr valley 's aim of changing its face from being a region that produced coal to one that produces culture that goes beyond mining museums . ruhr2010 continued to impress throughout the year - drawing over 10 million visitors , offering 5,500 events and tallying up costs of around 60 million euros -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- for cultural events . closing down the highway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the major a40 highway was closed down during one event major events have marked the program highlights .
one such event , " shaft signs , " saw over 300 gigantic yellow balloons hovering 80 meters -lrb- 262 feet -rrb- above the ground for a week , marking the location of former coalmine shafts .
thousands of people visited the places to learn more about the history of the coal-mining region . another major attraction was " stilllife a40 , " in which part of the ruhr 's main traffic artery - the a40 highway- was vacated of cars for an entire day .
visitors were invited to stage their own performance or party along the 60-kilometer stretch of highway .
they showcased their best in poetry , song , dance or story-telling . the " ! sing - day of song " event saw the ruhr region transformed into a metropolis of choirs - with over 600 concerts , in which thousands of singers and visitors were invited to sing along . small but mighty there were also other , smaller events , such as the " twins " project .
" one hundred sister-city partnerships were created in which intense exchanges took place , " noted oliver scheytt , managing director of the ruhr2010 company .
" look at the group of young people from nizhny novgorod , russia and essen , who hooked up and turned letters from a soldier on the war front in 1942 into a theater project . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruhr museum displays the area 's coalmining history like " twins , " all of the projects of the culture capital year have delved into the identity of the ruhr valley and its inhabitants .

activities drew people from around the world to the former coal-mining region . the ruhr2010 culture capital program went out with a bang on saturday , with fireworks , breakdancers , and brass bands performing in four cities of the ruhr valley region . it was an event of superlatives - the ruhr2010 culture capital year kicked off in january with a fulminant , televised opening show outside , despite a major snow storm and well-below freezing temperatures .
the spectacle demonstrated the ruhr valley 's aim of changing its face from being a region that produced coal to one that produces culture that goes beyond mining museums . ruhr2010 continued to impress throughout the year - drawing over 10 million visitors , offering 5,500 events and tallying up costs of around 60 million euros -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- for cultural events . closing down the highway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the major a40 highway was closed down during one event major events have marked the program highlights .
one such event , " shaft signs , " saw over 300 gigantic yellow balloons hovering 80 meters -lrb- 262 feet -rrb- above the ground for a week , marking the location of former coalmine shafts .
thousands of people visited the places to learn more about the history of the coal-mining region . another major attraction was " stilllife a40 , " in which part of the ruhr 's main traffic artery - the a40 highway- was vacated of cars for an entire day .
visitors were invited to stage their own performance or party along the 60-kilometer stretch of highway .
they showcased their best in poetry , song , dance or story-telling . the " ! sing - day of song " event saw the ruhr region transformed into a metropolis of choirs - with over 600 concerts , in which thousands of singers and visitors were invited to sing along . small but mighty there were also other , smaller events , such as the " twins " project .
" one hundred sister-city partnerships were created in which intense exchanges took place , " noted oliver scheytt , managing director of the ruhr2010 company .
" look at the group of young people from nizhny novgorod , russia and essen , who hooked up and turned letters from a soldier on the war front in 1942 into a theater project . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruhr museum displays the area 's coalmining history like " twins , " all of the projects of the culture capital year have delved into the identity of the ruhr valley and its inhabitants .
but the colorful cultural program of ruhr2010 has also been successful in going beyond its borders , said thomas laue , head dramatic adviser at bochum 's schauspielhaus theater . " this ruhr2010 year has really grabbed major attention to this region , " he said .
" the culture capital year has heightened awareness among the residents for the area where they live , but i think it 's pepped up the image and importance of the ruhr valley in the minds of people beyond here . " tapping young people 's potential in cooperation with other theaters , laue organized a project aimed at the future called " the next generation . " " we worked with young people to establish nine ' houses of the future ' in very diverse districts in duisburg , essen , bochum and herne , " he explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the " shaft sign " locations " we asked them how they envisioned a place where they would want to live in the future based on how and where they were currently living , " laue added .
" we asked them what their wishes , dreams , and aspirations were and what made them feel desperate .
how should this future place be designed ? " the young people searched for answers to those questions together , with their work turned into a theater piece that premiered in october .
it is now a part of the bochum schauspielhaus program . if left up to ruhr2010 organizers , this year 's experiences should continue to inspire cultural events and projects in the future .
dieter gorny , creator of the music fair popkom and former ceo of the music channel viva , is artistic director of the theme area of creative economy at ruhr2010 .
originally hailing from essen in the ruhr region , his aim - also as a cultural and media studies teacher - is to promote creativity both in economic sectors , as well as in the ruhr metropolitan areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : creative mind dieter gorny he said he wants to tap into branches of the economy that have been overlooked by common business development plans .
part of his project consists of creating spaces where designers and musicians can work productively in his " city of creativity . " " one can certainly say that we have pointed to the fact that these creative areas have already existed - we have just made people more aware of them , " gorny said . a look to the future future cultural projects and expansion of cultural networks , of course , cost money , managing director scheytt noted . " we are discussing ways of securing permanent funding for the culture capital program , and the state of north rhine-westfalia is considering whether it will contribute , " he said . despite all of the " positives " of this year 's ruhr2010 culture capital activities , a cloud still hangs over the project : the mass panic tragedy that claimed the lives of 21 people and injured around 500 others during the love parade music festival in duisburg in july .
this sober event is also to be commemorated during the closing ceremony of ruhr2010 on sunday . author : conny paul -lrb- als -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the imf also warned of tough times ahead for greece , and debt-laden ireland . the international monetary fund on friday released a 2.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- installment of loans for greece , and praised the country 's progress with stringent austerity measures , while also warning of tougher times to come . this was the latest tranche of the country 's 110 billion euro loan package that rescued athens from bankruptcy in may ; so far greece has received 10.58 billion euros from the eu and the imf . athens had to embark on a series of strict spending cuts to qualify for the loans . " the greek authorities are to be commended for their determined implementation of difficult and ambitious macroeconomic policies and structural reforms , " senior imf official murilo portugal said .
" inflation is falling and competitiveness improving … -lsb- the -rsb- overall fiscal adjustment to date has been impressive . " however , the changes have come at a price , recognized both by disgruntled greeks protesting the cuts , and by the imf 's economic experts . the organization warned that a cocktail of recession , high interest rates and draconian budget cuts would cause the country 's economy to shrink by 3 percent in 2011 , more than originally predicted .
the imf also said athens must do more to accelerate structural reforms , particularly in the tourism , retail , and labor markets . the greek government this week announced its latest cost-cutting drive , a plan to raise seven billion euros by selling or otherwise monetizing state companies and other assets . the capital athens was gripped on wednesday by sometimes violent protests against the austerity drive .

" there are significant risks to the program that could affect ireland 's capability to repay the fund , " the imf statement , published on friday but pre-dated , read . weaknesses in the banking sector and the possibility of further government rescues of major corporations are among the greater irish concerns , as well as the chance that dublin 's ambitious four year savings plan might drive the struggling economy into a prolonged downturn . the organization also predicted that the country would not be able to meet an eu target of cutting its deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by 2015 .
without further fiscal measures , the imf forecast a deficit of 5.1 percent of gdp by 2014 , and 4.8 percent by 2015 . the imf made particular reference to the irish banking sector , acknowledging measures taken to strengthen it , but still saying that " vulnerabilities remain acute . "
and further upheaval in ireland could affect other debt-laden eurozone members , according to the international monetary fund . " given market perceptions , spillover effects to other peripheral euro-area economies could be large , " the statement said .

for security reasons the chancellor 's trip was kept secret ahead of her arrival . at the german military camp in kunduz , merkel paid her respects at the memorial to the fallen , and the chancellor then talked to some soldiers about their mission .

opposition political parties are also ramping up pressure on merkel 's government to commit more firmly to their current plan to start gradually withdrawing soldiers starting at the end of 2011 . withdrawal plans however , the security situation on the ground - if anything - is deteriorating , as the nature of the chancellor 's visit on saturday showed . on her last trip to afghanistan in april 2009 , merkel visited the german bases in kunduz and masar-i-sharif , and she also went to a field hospital and a police training center . this time , merkel is confined to barracks ; having flown in with heavy security , she is not planning any trips beyond the confines of the kunduz base because of security concerns . bildunterschrift : this was a rare chance for merkel to discuss the afghan mission with the people executing it as merkel , guttenberg and the rest of the government try to find a balance between meeting the demands of a war-weary populace and fulfilling their pledges in afghanistan , military leaders have been calling on western governments not to think in terms of " theoretical and inflexible timetables .

" and even once you 've put the fire out , you 'd station a guard at the site to make sure the flames do n't rekindle . " german foreign minister guido westerwelle reiterated the plan to begin a troop withdrawal in 2011 in his address to parliament in berlin on thursday - in one of the government 's clearest statements so far on the issue .
however , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg - who said nothing in those discussions - had advised against setting too many fixed dates for winding down the mission . guttenberg also travelled to kunduz with merkel on saturday , days after his latest , somewhat controversial trip to the country .

however , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg - who said nothing in those discussions - had advised against setting too many fixed dates for winding down the mission . guttenberg also travelled to kunduz with merkel on saturday , days after his latest , somewhat controversial trip to the country .

the imf also warned of tough times ahead for greece , and debt-laden ireland . the international monetary fund on friday released a 2.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- installment of loans for greece , and praised the country 's progress with stringent austerity measures , while also warning of tougher times to come . this was the latest tranche of the country 's 110 billion euro loan package that rescued athens from bankruptcy in may ; so far greece has received 10.58 billion euros from the eu and the imf . athens had to embark on a series of strict spending cuts to qualify for the loans . " the greek authorities are to be commended for their determined implementation of difficult and ambitious macroeconomic policies and structural reforms , " senior imf official murilo portugal said .
" inflation is falling and competitiveness improving … -lsb- the -rsb- overall fiscal adjustment to date has been impressive . " however , the changes have come at a price , recognized both by disgruntled greeks protesting the cuts , and by the imf 's economic experts . the organization warned that a cocktail of recession , high interest rates and draconian budget cuts would cause the country 's economy to shrink by 3 percent in 2011 , more than originally predicted .
the imf also said athens must do more to accelerate structural reforms , particularly in the tourism , retail , and labor markets . the greek government this week announced its latest cost-cutting drive , a plan to raise seven billion euros by selling or otherwise monetizing state companies and other assets . the capital athens was gripped on wednesday by sometimes violent protests against the austerity drive . " significant risks " to irish rescue plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not just irish prime minister brian cowen who 's taking hits in a separate report on ireland , the imf said dublin faced major risks that could ultimately jeopardize its ability to repay emergency loans provided by the eu and imf . " there are significant risks to the program that could affect ireland 's capability to repay the fund , " the imf statement , published on friday but pre-dated , read . weaknesses in the banking sector and the possibility of further government rescues of major corporations are among the greater irish concerns , as well as the chance that dublin 's ambitious four year savings plan might drive the struggling economy into a prolonged downturn . the organization also predicted that the country would not be able to meet an eu target of cutting its deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by 2015 .
without further fiscal measures , the imf forecast a deficit of 5.1 percent of gdp by 2014 , and 4.8 percent by 2015 . the imf made particular reference to the irish banking sector , acknowledging measures taken to strengthen it , but still saying that " vulnerabilities remain acute . "
and further upheaval in ireland could affect other debt-laden eurozone members , according to the international monetary fund . " given market perceptions , spillover effects to other peripheral euro-area economies could be large , " the statement said .

activities drew people from around the world to the former coal-mining region . the ruhr2010 culture capital program went out with a bang on saturday , with fireworks , breakdancers , and brass bands performing in four cities of the ruhr valley region . it was an event of superlatives - the ruhr2010 culture capital year kicked off in january with a fulminant , televised opening show outside , despite a major snow storm and well-below freezing temperatures .
the spectacle demonstrated the ruhr valley 's aim of changing its face from being a region that produced coal to one that produces culture that goes beyond mining museums . ruhr2010 continued to impress throughout the year - drawing over 10 million visitors , offering 5,500 events and tallying up costs of around 60 million euros -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- for cultural events . closing down the highway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the major a40 highway was closed down during one event major events have marked the program highlights .
one such event , " shaft signs , " saw over 300 gigantic yellow balloons hovering 80 meters -lrb- 262 feet -rrb- above the ground for a week , marking the location of former coalmine shafts .
thousands of people visited the places to learn more about the history of the coal-mining region . another major attraction was " stilllife a40 , " in which part of the ruhr 's main traffic artery - the a40 highway- was vacated of cars for an entire day .
visitors were invited to stage their own performance or party along the 60-kilometer stretch of highway .
they showcased their best in poetry , song , dance or story-telling . the " ! sing - day of song " event saw the ruhr region transformed into a metropolis of choirs - with over 600 concerts , in which thousands of singers and visitors were invited to sing along . small but mighty there were also other , smaller events , such as the " twins " project .
" one hundred sister-city partnerships were created in which intense exchanges took place , " noted oliver scheytt , managing director of the ruhr2010 company .
" look at the group of young people from nizhny novgorod , russia and essen , who hooked up and turned letters from a soldier on the war front in 1942 into a theater project . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruhr museum displays the area 's coalmining history like " twins , " all of the projects of the culture capital year have delved into the identity of the ruhr valley and its inhabitants .
but the colorful cultural program of ruhr2010 has also been successful in going beyond its borders , said thomas laue , head dramatic adviser at bochum 's schauspielhaus theater . " this ruhr2010 year has really grabbed major attention to this region , " he said .
" the culture capital year has heightened awareness among the residents for the area where they live , but i think it 's pepped up the image and importance of the ruhr valley in the minds of people beyond here . " tapping young people 's potential in cooperation with other theaters , laue organized a project aimed at the future called " the next generation . " " we worked with young people to establish nine ' houses of the future ' in very diverse districts in duisburg , essen , bochum and herne , " he explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the " shaft sign " locations " we asked them how they envisioned a place where they would want to live in the future based on how and where they were currently living , " laue added .
" we asked them what their wishes , dreams , and aspirations were and what made them feel desperate .
how should this future place be designed ? " the young people searched for answers to those questions together , with their work turned into a theater piece that premiered in october .
it is now a part of the bochum schauspielhaus program . if left up to ruhr2010 organizers , this year 's experiences should continue to inspire cultural events and projects in the future .
dieter gorny , creator of the music fair popkom and former ceo of the music channel viva , is artistic director of the theme area of creative economy at ruhr2010 .
originally hailing from essen in the ruhr region , his aim - also as a cultural and media studies teacher - is to promote creativity both in economic sectors , as well as in the ruhr metropolitan areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : creative mind dieter gorny he said he wants to tap into branches of the economy that have been overlooked by common business development plans .
part of his project consists of creating spaces where designers and musicians can work productively in his " city of creativity . " " one can certainly say that we have pointed to the fact that these creative areas have already existed - we have just made people more aware of them , " gorny said . a look to the future future cultural projects and expansion of cultural networks , of course , cost money , managing director scheytt noted . " we are discussing ways of securing permanent funding for the culture capital program , and the state of north rhine-westfalia is considering whether it will contribute , " he said . despite all of the " positives " of this year 's ruhr2010 culture capital activities , a cloud still hangs over the project : the mass panic tragedy that claimed the lives of 21 people and injured around 500 others during the love parade music festival in duisburg in july .

military officials said " no combat situation " was apparent . a soldier with the german bundeswehr mission in afghanistan died of a gunshot wound in the north of the country , military officials announced on friday evening . a spokesman for the bundeswehr operations command in potsdam said the 21-year-old male soldier was found at an outpost north of the pol-e-khomri field camp with severe gunshot wounds .
he was then brought via helicopter to the camp , where he died during emergency surgery . the soldier 's family had been informed and an investigation into the accident had begun , officials said .
one spokesman told the german dpa news agency that a " no combat situation " was apparent . pol-e-khomri lies south of kunduz in the far north of afghanistan , where most of the approximately 4,600 german soldiers are stationed as part of nato 's international security assistance force .

german troops are scheduled to begin leaving the country in late 2011 - a timeframe which foreign minister guido westerwelle reiterated to parliament on thursday . the german mission in afghanistan was important , he said , because german security was at stake , " but it is also important that the mission not be allowed to last forever .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 18.12.2010 chancellor merkel thanks troops on surprise visit to afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's merkel 's first trip to afghanistan since april 2009 chancellor angela merkel has paid german soldiers serving in afghanistan a surprise visit .
but the chancellor 's third trip to the country has been marked by sadness , with news of the death of a 21-year-old soldier . chancellor angela merkel flew into afghanistan for a surprise visit early on saturday , accompanied by defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg and bundeswehr chief of staff volker wieker .
for security reasons the chancellor 's trip was kept secret ahead of her arrival . at the german military camp in kunduz , merkel paid her respects at the memorial to the fallen , and the chancellor then talked to some soldiers about their mission . " until now , we only knew of stories like this from war books , " merkel said after listening to soldiers describing a heated four-day offensive against taliban militants in the volatile char darah district last month .
" the reason why i 'm here is to say ' thank you . '
we know what you are doing is an extremely dangerous undertaking . " soldier 's death casts pall shortly before merkel arrived in kunduz , a 21-year-old german soldier died in an emergency operation .
medical personnel were operating after the soldier was discovered with a severe gunshot wound at an outpost in baghlan province .
the details behind the incident are unclear , but a military spokesman at bundeswehr headquarters in potsdam said the man was not injured in a combat situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has now lost 45 soldiers in afghanistan in total , 45 german troops have now lost their lives in afghanistan - 27 of them in combat .
eight german soldiers have been killed in the field in 2010 , making it the bloodiest year of the bundeswehr 's mission to afghanistan , where it is part of nato 's international security assistance force . the afghan mission is becoming increasingly unpopular in germany , with most opinion polls showing that the majority of people oppose the bundeswehr 's presence there .
opposition political parties are also ramping up pressure on merkel 's government to commit more firmly to their current plan to start gradually withdrawing soldiers starting at the end of 2011 . withdrawal plans however , the security situation on the ground - if anything - is deteriorating , as the nature of the chancellor 's visit on saturday showed . on her last trip to afghanistan in april 2009 , merkel visited the german bases in kunduz and masar-i-sharif , and she also went to a field hospital and a police training center . this time , merkel is confined to barracks ; having flown in with heavy security , she is not planning any trips beyond the confines of the kunduz base because of security concerns . bildunterschrift : this was a rare chance for merkel to discuss the afghan mission with the people executing it as merkel , guttenberg and the rest of the government try to find a balance between meeting the demands of a war-weary populace and fulfilling their pledges in afghanistan , military leaders have been calling on western governments not to think in terms of " theoretical and inflexible timetables . " " if , as a firefighter , you were fighting a blaze in a high-rise building , you 'd never say to yourself : ' ok , my shift finishes at 7 - whether it 's still burning or not , " ' isaf spokesman josef blotz said in a recent interview with the dpa news agency .
" and even once you 've put the fire out , you 'd station a guard at the site to make sure the flames do n't rekindle . " german foreign minister guido westerwelle reiterated the plan to begin a troop withdrawal in 2011 in his address to parliament in berlin on thursday - in one of the government 's clearest statements so far on the issue .
however , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg - who said nothing in those discussions - had advised against setting too many fixed dates for winding down the mission . guttenberg also travelled to kunduz with merkel on saturday , days after his latest , somewhat controversial trip to the country .
the defense minister went to the kundus and masar-i-sharif bases on monday , travelling with his wife and a television chat show host - a trip the opposition lambasted as a pr stunt .

the imf also warned of tough times ahead for greece , and debt-laden ireland . the international monetary fund on friday released a 2.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- installment of loans for greece , and praised the country 's progress with stringent austerity measures , while also warning of tougher times to come . this was the latest tranche of the country 's 110 billion euro loan package that rescued athens from bankruptcy in may ; so far greece has received 10.58 billion euros from the eu and the imf . athens had to embark on a series of strict spending cuts to qualify for the loans . " the greek authorities are to be commended for their determined implementation of difficult and ambitious macroeconomic policies and structural reforms , " senior imf official murilo portugal said .
" inflation is falling and competitiveness improving … -lsb- the -rsb- overall fiscal adjustment to date has been impressive . " however , the changes have come at a price , recognized both by disgruntled greeks protesting the cuts , and by the imf 's economic experts . the organization warned that a cocktail of recession , high interest rates and draconian budget cuts would cause the country 's economy to shrink by 3 percent in 2011 , more than originally predicted .
the imf also said athens must do more to accelerate structural reforms , particularly in the tourism , retail , and labor markets . the greek government this week announced its latest cost-cutting drive , a plan to raise seven billion euros by selling or otherwise monetizing state companies and other assets . the capital athens was gripped on wednesday by sometimes violent protests against the austerity drive . " significant risks " to irish rescue plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not just irish prime minister brian cowen who 's taking hits in a separate report on ireland , the imf said dublin faced major risks that could ultimately jeopardize its ability to repay emergency loans provided by the eu and imf . " there are significant risks to the program that could affect ireland 's capability to repay the fund , " the imf statement , published on friday but pre-dated , read . weaknesses in the banking sector and the possibility of further government rescues of major corporations are among the greater irish concerns , as well as the chance that dublin 's ambitious four year savings plan might drive the struggling economy into a prolonged downturn . the organization also predicted that the country would not be able to meet an eu target of cutting its deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by 2015 .
without further fiscal measures , the imf forecast a deficit of 5.1 percent of gdp by 2014 , and 4.8 percent by 2015 . the imf made particular reference to the irish banking sector , acknowledging measures taken to strengthen it , but still saying that " vulnerabilities remain acute . "
and further upheaval in ireland could affect other debt-laden eurozone members , according to the international monetary fund . " given market perceptions , spillover effects to other peripheral euro-area economies could be large , " the statement said .
" greece , portugal and spain are the most vulnerable to volatility from an event in ireland . " author : mark hallam -lrb- afp , dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the chancellor 's third trip to the country has been marked by sadness , with news of the death of a 21-year-old soldier . chancellor angela merkel flew into afghanistan for a surprise visit early on saturday , accompanied by defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg and bundeswehr chief of staff volker wieker .
for security reasons the chancellor 's trip was kept secret ahead of her arrival . at the german military camp in kunduz , merkel paid her respects at the memorial to the fallen , and the chancellor then talked to some soldiers about their mission . " until now , we only knew of stories like this from war books , " merkel said after listening to soldiers describing a heated four-day offensive against taliban militants in the volatile char darah district last month .
" the reason why i 'm here is to say ' thank you . '
we know what you are doing is an extremely dangerous undertaking . " soldier 's death casts pall shortly before merkel arrived in kunduz , a 21-year-old german soldier died in an emergency operation .
medical personnel were operating after the soldier was discovered with a severe gunshot wound at an outpost in baghlan province .
the details behind the incident are unclear , but a military spokesman at bundeswehr headquarters in potsdam said the man was not injured in a combat situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has now lost 45 soldiers in afghanistan in total , 45 german troops have now lost their lives in afghanistan - 27 of them in combat .
eight german soldiers have been killed in the field in 2010 , making it the bloodiest year of the bundeswehr 's mission to afghanistan , where it is part of nato 's international security assistance force . the afghan mission is becoming increasingly unpopular in germany , with most opinion polls showing that the majority of people oppose the bundeswehr 's presence there .
opposition political parties are also ramping up pressure on merkel 's government to commit more firmly to their current plan to start gradually withdrawing soldiers starting at the end of 2011 . withdrawal plans however , the security situation on the ground - if anything - is deteriorating , as the nature of the chancellor 's visit on saturday showed . on her last trip to afghanistan in april 2009 , merkel visited the german bases in kunduz and masar-i-sharif , and she also went to a field hospital and a police training center . this time , merkel is confined to barracks ; having flown in with heavy security , she is not planning any trips beyond the confines of the kunduz base because of security concerns . bildunterschrift : this was a rare chance for merkel to discuss the afghan mission with the people executing it as merkel , guttenberg and the rest of the government try to find a balance between meeting the demands of a war-weary populace and fulfilling their pledges in afghanistan , military leaders have been calling on western governments not to think in terms of " theoretical and inflexible timetables . " " if , as a firefighter , you were fighting a blaze in a high-rise building , you 'd never say to yourself : ' ok , my shift finishes at 7 - whether it 's still burning or not , " ' isaf spokesman josef blotz said in a recent interview with the dpa news agency .
" and even once you 've put the fire out , you 'd station a guard at the site to make sure the flames do n't rekindle . " german foreign minister guido westerwelle reiterated the plan to begin a troop withdrawal in 2011 in his address to parliament in berlin on thursday - in one of the government 's clearest statements so far on the issue .
however , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg - who said nothing in those discussions - had advised against setting too many fixed dates for winding down the mission . guttenberg also travelled to kunduz with merkel on saturday , days after his latest , somewhat controversial trip to the country .
the defense minister went to the kundus and masar-i-sharif bases on monday , travelling with his wife and a television chat show host - a trip the opposition lambasted as a pr stunt .

activities drew people from around the world to the former coal-mining region . the ruhr2010 culture capital program went out with a bang on saturday , with fireworks , breakdancers , and brass bands performing in four cities of the ruhr valley region . it was an event of superlatives - the ruhr2010 culture capital year kicked off in january with a fulminant , televised opening show outside , despite a major snow storm and well-below freezing temperatures .
the spectacle demonstrated the ruhr valley 's aim of changing its face from being a region that produced coal to one that produces culture that goes beyond mining museums . ruhr2010 continued to impress throughout the year - drawing over 10 million visitors , offering 5,500 events and tallying up costs of around 60 million euros -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- for cultural events . closing down the highway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the major a40 highway was closed down during one event major events have marked the program highlights .
one such event , " shaft signs , " saw over 300 gigantic yellow balloons hovering 80 meters -lrb- 262 feet -rrb- above the ground for a week , marking the location of former coalmine shafts .
thousands of people visited the places to learn more about the history of the coal-mining region . another major attraction was " stilllife a40 , " in which part of the ruhr 's main traffic artery - the a40 highway- was vacated of cars for an entire day .
visitors were invited to stage their own performance or party along the 60-kilometer stretch of highway .
they showcased their best in poetry , song , dance or story-telling . the " ! sing - day of song " event saw the ruhr region transformed into a metropolis of choirs - with over 600 concerts , in which thousands of singers and visitors were invited to sing along . small but mighty there were also other , smaller events , such as the " twins " project .
" one hundred sister-city partnerships were created in which intense exchanges took place , " noted oliver scheytt , managing director of the ruhr2010 company .
" look at the group of young people from nizhny novgorod , russia and essen , who hooked up and turned letters from a soldier on the war front in 1942 into a theater project . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruhr museum displays the area 's coalmining history like " twins , " all of the projects of the culture capital year have delved into the identity of the ruhr valley and its inhabitants .
but the colorful cultural program of ruhr2010 has also been successful in going beyond its borders , said thomas laue , head dramatic adviser at bochum 's schauspielhaus theater . " this ruhr2010 year has really grabbed major attention to this region , " he said .
" the culture capital year has heightened awareness among the residents for the area where they live , but i think it 's pepped up the image and importance of the ruhr valley in the minds of people beyond here . " tapping young people 's potential in cooperation with other theaters , laue organized a project aimed at the future called " the next generation . " " we worked with young people to establish nine ' houses of the future ' in very diverse districts in duisburg , essen , bochum and herne , " he explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the " shaft sign " locations " we asked them how they envisioned a place where they would want to live in the future based on how and where they were currently living , " laue added .
" we asked them what their wishes , dreams , and aspirations were and what made them feel desperate .
how should this future place be designed ? " the young people searched for answers to those questions together , with their work turned into a theater piece that premiered in october .
it is now a part of the bochum schauspielhaus program . if left up to ruhr2010 organizers , this year 's experiences should continue to inspire cultural events and projects in the future .
dieter gorny , creator of the music fair popkom and former ceo of the music channel viva , is artistic director of the theme area of creative economy at ruhr2010 .
originally hailing from essen in the ruhr region , his aim - also as a cultural and media studies teacher - is to promote creativity both in economic sectors , as well as in the ruhr metropolitan areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : creative mind dieter gorny he said he wants to tap into branches of the economy that have been overlooked by common business development plans .
part of his project consists of creating spaces where designers and musicians can work productively in his " city of creativity . " " one can certainly say that we have pointed to the fact that these creative areas have already existed - we have just made people more aware of them , " gorny said . a look to the future future cultural projects and expansion of cultural networks , of course , cost money , managing director scheytt noted . " we are discussing ways of securing permanent funding for the culture capital program , and the state of north rhine-westfalia is considering whether it will contribute , " he said . despite all of the " positives " of this year 's ruhr2010 culture capital activities , a cloud still hangs over the project : the mass panic tragedy that claimed the lives of 21 people and injured around 500 others during the love parade music festival in duisburg in july .

activities drew people from around the world to the former coal-mining region . the ruhr2010 culture capital program went out with a bang on saturday , with fireworks , breakdancers , and brass bands performing in four cities of the ruhr valley region . it was an event of superlatives - the ruhr2010 culture capital year kicked off in january with a fulminant , televised opening show outside , despite a major snow storm and well-below freezing temperatures .
the spectacle demonstrated the ruhr valley 's aim of changing its face from being a region that produced coal to one that produces culture that goes beyond mining museums . ruhr2010 continued to impress throughout the year - drawing over 10 million visitors , offering 5,500 events and tallying up costs of around 60 million euros -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- for cultural events . closing down the highway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the major a40 highway was closed down during one event major events have marked the program highlights .
one such event , " shaft signs , " saw over 300 gigantic yellow balloons hovering 80 meters -lrb- 262 feet -rrb- above the ground for a week , marking the location of former coalmine shafts .
thousands of people visited the places to learn more about the history of the coal-mining region . another major attraction was " stilllife a40 , " in which part of the ruhr 's main traffic artery - the a40 highway- was vacated of cars for an entire day .
visitors were invited to stage their own performance or party along the 60-kilometer stretch of highway .
they showcased their best in poetry , song , dance or story-telling . the " ! sing - day of song " event saw the ruhr region transformed into a metropolis of choirs - with over 600 concerts , in which thousands of singers and visitors were invited to sing along . small but mighty there were also other , smaller events , such as the " twins " project .
" one hundred sister-city partnerships were created in which intense exchanges took place , " noted oliver scheytt , managing director of the ruhr2010 company .
" look at the group of young people from nizhny novgorod , russia and essen , who hooked up and turned letters from a soldier on the war front in 1942 into a theater project . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruhr museum displays the area 's coalmining history like " twins , " all of the projects of the culture capital year have delved into the identity of the ruhr valley and its inhabitants .
but the colorful cultural program of ruhr2010 has also been successful in going beyond its borders , said thomas laue , head dramatic adviser at bochum 's schauspielhaus theater . " this ruhr2010 year has really grabbed major attention to this region , " he said .
" the culture capital year has heightened awareness among the residents for the area where they live , but i think it 's pepped up the image and importance of the ruhr valley in the minds of people beyond here . " tapping young people 's potential in cooperation with other theaters , laue organized a project aimed at the future called " the next generation . " " we worked with young people to establish nine ' houses of the future ' in very diverse districts in duisburg , essen , bochum and herne , " he explained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the " shaft sign " locations " we asked them how they envisioned a place where they would want to live in the future based on how and where they were currently living , " laue added .
" we asked them what their wishes , dreams , and aspirations were and what made them feel desperate .
how should this future place be designed ? " the young people searched for answers to those questions together , with their work turned into a theater piece that premiered in october .
it is now a part of the bochum schauspielhaus program . if left up to ruhr2010 organizers , this year 's experiences should continue to inspire cultural events and projects in the future .
dieter gorny , creator of the music fair popkom and former ceo of the music channel viva , is artistic director of the theme area of creative economy at ruhr2010 .
originally hailing from essen in the ruhr region , his aim - also as a cultural and media studies teacher - is to promote creativity both in economic sectors , as well as in the ruhr metropolitan areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : creative mind dieter gorny he said he wants to tap into branches of the economy that have been overlooked by common business development plans .
part of his project consists of creating spaces where designers and musicians can work productively in his " city of creativity . " " one can certainly say that we have pointed to the fact that these creative areas have already existed - we have just made people more aware of them , " gorny said . a look to the future future cultural projects and expansion of cultural networks , of course , cost money , managing director scheytt noted . " we are discussing ways of securing permanent funding for the culture capital program , and the state of north rhine-westfalia is considering whether it will contribute , " he said . despite all of the " positives " of this year 's ruhr2010 culture capital activities , a cloud still hangs over the project : the mass panic tragedy that claimed the lives of 21 people and injured around 500 others during the love parade music festival in duisburg in july .
