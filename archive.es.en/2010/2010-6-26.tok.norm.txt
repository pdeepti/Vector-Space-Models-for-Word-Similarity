the capital of somalia is a microcosm of the countless conflicts that have been plaguing the failed east african state for decades , leading to hundreds of thousands of somalis starving to death and countless others being killed .
the western-backed transitional government has been teetering on the edge of collapse for years under the weight of continued attacks by the al qaeda-linked al shabab militia and fellow islamist militant group hizbul islam .
the two groups control much of central and southern somalia , leaving only a few small parts of the capital under government rule , protected by the somali military , its ahlu sunna waljama militia and african union peacekeepers .
the islamist insurgent groups battle government troops , pro-government militia and even each other in a never-ending struggle for control of a country which has n't had an effective government since 1991 .
even in government-controlled areas , the battles rage .
troops loyal to somalia 's government fight within their ranks for scraps of power on the capital 's scarred streets .
they have even engaged in gun fights with their own police forces as corruption and organized crime eats away at the fragile state security systems in place , playing into the hands of the radical islamist insurgents who aim to take control of the whole country .
meanwhile , to compound the problems , pirates continue to operate off the somali coast .
in the midst of all the chaos , the inter-clan fighting and religious battles , the somali government is accused of deploying child soldiers , some as young as 12 , with assault rifles to protect its interests in mogadishu .
somali use of child soldiers reveals concerns over us aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia 's use of child soldiers has raised un concern a united nations security council report into somalia 's " persistent violations " in the use of child soldiers has not only heightened the international community 's deep concern at the continuing practice in african wars and the state of near-constant war in somalia but has also turned the spotlight on the involvement of the united states in the fight for control .
washington has been the main source of western aid for the transitional government since it came to power three years ago and has pumped millions of dollars into the somali military for weapons and soldiers ' salaries .
last year alone , the us government provided somalia with some 40 tonnes of arms and ammunition .
somalia is also expected to benefit from the obama administration 's 2011 budget request for security assistance programmes in africa which includes $ 38 million -lrb- 30.9 million euros -rrb- for arms sales to african states , $ 21 million for training african officers and $ 24 million for anti-terrorism programmes .
there is some concern that by supporting the somali government , washington has violated a number of international human rights laws and laws against the use of child soldiers .
while it has yet to be proved that the us has actually contravened these laws , they have been complying with other un restrictions , albeit with a certain amount of creativity of interpretation , which allow arms sales to somalia .
" the arms embargo which was put in place in 1992 was amended by the un in 2006 to allow arms to be sold to the transitional government , " david hartwell , an expert at jane 's defense , told deutsche welle .
" the international community has no other choice but to support the somali government and the americans have exploited this to sell arms via the ethiopians and the ugandan peacekeepers , who have bought weapons on behalf of the us and billed washington . "
hartwell says that the americans are n't the only ones providing weapons .
" on the other side we have eritrea which is arming the militants , " he added .
" the eritreans have been complaining about double standards because they are seen as breaking the embargo because they 're not supplying the somali government and yet the us and ethiopia , which is fighting a proxy war against eritrea in somalia , are flooding the country with weapons . "

even in government-controlled areas , the battles rage .
troops loyal to somalia 's government fight within their ranks for scraps of power on the capital 's scarred streets .
they have even engaged in gun fights with their own police forces as corruption and organized crime eats away at the fragile state security systems in place , playing into the hands of the radical islamist insurgents who aim to take control of the whole country .
meanwhile , to compound the problems , pirates continue to operate off the somali coast .
in the midst of all the chaos , the inter-clan fighting and religious battles , the somali government is accused of deploying child soldiers , some as young as 12 , with assault rifles to protect its interests in mogadishu .
somali use of child soldiers reveals concerns over us aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia 's use of child soldiers has raised un concern a united nations security council report into somalia 's " persistent violations " in the use of child soldiers has not only heightened the international community 's deep concern at the continuing practice in african wars and the state of near-constant war in somalia but has also turned the spotlight on the involvement of the united states in the fight for control .
washington has been the main source of western aid for the transitional government since it came to power three years ago and has pumped millions of dollars into the somali military for weapons and soldiers ' salaries .
last year alone , the us government provided somalia with some 40 tonnes of arms and ammunition .
somalia is also expected to benefit from the obama administration 's 2011 budget request for security assistance programmes in africa which includes $ 38 million -lrb- 30.9 million euros -rrb- for arms sales to african states , $ 21 million for training african officers and $ 24 million for anti-terrorism programmes .
there is some concern that by supporting the somali government , washington has violated a number of international human rights laws and laws against the use of child soldiers .
while it has yet to be proved that the us has actually contravened these laws , they have been complying with other un restrictions , albeit with a certain amount of creativity of interpretation , which allow arms sales to somalia .
" the arms embargo which was put in place in 1992 was amended by the un in 2006 to allow arms to be sold to the transitional government , " david hartwell , an expert at jane 's defense , told deutsche welle .
" the international community has no other choice but to support the somali government and the americans have exploited this to sell arms via the ethiopians and the ugandan peacekeepers , who have bought weapons on behalf of the us and billed washington . "
hartwell says that the americans are n't the only ones providing weapons .
" on the other side we have eritrea which is arming the militants , " he added .
" the eritreans have been complaining about double standards because they are seen as breaking the embargo because they 're not supplying the somali government and yet the us and ethiopia , which is fighting a proxy war against eritrea in somalia , are flooding the country with weapons . "

us involvement in somalia has a long history going back to august 1992 when its troops were deployed as part of operation restore hope to prevent mass starvation in somalia .
however , once the initial crisis seemed to be over , the un took control of relief operations leaving a small us logistical , aviation , and quick reaction force behind .
soon the us forces became involved in somalia 's inter-clan power struggles which eventually led to american soldiers being killed or wounded in fierce fighting in the streets of mogadishu .
one of the most psychologically damaging events of the ill-fated campaign took place in early october 1993 when news reports showed dead us soldiers being dragged through the streets by cheering somali mobs .
all un and us personnel were finally withdrawn almost a year later in march 1995 .
as far as the american people were concerned , that was the end of us involvement in somalia .
" the us got a bloody nose in the restore hope debacle , " david hartwell said .
" it was initially very wary of getting involved in somalia again .
but then 9/11 happened and the us started to see somalia through the prism of al qaeda and islamic extremism .
the insurgents also began to see themselves through this prism so there was a development on both sides where they felt they had to confront each other . "
covert operations signal a us return to somalia last year it was reported that a us special operations raid in somalia had killed the alleged head of al qaeda in east africa .
there were also reports that the us had backed ethiopia with military and logistical aid in its 2006 invasion of somalia aimed at eradicating the islamist threat .
a report in the new york times earlier this year revealed that the united states - through its africom command center in nearby djibouti - had begun a new operation in march in support of the transitional government in somalia , the justification being the fight against islamic extremism . " over the past year and a half the us has provided some arms , ammunition , and cash to the transitional somali government , " ej hogendoorn , the director of the horn of africa project at the international crisis group think tank in nairobi , told deutsche welle .

both are alleged to have played a role in terrorist attacks against us targets . " " the us has had a focus on the region for some time in the context of its strategy to stop the spread of islamic extremism , " said david hartwell . " but it knows that the situation in somalia is very fluid .

the capital of somalia is a microcosm of the countless conflicts that have been plaguing the failed east african state for decades , leading to hundreds of thousands of somalis starving to death and countless others being killed .
the western-backed transitional government has been teetering on the edge of collapse for years under the weight of continued attacks by the al qaeda-linked al shabab militia and fellow islamist militant group hizbul islam .
the two groups control much of central and southern somalia , leaving only a few small parts of the capital under government rule , protected by the somali military , its ahlu sunna waljama militia and african union peacekeepers .
the islamist insurgent groups battle government troops , pro-government militia and even each other in a never-ending struggle for control of a country which has n't had an effective government since 1991 .

somalia is also expected to benefit from the obama administration 's 2011 budget request for security assistance programmes in africa which includes $ 38 million -lrb- 30.9 million euros -rrb- for arms sales to african states , $ 21 million for training african officers and $ 24 million for anti-terrorism programmes .
there is some concern that by supporting the somali government , washington has violated a number of international human rights laws and laws against the use of child soldiers .
while it has yet to be proved that the us has actually contravened these laws , they have been complying with other un restrictions , albeit with a certain amount of creativity of interpretation , which allow arms sales to somalia .
" the arms embargo which was put in place in 1992 was amended by the un in 2006 to allow arms to be sold to the transitional government , " david hartwell , an expert at jane 's defense , told deutsche welle .
" the international community has no other choice but to support the somali government and the americans have exploited this to sell arms via the ethiopians and the ugandan peacekeepers , who have bought weapons on behalf of the us and billed washington . "
hartwell says that the americans are n't the only ones providing weapons .
" on the other side we have eritrea which is arming the militants , " he added .
" the eritreans have been complaining about double standards because they are seen as breaking the embargo because they 're not supplying the somali government and yet the us and ethiopia , which is fighting a proxy war against eritrea in somalia , are flooding the country with weapons . "

the capital of somalia is a microcosm of the countless conflicts that have been plaguing the failed east african state for decades , leading to hundreds of thousands of somalis starving to death and countless others being killed .
the western-backed transitional government has been teetering on the edge of collapse for years under the weight of continued attacks by the al qaeda-linked al shabab militia and fellow islamist militant group hizbul islam .
the two groups control much of central and southern somalia , leaving only a few small parts of the capital under government rule , protected by the somali military , its ahlu sunna waljama militia and african union peacekeepers .
the islamist insurgent groups battle government troops , pro-government militia and even each other in a never-ending struggle for control of a country which has n't had an effective government since 1991 .
even in government-controlled areas , the battles rage .
troops loyal to somalia 's government fight within their ranks for scraps of power on the capital 's scarred streets .
they have even engaged in gun fights with their own police forces as corruption and organized crime eats away at the fragile state security systems in place , playing into the hands of the radical islamist insurgents who aim to take control of the whole country .
meanwhile , to compound the problems , pirates continue to operate off the somali coast .
in the midst of all the chaos , the inter-clan fighting and religious battles , the somali government is accused of deploying child soldiers , some as young as 12 , with assault rifles to protect its interests in mogadishu .

the capital of somalia is a microcosm of the countless conflicts that have been plaguing the failed east african state for decades , leading to hundreds of thousands of somalis starving to death and countless others being killed .
the western-backed transitional government has been teetering on the edge of collapse for years under the weight of continued attacks by the al qaeda-linked al shabab militia and fellow islamist militant group hizbul islam .
the two groups control much of central and southern somalia , leaving only a few small parts of the capital under government rule , protected by the somali military , its ahlu sunna waljama militia and african union peacekeepers .
the islamist insurgent groups battle government troops , pro-government militia and even each other in a never-ending struggle for control of a country which has n't had an effective government since 1991 .
even in government-controlled areas , the battles rage .
troops loyal to somalia 's government fight within their ranks for scraps of power on the capital 's scarred streets .
they have even engaged in gun fights with their own police forces as corruption and organized crime eats away at the fragile state security systems in place , playing into the hands of the radical islamist insurgents who aim to take control of the whole country .
meanwhile , to compound the problems , pirates continue to operate off the somali coast .
in the midst of all the chaos , the inter-clan fighting and religious battles , the somali government is accused of deploying child soldiers , some as young as 12 , with assault rifles to protect its interests in mogadishu .
somali use of child soldiers reveals concerns over us aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia 's use of child soldiers has raised un concern a united nations security council report into somalia 's " persistent violations " in the use of child soldiers has not only heightened the international community 's deep concern at the continuing practice in african wars and the state of near-constant war in somalia but has also turned the spotlight on the involvement of the united states in the fight for control .
washington has been the main source of western aid for the transitional government since it came to power three years ago and has pumped millions of dollars into the somali military for weapons and soldiers ' salaries .
last year alone , the us government provided somalia with some 40 tonnes of arms and ammunition .
somalia is also expected to benefit from the obama administration 's 2011 budget request for security assistance programmes in africa which includes $ 38 million -lrb- 30.9 million euros -rrb- for arms sales to african states , $ 21 million for training african officers and $ 24 million for anti-terrorism programmes .
there is some concern that by supporting the somali government , washington has violated a number of international human rights laws and laws against the use of child soldiers .
while it has yet to be proved that the us has actually contravened these laws , they have been complying with other un restrictions , albeit with a certain amount of creativity of interpretation , which allow arms sales to somalia .
" the arms embargo which was put in place in 1992 was amended by the un in 2006 to allow arms to be sold to the transitional government , " david hartwell , an expert at jane 's defense , told deutsche welle .
" the international community has no other choice but to support the somali government and the americans have exploited this to sell arms via the ethiopians and the ugandan peacekeepers , who have bought weapons on behalf of the us and billed washington . "
hartwell says that the americans are n't the only ones providing weapons .
" on the other side we have eritrea which is arming the militants , " he added .
" the eritreans have been complaining about double standards because they are seen as breaking the embargo because they 're not supplying the somali government and yet the us and ethiopia , which is fighting a proxy war against eritrea in somalia , are flooding the country with weapons . "

us involvement in somalia has a long history going back to august 1992 when its troops were deployed as part of operation restore hope to prevent mass starvation in somalia .
however , once the initial crisis seemed to be over , the un took control of relief operations leaving a small us logistical , aviation , and quick reaction force behind .
soon the us forces became involved in somalia 's inter-clan power struggles which eventually led to american soldiers being killed or wounded in fierce fighting in the streets of mogadishu .
one of the most psychologically damaging events of the ill-fated campaign took place in early october 1993 when news reports showed dead us soldiers being dragged through the streets by cheering somali mobs .
all un and us personnel were finally withdrawn almost a year later in march 1995 .
as far as the american people were concerned , that was the end of us involvement in somalia .
" the us got a bloody nose in the restore hope debacle , " david hartwell said .
" it was initially very wary of getting involved in somalia again .
but then 9/11 happened and the us started to see somalia through the prism of al qaeda and islamic extremism .
the insurgents also began to see themselves through this prism so there was a development on both sides where they felt they had to confront each other . "
covert operations signal a us return to somalia last year it was reported that a us special operations raid in somalia had killed the alleged head of al qaeda in east africa .
there were also reports that the us had backed ethiopia with military and logistical aid in its 2006 invasion of somalia aimed at eradicating the islamist threat .
a report in the new york times earlier this year revealed that the united states - through its africom command center in nearby djibouti - had begun a new operation in march in support of the transitional government in somalia , the justification being the fight against islamic extremism . " over the past year and a half the us has provided some arms , ammunition , and cash to the transitional somali government , " ej hogendoorn , the director of the horn of africa project at the international crisis group think tank in nairobi , told deutsche welle .
" it is also providing transport to government units being trained abroad .
there are also allegations that it provides some intelligence support and training . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda suspect saleh ali saleh nabhan was killed by us troops in somalia " the only recent covert operations i am aware of are the well-documented killings of saleh ali nabhan , a kenyan sought in the 2002 bombing of an israeli-owned resort in kenya , and al-shabab military commander aden hashi ayro who reportedly trained with al qaeda in afghanistan before 2001 .
both are alleged to have played a role in terrorist attacks against us targets . " " the us has had a focus on the region for some time in the context of its strategy to stop the spread of islamic extremism , " said david hartwell . " but it knows that the situation in somalia is very fluid .
it may be al qaeda this month but it could be a nationalist civil war the next .
what it has to do is support the government as best it can .
this is difficult because it controls so little of mogadishu and the troops it trains are easily bought and turned .
if the us really wants a secure somalia , it will have to step up its efforts and change its approach . " reports suggest that this change in approach is already underway .
us military advisors have allegedly been training somali forces and intelligence officers in the fight against the islamists , and providing logistical , surveillance and material support .
one anonymous us source told the paper that the us was also prepared to launch its own air strikes and more special forces raids on the ground in somalia in support of the government . " the us has been indirectly involved through the ethiopians and also through - highly unconfirmed - covert special forces operations within somalia , targeting al qaeda operatives , " hartwell added .

us involvement in somalia has a long history going back to august 1992 when its troops were deployed as part of operation restore hope to prevent mass starvation in somalia .
however , once the initial crisis seemed to be over , the un took control of relief operations leaving a small us logistical , aviation , and quick reaction force behind .
soon the us forces became involved in somalia 's inter-clan power struggles which eventually led to american soldiers being killed or wounded in fierce fighting in the streets of mogadishu .
one of the most psychologically damaging events of the ill-fated campaign took place in early october 1993 when news reports showed dead us soldiers being dragged through the streets by cheering somali mobs .
all un and us personnel were finally withdrawn almost a year later in march 1995 .
as far as the american people were concerned , that was the end of us involvement in somalia .
" the us got a bloody nose in the restore hope debacle , " david hartwell said .
" it was initially very wary of getting involved in somalia again .
but then 9/11 happened and the us started to see somalia through the prism of al qaeda and islamic extremism .
the insurgents also began to see themselves through this prism so there was a development on both sides where they felt they had to confront each other . "
covert operations signal a us return to somalia last year it was reported that a us special operations raid in somalia had killed the alleged head of al qaeda in east africa .
there were also reports that the us had backed ethiopia with military and logistical aid in its 2006 invasion of somalia aimed at eradicating the islamist threat .
a report in the new york times earlier this year revealed that the united states - through its africom command center in nearby djibouti - had begun a new operation in march in support of the transitional government in somalia , the justification being the fight against islamic extremism . " over the past year and a half the us has provided some arms , ammunition , and cash to the transitional somali government , " ej hogendoorn , the director of the horn of africa project at the international crisis group think tank in nairobi , told deutsche welle .
" it is also providing transport to government units being trained abroad .
there are also allegations that it provides some intelligence support and training . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda suspect saleh ali saleh nabhan was killed by us troops in somalia " the only recent covert operations i am aware of are the well-documented killings of saleh ali nabhan , a kenyan sought in the 2002 bombing of an israeli-owned resort in kenya , and al-shabab military commander aden hashi ayro who reportedly trained with al qaeda in afghanistan before 2001 .
both are alleged to have played a role in terrorist attacks against us targets . " " the us has had a focus on the region for some time in the context of its strategy to stop the spread of islamic extremism , " said david hartwell . " but it knows that the situation in somalia is very fluid .
it may be al qaeda this month but it could be a nationalist civil war the next .
what it has to do is support the government as best it can .
this is difficult because it controls so little of mogadishu and the troops it trains are easily bought and turned .
if the us really wants a secure somalia , it will have to step up its efforts and change its approach . " reports suggest that this change in approach is already underway .
us military advisors have allegedly been training somali forces and intelligence officers in the fight against the islamists , and providing logistical , surveillance and material support .
one anonymous us source told the paper that the us was also prepared to launch its own air strikes and more special forces raids on the ground in somalia in support of the government . " the us has been indirectly involved through the ethiopians and also through - highly unconfirmed - covert special forces operations within somalia , targeting al qaeda operatives , " hartwell added .
" clearly , with the us command center at djibouti , they certainly have the assets in place to do this in somalia and also in yemen but they 'll never admit to active involvement on the ground .

the capital of somalia is a microcosm of the countless conflicts that have been plaguing the failed east african state for decades , leading to hundreds of thousands of somalis starving to death and countless others being killed .
the western-backed transitional government has been teetering on the edge of collapse for years under the weight of continued attacks by the al qaeda-linked al shabab militia and fellow islamist militant group hizbul islam .
the two groups control much of central and southern somalia , leaving only a few small parts of the capital under government rule , protected by the somali military , its ahlu sunna waljama militia and african union peacekeepers .
the islamist insurgent groups battle government troops , pro-government militia and even each other in a never-ending struggle for control of a country which has n't had an effective government since 1991 .
even in government-controlled areas , the battles rage .
troops loyal to somalia 's government fight within their ranks for scraps of power on the capital 's scarred streets .
they have even engaged in gun fights with their own police forces as corruption and organized crime eats away at the fragile state security systems in place , playing into the hands of the radical islamist insurgents who aim to take control of the whole country .
meanwhile , to compound the problems , pirates continue to operate off the somali coast .
in the midst of all the chaos , the inter-clan fighting and religious battles , the somali government is accused of deploying child soldiers , some as young as 12 , with assault rifles to protect its interests in mogadishu .
somali use of child soldiers reveals concerns over us aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia 's use of child soldiers has raised un concern a united nations security council report into somalia 's " persistent violations " in the use of child soldiers has not only heightened the international community 's deep concern at the continuing practice in african wars and the state of near-constant war in somalia but has also turned the spotlight on the involvement of the united states in the fight for control .
washington has been the main source of western aid for the transitional government since it came to power three years ago and has pumped millions of dollars into the somali military for weapons and soldiers ' salaries .
last year alone , the us government provided somalia with some 40 tonnes of arms and ammunition .
somalia is also expected to benefit from the obama administration 's 2011 budget request for security assistance programmes in africa which includes $ 38 million -lrb- 30.9 million euros -rrb- for arms sales to african states , $ 21 million for training african officers and $ 24 million for anti-terrorism programmes .
there is some concern that by supporting the somali government , washington has violated a number of international human rights laws and laws against the use of child soldiers .
while it has yet to be proved that the us has actually contravened these laws , they have been complying with other un restrictions , albeit with a certain amount of creativity of interpretation , which allow arms sales to somalia .
" the arms embargo which was put in place in 1992 was amended by the un in 2006 to allow arms to be sold to the transitional government , " david hartwell , an expert at jane 's defense , told deutsche welle .
" the international community has no other choice but to support the somali government and the americans have exploited this to sell arms via the ethiopians and the ugandan peacekeepers , who have bought weapons on behalf of the us and billed washington . "
hartwell says that the americans are n't the only ones providing weapons .
" on the other side we have eritrea which is arming the militants , " he added .
" the eritreans have been complaining about double standards because they are seen as breaking the embargo because they 're not supplying the somali government and yet the us and ethiopia , which is fighting a proxy war against eritrea in somalia , are flooding the country with weapons . "

us involvement in somalia has a long history going back to august 1992 when its troops were deployed as part of operation restore hope to prevent mass starvation in somalia .
however , once the initial crisis seemed to be over , the un took control of relief operations leaving a small us logistical , aviation , and quick reaction force behind .
soon the us forces became involved in somalia 's inter-clan power struggles which eventually led to american soldiers being killed or wounded in fierce fighting in the streets of mogadishu .
one of the most psychologically damaging events of the ill-fated campaign took place in early october 1993 when news reports showed dead us soldiers being dragged through the streets by cheering somali mobs .
all un and us personnel were finally withdrawn almost a year later in march 1995 .
as far as the american people were concerned , that was the end of us involvement in somalia .
" the us got a bloody nose in the restore hope debacle , " david hartwell said .
" it was initially very wary of getting involved in somalia again .
but then 9/11 happened and the us started to see somalia through the prism of al qaeda and islamic extremism .

there were also reports that the us had backed ethiopia with military and logistical aid in its 2006 invasion of somalia aimed at eradicating the islamist threat .
a report in the new york times earlier this year revealed that the united states - through its africom command center in nearby djibouti - had begun a new operation in march in support of the transitional government in somalia , the justification being the fight against islamic extremism .

the capital of somalia is a microcosm of the countless conflicts that have been plaguing the failed east african state for decades , leading to hundreds of thousands of somalis starving to death and countless others being killed .
the western-backed transitional government has been teetering on the edge of collapse for years under the weight of continued attacks by the al qaeda-linked al shabab militia and fellow islamist militant group hizbul islam .
the two groups control much of central and southern somalia , leaving only a few small parts of the capital under government rule , protected by the somali military , its ahlu sunna waljama militia and african union peacekeepers .
the islamist insurgent groups battle government troops , pro-government militia and even each other in a never-ending struggle for control of a country which has n't had an effective government since 1991 .
even in government-controlled areas , the battles rage .
troops loyal to somalia 's government fight within their ranks for scraps of power on the capital 's scarred streets .
they have even engaged in gun fights with their own police forces as corruption and organized crime eats away at the fragile state security systems in place , playing into the hands of the radical islamist insurgents who aim to take control of the whole country .
meanwhile , to compound the problems , pirates continue to operate off the somali coast .
in the midst of all the chaos , the inter-clan fighting and religious battles , the somali government is accused of deploying child soldiers , some as young as 12 , with assault rifles to protect its interests in mogadishu .
somali use of child soldiers reveals concerns over us aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia 's use of child soldiers has raised un concern a united nations security council report into somalia 's " persistent violations " in the use of child soldiers has not only heightened the international community 's deep concern at the continuing practice in african wars and the state of near-constant war in somalia but has also turned the spotlight on the involvement of the united states in the fight for control .
washington has been the main source of western aid for the transitional government since it came to power three years ago and has pumped millions of dollars into the somali military for weapons and soldiers ' salaries .
last year alone , the us government provided somalia with some 40 tonnes of arms and ammunition .
somalia is also expected to benefit from the obama administration 's 2011 budget request for security assistance programmes in africa which includes $ 38 million -lrb- 30.9 million euros -rrb- for arms sales to african states , $ 21 million for training african officers and $ 24 million for anti-terrorism programmes .
there is some concern that by supporting the somali government , washington has violated a number of international human rights laws and laws against the use of child soldiers .
while it has yet to be proved that the us has actually contravened these laws , they have been complying with other un restrictions , albeit with a certain amount of creativity of interpretation , which allow arms sales to somalia .
" the arms embargo which was put in place in 1992 was amended by the un in 2006 to allow arms to be sold to the transitional government , " david hartwell , an expert at jane 's defense , told deutsche welle .
" the international community has no other choice but to support the somali government and the americans have exploited this to sell arms via the ethiopians and the ugandan peacekeepers , who have bought weapons on behalf of the us and billed washington . "
hartwell says that the americans are n't the only ones providing weapons .
" on the other side we have eritrea which is arming the militants , " he added .
" the eritreans have been complaining about double standards because they are seen as breaking the embargo because they 're not supplying the somali government and yet the us and ethiopia , which is fighting a proxy war against eritrea in somalia , are flooding the country with weapons . "

the capital of somalia is a microcosm of the countless conflicts that have been plaguing the failed east african state for decades , leading to hundreds of thousands of somalis starving to death and countless others being killed .
the western-backed transitional government has been teetering on the edge of collapse for years under the weight of continued attacks by the al qaeda-linked al shabab militia and fellow islamist militant group hizbul islam .
the two groups control much of central and southern somalia , leaving only a few small parts of the capital under government rule , protected by the somali military , its ahlu sunna waljama militia and african union peacekeepers .
the islamist insurgent groups battle government troops , pro-government militia and even each other in a never-ending struggle for control of a country which has n't had an effective government since 1991 .
even in government-controlled areas , the battles rage .
troops loyal to somalia 's government fight within their ranks for scraps of power on the capital 's scarred streets .
they have even engaged in gun fights with their own police forces as corruption and organized crime eats away at the fragile state security systems in place , playing into the hands of the radical islamist insurgents who aim to take control of the whole country .
meanwhile , to compound the problems , pirates continue to operate off the somali coast .
in the midst of all the chaos , the inter-clan fighting and religious battles , the somali government is accused of deploying child soldiers , some as young as 12 , with assault rifles to protect its interests in mogadishu .
somali use of child soldiers reveals concerns over us aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia 's use of child soldiers has raised un concern a united nations security council report into somalia 's " persistent violations " in the use of child soldiers has not only heightened the international community 's deep concern at the continuing practice in african wars and the state of near-constant war in somalia but has also turned the spotlight on the involvement of the united states in the fight for control .
washington has been the main source of western aid for the transitional government since it came to power three years ago and has pumped millions of dollars into the somali military for weapons and soldiers ' salaries .
last year alone , the us government provided somalia with some 40 tonnes of arms and ammunition .
somalia is also expected to benefit from the obama administration 's 2011 budget request for security assistance programmes in africa which includes $ 38 million -lrb- 30.9 million euros -rrb- for arms sales to african states , $ 21 million for training african officers and $ 24 million for anti-terrorism programmes .
there is some concern that by supporting the somali government , washington has violated a number of international human rights laws and laws against the use of child soldiers .
while it has yet to be proved that the us has actually contravened these laws , they have been complying with other un restrictions , albeit with a certain amount of creativity of interpretation , which allow arms sales to somalia .
" the arms embargo which was put in place in 1992 was amended by the un in 2006 to allow arms to be sold to the transitional government , " david hartwell , an expert at jane 's defense , told deutsche welle .
" the international community has no other choice but to support the somali government and the americans have exploited this to sell arms via the ethiopians and the ugandan peacekeepers , who have bought weapons on behalf of the us and billed washington . "
hartwell says that the americans are n't the only ones providing weapons .
" on the other side we have eritrea which is arming the militants , " he added .
" the eritreans have been complaining about double standards because they are seen as breaking the embargo because they 're not supplying the somali government and yet the us and ethiopia , which is fighting a proxy war against eritrea in somalia , are flooding the country with weapons . "

last year alone , the us government provided somalia with some 40 tonnes of arms and ammunition .
somalia is also expected to benefit from the obama administration 's 2011 budget request for security assistance programmes in africa which includes $ 38 million -lrb- 30.9 million euros -rrb- for arms sales to african states , $ 21 million for training african officers and $ 24 million for anti-terrorism programmes .
there is some concern that by supporting the somali government , washington has violated a number of international human rights laws and laws against the use of child soldiers .
while it has yet to be proved that the us has actually contravened these laws , they have been complying with other un restrictions , albeit with a certain amount of creativity of interpretation , which allow arms sales to somalia .
" the arms embargo which was put in place in 1992 was amended by the un in 2006 to allow arms to be sold to the transitional government , " david hartwell , an expert at jane 's defense , told deutsche welle .
" the international community has no other choice but to support the somali government and the americans have exploited this to sell arms via the ethiopians and the ugandan peacekeepers , who have bought weapons on behalf of the us and billed washington . "
hartwell says that the americans are n't the only ones providing weapons .
" on the other side we have eritrea which is arming the militants , " he added .
" the eritreans have been complaining about double standards because they are seen as breaking the embargo because they 're not supplying the somali government and yet the us and ethiopia , which is fighting a proxy war against eritrea in somalia , are flooding the country with weapons . "

the capital of somalia is a microcosm of the countless conflicts that have been plaguing the failed east african state for decades , leading to hundreds of thousands of somalis starving to death and countless others being killed .
the western-backed transitional government has been teetering on the edge of collapse for years under the weight of continued attacks by the al qaeda-linked al shabab militia and fellow islamist militant group hizbul islam .
the two groups control much of central and southern somalia , leaving only a few small parts of the capital under government rule , protected by the somali military , its ahlu sunna waljama militia and african union peacekeepers .
the islamist insurgent groups battle government troops , pro-government militia and even each other in a never-ending struggle for control of a country which has n't had an effective government since 1991 .
even in government-controlled areas , the battles rage .
troops loyal to somalia 's government fight within their ranks for scraps of power on the capital 's scarred streets .
they have even engaged in gun fights with their own police forces as corruption and organized crime eats away at the fragile state security systems in place , playing into the hands of the radical islamist insurgents who aim to take control of the whole country .
meanwhile , to compound the problems , pirates continue to operate off the somali coast .
in the midst of all the chaos , the inter-clan fighting and religious battles , the somali government is accused of deploying child soldiers , some as young as 12 , with assault rifles to protect its interests in mogadishu .

the capital of somalia is a microcosm of the countless conflicts that have been plaguing the failed east african state for decades , leading to hundreds of thousands of somalis starving to death and countless others being killed .
the western-backed transitional government has been teetering on the edge of collapse for years under the weight of continued attacks by the al qaeda-linked al shabab militia and fellow islamist militant group hizbul islam .
the two groups control much of central and southern somalia , leaving only a few small parts of the capital under government rule , protected by the somali military , its ahlu sunna waljama militia and african union peacekeepers .
the islamist insurgent groups battle government troops , pro-government militia and even each other in a never-ending struggle for control of a country which has n't had an effective government since 1991 .
even in government-controlled areas , the battles rage .
troops loyal to somalia 's government fight within their ranks for scraps of power on the capital 's scarred streets .
they have even engaged in gun fights with their own police forces as corruption and organized crime eats away at the fragile state security systems in place , playing into the hands of the radical islamist insurgents who aim to take control of the whole country .
meanwhile , to compound the problems , pirates continue to operate off the somali coast .
in the midst of all the chaos , the inter-clan fighting and religious battles , the somali government is accused of deploying child soldiers , some as young as 12 , with assault rifles to protect its interests in mogadishu .
somali use of child soldiers reveals concerns over us aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia 's use of child soldiers has raised un concern a united nations security council report into somalia 's " persistent violations " in the use of child soldiers has not only heightened the international community 's deep concern at the continuing practice in african wars and the state of near-constant war in somalia but has also turned the spotlight on the involvement of the united states in the fight for control .
washington has been the main source of western aid for the transitional government since it came to power three years ago and has pumped millions of dollars into the somali military for weapons and soldiers ' salaries .
last year alone , the us government provided somalia with some 40 tonnes of arms and ammunition .
somalia is also expected to benefit from the obama administration 's 2011 budget request for security assistance programmes in africa which includes $ 38 million -lrb- 30.9 million euros -rrb- for arms sales to african states , $ 21 million for training african officers and $ 24 million for anti-terrorism programmes .
there is some concern that by supporting the somali government , washington has violated a number of international human rights laws and laws against the use of child soldiers .
while it has yet to be proved that the us has actually contravened these laws , they have been complying with other un restrictions , albeit with a certain amount of creativity of interpretation , which allow arms sales to somalia .
" the arms embargo which was put in place in 1992 was amended by the un in 2006 to allow arms to be sold to the transitional government , " david hartwell , an expert at jane 's defense , told deutsche welle .
" the international community has no other choice but to support the somali government and the americans have exploited this to sell arms via the ethiopians and the ugandan peacekeepers , who have bought weapons on behalf of the us and billed washington . "
hartwell says that the americans are n't the only ones providing weapons .
" on the other side we have eritrea which is arming the militants , " he added .
" the eritreans have been complaining about double standards because they are seen as breaking the embargo because they 're not supplying the somali government and yet the us and ethiopia , which is fighting a proxy war against eritrea in somalia , are flooding the country with weapons . "

the capital of somalia is a microcosm of the countless conflicts that have been plaguing the failed east african state for decades , leading to hundreds of thousands of somalis starving to death and countless others being killed .
the western-backed transitional government has been teetering on the edge of collapse for years under the weight of continued attacks by the al qaeda-linked al shabab militia and fellow islamist militant group hizbul islam .
the two groups control much of central and southern somalia , leaving only a few small parts of the capital under government rule , protected by the somali military , its ahlu sunna waljama militia and african union peacekeepers .
the islamist insurgent groups battle government troops , pro-government militia and even each other in a never-ending struggle for control of a country which has n't had an effective government since 1991 .
even in government-controlled areas , the battles rage .
troops loyal to somalia 's government fight within their ranks for scraps of power on the capital 's scarred streets .
they have even engaged in gun fights with their own police forces as corruption and organized crime eats away at the fragile state security systems in place , playing into the hands of the radical islamist insurgents who aim to take control of the whole country .
meanwhile , to compound the problems , pirates continue to operate off the somali coast .
in the midst of all the chaos , the inter-clan fighting and religious battles , the somali government is accused of deploying child soldiers , some as young as 12 , with assault rifles to protect its interests in mogadishu .
somali use of child soldiers reveals concerns over us aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia 's use of child soldiers has raised un concern a united nations security council report into somalia 's " persistent violations " in the use of child soldiers has not only heightened the international community 's deep concern at the continuing practice in african wars and the state of near-constant war in somalia but has also turned the spotlight on the involvement of the united states in the fight for control .
washington has been the main source of western aid for the transitional government since it came to power three years ago and has pumped millions of dollars into the somali military for weapons and soldiers ' salaries .
last year alone , the us government provided somalia with some 40 tonnes of arms and ammunition .
somalia is also expected to benefit from the obama administration 's 2011 budget request for security assistance programmes in africa which includes $ 38 million -lrb- 30.9 million euros -rrb- for arms sales to african states , $ 21 million for training african officers and $ 24 million for anti-terrorism programmes .
there is some concern that by supporting the somali government , washington has violated a number of international human rights laws and laws against the use of child soldiers .
while it has yet to be proved that the us has actually contravened these laws , they have been complying with other un restrictions , albeit with a certain amount of creativity of interpretation , which allow arms sales to somalia .
" the arms embargo which was put in place in 1992 was amended by the un in 2006 to allow arms to be sold to the transitional government , " david hartwell , an expert at jane 's defense , told deutsche welle .
" the international community has no other choice but to support the somali government and the americans have exploited this to sell arms via the ethiopians and the ugandan peacekeepers , who have bought weapons on behalf of the us and billed washington . "
hartwell says that the americans are n't the only ones providing weapons .
" on the other side we have eritrea which is arming the militants , " he added .
" the eritreans have been complaining about double standards because they are seen as breaking the embargo because they 're not supplying the somali government and yet the us and ethiopia , which is fighting a proxy war against eritrea in somalia , are flooding the country with weapons . "

us involvement in somalia has a long history going back to august 1992 when its troops were deployed as part of operation restore hope to prevent mass starvation in somalia .
however , once the initial crisis seemed to be over , the un took control of relief operations leaving a small us logistical , aviation , and quick reaction force behind .
soon the us forces became involved in somalia 's inter-clan power struggles which eventually led to american soldiers being killed or wounded in fierce fighting in the streets of mogadishu .
one of the most psychologically damaging events of the ill-fated campaign took place in early october 1993 when news reports showed dead us soldiers being dragged through the streets by cheering somali mobs .
all un and us personnel were finally withdrawn almost a year later in march 1995 .
as far as the american people were concerned , that was the end of us involvement in somalia .
" the us got a bloody nose in the restore hope debacle , " david hartwell said .
" it was initially very wary of getting involved in somalia again .
but then 9/11 happened and the us started to see somalia through the prism of al qaeda and islamic extremism .
the insurgents also began to see themselves through this prism so there was a development on both sides where they felt they had to confront each other . "
covert operations signal a us return to somalia last year it was reported that a us special operations raid in somalia had killed the alleged head of al qaeda in east africa .
there were also reports that the us had backed ethiopia with military and logistical aid in its 2006 invasion of somalia aimed at eradicating the islamist threat .
a report in the new york times earlier this year revealed that the united states - through its africom command center in nearby djibouti - had begun a new operation in march in support of the transitional government in somalia , the justification being the fight against islamic extremism . " over the past year and a half the us has provided some arms , ammunition , and cash to the transitional somali government , " ej hogendoorn , the director of the horn of africa project at the international crisis group think tank in nairobi , told deutsche welle .

both are alleged to have played a role in terrorist attacks against us targets . " " the us has had a focus on the region for some time in the context of its strategy to stop the spread of islamic extremism , " said david hartwell . " but it knows that the situation in somalia is very fluid .
it may be al qaeda this month but it could be a nationalist civil war the next .
what it has to do is support the government as best it can .
this is difficult because it controls so little of mogadishu and the troops it trains are easily bought and turned .

us involvement in somalia has a long history going back to august 1992 when its troops were deployed as part of operation restore hope to prevent mass starvation in somalia .
however , once the initial crisis seemed to be over , the un took control of relief operations leaving a small us logistical , aviation , and quick reaction force behind .
soon the us forces became involved in somalia 's inter-clan power struggles which eventually led to american soldiers being killed or wounded in fierce fighting in the streets of mogadishu .
one of the most psychologically damaging events of the ill-fated campaign took place in early october 1993 when news reports showed dead us soldiers being dragged through the streets by cheering somali mobs .
all un and us personnel were finally withdrawn almost a year later in march 1995 .
as far as the american people were concerned , that was the end of us involvement in somalia .
" the us got a bloody nose in the restore hope debacle , " david hartwell said .
" it was initially very wary of getting involved in somalia again .
but then 9/11 happened and the us started to see somalia through the prism of al qaeda and islamic extremism .
the insurgents also began to see themselves through this prism so there was a development on both sides where they felt they had to confront each other . "
covert operations signal a us return to somalia last year it was reported that a us special operations raid in somalia had killed the alleged head of al qaeda in east africa .
there were also reports that the us had backed ethiopia with military and logistical aid in its 2006 invasion of somalia aimed at eradicating the islamist threat .
a report in the new york times earlier this year revealed that the united states - through its africom command center in nearby djibouti - had begun a new operation in march in support of the transitional government in somalia , the justification being the fight against islamic extremism . " over the past year and a half the us has provided some arms , ammunition , and cash to the transitional somali government , " ej hogendoorn , the director of the horn of africa project at the international crisis group think tank in nairobi , told deutsche welle .
" it is also providing transport to government units being trained abroad .
there are also allegations that it provides some intelligence support and training . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda suspect saleh ali saleh nabhan was killed by us troops in somalia " the only recent covert operations i am aware of are the well-documented killings of saleh ali nabhan , a kenyan sought in the 2002 bombing of an israeli-owned resort in kenya , and al-shabab military commander aden hashi ayro who reportedly trained with al qaeda in afghanistan before 2001 .
both are alleged to have played a role in terrorist attacks against us targets . " " the us has had a focus on the region for some time in the context of its strategy to stop the spread of islamic extremism , " said david hartwell . " but it knows that the situation in somalia is very fluid .
it may be al qaeda this month but it could be a nationalist civil war the next .
what it has to do is support the government as best it can .
this is difficult because it controls so little of mogadishu and the troops it trains are easily bought and turned .
if the us really wants a secure somalia , it will have to step up its efforts and change its approach . " reports suggest that this change in approach is already underway .
us military advisors have allegedly been training somali forces and intelligence officers in the fight against the islamists , and providing logistical , surveillance and material support .
one anonymous us source told the paper that the us was also prepared to launch its own air strikes and more special forces raids on the ground in somalia in support of the government . " the us has been indirectly involved through the ethiopians and also through - highly unconfirmed - covert special forces operations within somalia , targeting al qaeda operatives , " hartwell added .
" clearly , with the us command center at djibouti , they certainly have the assets in place to do this in somalia and also in yemen but they 'll never admit to active involvement on the ground .

the capital of somalia is a microcosm of the countless conflicts that have been plaguing the failed east african state for decades , leading to hundreds of thousands of somalis starving to death and countless others being killed .
the western-backed transitional government has been teetering on the edge of collapse for years under the weight of continued attacks by the al qaeda-linked al shabab militia and fellow islamist militant group hizbul islam .
the two groups control much of central and southern somalia , leaving only a few small parts of the capital under government rule , protected by the somali military , its ahlu sunna waljama militia and african union peacekeepers .
the islamist insurgent groups battle government troops , pro-government militia and even each other in a never-ending struggle for control of a country which has n't had an effective government since 1991 .
even in government-controlled areas , the battles rage .
troops loyal to somalia 's government fight within their ranks for scraps of power on the capital 's scarred streets .
they have even engaged in gun fights with their own police forces as corruption and organized crime eats away at the fragile state security systems in place , playing into the hands of the radical islamist insurgents who aim to take control of the whole country .
meanwhile , to compound the problems , pirates continue to operate off the somali coast .
in the midst of all the chaos , the inter-clan fighting and religious battles , the somali government is accused of deploying child soldiers , some as young as 12 , with assault rifles to protect its interests in mogadishu .
somali use of child soldiers reveals concerns over us aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia 's use of child soldiers has raised un concern a united nations security council report into somalia 's " persistent violations " in the use of child soldiers has not only heightened the international community 's deep concern at the continuing practice in african wars and the state of near-constant war in somalia but has also turned the spotlight on the involvement of the united states in the fight for control .
washington has been the main source of western aid for the transitional government since it came to power three years ago and has pumped millions of dollars into the somali military for weapons and soldiers ' salaries .
last year alone , the us government provided somalia with some 40 tonnes of arms and ammunition .
somalia is also expected to benefit from the obama administration 's 2011 budget request for security assistance programmes in africa which includes $ 38 million -lrb- 30.9 million euros -rrb- for arms sales to african states , $ 21 million for training african officers and $ 24 million for anti-terrorism programmes .
there is some concern that by supporting the somali government , washington has violated a number of international human rights laws and laws against the use of child soldiers .
while it has yet to be proved that the us has actually contravened these laws , they have been complying with other un restrictions , albeit with a certain amount of creativity of interpretation , which allow arms sales to somalia .
" the arms embargo which was put in place in 1992 was amended by the un in 2006 to allow arms to be sold to the transitional government , " david hartwell , an expert at jane 's defense , told deutsche welle .
" the international community has no other choice but to support the somali government and the americans have exploited this to sell arms via the ethiopians and the ugandan peacekeepers , who have bought weapons on behalf of the us and billed washington . "
hartwell says that the americans are n't the only ones providing weapons .
" on the other side we have eritrea which is arming the militants , " he added .
" the eritreans have been complaining about double standards because they are seen as breaking the embargo because they 're not supplying the somali government and yet the us and ethiopia , which is fighting a proxy war against eritrea in somalia , are flooding the country with weapons . "

the capital of somalia is a microcosm of the countless conflicts that have been plaguing the failed east african state for decades , leading to hundreds of thousands of somalis starving to death and countless others being killed .
the western-backed transitional government has been teetering on the edge of collapse for years under the weight of continued attacks by the al qaeda-linked al shabab militia and fellow islamist militant group hizbul islam .
the two groups control much of central and southern somalia , leaving only a few small parts of the capital under government rule , protected by the somali military , its ahlu sunna waljama militia and african union peacekeepers .
the islamist insurgent groups battle government troops , pro-government militia and even each other in a never-ending struggle for control of a country which has n't had an effective government since 1991 .
even in government-controlled areas , the battles rage .
troops loyal to somalia 's government fight within their ranks for scraps of power on the capital 's scarred streets .
they have even engaged in gun fights with their own police forces as corruption and organized crime eats away at the fragile state security systems in place , playing into the hands of the radical islamist insurgents who aim to take control of the whole country .
meanwhile , to compound the problems , pirates continue to operate off the somali coast .
in the midst of all the chaos , the inter-clan fighting and religious battles , the somali government is accused of deploying child soldiers , some as young as 12 , with assault rifles to protect its interests in mogadishu .
somali use of child soldiers reveals concerns over us aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia 's use of child soldiers has raised un concern a united nations security council report into somalia 's " persistent violations " in the use of child soldiers has not only heightened the international community 's deep concern at the continuing practice in african wars and the state of near-constant war in somalia but has also turned the spotlight on the involvement of the united states in the fight for control .
washington has been the main source of western aid for the transitional government since it came to power three years ago and has pumped millions of dollars into the somali military for weapons and soldiers ' salaries .
last year alone , the us government provided somalia with some 40 tonnes of arms and ammunition .
somalia is also expected to benefit from the obama administration 's 2011 budget request for security assistance programmes in africa which includes $ 38 million -lrb- 30.9 million euros -rrb- for arms sales to african states , $ 21 million for training african officers and $ 24 million for anti-terrorism programmes .
there is some concern that by supporting the somali government , washington has violated a number of international human rights laws and laws against the use of child soldiers .
while it has yet to be proved that the us has actually contravened these laws , they have been complying with other un restrictions , albeit with a certain amount of creativity of interpretation , which allow arms sales to somalia .
" the arms embargo which was put in place in 1992 was amended by the un in 2006 to allow arms to be sold to the transitional government , " david hartwell , an expert at jane 's defense , told deutsche welle .
" the international community has no other choice but to support the somali government and the americans have exploited this to sell arms via the ethiopians and the ugandan peacekeepers , who have bought weapons on behalf of the us and billed washington . "
hartwell says that the americans are n't the only ones providing weapons .
" on the other side we have eritrea which is arming the militants , " he added .
" the eritreans have been complaining about double standards because they are seen as breaking the embargo because they 're not supplying the somali government and yet the us and ethiopia , which is fighting a proxy war against eritrea in somalia , are flooding the country with weapons . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 26.06.2010 us support for somali government raises questions over military aid back to first page back 2/2 memories of damaging us losses in mogadishu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us relief forces were drawn into bloody fighting in mogadishu while this information will dismay the american public , the fact that the united states is again actively involved in somalia may also come as a shock , especially considering what happened the last time the us was publicly acknowledged as having a role there .
us involvement in somalia has a long history going back to august 1992 when its troops were deployed as part of operation restore hope to prevent mass starvation in somalia .
however , once the initial crisis seemed to be over , the un took control of relief operations leaving a small us logistical , aviation , and quick reaction force behind .
soon the us forces became involved in somalia 's inter-clan power struggles which eventually led to american soldiers being killed or wounded in fierce fighting in the streets of mogadishu .
one of the most psychologically damaging events of the ill-fated campaign took place in early october 1993 when news reports showed dead us soldiers being dragged through the streets by cheering somali mobs .
all un and us personnel were finally withdrawn almost a year later in march 1995 .
as far as the american people were concerned , that was the end of us involvement in somalia .
" the us got a bloody nose in the restore hope debacle , " david hartwell said .
" it was initially very wary of getting involved in somalia again .
but then 9/11 happened and the us started to see somalia through the prism of al qaeda and islamic extremism .
the insurgents also began to see themselves through this prism so there was a development on both sides where they felt they had to confront each other . "
covert operations signal a us return to somalia last year it was reported that a us special operations raid in somalia had killed the alleged head of al qaeda in east africa .
there were also reports that the us had backed ethiopia with military and logistical aid in its 2006 invasion of somalia aimed at eradicating the islamist threat .
a report in the new york times earlier this year revealed that the united states - through its africom command center in nearby djibouti - had begun a new operation in march in support of the transitional government in somalia , the justification being the fight against islamic extremism . " over the past year and a half the us has provided some arms , ammunition , and cash to the transitional somali government , " ej hogendoorn , the director of the horn of africa project at the international crisis group think tank in nairobi , told deutsche welle .
" it is also providing transport to government units being trained abroad .
there are also allegations that it provides some intelligence support and training . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda suspect saleh ali saleh nabhan was killed by us troops in somalia " the only recent covert operations i am aware of are the well-documented killings of saleh ali nabhan , a kenyan sought in the 2002 bombing of an israeli-owned resort in kenya , and al-shabab military commander aden hashi ayro who reportedly trained with al qaeda in afghanistan before 2001 .
both are alleged to have played a role in terrorist attacks against us targets . " " the us has had a focus on the region for some time in the context of its strategy to stop the spread of islamic extremism , " said david hartwell . " but it knows that the situation in somalia is very fluid .
it may be al qaeda this month but it could be a nationalist civil war the next .
what it has to do is support the government as best it can .
this is difficult because it controls so little of mogadishu and the troops it trains are easily bought and turned .
if the us really wants a secure somalia , it will have to step up its efforts and change its approach . " reports suggest that this change in approach is already underway .
us military advisors have allegedly been training somali forces and intelligence officers in the fight against the islamists , and providing logistical , surveillance and material support .
one anonymous us source told the paper that the us was also prepared to launch its own air strikes and more special forces raids on the ground in somalia in support of the government . " the us has been indirectly involved through the ethiopians and also through - highly unconfirmed - covert special forces operations within somalia , targeting al qaeda operatives , " hartwell added .
" clearly , with the us command center at djibouti , they certainly have the assets in place to do this in somalia and also in yemen but they 'll never admit to active involvement on the ground .

the two groups control much of central and southern somalia , leaving only a few small parts of the capital under government rule , protected by the somali military , its ahlu sunna waljama militia and african union peacekeepers .
the islamist insurgent groups battle government troops , pro-government militia and even each other in a never-ending struggle for control of a country which has n't had an effective government since 1991 .
even in government-controlled areas , the battles rage .
troops loyal to somalia 's government fight within their ranks for scraps of power on the capital 's scarred streets .
they have even engaged in gun fights with their own police forces as corruption and organized crime eats away at the fragile state security systems in place , playing into the hands of the radical islamist insurgents who aim to take control of the whole country .
meanwhile , to compound the problems , pirates continue to operate off the somali coast .
in the midst of all the chaos , the inter-clan fighting and religious battles , the somali government is accused of deploying child soldiers , some as young as 12 , with assault rifles to protect its interests in mogadishu .
somali use of child soldiers reveals concerns over us aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia 's use of child soldiers has raised un concern a united nations security council report into somalia 's " persistent violations " in the use of child soldiers has not only heightened the international community 's deep concern at the continuing practice in african wars and the state of near-constant war in somalia but has also turned the spotlight on the involvement of the united states in the fight for control .
washington has been the main source of western aid for the transitional government since it came to power three years ago and has pumped millions of dollars into the somali military for weapons and soldiers ' salaries .
last year alone , the us government provided somalia with some 40 tonnes of arms and ammunition .
somalia is also expected to benefit from the obama administration 's 2011 budget request for security assistance programmes in africa which includes $ 38 million -lrb- 30.9 million euros -rrb- for arms sales to african states , $ 21 million for training african officers and $ 24 million for anti-terrorism programmes .
there is some concern that by supporting the somali government , washington has violated a number of international human rights laws and laws against the use of child soldiers .
while it has yet to be proved that the us has actually contravened these laws , they have been complying with other un restrictions , albeit with a certain amount of creativity of interpretation , which allow arms sales to somalia .
" the arms embargo which was put in place in 1992 was amended by the un in 2006 to allow arms to be sold to the transitional government , " david hartwell , an expert at jane 's defense , told deutsche welle .
" the international community has no other choice but to support the somali government and the americans have exploited this to sell arms via the ethiopians and the ugandan peacekeepers , who have bought weapons on behalf of the us and billed washington . "
hartwell says that the americans are n't the only ones providing weapons .
" on the other side we have eritrea which is arming the militants , " he added .
" the eritreans have been complaining about double standards because they are seen as breaking the embargo because they 're not supplying the somali government and yet the us and ethiopia , which is fighting a proxy war against eritrea in somalia , are flooding the country with weapons . "

us involvement in somalia has a long history going back to august 1992 when its troops were deployed as part of operation restore hope to prevent mass starvation in somalia .
however , once the initial crisis seemed to be over , the un took control of relief operations leaving a small us logistical , aviation , and quick reaction force behind .
soon the us forces became involved in somalia 's inter-clan power struggles which eventually led to american soldiers being killed or wounded in fierce fighting in the streets of mogadishu .
one of the most psychologically damaging events of the ill-fated campaign took place in early october 1993 when news reports showed dead us soldiers being dragged through the streets by cheering somali mobs .
all un and us personnel were finally withdrawn almost a year later in march 1995 .
as far as the american people were concerned , that was the end of us involvement in somalia .
" the us got a bloody nose in the restore hope debacle , " david hartwell said .
" it was initially very wary of getting involved in somalia again .
but then 9/11 happened and the us started to see somalia through the prism of al qaeda and islamic extremism .
the insurgents also began to see themselves through this prism so there was a development on both sides where they felt they had to confront each other . "
covert operations signal a us return to somalia last year it was reported that a us special operations raid in somalia had killed the alleged head of al qaeda in east africa .
there were also reports that the us had backed ethiopia with military and logistical aid in its 2006 invasion of somalia aimed at eradicating the islamist threat .
a report in the new york times earlier this year revealed that the united states - through its africom command center in nearby djibouti - had begun a new operation in march in support of the transitional government in somalia , the justification being the fight against islamic extremism . " over the past year and a half the us has provided some arms , ammunition , and cash to the transitional somali government , " ej hogendoorn , the director of the horn of africa project at the international crisis group think tank in nairobi , told deutsche welle .
" it is also providing transport to government units being trained abroad .
there are also allegations that it provides some intelligence support and training . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda suspect saleh ali saleh nabhan was killed by us troops in somalia " the only recent covert operations i am aware of are the well-documented killings of saleh ali nabhan , a kenyan sought in the 2002 bombing of an israeli-owned resort in kenya , and al-shabab military commander aden hashi ayro who reportedly trained with al qaeda in afghanistan before 2001 .
both are alleged to have played a role in terrorist attacks against us targets . " " the us has had a focus on the region for some time in the context of its strategy to stop the spread of islamic extremism , " said david hartwell . " but it knows that the situation in somalia is very fluid .
it may be al qaeda this month but it could be a nationalist civil war the next .
what it has to do is support the government as best it can .
this is difficult because it controls so little of mogadishu and the troops it trains are easily bought and turned .
if the us really wants a secure somalia , it will have to step up its efforts and change its approach . " reports suggest that this change in approach is already underway .
us military advisors have allegedly been training somali forces and intelligence officers in the fight against the islamists , and providing logistical , surveillance and material support .
one anonymous us source told the paper that the us was also prepared to launch its own air strikes and more special forces raids on the ground in somalia in support of the government . " the us has been indirectly involved through the ethiopians and also through - highly unconfirmed - covert special forces operations within somalia , targeting al qaeda operatives , " hartwell added .
" clearly , with the us command center at djibouti , they certainly have the assets in place to do this in somalia and also in yemen but they 'll never admit to active involvement on the ground .

protestors had hoped to outwit authorities by only revealing the site at the last minute . at least five gay rights activists were roughly arrested and taken to a police car in st. petersburg , russia after taking part in an unsanctioned rally , according to a police spokesman .
some 30 protestors had gathered outside the famous hermitage museum on palace square , shouting slogans such as " equality without compromise , " " homophobia is an illness , " " homophobia - the country 's shame " and " marriage rights without compromises . "
police often violently break up gay rights demonstrations in russia and activists had kept the location of saturday 's rally a secret until the last minute in an attempt to prevent the arrests .

organizers said it was only their " military planning " that prevented further arrests at that rally .
according to local media reports , a small group of anti-gay activists also showed up , attempting to attack the protesters .
at least four of them were also detained .

" i think there is a real opportunity to put the bilateral relations on to a new footing , " cameron said at the group of eight summit in huntsville , canada .
the two leaders met for an hour of bilateral talks on friday on the sidelines of the summit of the world 's leading economies .
they agreed to maintain regular contact and to encourage their foreign ministers to work more closely together .
medvedev agreed there was a new opportunity to set things right .
" we agreed that our bilateral relationship required the personal attention of the leaders of the two countries both in terms of the economy and other issues and we are determined to make them more productive and intense , " he said .
relationship free-fall british-russian relations hit a post-soviet low in 2006 after the fatal poisoning of former russian spy alexander litvinenko in london with a radioactive isotope .
british authorities sought to have russian parliament member andrei lugovol extradited in connection with litvinenko 's death , but moscow refused .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : litvinenko 's death worsened relations between russia and britain britain granted political asylum to some of the kremlin 's enemies and refused to extradite boris berezovsky , a russian billionaire and critic of the russian government .
berezovsky was convicted in absentia of fraud and embezzlement in russia .
the dispute over his extradition led britain to expel russian diplomats , moving russia to follow suit and to shut down two branches of the british council , a cultural and educational organization connected to the british foreign ministry .
the defrosting of uk-russia follows a warm-up between washington and moscow , which agreed last year to a " reset " of their relationship .
last thursday , us presidents barack obama and medvedev met in washington , where they dodged superpower protocol to slip out to one of the us leader 's favorite burger joints .

" i think there is a real opportunity to put the bilateral relations on to a new footing , " cameron said at the group of eight summit in huntsville , canada .
the two leaders met for an hour of bilateral talks on friday on the sidelines of the summit of the world 's leading economies .
they agreed to maintain regular contact and to encourage their foreign ministers to work more closely together .
medvedev agreed there was a new opportunity to set things right .
" we agreed that our bilateral relationship required the personal attention of the leaders of the two countries both in terms of the economy and other issues and we are determined to make them more productive and intense , " he said .
relationship free-fall british-russian relations hit a post-soviet low in 2006 after the fatal poisoning of former russian spy alexander litvinenko in london with a radioactive isotope .
british authorities sought to have russian parliament member andrei lugovol extradited in connection with litvinenko 's death , but moscow refused .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : litvinenko 's death worsened relations between russia and britain britain granted political asylum to some of the kremlin 's enemies and refused to extradite boris berezovsky , a russian billionaire and critic of the russian government .
berezovsky was convicted in absentia of fraud and embezzlement in russia .
the dispute over his extradition led britain to expel russian diplomats , moving russia to follow suit and to shut down two branches of the british council , a cultural and educational organization connected to the british foreign ministry .
the defrosting of uk-russia follows a warm-up between washington and moscow , which agreed last year to a " reset " of their relationship .
last thursday , us presidents barack obama and medvedev met in washington , where they dodged superpower protocol to slip out to one of the us leader 's favorite burger joints .

a decision on a proposal to end the global moratorium on whaling was postponed . greenland 's indigenous people now have the right to add humpbacks to a list of whales they are allowed to hunt , according to a decision made at the end of the international whaling commission 's annual meeting in agadir , morocco on friday .
they will now be allowed to kill and consume nine of the giant mammals each year through 2012 .
they were previously allowed to hunt 178 minke whales , 19 fin whales and two bowhead whales each year .
the number of fin whales will be reduced so that the total number of whales killed remains the same .
" our rights will be violated if we ca n't get this resolution , " said ane hansen , greenland 's fishing and hunting minister , during a tense plenary session before the decision .
she added that scientists from the commission had determined that harvesting 10 whales every year for a decade would not adversely affect humpback populations .
approved without a vote international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- delegates said there was consensus on the issue and the 88 member countries did not hold a vote on it .
some countries , including japan , had said that denying the humpback extension - or even taking it to a vote - would damage the organization .
several members were , however , resistant to the idea of allowing the humpback whale hunt .
" this population is not exactly starving .
they enjoy one of the highest average household incomes in the world , " said frederic briand , monaco 's negotiator , adding that more than 3,000 small cetaceans - including whales , dolphins and porpoises - are caught every year in greenland 's waters to feed the population of 55,000 .
some environmental groups argued that the whale meat does n't just feed the native people but also ends up in supermarkets and restaurants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some native groups are allowed a limited number of kills a year " whale meat is sold even in copenhagen with the justification that greenlanders live there , " said biologist petra deimar , a member of the iwc scientific committee .
while greenland is a self-ruled territory of denmark , it is not a member of the european union .
the eu supported the extension for greenland after reaching a deal with denmark reducing the total number of whales .
moratorium sticks for now indigenous groups from several countries are exempt from a 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling .
the ban itself was up for discussion at the iwc meeting but talks over ending it collapsed .
debate had centered on iceland , japan and norway , which continue whaling , reducing the total number of whales they hunt each year .
the proposal would have allowed those three rogue countries a small annual commercial hunt .
japan says it hunts whales for scientific purposes , while norway and iceland claim special rights exempt them .
together the three countries killed more than 1,500 whales in the 2008-2009 season .
a decision on the proposal will now be postponed until next year .

a decision on a proposal to end the global moratorium on whaling was postponed . greenland 's indigenous people now have the right to add humpbacks to a list of whales they are allowed to hunt , according to a decision made at the end of the international whaling commission 's annual meeting in agadir , morocco on friday .
they will now be allowed to kill and consume nine of the giant mammals each year through 2012 .
they were previously allowed to hunt 178 minke whales , 19 fin whales and two bowhead whales each year .
the number of fin whales will be reduced so that the total number of whales killed remains the same .
" our rights will be violated if we ca n't get this resolution , " said ane hansen , greenland 's fishing and hunting minister , during a tense plenary session before the decision .
she added that scientists from the commission had determined that harvesting 10 whales every year for a decade would not adversely affect humpback populations .
approved without a vote international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- delegates said there was consensus on the issue and the 88 member countries did not hold a vote on it .
some countries , including japan , had said that denying the humpback extension - or even taking it to a vote - would damage the organization .
several members were , however , resistant to the idea of allowing the humpback whale hunt .
" this population is not exactly starving .
they enjoy one of the highest average household incomes in the world , " said frederic briand , monaco 's negotiator , adding that more than 3,000 small cetaceans - including whales , dolphins and porpoises - are caught every year in greenland 's waters to feed the population of 55,000 .
some environmental groups argued that the whale meat does n't just feed the native people but also ends up in supermarkets and restaurants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some native groups are allowed a limited number of kills a year " whale meat is sold even in copenhagen with the justification that greenlanders live there , " said biologist petra deimar , a member of the iwc scientific committee .
while greenland is a self-ruled territory of denmark , it is not a member of the european union .
the eu supported the extension for greenland after reaching a deal with denmark reducing the total number of whales .
moratorium sticks for now indigenous groups from several countries are exempt from a 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling .
the ban itself was up for discussion at the iwc meeting but talks over ending it collapsed .
debate had centered on iceland , japan and norway , which continue whaling , reducing the total number of whales they hunt each year .
the proposal would have allowed those three rogue countries a small annual commercial hunt .
japan says it hunts whales for scientific purposes , while norway and iceland claim special rights exempt them .
together the three countries killed more than 1,500 whales in the 2008-2009 season .
a decision on the proposal will now be postponed until next year .

but the victims themselves need no reminder .
many are left not with bruises or broken bones , but with emotional and psychological scars that remain years after the torture has ceased – and music is being used by some as torture instrument of choice .
" you lose control and start to hallucinate .
you 're pushed to a threshold , and you realize that insanity is lurking on the other side .
and once you cross that line , there 's no going back .
i saw that threshold several times , " said binyam mohamed in an interview with uk prisoners ' advocacy organization reprieve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : binyam mohamed suffered harsh interrogation techniques in guantanamo mohamed , a former inmate at the " dark prison " in afghanistan and later at the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , is one of an untold number of victims of so-called " no-touch " torture techniques .
these are psychological techniques , often employed during interrogations , that leave few or no physical marks on the victim but can have lasting psychological consequences .
music used as part of ' cruel and degrading ' treatment mohamed described an interrogation period of almost three weeks , during which he was hung up in stress positions and allowed to sleep only occasionally and for a few hours at a time , as music played at ear-splitting volumes .
this music changed from tracks by popular rappers eminem and dr dre to " horrible ghost laughter and halloween sounds " , mohamed said .
" the cia worked on people , including me , day and night - plenty lost their minds .
i could hear people knocking their heads against the walls and the doors , screaming their heads off " , he added .
in february this year , the united kingdom court of appeal ruled that mohamed 's treatment at the hands of united states authorities was " cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some former guantanamo bay detainees claim they were tortured with music another former guantanamo detainee , ruhal ahmed , described the musical torture as more brutal than physical abuse .
" it 's as if you had very bad migraines , and then someone shows up and yells at you – and take that times a thousand .
you ca n't concentrate on anything , " he told german weekly der spiegel .
" before that , when i was beaten , i could use my imagination to forget the pain .
but the music makes you completely disoriented .
it takes over your brain . "
human rights groups say that in recent years there 's been an increase in the use of these invisible torture techniques , though the use of music as a torture instrument dates back centuries .
" we know that even from ancient history , extremely loud sounds were used to terrify populations before the army was going to invade the next day , " said dr suzanne cusick , a musicologist at new york university .
" we know that people would be put in caves so that the resonant qualities of the stone would make small sounds seem ubiquitous and extremely loud , " she added .
" but we can now do that for hundreds of people at a time and we do n't depend on a cave to do it . "
invisible torture techniques go back decades modern use of music and sound during interrogations grew out of research from the 1950s in which the cia conducted experiments to work out how to break people psychologically .
the british subjected irish prisoners to white-noise in the 70s and the israelis made similar use of music in the 90s .
more recently , experts have accused the us military of holding suspected terrorists inside shipping containers and blasting them with a playlist including not only rock songs like metallica 's " enter sandman " but also contemporary children 's music such as barney the purple dinosaur 's " i love you " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tracks from rock group metallica have been used during prisoner interrogations " with a rhythm , it 's like beating … it gets into your head and you get a headache and you can not concentrate on anything else , " said physician and psychotherapist dr mechthild wenk-ansohn , from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims .
the center treats around 500 children and adults from over 50 countries every year , all of them victims of torture or war-related violence .
music is a particularly versatile form of psychological interrogation as it can be tailored to cause maximum discomfort for specific prisoners .
" in turkey it was used that they played very patriotic music or march music -lsb- to -rsb- these two kurds who had been fighting for their independence .
so this was a way to humiliate them , " wenk-ansohn said .
many survivors suffer flashbacks from acoustic triggers in everyday life – anything from a neighbor 's radio , a car stereo , shopping centers or tv – and many are never able to relate to music in the same way .
new york university 's cusick told of one former guantanamo detainee who had once been a great fan of garage and hard rock .
" he seldom listens to music of any kind now .
he 's extremely sensitive to ambient sound , " she said .
" he remains paranoid now four years after his capture and imprisonment .
he believes that he could be picked up at anytime and consequently he 's afraid to go out of his house . "
not torture – just interrogation , say authorities the us has never considered its use of music during interrogation to be torture at all .
us authorities described it as an enhanced interrogation technique – the same term used to describe sleep deprivation , stress positions and water-boarding .
last year us president barack obama ordered an end to the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques , limiting the cia to interrogation methods explicitly outlined in the us army field manual on interrogations .
the use of music during interrogations is not one of the currently accepted interrogation methods .
stacy sullivan , a new york-based counter-terrorism expert with international ngo human rights watch , said that the organization has no evidence that the use of music during interrogations is on the increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama ordered an end to " harsh interrogation techniques " in 2009 yet there is some evidence that the practise still enjoys widespread use .
wenk-ansohn from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims said that the center is seeing a growing number patients who have been subjected to treatment involving music , including those who have come from turkey , iraq and iran .
dr. julia duchrow from amnesty international germany said these techniques violate the international declaration of human rights and should be recognized as torture " because the music is used intentionally to make someone suffer and create pain in the brains and the mental health of the person . "
duchrow added that germany , like other countries that have signed declarations that prohibit torture , has a responsibility to fight against torture in all its forms .
while some musicians like james hetfield of metallica may not publicly object to their music being used to interrogate suspected terrorists , others like tom morello from the politically active rage against the machine are angry that their music has been used to hurt people .
they and over 25 other bands , as well as amnesty international , are engaged in an ongoing campaign to end the use of music as an instrument of torture .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : binyam mohamed suffered harsh interrogation techniques in guantanamo mohamed , a former inmate at the " dark prison " in afghanistan and later at the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , is one of an untold number of victims of so-called " no-touch " torture techniques .
these are psychological techniques , often employed during interrogations , that leave few or no physical marks on the victim but can have lasting psychological consequences .
music used as part of ' cruel and degrading ' treatment mohamed described an interrogation period of almost three weeks , during which he was hung up in stress positions and allowed to sleep only occasionally and for a few hours at a time , as music played at ear-splitting volumes .
this music changed from tracks by popular rappers eminem and dr dre to " horrible ghost laughter and halloween sounds " , mohamed said .
" the cia worked on people , including me , day and night - plenty lost their minds .
i could hear people knocking their heads against the walls and the doors , screaming their heads off " , he added .
in february this year , the united kingdom court of appeal ruled that mohamed 's treatment at the hands of united states authorities was " cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some former guantanamo bay detainees claim they were tortured with music another former guantanamo detainee , ruhal ahmed , described the musical torture as more brutal than physical abuse .
" it 's as if you had very bad migraines , and then someone shows up and yells at you – and take that times a thousand .
you ca n't concentrate on anything , " he told german weekly der spiegel .
" before that , when i was beaten , i could use my imagination to forget the pain .
but the music makes you completely disoriented .
it takes over your brain . "
human rights groups say that in recent years there 's been an increase in the use of these invisible torture techniques , though the use of music as a torture instrument dates back centuries .
" we know that even from ancient history , extremely loud sounds were used to terrify populations before the army was going to invade the next day , " said dr suzanne cusick , a musicologist at new york university .
" we know that people would be put in caves so that the resonant qualities of the stone would make small sounds seem ubiquitous and extremely loud , " she added .
" but we can now do that for hundreds of people at a time and we do n't depend on a cave to do it . "
invisible torture techniques go back decades modern use of music and sound during interrogations grew out of research from the 1950s in which the cia conducted experiments to work out how to break people psychologically .
the british subjected irish prisoners to white-noise in the 70s and the israelis made similar use of music in the 90s .
more recently , experts have accused the us military of holding suspected terrorists inside shipping containers and blasting them with a playlist including not only rock songs like metallica 's " enter sandman " but also contemporary children 's music such as barney the purple dinosaur 's " i love you " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tracks from rock group metallica have been used during prisoner interrogations " with a rhythm , it 's like beating … it gets into your head and you get a headache and you can not concentrate on anything else , " said physician and psychotherapist dr mechthild wenk-ansohn , from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims .
the center treats around 500 children and adults from over 50 countries every year , all of them victims of torture or war-related violence .
music is a particularly versatile form of psychological interrogation as it can be tailored to cause maximum discomfort for specific prisoners .
" in turkey it was used that they played very patriotic music or march music -lsb- to -rsb- these two kurds who had been fighting for their independence .
so this was a way to humiliate them , " wenk-ansohn said .
many survivors suffer flashbacks from acoustic triggers in everyday life – anything from a neighbor 's radio , a car stereo , shopping centers or tv – and many are never able to relate to music in the same way .
new york university 's cusick told of one former guantanamo detainee who had once been a great fan of garage and hard rock .
" he seldom listens to music of any kind now .
he 's extremely sensitive to ambient sound , " she said .
" he remains paranoid now four years after his capture and imprisonment .
he believes that he could be picked up at anytime and consequently he 's afraid to go out of his house . "
not torture – just interrogation , say authorities the us has never considered its use of music during interrogation to be torture at all .
us authorities described it as an enhanced interrogation technique – the same term used to describe sleep deprivation , stress positions and water-boarding .
last year us president barack obama ordered an end to the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques , limiting the cia to interrogation methods explicitly outlined in the us army field manual on interrogations .
the use of music during interrogations is not one of the currently accepted interrogation methods .
stacy sullivan , a new york-based counter-terrorism expert with international ngo human rights watch , said that the organization has no evidence that the use of music during interrogations is on the increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama ordered an end to " harsh interrogation techniques " in 2009 yet there is some evidence that the practise still enjoys widespread use .
wenk-ansohn from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims said that the center is seeing a growing number patients who have been subjected to treatment involving music , including those who have come from turkey , iraq and iran .
dr. julia duchrow from amnesty international germany said these techniques violate the international declaration of human rights and should be recognized as torture " because the music is used intentionally to make someone suffer and create pain in the brains and the mental health of the person . "
duchrow added that germany , like other countries that have signed declarations that prohibit torture , has a responsibility to fight against torture in all its forms .
while some musicians like james hetfield of metallica may not publicly object to their music being used to interrogate suspected terrorists , others like tom morello from the politically active rage against the machine are angry that their music has been used to hurt people .
they and over 25 other bands , as well as amnesty international , are engaged in an ongoing campaign to end the use of music as an instrument of torture .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : binyam mohamed suffered harsh interrogation techniques in guantanamo mohamed , a former inmate at the " dark prison " in afghanistan and later at the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , is one of an untold number of victims of so-called " no-touch " torture techniques .
these are psychological techniques , often employed during interrogations , that leave few or no physical marks on the victim but can have lasting psychological consequences .
music used as part of ' cruel and degrading ' treatment mohamed described an interrogation period of almost three weeks , during which he was hung up in stress positions and allowed to sleep only occasionally and for a few hours at a time , as music played at ear-splitting volumes .
this music changed from tracks by popular rappers eminem and dr dre to " horrible ghost laughter and halloween sounds " , mohamed said .
" the cia worked on people , including me , day and night - plenty lost their minds .
i could hear people knocking their heads against the walls and the doors , screaming their heads off " , he added .
in february this year , the united kingdom court of appeal ruled that mohamed 's treatment at the hands of united states authorities was " cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some former guantanamo bay detainees claim they were tortured with music another former guantanamo detainee , ruhal ahmed , described the musical torture as more brutal than physical abuse .
" it 's as if you had very bad migraines , and then someone shows up and yells at you – and take that times a thousand .
you ca n't concentrate on anything , " he told german weekly der spiegel .
" before that , when i was beaten , i could use my imagination to forget the pain .
but the music makes you completely disoriented .
it takes over your brain . "
human rights groups say that in recent years there 's been an increase in the use of these invisible torture techniques , though the use of music as a torture instrument dates back centuries .
" we know that even from ancient history , extremely loud sounds were used to terrify populations before the army was going to invade the next day , " said dr suzanne cusick , a musicologist at new york university .
" we know that people would be put in caves so that the resonant qualities of the stone would make small sounds seem ubiquitous and extremely loud , " she added .
" but we can now do that for hundreds of people at a time and we do n't depend on a cave to do it . "
invisible torture techniques go back decades modern use of music and sound during interrogations grew out of research from the 1950s in which the cia conducted experiments to work out how to break people psychologically .
the british subjected irish prisoners to white-noise in the 70s and the israelis made similar use of music in the 90s .
more recently , experts have accused the us military of holding suspected terrorists inside shipping containers and blasting them with a playlist including not only rock songs like metallica 's " enter sandman " but also contemporary children 's music such as barney the purple dinosaur 's " i love you " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tracks from rock group metallica have been used during prisoner interrogations " with a rhythm , it 's like beating … it gets into your head and you get a headache and you can not concentrate on anything else , " said physician and psychotherapist dr mechthild wenk-ansohn , from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims .
the center treats around 500 children and adults from over 50 countries every year , all of them victims of torture or war-related violence .
music is a particularly versatile form of psychological interrogation as it can be tailored to cause maximum discomfort for specific prisoners .
" in turkey it was used that they played very patriotic music or march music -lsb- to -rsb- these two kurds who had been fighting for their independence .
so this was a way to humiliate them , " wenk-ansohn said .
many survivors suffer flashbacks from acoustic triggers in everyday life – anything from a neighbor 's radio , a car stereo , shopping centers or tv – and many are never able to relate to music in the same way .
new york university 's cusick told of one former guantanamo detainee who had once been a great fan of garage and hard rock .
" he seldom listens to music of any kind now .
he 's extremely sensitive to ambient sound , " she said .
" he remains paranoid now four years after his capture and imprisonment .
he believes that he could be picked up at anytime and consequently he 's afraid to go out of his house . "
not torture – just interrogation , say authorities the us has never considered its use of music during interrogation to be torture at all .
us authorities described it as an enhanced interrogation technique – the same term used to describe sleep deprivation , stress positions and water-boarding .
last year us president barack obama ordered an end to the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques , limiting the cia to interrogation methods explicitly outlined in the us army field manual on interrogations .
the use of music during interrogations is not one of the currently accepted interrogation methods .
stacy sullivan , a new york-based counter-terrorism expert with international ngo human rights watch , said that the organization has no evidence that the use of music during interrogations is on the increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama ordered an end to " harsh interrogation techniques " in 2009 yet there is some evidence that the practise still enjoys widespread use .
wenk-ansohn from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims said that the center is seeing a growing number patients who have been subjected to treatment involving music , including those who have come from turkey , iraq and iran .
dr. julia duchrow from amnesty international germany said these techniques violate the international declaration of human rights and should be recognized as torture " because the music is used intentionally to make someone suffer and create pain in the brains and the mental health of the person . "
duchrow added that germany , like other countries that have signed declarations that prohibit torture , has a responsibility to fight against torture in all its forms .
while some musicians like james hetfield of metallica may not publicly object to their music being used to interrogate suspected terrorists , others like tom morello from the politically active rage against the machine are angry that their music has been used to hurt people .
they and over 25 other bands , as well as amnesty international , are engaged in an ongoing campaign to end the use of music as an instrument of torture .

protestors had hoped to outwit authorities by only revealing the site at the last minute . at least five gay rights activists were roughly arrested and taken to a police car in st. petersburg , russia after taking part in an unsanctioned rally , according to a police spokesman .
some 30 protestors had gathered outside the famous hermitage museum on palace square , shouting slogans such as " equality without compromise , " " homophobia is an illness , " " homophobia - the country 's shame " and " marriage rights without compromises . "
police often violently break up gay rights demonstrations in russia and activists had kept the location of saturday 's rally a secret until the last minute in an attempt to prevent the arrests .
in may , activists in moscow held the first demonstration undisturbed by arrests and violence in five years .
organizers said it was only their " military planning " that prevented further arrests at that rally .
according to local media reports , a small group of anti-gay activists also showed up , attempting to attack the protesters .
at least four of them were also detained .
moscow 's mayor yury luzhkov has described gay pride parades as " satanic " and gay rights activists have condemned the russian authorities ' refusal to allow gay rights demonstrations .

this comes as something of an embarrassment for the rail operator . the european commission , the eu 's executive body , is taking the german government to court over non-compliance with the bloc ’ s competition rules in the rail market . the commission says the rail network operator db netz is not independent enough of state-owned deutsche bahn 's passenger and freight services , and the dispute has ended up in the european court of justice in luxembourg . brussels initiated proceedings over contractual violations two years ago and a report in the financial times deutschland quoted the spokesman for transport commissioner siim kallas as saying on thursday that " since then , germany has made no progress whatsoever . " the lawsuit comes as a serious blow to deutsche bahn , whose ceo ruediger grube has for months been complaining about the rail market in europe not being adequately liberalized . commenting on the european commission 's move , reinhard boeckh , head of the press office of deutsche bahn told deutsche welle : " this is the end of a process that ’ s been going on for years .
in this regard the position of the german government is the same as that of deutsche bahn .
the government is on our side . " " in germany , we have a rail market where there 's much more competition than in the rest of europe .
there are over 320 companies operating in this sector .
you don ’ t find that in any other european country , " he added . ceo grube had accused the french of " flagrant competition violations . "
in contrast , he said : " germany 's rail services are operating fairly , " referring to the fact that while any foreign rail company can operate in germany , the same is not possible in france . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case is being dealt with at the european court of justice in luxembourg " the french government put up every obstacle it could to liberalizing the rail sector across the european union earlier this year , " boeckh said . ec clampdown but the european commission is not convinced that the german rail market is operating in a fair manner .
it wants to make it impossible for board members of railway companies to influence the allocation of sections of track to competitors and charge for the use of the track . and according to eu regulations , board members of deutsche bahn are not supposed to sit on the board of a railway infrastructure provider such as db netz at the same time .
board executives are not allowed to move between the holding and the network operator . boeckh , however , maintains that the organizational structure of the boards does not violate european commission regulations . " db netz , which is responsible for distributing tracks , comes under the board of deutsche bahn but it is separated , that is , its decisions are not discussed with the rest of deutsche bahn .
there is in fact a european commission regulation that allows this sort of a setup , " he told deutsche welle . some analysts say that since grube took over the reins of deutsche bahn just over a year ago , the close ties between the holding and its operating company , db mobility logistics – which besides carrying freight is also responsible for passenger transportation – have increased . boeckh confirmed that five managers are simultaneously on the boards of both companies . germany 's supreme administrative court also recently objected to the personnel links .
the judges ruled that legal advisers of the holding company can not advise db netz in the future on issues involving the allocation of tracks to competitors . buses to offer competition on thursday , the same court dealt a further blow to deutsche bahn , ruling that long-distance bus operators can compete with trains in germany but on condition that the price they offer for a particular route is considerably lower than the one offered by db . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo grube has complained about a lack of liberalization in europe 's rail market the ruling looks set to transform public transportation in germany .
until now , there have been few national bus services in the country with the exception of those operating from and to berlin .
this is in keeping with a clause in the public transport act of 1931 which allows national bus routes only in exceptional cases and only if deutsche bahn does not object . the privilege was due to come to an end by 2011 at the latest , in accordance with the agreement between the members of germany 's governing coalition . eyeing uk high-speed railway these developments come at a particularly awkward time for germany 's national rail operator , which is itself looking to expand in europe . this week , deutsche bahn was reported to be in talks with britain about running its trains on the country 's only high-speed railway .
this move could break the monopoly of rival eurostar , which uses the high speed 1 -lrb- hs1 -rrb- line . " we are discussing several options with them -lrb- deutsche bahn -rrb- , " mark bayley , head of state-owned london and continental railways -lrb- lcr -rrb- confirmed . lcr , which operates the high-speed , 110-kilometer railway linking london and the channel tunnel has a 30-year concession to run the high-speed line and stations . bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn is seeking to dominate the rail market both at home and abroad ' divestment in line with liberalization ' deutsche bahn has expressed interest in running direct rail connections between london and the continent following the liberalization of the european cross-border rail passenger market at the start of the year . this comes on the back of the company 's takeover of british transport group arriva to create europe 's no.1 passenger carrier .
the 1.58 billion pound -lrb- € 1.91 billion , $ 2.36 billion -rrb- deal saw the german rail operator enlarging its footprint in rail , bus and logistics services outside of germany . while london 's bid to reduce a budget deficit of nearly 11 percent of gdp is the primary reason behind the sale of hs1 , bayley said the divestment would also be in line with a european trend of removing conflicts in rail . " high speed 1 will no longer feel any incentive to act in the interest of eurostar , " he said .
" the european union wishes to see regulators enforcing this principle of a separation of the commercial and management interests of infrastructure and operation . "

but the victims themselves need no reminder .
many are left not with bruises or broken bones , but with emotional and psychological scars that remain years after the torture has ceased – and music is being used by some as torture instrument of choice .
" you lose control and start to hallucinate .
you 're pushed to a threshold , and you realize that insanity is lurking on the other side .
and once you cross that line , there 's no going back .
i saw that threshold several times , " said binyam mohamed in an interview with uk prisoners ' advocacy organization reprieve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : binyam mohamed suffered harsh interrogation techniques in guantanamo mohamed , a former inmate at the " dark prison " in afghanistan and later at the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , is one of an untold number of victims of so-called " no-touch " torture techniques .
these are psychological techniques , often employed during interrogations , that leave few or no physical marks on the victim but can have lasting psychological consequences .
music used as part of ' cruel and degrading ' treatment mohamed described an interrogation period of almost three weeks , during which he was hung up in stress positions and allowed to sleep only occasionally and for a few hours at a time , as music played at ear-splitting volumes .
this music changed from tracks by popular rappers eminem and dr dre to " horrible ghost laughter and halloween sounds " , mohamed said .
" the cia worked on people , including me , day and night - plenty lost their minds .
i could hear people knocking their heads against the walls and the doors , screaming their heads off " , he added .
in february this year , the united kingdom court of appeal ruled that mohamed 's treatment at the hands of united states authorities was " cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some former guantanamo bay detainees claim they were tortured with music another former guantanamo detainee , ruhal ahmed , described the musical torture as more brutal than physical abuse .
" it 's as if you had very bad migraines , and then someone shows up and yells at you – and take that times a thousand .
you ca n't concentrate on anything , " he told german weekly der spiegel .
" before that , when i was beaten , i could use my imagination to forget the pain .
but the music makes you completely disoriented .
it takes over your brain . "
human rights groups say that in recent years there 's been an increase in the use of these invisible torture techniques , though the use of music as a torture instrument dates back centuries .
" we know that even from ancient history , extremely loud sounds were used to terrify populations before the army was going to invade the next day , " said dr suzanne cusick , a musicologist at new york university .
" we know that people would be put in caves so that the resonant qualities of the stone would make small sounds seem ubiquitous and extremely loud , " she added .
" but we can now do that for hundreds of people at a time and we do n't depend on a cave to do it . "
invisible torture techniques go back decades modern use of music and sound during interrogations grew out of research from the 1950s in which the cia conducted experiments to work out how to break people psychologically .
the british subjected irish prisoners to white-noise in the 70s and the israelis made similar use of music in the 90s .
more recently , experts have accused the us military of holding suspected terrorists inside shipping containers and blasting them with a playlist including not only rock songs like metallica 's " enter sandman " but also contemporary children 's music such as barney the purple dinosaur 's " i love you " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tracks from rock group metallica have been used during prisoner interrogations " with a rhythm , it 's like beating … it gets into your head and you get a headache and you can not concentrate on anything else , " said physician and psychotherapist dr mechthild wenk-ansohn , from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims .
the center treats around 500 children and adults from over 50 countries every year , all of them victims of torture or war-related violence .
music is a particularly versatile form of psychological interrogation as it can be tailored to cause maximum discomfort for specific prisoners .
" in turkey it was used that they played very patriotic music or march music -lsb- to -rsb- these two kurds who had been fighting for their independence .
so this was a way to humiliate them , " wenk-ansohn said .
many survivors suffer flashbacks from acoustic triggers in everyday life – anything from a neighbor 's radio , a car stereo , shopping centers or tv – and many are never able to relate to music in the same way .
new york university 's cusick told of one former guantanamo detainee who had once been a great fan of garage and hard rock .
" he seldom listens to music of any kind now .
he 's extremely sensitive to ambient sound , " she said .
" he remains paranoid now four years after his capture and imprisonment .
he believes that he could be picked up at anytime and consequently he 's afraid to go out of his house . "
not torture – just interrogation , say authorities the us has never considered its use of music during interrogation to be torture at all .
us authorities described it as an enhanced interrogation technique – the same term used to describe sleep deprivation , stress positions and water-boarding .
last year us president barack obama ordered an end to the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques , limiting the cia to interrogation methods explicitly outlined in the us army field manual on interrogations .
the use of music during interrogations is not one of the currently accepted interrogation methods .
stacy sullivan , a new york-based counter-terrorism expert with international ngo human rights watch , said that the organization has no evidence that the use of music during interrogations is on the increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama ordered an end to " harsh interrogation techniques " in 2009 yet there is some evidence that the practise still enjoys widespread use .
wenk-ansohn from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims said that the center is seeing a growing number patients who have been subjected to treatment involving music , including those who have come from turkey , iraq and iran .
dr. julia duchrow from amnesty international germany said these techniques violate the international declaration of human rights and should be recognized as torture " because the music is used intentionally to make someone suffer and create pain in the brains and the mental health of the person . "
duchrow added that germany , like other countries that have signed declarations that prohibit torture , has a responsibility to fight against torture in all its forms .
while some musicians like james hetfield of metallica may not publicly object to their music being used to interrogate suspected terrorists , others like tom morello from the politically active rage against the machine are angry that their music has been used to hurt people .
they and over 25 other bands , as well as amnesty international , are engaged in an ongoing campaign to end the use of music as an instrument of torture .

eight-tentacled paul predicts a win for germany against england as the two sides prepare for their world cup clash . a sea creature famed for predicting football results has tipped germany to beat england in sunday 's eagerly anticipated world cup showdown .
paul the octopus , who lives at the sea life aquarium in the german city of oberhausen , has been making waves with his successful predictions of the outcomes of all of germany 's group-stage matches in south africa .
in his latest test , paul was offered the choice of two plastic boxes containing food - one adorned with england 's st. george flag , the other with a german flag .
paul moved quickly to open the box with the germany flag , to the delight of spectators , and the selection was reported in news broadcasts across germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul picked serbia as the winner ahead of germany 's game with that country - he was right " paul went rather quickly for the germany flag , " said sea life spokeswoman tanja munzig .
" he 's got a 100-percent average in the world cup so far . ”

during the football european championships in 2008 , they said , paul picked the winning side in 80 percent of german games .
england fans might have reason to feel aggrieved at the latest decision reached by the octopus .
paul was , in fact , born a little over two years ago in the english seaside town of weymouth .

" i think there is a real opportunity to put the bilateral relations on to a new footing , " cameron said at the group of eight summit in huntsville , canada .
the two leaders met for an hour of bilateral talks on friday on the sidelines of the summit of the world 's leading economies .
they agreed to maintain regular contact and to encourage their foreign ministers to work more closely together .
medvedev agreed there was a new opportunity to set things right .
" we agreed that our bilateral relationship required the personal attention of the leaders of the two countries both in terms of the economy and other issues and we are determined to make them more productive and intense , " he said .
relationship free-fall british-russian relations hit a post-soviet low in 2006 after the fatal poisoning of former russian spy alexander litvinenko in london with a radioactive isotope .
british authorities sought to have russian parliament member andrei lugovol extradited in connection with litvinenko 's death , but moscow refused .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : litvinenko 's death worsened relations between russia and britain britain granted political asylum to some of the kremlin 's enemies and refused to extradite boris berezovsky , a russian billionaire and critic of the russian government .
berezovsky was convicted in absentia of fraud and embezzlement in russia .
the dispute over his extradition led britain to expel russian diplomats , moving russia to follow suit and to shut down two branches of the british council , a cultural and educational organization connected to the british foreign ministry .
the defrosting of uk-russia follows a warm-up between washington and moscow , which agreed last year to a " reset " of their relationship .
last thursday , us presidents barack obama and medvedev met in washington , where they dodged superpower protocol to slip out to one of the us leader 's favorite burger joints .

" i think there is a real opportunity to put the bilateral relations on to a new footing , " cameron said at the group of eight summit in huntsville , canada .
the two leaders met for an hour of bilateral talks on friday on the sidelines of the summit of the world 's leading economies .
they agreed to maintain regular contact and to encourage their foreign ministers to work more closely together .
medvedev agreed there was a new opportunity to set things right .
" we agreed that our bilateral relationship required the personal attention of the leaders of the two countries both in terms of the economy and other issues and we are determined to make them more productive and intense , " he said .
relationship free-fall british-russian relations hit a post-soviet low in 2006 after the fatal poisoning of former russian spy alexander litvinenko in london with a radioactive isotope .
british authorities sought to have russian parliament member andrei lugovol extradited in connection with litvinenko 's death , but moscow refused .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : litvinenko 's death worsened relations between russia and britain britain granted political asylum to some of the kremlin 's enemies and refused to extradite boris berezovsky , a russian billionaire and critic of the russian government .
berezovsky was convicted in absentia of fraud and embezzlement in russia .
the dispute over his extradition led britain to expel russian diplomats , moving russia to follow suit and to shut down two branches of the british council , a cultural and educational organization connected to the british foreign ministry .
the defrosting of uk-russia follows a warm-up between washington and moscow , which agreed last year to a " reset " of their relationship .
last thursday , us presidents barack obama and medvedev met in washington , where they dodged superpower protocol to slip out to one of the us leader 's favorite burger joints .

but the victims themselves need no reminder .
many are left not with bruises or broken bones , but with emotional and psychological scars that remain years after the torture has ceased – and music is being used by some as torture instrument of choice .
" you lose control and start to hallucinate .
you 're pushed to a threshold , and you realize that insanity is lurking on the other side .
and once you cross that line , there 's no going back .
i saw that threshold several times , " said binyam mohamed in an interview with uk prisoners ' advocacy organization reprieve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : binyam mohamed suffered harsh interrogation techniques in guantanamo mohamed , a former inmate at the " dark prison " in afghanistan and later at the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , is one of an untold number of victims of so-called " no-touch " torture techniques .
these are psychological techniques , often employed during interrogations , that leave few or no physical marks on the victim but can have lasting psychological consequences .
music used as part of ' cruel and degrading ' treatment mohamed described an interrogation period of almost three weeks , during which he was hung up in stress positions and allowed to sleep only occasionally and for a few hours at a time , as music played at ear-splitting volumes .
this music changed from tracks by popular rappers eminem and dr dre to " horrible ghost laughter and halloween sounds " , mohamed said .
" the cia worked on people , including me , day and night - plenty lost their minds .
i could hear people knocking their heads against the walls and the doors , screaming their heads off " , he added .
in february this year , the united kingdom court of appeal ruled that mohamed 's treatment at the hands of united states authorities was " cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some former guantanamo bay detainees claim they were tortured with music another former guantanamo detainee , ruhal ahmed , described the musical torture as more brutal than physical abuse .
" it 's as if you had very bad migraines , and then someone shows up and yells at you – and take that times a thousand .
you ca n't concentrate on anything , " he told german weekly der spiegel .
" before that , when i was beaten , i could use my imagination to forget the pain .
but the music makes you completely disoriented .
it takes over your brain . "
human rights groups say that in recent years there 's been an increase in the use of these invisible torture techniques , though the use of music as a torture instrument dates back centuries .
" we know that even from ancient history , extremely loud sounds were used to terrify populations before the army was going to invade the next day , " said dr suzanne cusick , a musicologist at new york university .
" we know that people would be put in caves so that the resonant qualities of the stone would make small sounds seem ubiquitous and extremely loud , " she added .
" but we can now do that for hundreds of people at a time and we do n't depend on a cave to do it . "
invisible torture techniques go back decades modern use of music and sound during interrogations grew out of research from the 1950s in which the cia conducted experiments to work out how to break people psychologically .
the british subjected irish prisoners to white-noise in the 70s and the israelis made similar use of music in the 90s .
more recently , experts have accused the us military of holding suspected terrorists inside shipping containers and blasting them with a playlist including not only rock songs like metallica 's " enter sandman " but also contemporary children 's music such as barney the purple dinosaur 's " i love you " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tracks from rock group metallica have been used during prisoner interrogations " with a rhythm , it 's like beating … it gets into your head and you get a headache and you can not concentrate on anything else , " said physician and psychotherapist dr mechthild wenk-ansohn , from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims .
the center treats around 500 children and adults from over 50 countries every year , all of them victims of torture or war-related violence .
music is a particularly versatile form of psychological interrogation as it can be tailored to cause maximum discomfort for specific prisoners .
" in turkey it was used that they played very patriotic music or march music -lsb- to -rsb- these two kurds who had been fighting for their independence .
so this was a way to humiliate them , " wenk-ansohn said .
many survivors suffer flashbacks from acoustic triggers in everyday life – anything from a neighbor 's radio , a car stereo , shopping centers or tv – and many are never able to relate to music in the same way .
new york university 's cusick told of one former guantanamo detainee who had once been a great fan of garage and hard rock .
" he seldom listens to music of any kind now .
he 's extremely sensitive to ambient sound , " she said .
" he remains paranoid now four years after his capture and imprisonment .
he believes that he could be picked up at anytime and consequently he 's afraid to go out of his house . "
not torture – just interrogation , say authorities the us has never considered its use of music during interrogation to be torture at all .
us authorities described it as an enhanced interrogation technique – the same term used to describe sleep deprivation , stress positions and water-boarding .
last year us president barack obama ordered an end to the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques , limiting the cia to interrogation methods explicitly outlined in the us army field manual on interrogations .
the use of music during interrogations is not one of the currently accepted interrogation methods .
stacy sullivan , a new york-based counter-terrorism expert with international ngo human rights watch , said that the organization has no evidence that the use of music during interrogations is on the increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama ordered an end to " harsh interrogation techniques " in 2009 yet there is some evidence that the practise still enjoys widespread use .
wenk-ansohn from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims said that the center is seeing a growing number patients who have been subjected to treatment involving music , including those who have come from turkey , iraq and iran .
dr. julia duchrow from amnesty international germany said these techniques violate the international declaration of human rights and should be recognized as torture " because the music is used intentionally to make someone suffer and create pain in the brains and the mental health of the person . "
duchrow added that germany , like other countries that have signed declarations that prohibit torture , has a responsibility to fight against torture in all its forms .
while some musicians like james hetfield of metallica may not publicly object to their music being used to interrogate suspected terrorists , others like tom morello from the politically active rage against the machine are angry that their music has been used to hurt people .
they and over 25 other bands , as well as amnesty international , are engaged in an ongoing campaign to end the use of music as an instrument of torture .

eight-tentacled paul predicts a win for germany against england as the two sides prepare for their world cup clash . a sea creature famed for predicting football results has tipped germany to beat england in sunday 's eagerly anticipated world cup showdown .
paul the octopus , who lives at the sea life aquarium in the german city of oberhausen , has been making waves with his successful predictions of the outcomes of all of germany 's group-stage matches in south africa .
in his latest test , paul was offered the choice of two plastic boxes containing food - one adorned with england 's st. george flag , the other with a german flag .
paul moved quickly to open the box with the germany flag , to the delight of spectators , and the selection was reported in news broadcasts across germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul picked serbia as the winner ahead of germany 's game with that country - he was right " paul went rather quickly for the germany flag , " said sea life spokeswoman tanja munzig .
" he 's got a 100-percent average in the world cup so far . ”
winning record paul 's keepers said that the octopod , using the same method , had already predicted germany 's group-stage wins over australia and ghana as well as the national side 's loss to serbia .
during the football european championships in 2008 , they said , paul picked the winning side in 80 percent of german games .
england fans might have reason to feel aggrieved at the latest decision reached by the octopus .
paul was , in fact , born a little over two years ago in the english seaside town of weymouth .

but the victims themselves need no reminder .
many are left not with bruises or broken bones , but with emotional and psychological scars that remain years after the torture has ceased – and music is being used by some as torture instrument of choice .
" you lose control and start to hallucinate .
you 're pushed to a threshold , and you realize that insanity is lurking on the other side .
and once you cross that line , there 's no going back .
i saw that threshold several times , " said binyam mohamed in an interview with uk prisoners ' advocacy organization reprieve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : binyam mohamed suffered harsh interrogation techniques in guantanamo mohamed , a former inmate at the " dark prison " in afghanistan and later at the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , is one of an untold number of victims of so-called " no-touch " torture techniques .
these are psychological techniques , often employed during interrogations , that leave few or no physical marks on the victim but can have lasting psychological consequences .
music used as part of ' cruel and degrading ' treatment mohamed described an interrogation period of almost three weeks , during which he was hung up in stress positions and allowed to sleep only occasionally and for a few hours at a time , as music played at ear-splitting volumes .
this music changed from tracks by popular rappers eminem and dr dre to " horrible ghost laughter and halloween sounds " , mohamed said .
" the cia worked on people , including me , day and night - plenty lost their minds .
i could hear people knocking their heads against the walls and the doors , screaming their heads off " , he added .
in february this year , the united kingdom court of appeal ruled that mohamed 's treatment at the hands of united states authorities was " cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some former guantanamo bay detainees claim they were tortured with music another former guantanamo detainee , ruhal ahmed , described the musical torture as more brutal than physical abuse .
" it 's as if you had very bad migraines , and then someone shows up and yells at you – and take that times a thousand .
you ca n't concentrate on anything , " he told german weekly der spiegel .
" before that , when i was beaten , i could use my imagination to forget the pain .
but the music makes you completely disoriented .
it takes over your brain . "
human rights groups say that in recent years there 's been an increase in the use of these invisible torture techniques , though the use of music as a torture instrument dates back centuries .
" we know that even from ancient history , extremely loud sounds were used to terrify populations before the army was going to invade the next day , " said dr suzanne cusick , a musicologist at new york university .
" we know that people would be put in caves so that the resonant qualities of the stone would make small sounds seem ubiquitous and extremely loud , " she added .
" but we can now do that for hundreds of people at a time and we do n't depend on a cave to do it . "
invisible torture techniques go back decades modern use of music and sound during interrogations grew out of research from the 1950s in which the cia conducted experiments to work out how to break people psychologically .
the british subjected irish prisoners to white-noise in the 70s and the israelis made similar use of music in the 90s .
more recently , experts have accused the us military of holding suspected terrorists inside shipping containers and blasting them with a playlist including not only rock songs like metallica 's " enter sandman " but also contemporary children 's music such as barney the purple dinosaur 's " i love you " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tracks from rock group metallica have been used during prisoner interrogations " with a rhythm , it 's like beating … it gets into your head and you get a headache and you can not concentrate on anything else , " said physician and psychotherapist dr mechthild wenk-ansohn , from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims .
the center treats around 500 children and adults from over 50 countries every year , all of them victims of torture or war-related violence .
music is a particularly versatile form of psychological interrogation as it can be tailored to cause maximum discomfort for specific prisoners .
" in turkey it was used that they played very patriotic music or march music -lsb- to -rsb- these two kurds who had been fighting for their independence .
so this was a way to humiliate them , " wenk-ansohn said .
many survivors suffer flashbacks from acoustic triggers in everyday life – anything from a neighbor 's radio , a car stereo , shopping centers or tv – and many are never able to relate to music in the same way .
new york university 's cusick told of one former guantanamo detainee who had once been a great fan of garage and hard rock .
" he seldom listens to music of any kind now .
he 's extremely sensitive to ambient sound , " she said .
" he remains paranoid now four years after his capture and imprisonment .
he believes that he could be picked up at anytime and consequently he 's afraid to go out of his house . "
not torture – just interrogation , say authorities the us has never considered its use of music during interrogation to be torture at all .
us authorities described it as an enhanced interrogation technique – the same term used to describe sleep deprivation , stress positions and water-boarding .
last year us president barack obama ordered an end to the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques , limiting the cia to interrogation methods explicitly outlined in the us army field manual on interrogations .
the use of music during interrogations is not one of the currently accepted interrogation methods .
stacy sullivan , a new york-based counter-terrorism expert with international ngo human rights watch , said that the organization has no evidence that the use of music during interrogations is on the increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama ordered an end to " harsh interrogation techniques " in 2009 yet there is some evidence that the practise still enjoys widespread use .
wenk-ansohn from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims said that the center is seeing a growing number patients who have been subjected to treatment involving music , including those who have come from turkey , iraq and iran .
dr. julia duchrow from amnesty international germany said these techniques violate the international declaration of human rights and should be recognized as torture " because the music is used intentionally to make someone suffer and create pain in the brains and the mental health of the person . "
duchrow added that germany , like other countries that have signed declarations that prohibit torture , has a responsibility to fight against torture in all its forms .
while some musicians like james hetfield of metallica may not publicly object to their music being used to interrogate suspected terrorists , others like tom morello from the politically active rage against the machine are angry that their music has been used to hurt people .
they and over 25 other bands , as well as amnesty international , are engaged in an ongoing campaign to end the use of music as an instrument of torture .

meanwhile , the summit of the wider group of g-20 has begun in canada . g-8 leaders did n't pull any punches after their summit in huntsville , canada , this weekend , issuing a final communique critical of iran , north korea , israel , and afghanistan .
the leaders of the world 's eight richest countries called on iran to hold a " transparent dialogue " over its suspect nuclear program , as iranian leader mahmoud ahmedinejad prepares to unveil his conditions for talks .
" we are profoundly concerned by iran 's continued lack of transparency regarding its nuclear activities and its stated intention to continue and expand enriching uranium , including to nearly 20 percent , " g-8 leaders said in their final communique .
" our goal is to persuade iran 's leaders to engage in a transparent dialogue about its nuclear activities and to meet iran 's international obligations , " they wrote , while simultaneously welcoming a deal between iran , turkey and brazil designed to rein in the country 's nuclear enrichment program .
the west believes iran is seeking nuclear weapons , while tehran says its nuclear program is peaceful and is only meant to meet its energy needs . north korea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eight most powerful nations focused on trouble spots around the world the leaders of germany , britain , canada , france , italy , japan , russia and the united states also expressed their " gravest concern about the nuclear test and missile activities " carried out by north korea , reiterating that the country can not become a nuclear power under the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . they also condemned the sinking of a south korean submarine in march , adjudged to have been carried out by the north , that killed 24 sailors near the countries ' disputed maritime border .
" we demand the democratic people 's republic of korea refrain from committing any attacks or threatening hostilities against the republic of korea , " the group concluded .
israel and gaza bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 condemned an israeli raid on this aid flotilla the group 's joint statement welcomed israel 's promise to loosen its blockade on the hamas-run gaza strip , as leaders said they " urge full and effective implementation of this policy in order to address the needs of gaza 's population for humanitarian and commercial goods , civilian reconstruction and infrastructure , and legitimate economic activity . "
" the current arrangements are not sustainable and must be changed . "
the long-standing blockade of the territory came into sharp focus this month after israeli troops stormed a gaza-bound flotilla of aid ships in international waters on may 31 .
the boats were trying to defy the blockade , saying they were taking humanitarian supplies to the region .
the g-8 leaders said they deeply regretted the deaths of nine activists during this israeli intervention .
afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama accepting mcchrystal 's resignation put the afghan mission back in the spotlight finally , the leaders used their chance to address the conflict in afghanistan , days after the sudden resignation of the isaf force 's commanding general , stanley mcchrystal , who has since been replaced by senior us military general , david petraeus .
offering their full support to the current strategy in afghanistan , ahead of a number of major military operations in the country , the g-8 statement said afghan soldiers should be in a position to start taking responsibility for the country 's security " within five years . "
the leaders described the coming months and years as an opportunity for president hamid karzai 's embattled government to improve its performance , " including measures to combat corruption , address illicit drug production and trafficking , improve human rights , -lrb- and -rrb- improve provision of basic services and governance .

eight-tentacled paul predicts a win for germany against england as the two sides prepare for their world cup clash . a sea creature famed for predicting football results has tipped germany to beat england in sunday 's eagerly anticipated world cup showdown .
paul the octopus , who lives at the sea life aquarium in the german city of oberhausen , has been making waves with his successful predictions of the outcomes of all of germany 's group-stage matches in south africa .
in his latest test , paul was offered the choice of two plastic boxes containing food - one adorned with england 's st. george flag , the other with a german flag .
paul moved quickly to open the box with the germany flag , to the delight of spectators , and the selection was reported in news broadcasts across germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul picked serbia as the winner ahead of germany 's game with that country - he was right " paul went rather quickly for the germany flag , " said sea life spokeswoman tanja munzig .

winning record paul 's keepers said that the octopod , using the same method , had already predicted germany 's group-stage wins over australia and ghana as well as the national side 's loss to serbia .
during the football european championships in 2008 , they said , paul picked the winning side in 80 percent of german games .
england fans might have reason to feel aggrieved at the latest decision reached by the octopus .
paul was , in fact , born a little over two years ago in the english seaside town of weymouth .

paul the octopus , who lives at the sea life aquarium in the german city of oberhausen , has been making waves with his successful predictions of the outcomes of all of germany 's group-stage matches in south africa .
in his latest test , paul was offered the choice of two plastic boxes containing food - one adorned with england 's st. george flag , the other with a german flag .
paul moved quickly to open the box with the germany flag , to the delight of spectators , and the selection was reported in news broadcasts across germany .

" he 's got a 100-percent average in the world cup so far . ”
winning record paul 's keepers said that the octopod , using the same method , had already predicted germany 's group-stage wins over australia and ghana as well as the national side 's loss to serbia .
during the football european championships in 2008 , they said , paul picked the winning side in 80 percent of german games .
england fans might have reason to feel aggrieved at the latest decision reached by the octopus .
paul was , in fact , born a little over two years ago in the english seaside town of weymouth .

meanwhile , the summit of the wider group of g-20 has begun in canada . g-8 leaders did n't pull any punches after their summit in huntsville , canada , this weekend , issuing a final communique critical of iran , north korea , israel , and afghanistan .
the leaders of the world 's eight richest countries called on iran to hold a " transparent dialogue " over its suspect nuclear program , as iranian leader mahmoud ahmedinejad prepares to unveil his conditions for talks .
" we are profoundly concerned by iran 's continued lack of transparency regarding its nuclear activities and its stated intention to continue and expand enriching uranium , including to nearly 20 percent , " g-8 leaders said in their final communique .
" our goal is to persuade iran 's leaders to engage in a transparent dialogue about its nuclear activities and to meet iran 's international obligations , " they wrote , while simultaneously welcoming a deal between iran , turkey and brazil designed to rein in the country 's nuclear enrichment program .
the west believes iran is seeking nuclear weapons , while tehran says its nuclear program is peaceful and is only meant to meet its energy needs . north korea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eight most powerful nations focused on trouble spots around the world the leaders of germany , britain , canada , france , italy , japan , russia and the united states also expressed their " gravest concern about the nuclear test and missile activities " carried out by north korea , reiterating that the country can not become a nuclear power under the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . they also condemned the sinking of a south korean submarine in march , adjudged to have been carried out by the north , that killed 24 sailors near the countries ' disputed maritime border .

"
" the current arrangements are not sustainable and must be changed . "
the long-standing blockade of the territory came into sharp focus this month after israeli troops stormed a gaza-bound flotilla of aid ships in international waters on may 31 .
the boats were trying to defy the blockade , saying they were taking humanitarian supplies to the region .
the g-8 leaders said they deeply regretted the deaths of nine activists during this israeli intervention .
afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama accepting mcchrystal 's resignation put the afghan mission back in the spotlight finally , the leaders used their chance to address the conflict in afghanistan , days after the sudden resignation of the isaf force 's commanding general , stanley mcchrystal , who has since been replaced by senior us military general , david petraeus .
offering their full support to the current strategy in afghanistan , ahead of a number of major military operations in the country , the g-8 statement said afghan soldiers should be in a position to start taking responsibility for the country 's security " within five years . "
the leaders described the coming months and years as an opportunity for president hamid karzai 's embattled government to improve its performance , " including measures to combat corruption , address illicit drug production and trafficking , improve human rights , -lrb- and -rrb- improve provision of basic services and governance .

" i think there is a real opportunity to put the bilateral relations on to a new footing , " cameron said at the group of eight summit in huntsville , canada .
the two leaders met for an hour of bilateral talks on friday on the sidelines of the summit of the world 's leading economies .
they agreed to maintain regular contact and to encourage their foreign ministers to work more closely together .
medvedev agreed there was a new opportunity to set things right .
" we agreed that our bilateral relationship required the personal attention of the leaders of the two countries both in terms of the economy and other issues and we are determined to make them more productive and intense , " he said .
relationship free-fall british-russian relations hit a post-soviet low in 2006 after the fatal poisoning of former russian spy alexander litvinenko in london with a radioactive isotope .

berezovsky was convicted in absentia of fraud and embezzlement in russia .
the dispute over his extradition led britain to expel russian diplomats , moving russia to follow suit and to shut down two branches of the british council , a cultural and educational organization connected to the british foreign ministry .
the defrosting of uk-russia follows a warm-up between washington and moscow , which agreed last year to a " reset " of their relationship .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul picked serbia as the winner ahead of germany 's game with that country - he was right " paul went rather quickly for the germany flag , " said sea life spokeswoman tanja munzig .
" he 's got a 100-percent average in the world cup so far . ”
winning record paul 's keepers said that the octopod , using the same method , had already predicted germany 's group-stage wins over australia and ghana as well as the national side 's loss to serbia .
during the football european championships in 2008 , they said , paul picked the winning side in 80 percent of german games .
england fans might have reason to feel aggrieved at the latest decision reached by the octopus .
paul was , in fact , born a little over two years ago in the english seaside town of weymouth .

meanwhile , the summit of the wider group of g-20 has begun in canada . g-8 leaders did n't pull any punches after their summit in huntsville , canada , this weekend , issuing a final communique critical of iran , north korea , israel , and afghanistan .
the leaders of the world 's eight richest countries called on iran to hold a " transparent dialogue " over its suspect nuclear program , as iranian leader mahmoud ahmedinejad prepares to unveil his conditions for talks .
" we are profoundly concerned by iran 's continued lack of transparency regarding its nuclear activities and its stated intention to continue and expand enriching uranium , including to nearly 20 percent , " g-8 leaders said in their final communique .
" our goal is to persuade iran 's leaders to engage in a transparent dialogue about its nuclear activities and to meet iran 's international obligations , " they wrote , while simultaneously welcoming a deal between iran , turkey and brazil designed to rein in the country 's nuclear enrichment program .
the west believes iran is seeking nuclear weapons , while tehran says its nuclear program is peaceful and is only meant to meet its energy needs . north korea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eight most powerful nations focused on trouble spots around the world the leaders of germany , britain , canada , france , italy , japan , russia and the united states also expressed their " gravest concern about the nuclear test and missile activities " carried out by north korea , reiterating that the country can not become a nuclear power under the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . they also condemned the sinking of a south korean submarine in march , adjudged to have been carried out by the north , that killed 24 sailors near the countries ' disputed maritime border .
" we demand the democratic people 's republic of korea refrain from committing any attacks or threatening hostilities against the republic of korea , " the group concluded .

"
" the current arrangements are not sustainable and must be changed . "
the long-standing blockade of the territory came into sharp focus this month after israeli troops stormed a gaza-bound flotilla of aid ships in international waters on may 31 .
the boats were trying to defy the blockade , saying they were taking humanitarian supplies to the region .
the g-8 leaders said they deeply regretted the deaths of nine activists during this israeli intervention .
afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama accepting mcchrystal 's resignation put the afghan mission back in the spotlight finally , the leaders used their chance to address the conflict in afghanistan , days after the sudden resignation of the isaf force 's commanding general , stanley mcchrystal , who has since been replaced by senior us military general , david petraeus .
offering their full support to the current strategy in afghanistan , ahead of a number of major military operations in the country , the g-8 statement said afghan soldiers should be in a position to start taking responsibility for the country 's security " within five years . "
the leaders described the coming months and years as an opportunity for president hamid karzai 's embattled government to improve its performance , " including measures to combat corruption , address illicit drug production and trafficking , improve human rights , -lrb- and -rrb- improve provision of basic services and governance . "

" i think there is a real opportunity to put the bilateral relations on to a new footing , " cameron said at the group of eight summit in huntsville , canada .
the two leaders met for an hour of bilateral talks on friday on the sidelines of the summit of the world 's leading economies .
they agreed to maintain regular contact and to encourage their foreign ministers to work more closely together .
medvedev agreed there was a new opportunity to set things right .
" we agreed that our bilateral relationship required the personal attention of the leaders of the two countries both in terms of the economy and other issues and we are determined to make them more productive and intense , " he said .
relationship free-fall british-russian relations hit a post-soviet low in 2006 after the fatal poisoning of former russian spy alexander litvinenko in london with a radioactive isotope .
british authorities sought to have russian parliament member andrei lugovol extradited in connection with litvinenko 's death , but moscow refused .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : litvinenko 's death worsened relations between russia and britain britain granted political asylum to some of the kremlin 's enemies and refused to extradite boris berezovsky , a russian billionaire and critic of the russian government .
berezovsky was convicted in absentia of fraud and embezzlement in russia .
the dispute over his extradition led britain to expel russian diplomats , moving russia to follow suit and to shut down two branches of the british council , a cultural and educational organization connected to the british foreign ministry .
the defrosting of uk-russia follows a warm-up between washington and moscow , which agreed last year to a " reset " of their relationship .
last thursday , us presidents barack obama and medvedev met in washington , where they dodged superpower protocol to slip out to one of the us leader 's favorite burger joints .

but the victims themselves need no reminder .
many are left not with bruises or broken bones , but with emotional and psychological scars that remain years after the torture has ceased – and music is being used by some as torture instrument of choice .
" you lose control and start to hallucinate .
you 're pushed to a threshold , and you realize that insanity is lurking on the other side .
and once you cross that line , there 's no going back .
i saw that threshold several times , " said binyam mohamed in an interview with uk prisoners ' advocacy organization reprieve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : binyam mohamed suffered harsh interrogation techniques in guantanamo mohamed , a former inmate at the " dark prison " in afghanistan and later at the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , is one of an untold number of victims of so-called " no-touch " torture techniques .
these are psychological techniques , often employed during interrogations , that leave few or no physical marks on the victim but can have lasting psychological consequences .
music used as part of ' cruel and degrading ' treatment mohamed described an interrogation period of almost three weeks , during which he was hung up in stress positions and allowed to sleep only occasionally and for a few hours at a time , as music played at ear-splitting volumes .
this music changed from tracks by popular rappers eminem and dr dre to " horrible ghost laughter and halloween sounds " , mohamed said .
" the cia worked on people , including me , day and night - plenty lost their minds .
i could hear people knocking their heads against the walls and the doors , screaming their heads off " , he added .
in february this year , the united kingdom court of appeal ruled that mohamed 's treatment at the hands of united states authorities was " cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some former guantanamo bay detainees claim they were tortured with music another former guantanamo detainee , ruhal ahmed , described the musical torture as more brutal than physical abuse .
" it 's as if you had very bad migraines , and then someone shows up and yells at you – and take that times a thousand .
you ca n't concentrate on anything , " he told german weekly der spiegel .
" before that , when i was beaten , i could use my imagination to forget the pain .
but the music makes you completely disoriented .
it takes over your brain . "
human rights groups say that in recent years there 's been an increase in the use of these invisible torture techniques , though the use of music as a torture instrument dates back centuries .
" we know that even from ancient history , extremely loud sounds were used to terrify populations before the army was going to invade the next day , " said dr suzanne cusick , a musicologist at new york university .
" we know that people would be put in caves so that the resonant qualities of the stone would make small sounds seem ubiquitous and extremely loud , " she added .
" but we can now do that for hundreds of people at a time and we do n't depend on a cave to do it . "
invisible torture techniques go back decades modern use of music and sound during interrogations grew out of research from the 1950s in which the cia conducted experiments to work out how to break people psychologically .
the british subjected irish prisoners to white-noise in the 70s and the israelis made similar use of music in the 90s .
more recently , experts have accused the us military of holding suspected terrorists inside shipping containers and blasting them with a playlist including not only rock songs like metallica 's " enter sandman " but also contemporary children 's music such as barney the purple dinosaur 's " i love you " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tracks from rock group metallica have been used during prisoner interrogations " with a rhythm , it 's like beating … it gets into your head and you get a headache and you can not concentrate on anything else , " said physician and psychotherapist dr mechthild wenk-ansohn , from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims .
the center treats around 500 children and adults from over 50 countries every year , all of them victims of torture or war-related violence .
music is a particularly versatile form of psychological interrogation as it can be tailored to cause maximum discomfort for specific prisoners .
" in turkey it was used that they played very patriotic music or march music -lsb- to -rsb- these two kurds who had been fighting for their independence .
so this was a way to humiliate them , " wenk-ansohn said .
many survivors suffer flashbacks from acoustic triggers in everyday life – anything from a neighbor 's radio , a car stereo , shopping centers or tv – and many are never able to relate to music in the same way .
new york university 's cusick told of one former guantanamo detainee who had once been a great fan of garage and hard rock .
" he seldom listens to music of any kind now .
he 's extremely sensitive to ambient sound , " she said .
" he remains paranoid now four years after his capture and imprisonment .
he believes that he could be picked up at anytime and consequently he 's afraid to go out of his house . "
not torture – just interrogation , say authorities the us has never considered its use of music during interrogation to be torture at all .
us authorities described it as an enhanced interrogation technique – the same term used to describe sleep deprivation , stress positions and water-boarding .
last year us president barack obama ordered an end to the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques , limiting the cia to interrogation methods explicitly outlined in the us army field manual on interrogations .
the use of music during interrogations is not one of the currently accepted interrogation methods .
stacy sullivan , a new york-based counter-terrorism expert with international ngo human rights watch , said that the organization has no evidence that the use of music during interrogations is on the increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama ordered an end to " harsh interrogation techniques " in 2009 yet there is some evidence that the practise still enjoys widespread use .
wenk-ansohn from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims said that the center is seeing a growing number patients who have been subjected to treatment involving music , including those who have come from turkey , iraq and iran .
dr. julia duchrow from amnesty international germany said these techniques violate the international declaration of human rights and should be recognized as torture " because the music is used intentionally to make someone suffer and create pain in the brains and the mental health of the person . "
duchrow added that germany , like other countries that have signed declarations that prohibit torture , has a responsibility to fight against torture in all its forms .
while some musicians like james hetfield of metallica may not publicly object to their music being used to interrogate suspected terrorists , others like tom morello from the politically active rage against the machine are angry that their music has been used to hurt people .
they and over 25 other bands , as well as amnesty international , are engaged in an ongoing campaign to end the use of music as an instrument of torture .

human rights groups say that in recent years there 's been an increase in the use of these invisible torture techniques , though the use of music as a torture instrument dates back centuries .
" we know that even from ancient history , extremely loud sounds were used to terrify populations before the army was going to invade the next day , " said dr suzanne cusick , a musicologist at new york university .
" we know that people would be put in caves so that the resonant qualities of the stone would make small sounds seem ubiquitous and extremely loud , " she added .
" but we can now do that for hundreds of people at a time and we do n't depend on a cave to do it . "
invisible torture techniques go back decades modern use of music and sound during interrogations grew out of research from the 1950s in which the cia conducted experiments to work out how to break people psychologically .
the british subjected irish prisoners to white-noise in the 70s and the israelis made similar use of music in the 90s .
more recently , experts have accused the us military of holding suspected terrorists inside shipping containers and blasting them with a playlist including not only rock songs like metallica 's " enter sandman " but also contemporary children 's music such as barney the purple dinosaur 's " i love you " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tracks from rock group metallica have been used during prisoner interrogations " with a rhythm , it 's like beating … it gets into your head and you get a headache and you can not concentrate on anything else , " said physician and psychotherapist dr mechthild wenk-ansohn , from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims .
the center treats around 500 children and adults from over 50 countries every year , all of them victims of torture or war-related violence .
music is a particularly versatile form of psychological interrogation as it can be tailored to cause maximum discomfort for specific prisoners .
" in turkey it was used that they played very patriotic music or march music -lsb- to -rsb- these two kurds who had been fighting for their independence .
so this was a way to humiliate them , " wenk-ansohn said .
many survivors suffer flashbacks from acoustic triggers in everyday life – anything from a neighbor 's radio , a car stereo , shopping centers or tv – and many are never able to relate to music in the same way .
new york university 's cusick told of one former guantanamo detainee who had once been a great fan of garage and hard rock .
" he seldom listens to music of any kind now .
he 's extremely sensitive to ambient sound , " she said .
" he remains paranoid now four years after his capture and imprisonment .
he believes that he could be picked up at anytime and consequently he 's afraid to go out of his house . "
not torture – just interrogation , say authorities the us has never considered its use of music during interrogation to be torture at all .
us authorities described it as an enhanced interrogation technique – the same term used to describe sleep deprivation , stress positions and water-boarding .
last year us president barack obama ordered an end to the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques , limiting the cia to interrogation methods explicitly outlined in the us army field manual on interrogations .
the use of music during interrogations is not one of the currently accepted interrogation methods .
stacy sullivan , a new york-based counter-terrorism expert with international ngo human rights watch , said that the organization has no evidence that the use of music during interrogations is on the increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama ordered an end to " harsh interrogation techniques " in 2009 yet there is some evidence that the practise still enjoys widespread use .
wenk-ansohn from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims said that the center is seeing a growing number patients who have been subjected to treatment involving music , including those who have come from turkey , iraq and iran .
dr. julia duchrow from amnesty international germany said these techniques violate the international declaration of human rights and should be recognized as torture " because the music is used intentionally to make someone suffer and create pain in the brains and the mental health of the person . "
duchrow added that germany , like other countries that have signed declarations that prohibit torture , has a responsibility to fight against torture in all its forms .
while some musicians like james hetfield of metallica may not publicly object to their music being used to interrogate suspected terrorists , others like tom morello from the politically active rage against the machine are angry that their music has been used to hurt people .
they and over 25 other bands , as well as amnesty international , are engaged in an ongoing campaign to end the use of music as an instrument of torture .

but the victims themselves need no reminder .
many are left not with bruises or broken bones , but with emotional and psychological scars that remain years after the torture has ceased – and music is being used by some as torture instrument of choice .
" you lose control and start to hallucinate .
you 're pushed to a threshold , and you realize that insanity is lurking on the other side .

i saw that threshold several times , " said binyam mohamed in an interview with uk prisoners ' advocacy organization reprieve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : binyam mohamed suffered harsh interrogation techniques in guantanamo mohamed , a former inmate at the " dark prison " in afghanistan and later at the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , is one of an untold number of victims of so-called " no-touch " torture techniques .
these are psychological techniques , often employed during interrogations , that leave few or no physical marks on the victim but can have lasting psychological consequences .
music used as part of ' cruel and degrading ' treatment mohamed described an interrogation period of almost three weeks , during which he was hung up in stress positions and allowed to sleep only occasionally and for a few hours at a time , as music played at ear-splitting volumes .
this music changed from tracks by popular rappers eminem and dr dre to " horrible ghost laughter and halloween sounds " , mohamed said .
" the cia worked on people , including me , day and night - plenty lost their minds .
i could hear people knocking their heads against the walls and the doors , screaming their heads off " , he added .
in february this year , the united kingdom court of appeal ruled that mohamed 's treatment at the hands of united states authorities was " cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment " .

" we know that even from ancient history , extremely loud sounds were used to terrify populations before the army was going to invade the next day , " said dr suzanne cusick , a musicologist at new york university .
" we know that people would be put in caves so that the resonant qualities of the stone would make small sounds seem ubiquitous and extremely loud , " she added .
" but we can now do that for hundreds of people at a time and we do n't depend on a cave to do it . "
invisible torture techniques go back decades modern use of music and sound during interrogations grew out of research from the 1950s in which the cia conducted experiments to work out how to break people psychologically .
the british subjected irish prisoners to white-noise in the 70s and the israelis made similar use of music in the 90s .
more recently , experts have accused the us military of holding suspected terrorists inside shipping containers and blasting them with a playlist including not only rock songs like metallica 's " enter sandman " but also contemporary children 's music such as barney the purple dinosaur 's " i love you " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tracks from rock group metallica have been used during prisoner interrogations " with a rhythm , it 's like beating … it gets into your head and you get a headache and you can not concentrate on anything else , " said physician and psychotherapist dr mechthild wenk-ansohn , from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims .
the center treats around 500 children and adults from over 50 countries every year , all of them victims of torture or war-related violence .
music is a particularly versatile form of psychological interrogation as it can be tailored to cause maximum discomfort for specific prisoners .
" in turkey it was used that they played very patriotic music or march music -lsb- to -rsb- these two kurds who had been fighting for their independence .
so this was a way to humiliate them , " wenk-ansohn said .
many survivors suffer flashbacks from acoustic triggers in everyday life – anything from a neighbor 's radio , a car stereo , shopping centers or tv – and many are never able to relate to music in the same way .
new york university 's cusick told of one former guantanamo detainee who had once been a great fan of garage and hard rock .
" he seldom listens to music of any kind now .
he 's extremely sensitive to ambient sound , " she said .
" he remains paranoid now four years after his capture and imprisonment .
he believes that he could be picked up at anytime and consequently he 's afraid to go out of his house . "
not torture – just interrogation , say authorities the us has never considered its use of music during interrogation to be torture at all .
us authorities described it as an enhanced interrogation technique – the same term used to describe sleep deprivation , stress positions and water-boarding .
last year us president barack obama ordered an end to the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques , limiting the cia to interrogation methods explicitly outlined in the us army field manual on interrogations .
the use of music during interrogations is not one of the currently accepted interrogation methods .
stacy sullivan , a new york-based counter-terrorism expert with international ngo human rights watch , said that the organization has no evidence that the use of music during interrogations is on the increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama ordered an end to " harsh interrogation techniques " in 2009 yet there is some evidence that the practise still enjoys widespread use .
wenk-ansohn from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims said that the center is seeing a growing number patients who have been subjected to treatment involving music , including those who have come from turkey , iraq and iran .
dr. julia duchrow from amnesty international germany said these techniques violate the international declaration of human rights and should be recognized as torture " because the music is used intentionally to make someone suffer and create pain in the brains and the mental health of the person . "
duchrow added that germany , like other countries that have signed declarations that prohibit torture , has a responsibility to fight against torture in all its forms .
while some musicians like james hetfield of metallica may not publicly object to their music being used to interrogate suspected terrorists , others like tom morello from the politically active rage against the machine are angry that their music has been used to hurt people .
they and over 25 other bands , as well as amnesty international , are engaged in an ongoing campaign to end the use of music as an instrument of torture .

" i think there is a real opportunity to put the bilateral relations on to a new footing , " cameron said at the group of eight summit in huntsville , canada .
the two leaders met for an hour of bilateral talks on friday on the sidelines of the summit of the world 's leading economies .
they agreed to maintain regular contact and to encourage their foreign ministers to work more closely together .
medvedev agreed there was a new opportunity to set things right .
" we agreed that our bilateral relationship required the personal attention of the leaders of the two countries both in terms of the economy and other issues and we are determined to make them more productive and intense , " he said .
relationship free-fall british-russian relations hit a post-soviet low in 2006 after the fatal poisoning of former russian spy alexander litvinenko in london with a radioactive isotope .
british authorities sought to have russian parliament member andrei lugovol extradited in connection with litvinenko 's death , but moscow refused .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : litvinenko 's death worsened relations between russia and britain britain granted political asylum to some of the kremlin 's enemies and refused to extradite boris berezovsky , a russian billionaire and critic of the russian government .
berezovsky was convicted in absentia of fraud and embezzlement in russia .
the dispute over his extradition led britain to expel russian diplomats , moving russia to follow suit and to shut down two branches of the british council , a cultural and educational organization connected to the british foreign ministry .
the defrosting of uk-russia follows a warm-up between washington and moscow , which agreed last year to a " reset " of their relationship .
last thursday , us presidents barack obama and medvedev met in washington , where they dodged superpower protocol to slip out to one of the us leader 's favorite burger joints .

but the victims themselves need no reminder .
many are left not with bruises or broken bones , but with emotional and psychological scars that remain years after the torture has ceased – and music is being used by some as torture instrument of choice .
" you lose control and start to hallucinate .
you 're pushed to a threshold , and you realize that insanity is lurking on the other side .
and once you cross that line , there 's no going back .
i saw that threshold several times , " said binyam mohamed in an interview with uk prisoners ' advocacy organization reprieve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : binyam mohamed suffered harsh interrogation techniques in guantanamo mohamed , a former inmate at the " dark prison " in afghanistan and later at the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , is one of an untold number of victims of so-called " no-touch " torture techniques .
these are psychological techniques , often employed during interrogations , that leave few or no physical marks on the victim but can have lasting psychological consequences .
music used as part of ' cruel and degrading ' treatment mohamed described an interrogation period of almost three weeks , during which he was hung up in stress positions and allowed to sleep only occasionally and for a few hours at a time , as music played at ear-splitting volumes .
this music changed from tracks by popular rappers eminem and dr dre to " horrible ghost laughter and halloween sounds " , mohamed said .
" the cia worked on people , including me , day and night - plenty lost their minds .
i could hear people knocking their heads against the walls and the doors , screaming their heads off " , he added .
in february this year , the united kingdom court of appeal ruled that mohamed 's treatment at the hands of united states authorities was " cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some former guantanamo bay detainees claim they were tortured with music another former guantanamo detainee , ruhal ahmed , described the musical torture as more brutal than physical abuse .
" it 's as if you had very bad migraines , and then someone shows up and yells at you – and take that times a thousand .
you ca n't concentrate on anything , " he told german weekly der spiegel .
" before that , when i was beaten , i could use my imagination to forget the pain .
but the music makes you completely disoriented .
it takes over your brain . "
human rights groups say that in recent years there 's been an increase in the use of these invisible torture techniques , though the use of music as a torture instrument dates back centuries .
" we know that even from ancient history , extremely loud sounds were used to terrify populations before the army was going to invade the next day , " said dr suzanne cusick , a musicologist at new york university .
" we know that people would be put in caves so that the resonant qualities of the stone would make small sounds seem ubiquitous and extremely loud , " she added .
" but we can now do that for hundreds of people at a time and we do n't depend on a cave to do it . "
invisible torture techniques go back decades modern use of music and sound during interrogations grew out of research from the 1950s in which the cia conducted experiments to work out how to break people psychologically .
the british subjected irish prisoners to white-noise in the 70s and the israelis made similar use of music in the 90s .
more recently , experts have accused the us military of holding suspected terrorists inside shipping containers and blasting them with a playlist including not only rock songs like metallica 's " enter sandman " but also contemporary children 's music such as barney the purple dinosaur 's " i love you " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tracks from rock group metallica have been used during prisoner interrogations " with a rhythm , it 's like beating … it gets into your head and you get a headache and you can not concentrate on anything else , " said physician and psychotherapist dr mechthild wenk-ansohn , from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims .
the center treats around 500 children and adults from over 50 countries every year , all of them victims of torture or war-related violence .
music is a particularly versatile form of psychological interrogation as it can be tailored to cause maximum discomfort for specific prisoners .
" in turkey it was used that they played very patriotic music or march music -lsb- to -rsb- these two kurds who had been fighting for their independence .
so this was a way to humiliate them , " wenk-ansohn said .
many survivors suffer flashbacks from acoustic triggers in everyday life – anything from a neighbor 's radio , a car stereo , shopping centers or tv – and many are never able to relate to music in the same way .
new york university 's cusick told of one former guantanamo detainee who had once been a great fan of garage and hard rock .
" he seldom listens to music of any kind now .
he 's extremely sensitive to ambient sound , " she said .
" he remains paranoid now four years after his capture and imprisonment .
he believes that he could be picked up at anytime and consequently he 's afraid to go out of his house . "
not torture – just interrogation , say authorities the us has never considered its use of music during interrogation to be torture at all .
us authorities described it as an enhanced interrogation technique – the same term used to describe sleep deprivation , stress positions and water-boarding .
last year us president barack obama ordered an end to the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques , limiting the cia to interrogation methods explicitly outlined in the us army field manual on interrogations .
the use of music during interrogations is not one of the currently accepted interrogation methods .
stacy sullivan , a new york-based counter-terrorism expert with international ngo human rights watch , said that the organization has no evidence that the use of music during interrogations is on the increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama ordered an end to " harsh interrogation techniques " in 2009 yet there is some evidence that the practise still enjoys widespread use .
wenk-ansohn from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims said that the center is seeing a growing number patients who have been subjected to treatment involving music , including those who have come from turkey , iraq and iran .
dr. julia duchrow from amnesty international germany said these techniques violate the international declaration of human rights and should be recognized as torture " because the music is used intentionally to make someone suffer and create pain in the brains and the mental health of the person . "
duchrow added that germany , like other countries that have signed declarations that prohibit torture , has a responsibility to fight against torture in all its forms .
while some musicians like james hetfield of metallica may not publicly object to their music being used to interrogate suspected terrorists , others like tom morello from the politically active rage against the machine are angry that their music has been used to hurt people .
they and over 25 other bands , as well as amnesty international , are engaged in an ongoing campaign to end the use of music as an instrument of torture .

but the victims themselves need no reminder .
many are left not with bruises or broken bones , but with emotional and psychological scars that remain years after the torture has ceased – and music is being used by some as torture instrument of choice .
" you lose control and start to hallucinate .
you 're pushed to a threshold , and you realize that insanity is lurking on the other side .
and once you cross that line , there 's no going back .
i saw that threshold several times , " said binyam mohamed in an interview with uk prisoners ' advocacy organization reprieve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : binyam mohamed suffered harsh interrogation techniques in guantanamo mohamed , a former inmate at the " dark prison " in afghanistan and later at the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , is one of an untold number of victims of so-called " no-touch " torture techniques .
these are psychological techniques , often employed during interrogations , that leave few or no physical marks on the victim but can have lasting psychological consequences .
music used as part of ' cruel and degrading ' treatment mohamed described an interrogation period of almost three weeks , during which he was hung up in stress positions and allowed to sleep only occasionally and for a few hours at a time , as music played at ear-splitting volumes .
this music changed from tracks by popular rappers eminem and dr dre to " horrible ghost laughter and halloween sounds " , mohamed said .
" the cia worked on people , including me , day and night - plenty lost their minds .
i could hear people knocking their heads against the walls and the doors , screaming their heads off " , he added .
in february this year , the united kingdom court of appeal ruled that mohamed 's treatment at the hands of united states authorities was " cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some former guantanamo bay detainees claim they were tortured with music another former guantanamo detainee , ruhal ahmed , described the musical torture as more brutal than physical abuse .
" it 's as if you had very bad migraines , and then someone shows up and yells at you – and take that times a thousand .
you ca n't concentrate on anything , " he told german weekly der spiegel .
" before that , when i was beaten , i could use my imagination to forget the pain .
but the music makes you completely disoriented .
it takes over your brain . "
human rights groups say that in recent years there 's been an increase in the use of these invisible torture techniques , though the use of music as a torture instrument dates back centuries .
" we know that even from ancient history , extremely loud sounds were used to terrify populations before the army was going to invade the next day , " said dr suzanne cusick , a musicologist at new york university .
" we know that people would be put in caves so that the resonant qualities of the stone would make small sounds seem ubiquitous and extremely loud , " she added .
" but we can now do that for hundreds of people at a time and we do n't depend on a cave to do it . "
invisible torture techniques go back decades modern use of music and sound during interrogations grew out of research from the 1950s in which the cia conducted experiments to work out how to break people psychologically .
the british subjected irish prisoners to white-noise in the 70s and the israelis made similar use of music in the 90s .
more recently , experts have accused the us military of holding suspected terrorists inside shipping containers and blasting them with a playlist including not only rock songs like metallica 's " enter sandman " but also contemporary children 's music such as barney the purple dinosaur 's " i love you " .

meanwhile , the summit of the wider group of g-20 has begun in canada . g-8 leaders did n't pull any punches after their summit in huntsville , canada , this weekend , issuing a final communique critical of iran , north korea , israel , and afghanistan .
the leaders of the world 's eight richest countries called on iran to hold a " transparent dialogue " over its suspect nuclear program , as iranian leader mahmoud ahmedinejad prepares to unveil his conditions for talks .
" we are profoundly concerned by iran 's continued lack of transparency regarding its nuclear activities and its stated intention to continue and expand enriching uranium , including to nearly 20 percent , " g-8 leaders said in their final communique .
" our goal is to persuade iran 's leaders to engage in a transparent dialogue about its nuclear activities and to meet iran 's international obligations , " they wrote , while simultaneously welcoming a deal between iran , turkey and brazil designed to rein in the country 's nuclear enrichment program .
the west believes iran is seeking nuclear weapons , while tehran says its nuclear program is peaceful and is only meant to meet its energy needs . north korea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eight most powerful nations focused on trouble spots around the world the leaders of germany , britain , canada , france , italy , japan , russia and the united states also expressed their " gravest concern about the nuclear test and missile activities " carried out by north korea , reiterating that the country can not become a nuclear power under the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . they also condemned the sinking of a south korean submarine in march , adjudged to have been carried out by the north , that killed 24 sailors near the countries ' disputed maritime border .
" we demand the democratic people 's republic of korea refrain from committing any attacks or threatening hostilities against the republic of korea , " the group concluded .
israel and gaza bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 condemned an israeli raid on this aid flotilla the group 's joint statement welcomed israel 's promise to loosen its blockade on the hamas-run gaza strip , as leaders said they " urge full and effective implementation of this policy in order to address the needs of gaza 's population for humanitarian and commercial goods , civilian reconstruction and infrastructure , and legitimate economic activity . "
" the current arrangements are not sustainable and must be changed . "
the long-standing blockade of the territory came into sharp focus this month after israeli troops stormed a gaza-bound flotilla of aid ships in international waters on may 31 .
the boats were trying to defy the blockade , saying they were taking humanitarian supplies to the region .
the g-8 leaders said they deeply regretted the deaths of nine activists during this israeli intervention .
afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama accepting mcchrystal 's resignation put the afghan mission back in the spotlight finally , the leaders used their chance to address the conflict in afghanistan , days after the sudden resignation of the isaf force 's commanding general , stanley mcchrystal , who has since been replaced by senior us military general , david petraeus .
offering their full support to the current strategy in afghanistan , ahead of a number of major military operations in the country , the g-8 statement said afghan soldiers should be in a position to start taking responsibility for the country 's security " within five years . "
the leaders described the coming months and years as an opportunity for president hamid karzai 's embattled government to improve its performance , " including measures to combat corruption , address illicit drug production and trafficking , improve human rights , -lrb- and -rrb- improve provision of basic services and governance .

meanwhile , the summit of the wider group of g-20 has begun in canada . g-8 leaders did n't pull any punches after their summit in huntsville , canada , this weekend , issuing a final communique critical of iran , north korea , israel , and afghanistan .
the leaders of the world 's eight richest countries called on iran to hold a " transparent dialogue " over its suspect nuclear program , as iranian leader mahmoud ahmedinejad prepares to unveil his conditions for talks .
" we are profoundly concerned by iran 's continued lack of transparency regarding its nuclear activities and its stated intention to continue and expand enriching uranium , including to nearly 20 percent , " g-8 leaders said in their final communique .
" our goal is to persuade iran 's leaders to engage in a transparent dialogue about its nuclear activities and to meet iran 's international obligations , " they wrote , while simultaneously welcoming a deal between iran , turkey and brazil designed to rein in the country 's nuclear enrichment program .
the west believes iran is seeking nuclear weapons , while tehran says its nuclear program is peaceful and is only meant to meet its energy needs . north korea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eight most powerful nations focused on trouble spots around the world the leaders of germany , britain , canada , france , italy , japan , russia and the united states also expressed their " gravest concern about the nuclear test and missile activities " carried out by north korea , reiterating that the country can not become a nuclear power under the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . they also condemned the sinking of a south korean submarine in march , adjudged to have been carried out by the north , that killed 24 sailors near the countries ' disputed maritime border .
" we demand the democratic people 's republic of korea refrain from committing any attacks or threatening hostilities against the republic of korea , " the group concluded .
israel and gaza bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 condemned an israeli raid on this aid flotilla the group 's joint statement welcomed israel 's promise to loosen its blockade on the hamas-run gaza strip , as leaders said they " urge full and effective implementation of this policy in order to address the needs of gaza 's population for humanitarian and commercial goods , civilian reconstruction and infrastructure , and legitimate economic activity . "
" the current arrangements are not sustainable and must be changed . "
the long-standing blockade of the territory came into sharp focus this month after israeli troops stormed a gaza-bound flotilla of aid ships in international waters on may 31 .
the boats were trying to defy the blockade , saying they were taking humanitarian supplies to the region .
the g-8 leaders said they deeply regretted the deaths of nine activists during this israeli intervention .
afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama accepting mcchrystal 's resignation put the afghan mission back in the spotlight finally , the leaders used their chance to address the conflict in afghanistan , days after the sudden resignation of the isaf force 's commanding general , stanley mcchrystal , who has since been replaced by senior us military general , david petraeus .
offering their full support to the current strategy in afghanistan , ahead of a number of major military operations in the country , the g-8 statement said afghan soldiers should be in a position to start taking responsibility for the country 's security " within five years . "
the leaders described the coming months and years as an opportunity for president hamid karzai 's embattled government to improve its performance , " including measures to combat corruption , address illicit drug production and trafficking , improve human rights , -lrb- and -rrb- improve provision of basic services and governance . "

this comes as something of an embarrassment for the rail operator . the european commission , the eu 's executive body , is taking the german government to court over non-compliance with the bloc ’ s competition rules in the rail market . the commission says the rail network operator db netz is not independent enough of state-owned deutsche bahn 's passenger and freight services , and the dispute has ended up in the european court of justice in luxembourg . brussels initiated proceedings over contractual violations two years ago and a report in the financial times deutschland quoted the spokesman for transport commissioner siim kallas as saying on thursday that " since then , germany has made no progress whatsoever . " the lawsuit comes as a serious blow to deutsche bahn , whose ceo ruediger grube has for months been complaining about the rail market in europe not being adequately liberalized . commenting on the european commission 's move , reinhard boeckh , head of the press office of deutsche bahn told deutsche welle : " this is the end of a process that ’ s been going on for years .
in this regard the position of the german government is the same as that of deutsche bahn .
the government is on our side . " " in germany , we have a rail market where there 's much more competition than in the rest of europe .
there are over 320 companies operating in this sector .
you don ’ t find that in any other european country , " he added . ceo grube had accused the french of " flagrant competition violations . "
in contrast , he said : " germany 's rail services are operating fairly , " referring to the fact that while any foreign rail company can operate in germany , the same is not possible in france . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the case is being dealt with at the european court of justice in luxembourg " the french government put up every obstacle it could to liberalizing the rail sector across the european union earlier this year , " boeckh said . ec clampdown but the european commission is not convinced that the german rail market is operating in a fair manner .
it wants to make it impossible for board members of railway companies to influence the allocation of sections of track to competitors and charge for the use of the track . and according to eu regulations , board members of deutsche bahn are not supposed to sit on the board of a railway infrastructure provider such as db netz at the same time .
board executives are not allowed to move between the holding and the network operator . boeckh , however , maintains that the organizational structure of the boards does not violate european commission regulations . " db netz , which is responsible for distributing tracks , comes under the board of deutsche bahn but it is separated , that is , its decisions are not discussed with the rest of deutsche bahn .
there is in fact a european commission regulation that allows this sort of a setup , " he told deutsche welle . some analysts say that since grube took over the reins of deutsche bahn just over a year ago , the close ties between the holding and its operating company , db mobility logistics – which besides carrying freight is also responsible for passenger transportation – have increased . boeckh confirmed that five managers are simultaneously on the boards of both companies . germany 's supreme administrative court also recently objected to the personnel links .
the judges ruled that legal advisers of the holding company can not advise db netz in the future on issues involving the allocation of tracks to competitors . buses to offer competition on thursday , the same court dealt a further blow to deutsche bahn , ruling that long-distance bus operators can compete with trains in germany but on condition that the price they offer for a particular route is considerably lower than the one offered by db . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo grube has complained about a lack of liberalization in europe 's rail market the ruling looks set to transform public transportation in germany .
until now , there have been few national bus services in the country with the exception of those operating from and to berlin .
this is in keeping with a clause in the public transport act of 1931 which allows national bus routes only in exceptional cases and only if deutsche bahn does not object . the privilege was due to come to an end by 2011 at the latest , in accordance with the agreement between the members of germany 's governing coalition . eyeing uk high-speed railway these developments come at a particularly awkward time for germany 's national rail operator , which is itself looking to expand in europe . this week , deutsche bahn was reported to be in talks with britain about running its trains on the country 's only high-speed railway .
this move could break the monopoly of rival eurostar , which uses the high speed 1 -lrb- hs1 -rrb- line . " we are discussing several options with them -lrb- deutsche bahn -rrb- , " mark bayley , head of state-owned london and continental railways -lrb- lcr -rrb- confirmed . lcr , which operates the high-speed , 110-kilometer railway linking london and the channel tunnel has a 30-year concession to run the high-speed line and stations . bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn is seeking to dominate the rail market both at home and abroad ' divestment in line with liberalization ' deutsche bahn has expressed interest in running direct rail connections between london and the continent following the liberalization of the european cross-border rail passenger market at the start of the year . this comes on the back of the company 's takeover of british transport group arriva to create europe 's no.1 passenger carrier .
the 1.58 billion pound -lrb- € 1.91 billion , $ 2.36 billion -rrb- deal saw the german rail operator enlarging its footprint in rail , bus and logistics services outside of germany . while london 's bid to reduce a budget deficit of nearly 11 percent of gdp is the primary reason behind the sale of hs1 , bayley said the divestment would also be in line with a european trend of removing conflicts in rail . " high speed 1 will no longer feel any incentive to act in the interest of eurostar , " he said .
" the european union wishes to see regulators enforcing this principle of a separation of the commercial and management interests of infrastructure and operation . "

meanwhile , the summit of the wider group of g-20 has begun in canada . g-8 leaders did n't pull any punches after their summit in huntsville , canada , this weekend , issuing a final communique critical of iran , north korea , israel , and afghanistan .
the leaders of the world 's eight richest countries called on iran to hold a " transparent dialogue " over its suspect nuclear program , as iranian leader mahmoud ahmedinejad prepares to unveil his conditions for talks .
" we are profoundly concerned by iran 's continued lack of transparency regarding its nuclear activities and its stated intention to continue and expand enriching uranium , including to nearly 20 percent , " g-8 leaders said in their final communique .
" our goal is to persuade iran 's leaders to engage in a transparent dialogue about its nuclear activities and to meet iran 's international obligations , " they wrote , while simultaneously welcoming a deal between iran , turkey and brazil designed to rein in the country 's nuclear enrichment program .
the west believes iran is seeking nuclear weapons , while tehran says its nuclear program is peaceful and is only meant to meet its energy needs . north korea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eight most powerful nations focused on trouble spots around the world the leaders of germany , britain , canada , france , italy , japan , russia and the united states also expressed their " gravest concern about the nuclear test and missile activities " carried out by north korea , reiterating that the country can not become a nuclear power under the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . they also condemned the sinking of a south korean submarine in march , adjudged to have been carried out by the north , that killed 24 sailors near the countries ' disputed maritime border .
" we demand the democratic people 's republic of korea refrain from committing any attacks or threatening hostilities against the republic of korea , " the group concluded .
israel and gaza bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 condemned an israeli raid on this aid flotilla the group 's joint statement welcomed israel 's promise to loosen its blockade on the hamas-run gaza strip , as leaders said they " urge full and effective implementation of this policy in order to address the needs of gaza 's population for humanitarian and commercial goods , civilian reconstruction and infrastructure , and legitimate economic activity . "
" the current arrangements are not sustainable and must be changed . "
the long-standing blockade of the territory came into sharp focus this month after israeli troops stormed a gaza-bound flotilla of aid ships in international waters on may 31 .
the boats were trying to defy the blockade , saying they were taking humanitarian supplies to the region .
the g-8 leaders said they deeply regretted the deaths of nine activists during this israeli intervention .
afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama accepting mcchrystal 's resignation put the afghan mission back in the spotlight finally , the leaders used their chance to address the conflict in afghanistan , days after the sudden resignation of the isaf force 's commanding general , stanley mcchrystal , who has since been replaced by senior us military general , david petraeus .
offering their full support to the current strategy in afghanistan , ahead of a number of major military operations in the country , the g-8 statement said afghan soldiers should be in a position to start taking responsibility for the country 's security " within five years . "
the leaders described the coming months and years as an opportunity for president hamid karzai 's embattled government to improve its performance , " including measures to combat corruption , address illicit drug production and trafficking , improve human rights , -lrb- and -rrb- improve provision of basic services and governance .

the leaders of the world 's eight richest countries called on iran to hold a " transparent dialogue " over its suspect nuclear program , as iranian leader mahmoud ahmedinejad prepares to unveil his conditions for talks .
" we are profoundly concerned by iran 's continued lack of transparency regarding its nuclear activities and its stated intention to continue and expand enriching uranium , including to nearly 20 percent , " g-8 leaders said in their final communique .
" our goal is to persuade iran 's leaders to engage in a transparent dialogue about its nuclear activities and to meet iran 's international obligations , " they wrote , while simultaneously welcoming a deal between iran , turkey and brazil designed to rein in the country 's nuclear enrichment program .

" we demand the democratic people 's republic of korea refrain from committing any attacks or threatening hostilities against the republic of korea , " the group concluded .

"
" the current arrangements are not sustainable and must be changed . "
the long-standing blockade of the territory came into sharp focus this month after israeli troops stormed a gaza-bound flotilla of aid ships in international waters on may 31 .
the boats were trying to defy the blockade , saying they were taking humanitarian supplies to the region .
the g-8 leaders said they deeply regretted the deaths of nine activists during this israeli intervention .

offering their full support to the current strategy in afghanistan , ahead of a number of major military operations in the country , the g-8 statement said afghan soldiers should be in a position to start taking responsibility for the country 's security " within five years . "
the leaders described the coming months and years as an opportunity for president hamid karzai 's embattled government to improve its performance , " including measures to combat corruption , address illicit drug production and trafficking , improve human rights , -lrb- and -rrb- improve provision of basic services and governance . "

but the victims themselves need no reminder .
many are left not with bruises or broken bones , but with emotional and psychological scars that remain years after the torture has ceased – and music is being used by some as torture instrument of choice .
" you lose control and start to hallucinate .
you 're pushed to a threshold , and you realize that insanity is lurking on the other side .
and once you cross that line , there 's no going back .
i saw that threshold several times , " said binyam mohamed in an interview with uk prisoners ' advocacy organization reprieve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : binyam mohamed suffered harsh interrogation techniques in guantanamo mohamed , a former inmate at the " dark prison " in afghanistan and later at the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , is one of an untold number of victims of so-called " no-touch " torture techniques .
these are psychological techniques , often employed during interrogations , that leave few or no physical marks on the victim but can have lasting psychological consequences .
music used as part of ' cruel and degrading ' treatment mohamed described an interrogation period of almost three weeks , during which he was hung up in stress positions and allowed to sleep only occasionally and for a few hours at a time , as music played at ear-splitting volumes .
this music changed from tracks by popular rappers eminem and dr dre to " horrible ghost laughter and halloween sounds " , mohamed said .
" the cia worked on people , including me , day and night - plenty lost their minds .
i could hear people knocking their heads against the walls and the doors , screaming their heads off " , he added .
in february this year , the united kingdom court of appeal ruled that mohamed 's treatment at the hands of united states authorities was " cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some former guantanamo bay detainees claim they were tortured with music another former guantanamo detainee , ruhal ahmed , described the musical torture as more brutal than physical abuse .
" it 's as if you had very bad migraines , and then someone shows up and yells at you – and take that times a thousand .
you ca n't concentrate on anything , " he told german weekly der spiegel .
" before that , when i was beaten , i could use my imagination to forget the pain .
but the music makes you completely disoriented .
it takes over your brain . "
human rights groups say that in recent years there 's been an increase in the use of these invisible torture techniques , though the use of music as a torture instrument dates back centuries .
" we know that even from ancient history , extremely loud sounds were used to terrify populations before the army was going to invade the next day , " said dr suzanne cusick , a musicologist at new york university .
" we know that people would be put in caves so that the resonant qualities of the stone would make small sounds seem ubiquitous and extremely loud , " she added .
" but we can now do that for hundreds of people at a time and we do n't depend on a cave to do it . "
invisible torture techniques go back decades modern use of music and sound during interrogations grew out of research from the 1950s in which the cia conducted experiments to work out how to break people psychologically .
the british subjected irish prisoners to white-noise in the 70s and the israelis made similar use of music in the 90s .
more recently , experts have accused the us military of holding suspected terrorists inside shipping containers and blasting them with a playlist including not only rock songs like metallica 's " enter sandman " but also contemporary children 's music such as barney the purple dinosaur 's " i love you " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tracks from rock group metallica have been used during prisoner interrogations " with a rhythm , it 's like beating … it gets into your head and you get a headache and you can not concentrate on anything else , " said physician and psychotherapist dr mechthild wenk-ansohn , from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims .
the center treats around 500 children and adults from over 50 countries every year , all of them victims of torture or war-related violence .
music is a particularly versatile form of psychological interrogation as it can be tailored to cause maximum discomfort for specific prisoners .
" in turkey it was used that they played very patriotic music or march music -lsb- to -rsb- these two kurds who had been fighting for their independence .
so this was a way to humiliate them , " wenk-ansohn said .
many survivors suffer flashbacks from acoustic triggers in everyday life – anything from a neighbor 's radio , a car stereo , shopping centers or tv – and many are never able to relate to music in the same way .
new york university 's cusick told of one former guantanamo detainee who had once been a great fan of garage and hard rock .
" he seldom listens to music of any kind now .
he 's extremely sensitive to ambient sound , " she said .
" he remains paranoid now four years after his capture and imprisonment .
he believes that he could be picked up at anytime and consequently he 's afraid to go out of his house . "
not torture – just interrogation , say authorities the us has never considered its use of music during interrogation to be torture at all .
us authorities described it as an enhanced interrogation technique – the same term used to describe sleep deprivation , stress positions and water-boarding .
last year us president barack obama ordered an end to the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques , limiting the cia to interrogation methods explicitly outlined in the us army field manual on interrogations .
the use of music during interrogations is not one of the currently accepted interrogation methods .
stacy sullivan , a new york-based counter-terrorism expert with international ngo human rights watch , said that the organization has no evidence that the use of music during interrogations is on the increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama ordered an end to " harsh interrogation techniques " in 2009 yet there is some evidence that the practise still enjoys widespread use .
wenk-ansohn from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims said that the center is seeing a growing number patients who have been subjected to treatment involving music , including those who have come from turkey , iraq and iran .
dr. julia duchrow from amnesty international germany said these techniques violate the international declaration of human rights and should be recognized as torture " because the music is used intentionally to make someone suffer and create pain in the brains and the mental health of the person . "
duchrow added that germany , like other countries that have signed declarations that prohibit torture , has a responsibility to fight against torture in all its forms .
while some musicians like james hetfield of metallica may not publicly object to their music being used to interrogate suspected terrorists , others like tom morello from the politically active rage against the machine are angry that their music has been used to hurt people .
they and over 25 other bands , as well as amnesty international , are engaged in an ongoing campaign to end the use of music as an instrument of torture .

of course england wants to win the world cup but if we ca n't , we at least want to be beat the germans , says dw 's nick amies . every england fan takes great pleasure in watching and re-watching the 4-2 victory over germany in the final of the 1966 world cup .
this is not only because this is the pinnacle of the national team 's success to date , but also because in winning the world cup , england stopped the germans from lifting the trophy .
it 's a two-for-the-price-of-one bargain that never gets old .
this is where an england fan 's indoctrination begins , with a joyous moment .
our national sporting obsession with germany has its roots in happiness - in the gap-toothed smile and carefree jig of midfielder nobby stiles .
the bitterness does n't begin until you 've been hooked and forced to watch more recent england vintages in the flesh .
then you have to admit that 1966 is as good as it gets .
england did n't even show up for world cup in 1974 or 1978 and our involvement in 1982 is best left unmentioned .
the main recollections of 1986 are of a squat argentinean bloke cheating us out of the tournament .
at least the fat gaucho had a hand -lrb- not literally in this case -rrb- in beating the germans in the final , so he could n't have been all that bad .
penalty pain bildunterschrift : things were equal in 1990 until the shoot-out when england players suddenly forgot how to shoot all of which brings us to italia 90 .
looking back , the only thing i now remember about that tournament is the germans in full group hug mode as england 's broken failures trudged from the pitch , vowing to practice penalties from now on .
that penalty shoot-out defeat to germany in a semi-final was traumatic , mainly because england looked as though they had a team good enough to win the cup for once .
when the european championships came to england in 1996 , the animosity towards germany was still at a pretty low level , despite the tabloids ' lazily digging up the war to try and get an already feverishly patriotic public ready for another semi-final clash against the germans .
italia 90 was an aberration .
we still had 1966 - which was only 30 years of hurt away at that point .
revenge would be ours because , you know , lightning could n't strike twice … could it ?
from today 's vantage point , there was more chance of lightning striking twice than england scoring two penalties .
two spot kicks .
penalty taker against goalkeeper .
it does n't seem that hard , does it ?
and this was a team that knew the heartbreak of losing to the germans on penalties .
surely they would n't let it happen again ?
history tells us that it did .
it also tells us that after beating england , germany went on to win the trophy , as they did in 1990 at the world cup .
one-sided " rivalry " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english tabloids dragged up war rhetoric for the 96 clash two soul-destroying defeats were enough to turn a little rivalry into a massive vendetta for the english .
with the memory of 1966 dimming fast , all that most of us had actually experienced was getting beaten by the germans .
for the germans , however , england 's obsession has never prompted anything other than mild bemusement .
as far as the germans are concerned , england are just another opponent , albeit one with a certain amount of history .
there certainly is n't the rabid reaction in germany to playing each other as there is in the uk .
germany 's grudge match is usually one played against their neighbors to the west in the netherlands .
fans in germany get excited about playing holland in much the same way as englishmen go loopy of the germans .
this fact infuriates the english further .
the rivalry should mean as much to the germans as it means to us - otherwise what 's the point of getting all stewed up about it ?
taking what we can get for england , beating germany is the pinnacle of any campaign .
that 's why a turgid 1-0 win over one of germany 's worst-ever sides in euro 2000 was celebrated like the second coming .
it did n't matter that england were dreadful too - and were n't far behind germany in getting knocked out of the tournament .
we 'd beaten the germans .
it was a hollow victory , but one still held close to english hearts .
meager as it now sounds , a 5-1 demolition in munich in a world cup qualifier a year later was even better .
it felt almost as good as 1966 .
almost .
bildunterschrift : beating even a woeful germany team , as in 2000 , is better than not beating them at all and so we meet again .
it 's 2010 , and already the highlight reels from 44 years ago are being projected onto a new generation 's formative inner eye , mythologizing events from ancient history and lionizing men who are either no longer with us or who now look very old indeed when wheeled out for comment whenever germany and england clash .
the papers , of course , are beside themselves with glee .
it 's only a matter of time before we see distasteful war-related headlines in the red tops and the demonizing of young german players who do n't much care about beating england , only about winning the world cup .
this is what the coming match should be about for us england fans - about progressing and emulating the heroes of 1966 .
instead it 's about getting one over the germans .
that 's what it 's always about for england .
we may beat germany , but even then we 'll probably meet an even stronger argentina side , managed by a certain fat gaucho , who 'll knock us out .
but we wo n't care .
we 'll have beaten the germans .
and that 's all that matters .

of course england wants to win the world cup but if we ca n't , we at least want to be beat the germans , says dw 's nick amies . every england fan takes great pleasure in watching and re-watching the 4-2 victory over germany in the final of the 1966 world cup .
this is not only because this is the pinnacle of the national team 's success to date , but also because in winning the world cup , england stopped the germans from lifting the trophy .
it 's a two-for-the-price-of-one bargain that never gets old .
this is where an england fan 's indoctrination begins , with a joyous moment .
our national sporting obsession with germany has its roots in happiness - in the gap-toothed smile and carefree jig of midfielder nobby stiles .
the bitterness does n't begin until you 've been hooked and forced to watch more recent england vintages in the flesh .
then you have to admit that 1966 is as good as it gets .
england did n't even show up for world cup in 1974 or 1978 and our involvement in 1982 is best left unmentioned .
the main recollections of 1986 are of a squat argentinean bloke cheating us out of the tournament .
at least the fat gaucho had a hand -lrb- not literally in this case -rrb- in beating the germans in the final , so he could n't have been all that bad .
penalty pain bildunterschrift : things were equal in 1990 until the shoot-out when england players suddenly forgot how to shoot all of which brings us to italia 90 .
looking back , the only thing i now remember about that tournament is the germans in full group hug mode as england 's broken failures trudged from the pitch , vowing to practice penalties from now on .
that penalty shoot-out defeat to germany in a semi-final was traumatic , mainly because england looked as though they had a team good enough to win the cup for once .
when the european championships came to england in 1996 , the animosity towards germany was still at a pretty low level , despite the tabloids ' lazily digging up the war to try and get an already feverishly patriotic public ready for another semi-final clash against the germans .
italia 90 was an aberration .
we still had 1966 - which was only 30 years of hurt away at that point .
revenge would be ours because , you know , lightning could n't strike twice … could it ?
from today 's vantage point , there was more chance of lightning striking twice than england scoring two penalties .
two spot kicks .
penalty taker against goalkeeper .
it does n't seem that hard , does it ?
and this was a team that knew the heartbreak of losing to the germans on penalties .
surely they would n't let it happen again ?
history tells us that it did .
it also tells us that after beating england , germany went on to win the trophy , as they did in 1990 at the world cup .
one-sided " rivalry " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english tabloids dragged up war rhetoric for the 96 clash two soul-destroying defeats were enough to turn a little rivalry into a massive vendetta for the english .
with the memory of 1966 dimming fast , all that most of us had actually experienced was getting beaten by the germans .
for the germans , however , england 's obsession has never prompted anything other than mild bemusement .
as far as the germans are concerned , england are just another opponent , albeit one with a certain amount of history .
there certainly is n't the rabid reaction in germany to playing each other as there is in the uk .
germany 's grudge match is usually one played against their neighbors to the west in the netherlands .
fans in germany get excited about playing holland in much the same way as englishmen go loopy of the germans .
this fact infuriates the english further .
the rivalry should mean as much to the germans as it means to us - otherwise what 's the point of getting all stewed up about it ?
taking what we can get for england , beating germany is the pinnacle of any campaign .
that 's why a turgid 1-0 win over one of germany 's worst-ever sides in euro 2000 was celebrated like the second coming .
it did n't matter that england were dreadful too - and were n't far behind germany in getting knocked out of the tournament .
we 'd beaten the germans .
it was a hollow victory , but one still held close to english hearts .
meager as it now sounds , a 5-1 demolition in munich in a world cup qualifier a year later was even better .
it felt almost as good as 1966 .
almost .
bildunterschrift : beating even a woeful germany team , as in 2000 , is better than not beating them at all and so we meet again .
it 's 2010 , and already the highlight reels from 44 years ago are being projected onto a new generation 's formative inner eye , mythologizing events from ancient history and lionizing men who are either no longer with us or who now look very old indeed when wheeled out for comment whenever germany and england clash .
the papers , of course , are beside themselves with glee .
it 's only a matter of time before we see distasteful war-related headlines in the red tops and the demonizing of young german players who do n't much care about beating england , only about winning the world cup .
this is what the coming match should be about for us england fans - about progressing and emulating the heroes of 1966 .
instead it 's about getting one over the germans .
that 's what it 's always about for england .
we may beat germany , but even then we 'll probably meet an even stronger argentina side , managed by a certain fat gaucho , who 'll knock us out .
but we wo n't care .
we 'll have beaten the germans .
and that 's all that matters .
nick amies is a life-long england supporter , and germany detractor .

but the victims themselves need no reminder .
many are left not with bruises or broken bones , but with emotional and psychological scars that remain years after the torture has ceased – and music is being used by some as torture instrument of choice .
" you lose control and start to hallucinate .
you 're pushed to a threshold , and you realize that insanity is lurking on the other side .
and once you cross that line , there 's no going back .
i saw that threshold several times , " said binyam mohamed in an interview with uk prisoners ' advocacy organization reprieve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : binyam mohamed suffered harsh interrogation techniques in guantanamo mohamed , a former inmate at the " dark prison " in afghanistan and later at the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , is one of an untold number of victims of so-called " no-touch " torture techniques .
these are psychological techniques , often employed during interrogations , that leave few or no physical marks on the victim but can have lasting psychological consequences .
music used as part of ' cruel and degrading ' treatment mohamed described an interrogation period of almost three weeks , during which he was hung up in stress positions and allowed to sleep only occasionally and for a few hours at a time , as music played at ear-splitting volumes .
this music changed from tracks by popular rappers eminem and dr dre to " horrible ghost laughter and halloween sounds " , mohamed said .
" the cia worked on people , including me , day and night - plenty lost their minds .
i could hear people knocking their heads against the walls and the doors , screaming their heads off " , he added .
in february this year , the united kingdom court of appeal ruled that mohamed 's treatment at the hands of united states authorities was " cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some former guantanamo bay detainees claim they were tortured with music another former guantanamo detainee , ruhal ahmed , described the musical torture as more brutal than physical abuse .
" it 's as if you had very bad migraines , and then someone shows up and yells at you – and take that times a thousand .
you ca n't concentrate on anything , " he told german weekly der spiegel .
" before that , when i was beaten , i could use my imagination to forget the pain .
but the music makes you completely disoriented .
it takes over your brain . "
human rights groups say that in recent years there 's been an increase in the use of these invisible torture techniques , though the use of music as a torture instrument dates back centuries .
" we know that even from ancient history , extremely loud sounds were used to terrify populations before the army was going to invade the next day , " said dr suzanne cusick , a musicologist at new york university .
" we know that people would be put in caves so that the resonant qualities of the stone would make small sounds seem ubiquitous and extremely loud , " she added .
" but we can now do that for hundreds of people at a time and we do n't depend on a cave to do it . "
invisible torture techniques go back decades modern use of music and sound during interrogations grew out of research from the 1950s in which the cia conducted experiments to work out how to break people psychologically .
the british subjected irish prisoners to white-noise in the 70s and the israelis made similar use of music in the 90s .
more recently , experts have accused the us military of holding suspected terrorists inside shipping containers and blasting them with a playlist including not only rock songs like metallica 's " enter sandman " but also contemporary children 's music such as barney the purple dinosaur 's " i love you " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tracks from rock group metallica have been used during prisoner interrogations " with a rhythm , it 's like beating … it gets into your head and you get a headache and you can not concentrate on anything else , " said physician and psychotherapist dr mechthild wenk-ansohn , from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims .
the center treats around 500 children and adults from over 50 countries every year , all of them victims of torture or war-related violence .
music is a particularly versatile form of psychological interrogation as it can be tailored to cause maximum discomfort for specific prisoners .
" in turkey it was used that they played very patriotic music or march music -lsb- to -rsb- these two kurds who had been fighting for their independence .
so this was a way to humiliate them , " wenk-ansohn said .
many survivors suffer flashbacks from acoustic triggers in everyday life – anything from a neighbor 's radio , a car stereo , shopping centers or tv – and many are never able to relate to music in the same way .
new york university 's cusick told of one former guantanamo detainee who had once been a great fan of garage and hard rock .
" he seldom listens to music of any kind now .
he 's extremely sensitive to ambient sound , " she said .
" he remains paranoid now four years after his capture and imprisonment .
he believes that he could be picked up at anytime and consequently he 's afraid to go out of his house . "
not torture – just interrogation , say authorities the us has never considered its use of music during interrogation to be torture at all .
us authorities described it as an enhanced interrogation technique – the same term used to describe sleep deprivation , stress positions and water-boarding .
last year us president barack obama ordered an end to the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques , limiting the cia to interrogation methods explicitly outlined in the us army field manual on interrogations .
the use of music during interrogations is not one of the currently accepted interrogation methods .
stacy sullivan , a new york-based counter-terrorism expert with international ngo human rights watch , said that the organization has no evidence that the use of music during interrogations is on the increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama ordered an end to " harsh interrogation techniques " in 2009 yet there is some evidence that the practise still enjoys widespread use .
wenk-ansohn from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims said that the center is seeing a growing number patients who have been subjected to treatment involving music , including those who have come from turkey , iraq and iran .
dr. julia duchrow from amnesty international germany said these techniques violate the international declaration of human rights and should be recognized as torture " because the music is used intentionally to make someone suffer and create pain in the brains and the mental health of the person . "
duchrow added that germany , like other countries that have signed declarations that prohibit torture , has a responsibility to fight against torture in all its forms .
while some musicians like james hetfield of metallica may not publicly object to their music being used to interrogate suspected terrorists , others like tom morello from the politically active rage against the machine are angry that their music has been used to hurt people .
they and over 25 other bands , as well as amnesty international , are engaged in an ongoing campaign to end the use of music as an instrument of torture .

of course england wants to win the world cup but if we ca n't , we at least want to be beat the germans , says dw 's nick amies . every england fan takes great pleasure in watching and re-watching the 4-2 victory over germany in the final of the 1966 world cup .
this is not only because this is the pinnacle of the national team 's success to date , but also because in winning the world cup , england stopped the germans from lifting the trophy .
it 's a two-for-the-price-of-one bargain that never gets old .
this is where an england fan 's indoctrination begins , with a joyous moment .
our national sporting obsession with germany has its roots in happiness - in the gap-toothed smile and carefree jig of midfielder nobby stiles .
the bitterness does n't begin until you 've been hooked and forced to watch more recent england vintages in the flesh .
then you have to admit that 1966 is as good as it gets .
england did n't even show up for world cup in 1974 or 1978 and our involvement in 1982 is best left unmentioned .
the main recollections of 1986 are of a squat argentinean bloke cheating us out of the tournament .
at least the fat gaucho had a hand -lrb- not literally in this case -rrb- in beating the germans in the final , so he could n't have been all that bad .
penalty pain bildunterschrift : things were equal in 1990 until the shoot-out when england players suddenly forgot how to shoot all of which brings us to italia 90 .
looking back , the only thing i now remember about that tournament is the germans in full group hug mode as england 's broken failures trudged from the pitch , vowing to practice penalties from now on .
that penalty shoot-out defeat to germany in a semi-final was traumatic , mainly because england looked as though they had a team good enough to win the cup for once .
when the european championships came to england in 1996 , the animosity towards germany was still at a pretty low level , despite the tabloids ' lazily digging up the war to try and get an already feverishly patriotic public ready for another semi-final clash against the germans .
italia 90 was an aberration .
we still had 1966 - which was only 30 years of hurt away at that point .
revenge would be ours because , you know , lightning could n't strike twice … could it ?
from today 's vantage point , there was more chance of lightning striking twice than england scoring two penalties .
two spot kicks .
penalty taker against goalkeeper .
it does n't seem that hard , does it ?
and this was a team that knew the heartbreak of losing to the germans on penalties .
surely they would n't let it happen again ?
history tells us that it did .
it also tells us that after beating england , germany went on to win the trophy , as they did in 1990 at the world cup .
one-sided " rivalry " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english tabloids dragged up war rhetoric for the 96 clash two soul-destroying defeats were enough to turn a little rivalry into a massive vendetta for the english .
with the memory of 1966 dimming fast , all that most of us had actually experienced was getting beaten by the germans .
for the germans , however , england 's obsession has never prompted anything other than mild bemusement .
as far as the germans are concerned , england are just another opponent , albeit one with a certain amount of history .
there certainly is n't the rabid reaction in germany to playing each other as there is in the uk .
germany 's grudge match is usually one played against their neighbors to the west in the netherlands .
fans in germany get excited about playing holland in much the same way as englishmen go loopy of the germans .
this fact infuriates the english further .
the rivalry should mean as much to the germans as it means to us - otherwise what 's the point of getting all stewed up about it ?
taking what we can get for england , beating germany is the pinnacle of any campaign .
that 's why a turgid 1-0 win over one of germany 's worst-ever sides in euro 2000 was celebrated like the second coming .
it did n't matter that england were dreadful too - and were n't far behind germany in getting knocked out of the tournament .
we 'd beaten the germans .
it was a hollow victory , but one still held close to english hearts .
meager as it now sounds , a 5-1 demolition in munich in a world cup qualifier a year later was even better .
it felt almost as good as 1966 .
almost .
bildunterschrift : beating even a woeful germany team , as in 2000 , is better than not beating them at all and so we meet again .
it 's 2010 , and already the highlight reels from 44 years ago are being projected onto a new generation 's formative inner eye , mythologizing events from ancient history and lionizing men who are either no longer with us or who now look very old indeed when wheeled out for comment whenever germany and england clash .
the papers , of course , are beside themselves with glee .
it 's only a matter of time before we see distasteful war-related headlines in the red tops and the demonizing of young german players who do n't much care about beating england , only about winning the world cup .
this is what the coming match should be about for us england fans - about progressing and emulating the heroes of 1966 .
instead it 's about getting one over the germans .
that 's what it 's always about for england .
we may beat germany , but even then we 'll probably meet an even stronger argentina side , managed by a certain fat gaucho , who 'll knock us out .
but we wo n't care .
we 'll have beaten the germans .
and that 's all that matters .
nick amies is a life-long england supporter , and germany detractor .

protestors had hoped to outwit authorities by only revealing the site at the last minute . at least five gay rights activists were roughly arrested and taken to a police car in st. petersburg , russia after taking part in an unsanctioned rally , according to a police spokesman .
some 30 protestors had gathered outside the famous hermitage museum on palace square , shouting slogans such as " equality without compromise , " " homophobia is an illness , " " homophobia - the country 's shame " and " marriage rights without compromises . "
police often violently break up gay rights demonstrations in russia and activists had kept the location of saturday 's rally a secret until the last minute in an attempt to prevent the arrests .
in may , activists in moscow held the first demonstration undisturbed by arrests and violence in five years .
organizers said it was only their " military planning " that prevented further arrests at that rally .
according to local media reports , a small group of anti-gay activists also showed up , attempting to attack the protesters .
at least four of them were also detained .
moscow 's mayor yury luzhkov has described gay pride parades as " satanic " and gay rights activists have condemned the russian authorities ' refusal to allow gay rights demonstrations .

of course england wants to win the world cup but if we ca n't , we at least want to be beat the germans , says dw 's nick amies . every england fan takes great pleasure in watching and re-watching the 4-2 victory over germany in the final of the 1966 world cup .
this is not only because this is the pinnacle of the national team 's success to date , but also because in winning the world cup , england stopped the germans from lifting the trophy .
it 's a two-for-the-price-of-one bargain that never gets old .
this is where an england fan 's indoctrination begins , with a joyous moment .
our national sporting obsession with germany has its roots in happiness - in the gap-toothed smile and carefree jig of midfielder nobby stiles .
the bitterness does n't begin until you 've been hooked and forced to watch more recent england vintages in the flesh .
then you have to admit that 1966 is as good as it gets .
england did n't even show up for world cup in 1974 or 1978 and our involvement in 1982 is best left unmentioned .
the main recollections of 1986 are of a squat argentinean bloke cheating us out of the tournament .
at least the fat gaucho had a hand -lrb- not literally in this case -rrb- in beating the germans in the final , so he could n't have been all that bad .
penalty pain bildunterschrift : things were equal in 1990 until the shoot-out when england players suddenly forgot how to shoot all of which brings us to italia 90 .
looking back , the only thing i now remember about that tournament is the germans in full group hug mode as england 's broken failures trudged from the pitch , vowing to practice penalties from now on .
that penalty shoot-out defeat to germany in a semi-final was traumatic , mainly because england looked as though they had a team good enough to win the cup for once .
when the european championships came to england in 1996 , the animosity towards germany was still at a pretty low level , despite the tabloids ' lazily digging up the war to try and get an already feverishly patriotic public ready for another semi-final clash against the germans .
italia 90 was an aberration .
we still had 1966 - which was only 30 years of hurt away at that point .
revenge would be ours because , you know , lightning could n't strike twice … could it ?
from today 's vantage point , there was more chance of lightning striking twice than england scoring two penalties .
two spot kicks .
penalty taker against goalkeeper .
it does n't seem that hard , does it ?
and this was a team that knew the heartbreak of losing to the germans on penalties .
surely they would n't let it happen again ?
history tells us that it did .
it also tells us that after beating england , germany went on to win the trophy , as they did in 1990 at the world cup .
one-sided " rivalry " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english tabloids dragged up war rhetoric for the 96 clash two soul-destroying defeats were enough to turn a little rivalry into a massive vendetta for the english .
with the memory of 1966 dimming fast , all that most of us had actually experienced was getting beaten by the germans .
for the germans , however , england 's obsession has never prompted anything other than mild bemusement .
as far as the germans are concerned , england are just another opponent , albeit one with a certain amount of history .
there certainly is n't the rabid reaction in germany to playing each other as there is in the uk .
germany 's grudge match is usually one played against their neighbors to the west in the netherlands .
fans in germany get excited about playing holland in much the same way as englishmen go loopy of the germans .
this fact infuriates the english further .
the rivalry should mean as much to the germans as it means to us - otherwise what 's the point of getting all stewed up about it ?
taking what we can get for england , beating germany is the pinnacle of any campaign .
that 's why a turgid 1-0 win over one of germany 's worst-ever sides in euro 2000 was celebrated like the second coming .
it did n't matter that england were dreadful too - and were n't far behind germany in getting knocked out of the tournament .
we 'd beaten the germans .
it was a hollow victory , but one still held close to english hearts .
meager as it now sounds , a 5-1 demolition in munich in a world cup qualifier a year later was even better .
it felt almost as good as 1966 .
almost .
bildunterschrift : beating even a woeful germany team , as in 2000 , is better than not beating them at all and so we meet again .
it 's 2010 , and already the highlight reels from 44 years ago are being projected onto a new generation 's formative inner eye , mythologizing events from ancient history and lionizing men who are either no longer with us or who now look very old indeed when wheeled out for comment whenever germany and england clash .
the papers , of course , are beside themselves with glee .
it 's only a matter of time before we see distasteful war-related headlines in the red tops and the demonizing of young german players who do n't much care about beating england , only about winning the world cup .
this is what the coming match should be about for us england fans - about progressing and emulating the heroes of 1966 .
instead it 's about getting one over the germans .
that 's what it 's always about for england .
we may beat germany , but even then we 'll probably meet an even stronger argentina side , managed by a certain fat gaucho , who 'll knock us out .
but we wo n't care .
we 'll have beaten the germans .
and that 's all that matters .

paul the octopus , who lives at the sea life aquarium in the german city of oberhausen , has been making waves with his successful predictions of the outcomes of all of germany 's group-stage matches in south africa .
in his latest test , paul was offered the choice of two plastic boxes containing food - one adorned with england 's st. george flag , the other with a german flag .
paul moved quickly to open the box with the germany flag , to the delight of spectators , and the selection was reported in news broadcasts across germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul picked serbia as the winner ahead of germany 's game with that country - he was right " paul went rather quickly for the germany flag , " said sea life spokeswoman tanja munzig .

during the football european championships in 2008 , they said , paul picked the winning side in 80 percent of german games .
england fans might have reason to feel aggrieved at the latest decision reached by the octopus .
paul was , in fact , born a little over two years ago in the english seaside town of weymouth .

in his latest test , paul was offered the choice of two plastic boxes containing food - one adorned with england 's st. george flag , the other with a german flag .
paul moved quickly to open the box with the germany flag , to the delight of spectators , and the selection was reported in news broadcasts across germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul picked serbia as the winner ahead of germany 's game with that country - he was right " paul went rather quickly for the germany flag , " said sea life spokeswoman tanja munzig .
" he 's got a 100-percent average in the world cup so far . ”
winning record paul 's keepers said that the octopod , using the same method , had already predicted germany 's group-stage wins over australia and ghana as well as the national side 's loss to serbia .
during the football european championships in 2008 , they said , paul picked the winning side in 80 percent of german games .
england fans might have reason to feel aggrieved at the latest decision reached by the octopus .
paul was , in fact , born a little over two years ago in the english seaside town of weymouth .

" i think there is a real opportunity to put the bilateral relations on to a new footing , " cameron said at the group of eight summit in huntsville , canada .
the two leaders met for an hour of bilateral talks on friday on the sidelines of the summit of the world 's leading economies .
they agreed to maintain regular contact and to encourage their foreign ministers to work more closely together .
medvedev agreed there was a new opportunity to set things right .
" we agreed that our bilateral relationship required the personal attention of the leaders of the two countries both in terms of the economy and other issues and we are determined to make them more productive and intense , " he said .
relationship free-fall british-russian relations hit a post-soviet low in 2006 after the fatal poisoning of former russian spy alexander litvinenko in london with a radioactive isotope .
british authorities sought to have russian parliament member andrei lugovol extradited in connection with litvinenko 's death , but moscow refused .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : litvinenko 's death worsened relations between russia and britain britain granted political asylum to some of the kremlin 's enemies and refused to extradite boris berezovsky , a russian billionaire and critic of the russian government .
berezovsky was convicted in absentia of fraud and embezzlement in russia .
the dispute over his extradition led britain to expel russian diplomats , moving russia to follow suit and to shut down two branches of the british council , a cultural and educational organization connected to the british foreign ministry .
the defrosting of uk-russia follows a warm-up between washington and moscow , which agreed last year to a " reset " of their relationship .
last thursday , us presidents barack obama and medvedev met in washington , where they dodged superpower protocol to slip out to one of the us leader 's favorite burger joints .

many are left not with bruises or broken bones , but with emotional and psychological scars that remain years after the torture has ceased – and music is being used by some as torture instrument of choice .
" you lose control and start to hallucinate .
you 're pushed to a threshold , and you realize that insanity is lurking on the other side .
and once you cross that line , there 's no going back .
i saw that threshold several times , " said binyam mohamed in an interview with uk prisoners ' advocacy organization reprieve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : binyam mohamed suffered harsh interrogation techniques in guantanamo mohamed , a former inmate at the " dark prison " in afghanistan and later at the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , is one of an untold number of victims of so-called " no-touch " torture techniques .
these are psychological techniques , often employed during interrogations , that leave few or no physical marks on the victim but can have lasting psychological consequences .
music used as part of ' cruel and degrading ' treatment mohamed described an interrogation period of almost three weeks , during which he was hung up in stress positions and allowed to sleep only occasionally and for a few hours at a time , as music played at ear-splitting volumes .
this music changed from tracks by popular rappers eminem and dr dre to " horrible ghost laughter and halloween sounds " , mohamed said .
" the cia worked on people , including me , day and night - plenty lost their minds .
i could hear people knocking their heads against the walls and the doors , screaming their heads off " , he added .
in february this year , the united kingdom court of appeal ruled that mohamed 's treatment at the hands of united states authorities was " cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some former guantanamo bay detainees claim they were tortured with music another former guantanamo detainee , ruhal ahmed , described the musical torture as more brutal than physical abuse .
" it 's as if you had very bad migraines , and then someone shows up and yells at you – and take that times a thousand .
you ca n't concentrate on anything , " he told german weekly der spiegel .
" before that , when i was beaten , i could use my imagination to forget the pain .
but the music makes you completely disoriented .
it takes over your brain . "
human rights groups say that in recent years there 's been an increase in the use of these invisible torture techniques , though the use of music as a torture instrument dates back centuries .
" we know that even from ancient history , extremely loud sounds were used to terrify populations before the army was going to invade the next day , " said dr suzanne cusick , a musicologist at new york university .
" we know that people would be put in caves so that the resonant qualities of the stone would make small sounds seem ubiquitous and extremely loud , " she added .
" but we can now do that for hundreds of people at a time and we do n't depend on a cave to do it . "
invisible torture techniques go back decades modern use of music and sound during interrogations grew out of research from the 1950s in which the cia conducted experiments to work out how to break people psychologically .
the british subjected irish prisoners to white-noise in the 70s and the israelis made similar use of music in the 90s .
more recently , experts have accused the us military of holding suspected terrorists inside shipping containers and blasting them with a playlist including not only rock songs like metallica 's " enter sandman " but also contemporary children 's music such as barney the purple dinosaur 's " i love you " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tracks from rock group metallica have been used during prisoner interrogations " with a rhythm , it 's like beating … it gets into your head and you get a headache and you can not concentrate on anything else , " said physician and psychotherapist dr mechthild wenk-ansohn , from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims .
the center treats around 500 children and adults from over 50 countries every year , all of them victims of torture or war-related violence .
music is a particularly versatile form of psychological interrogation as it can be tailored to cause maximum discomfort for specific prisoners .
" in turkey it was used that they played very patriotic music or march music -lsb- to -rsb- these two kurds who had been fighting for their independence .
so this was a way to humiliate them , " wenk-ansohn said .
many survivors suffer flashbacks from acoustic triggers in everyday life – anything from a neighbor 's radio , a car stereo , shopping centers or tv – and many are never able to relate to music in the same way .
new york university 's cusick told of one former guantanamo detainee who had once been a great fan of garage and hard rock .
" he seldom listens to music of any kind now .
he 's extremely sensitive to ambient sound , " she said .
" he remains paranoid now four years after his capture and imprisonment .
he believes that he could be picked up at anytime and consequently he 's afraid to go out of his house . "
not torture – just interrogation , say authorities the us has never considered its use of music during interrogation to be torture at all .
us authorities described it as an enhanced interrogation technique – the same term used to describe sleep deprivation , stress positions and water-boarding .
last year us president barack obama ordered an end to the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques , limiting the cia to interrogation methods explicitly outlined in the us army field manual on interrogations .
the use of music during interrogations is not one of the currently accepted interrogation methods .
stacy sullivan , a new york-based counter-terrorism expert with international ngo human rights watch , said that the organization has no evidence that the use of music during interrogations is on the increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama ordered an end to " harsh interrogation techniques " in 2009 yet there is some evidence that the practise still enjoys widespread use .
wenk-ansohn from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims said that the center is seeing a growing number patients who have been subjected to treatment involving music , including those who have come from turkey , iraq and iran .
dr. julia duchrow from amnesty international germany said these techniques violate the international declaration of human rights and should be recognized as torture " because the music is used intentionally to make someone suffer and create pain in the brains and the mental health of the person . "
duchrow added that germany , like other countries that have signed declarations that prohibit torture , has a responsibility to fight against torture in all its forms .
while some musicians like james hetfield of metallica may not publicly object to their music being used to interrogate suspected terrorists , others like tom morello from the politically active rage against the machine are angry that their music has been used to hurt people .
they and over 25 other bands , as well as amnesty international , are engaged in an ongoing campaign to end the use of music as an instrument of torture .

the western-backed transitional government has been teetering on the edge of collapse for years under the weight of continued attacks by the al qaeda-linked al shabab militia and fellow islamist militant group hizbul islam .
the two groups control much of central and southern somalia , leaving only a few small parts of the capital under government rule , protected by the somali military , its ahlu sunna waljama militia and african union peacekeepers .
the islamist insurgent groups battle government troops , pro-government militia and even each other in a never-ending struggle for control of a country which has n't had an effective government since 1991 .
even in government-controlled areas , the battles rage .
troops loyal to somalia 's government fight within their ranks for scraps of power on the capital 's scarred streets .
they have even engaged in gun fights with their own police forces as corruption and organized crime eats away at the fragile state security systems in place , playing into the hands of the radical islamist insurgents who aim to take control of the whole country .
meanwhile , to compound the problems , pirates continue to operate off the somali coast .
in the midst of all the chaos , the inter-clan fighting and religious battles , the somali government is accused of deploying child soldiers , some as young as 12 , with assault rifles to protect its interests in mogadishu .
somali use of child soldiers reveals concerns over us aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia 's use of child soldiers has raised un concern a united nations security council report into somalia 's " persistent violations " in the use of child soldiers has not only heightened the international community 's deep concern at the continuing practice in african wars and the state of near-constant war in somalia but has also turned the spotlight on the involvement of the united states in the fight for control .
washington has been the main source of western aid for the transitional government since it came to power three years ago and has pumped millions of dollars into the somali military for weapons and soldiers ' salaries .
last year alone , the us government provided somalia with some 40 tonnes of arms and ammunition .
somalia is also expected to benefit from the obama administration 's 2011 budget request for security assistance programmes in africa which includes $ 38 million -lrb- 30.9 million euros -rrb- for arms sales to african states , $ 21 million for training african officers and $ 24 million for anti-terrorism programmes .
there is some concern that by supporting the somali government , washington has violated a number of international human rights laws and laws against the use of child soldiers .
while it has yet to be proved that the us has actually contravened these laws , they have been complying with other un restrictions , albeit with a certain amount of creativity of interpretation , which allow arms sales to somalia .
" the arms embargo which was put in place in 1992 was amended by the un in 2006 to allow arms to be sold to the transitional government , " david hartwell , an expert at jane 's defense , told deutsche welle .
" the international community has no other choice but to support the somali government and the americans have exploited this to sell arms via the ethiopians and the ugandan peacekeepers , who have bought weapons on behalf of the us and billed washington . "
hartwell says that the americans are n't the only ones providing weapons .
" on the other side we have eritrea which is arming the militants , " he added .
" the eritreans have been complaining about double standards because they are seen as breaking the embargo because they 're not supplying the somali government and yet the us and ethiopia , which is fighting a proxy war against eritrea in somalia , are flooding the country with weapons . "

somalia is also expected to benefit from the obama administration 's 2011 budget request for security assistance programmes in africa which includes $ 38 million -lrb- 30.9 million euros -rrb- for arms sales to african states , $ 21 million for training african officers and $ 24 million for anti-terrorism programmes .
there is some concern that by supporting the somali government , washington has violated a number of international human rights laws and laws against the use of child soldiers .
while it has yet to be proved that the us has actually contravened these laws , they have been complying with other un restrictions , albeit with a certain amount of creativity of interpretation , which allow arms sales to somalia .
" the arms embargo which was put in place in 1992 was amended by the un in 2006 to allow arms to be sold to the transitional government , " david hartwell , an expert at jane 's defense , told deutsche welle .
" the international community has no other choice but to support the somali government and the americans have exploited this to sell arms via the ethiopians and the ugandan peacekeepers , who have bought weapons on behalf of the us and billed washington . "
hartwell says that the americans are n't the only ones providing weapons .
" on the other side we have eritrea which is arming the militants , " he added .
" the eritreans have been complaining about double standards because they are seen as breaking the embargo because they 're not supplying the somali government and yet the us and ethiopia , which is fighting a proxy war against eritrea in somalia , are flooding the country with weapons . "

the capital of somalia is a microcosm of the countless conflicts that have been plaguing the failed east african state for decades , leading to hundreds of thousands of somalis starving to death and countless others being killed .
the western-backed transitional government has been teetering on the edge of collapse for years under the weight of continued attacks by the al qaeda-linked al shabab militia and fellow islamist militant group hizbul islam .
the two groups control much of central and southern somalia , leaving only a few small parts of the capital under government rule , protected by the somali military , its ahlu sunna waljama militia and african union peacekeepers .
the islamist insurgent groups battle government troops , pro-government militia and even each other in a never-ending struggle for control of a country which has n't had an effective government since 1991 .
even in government-controlled areas , the battles rage .
troops loyal to somalia 's government fight within their ranks for scraps of power on the capital 's scarred streets .
they have even engaged in gun fights with their own police forces as corruption and organized crime eats away at the fragile state security systems in place , playing into the hands of the radical islamist insurgents who aim to take control of the whole country .
meanwhile , to compound the problems , pirates continue to operate off the somali coast .

of course england wants to win the world cup but if we ca n't , we at least want to be beat the germans , says dw 's nick amies . every england fan takes great pleasure in watching and re-watching the 4-2 victory over germany in the final of the 1966 world cup .
this is not only because this is the pinnacle of the national team 's success to date , but also because in winning the world cup , england stopped the germans from lifting the trophy .
it 's a two-for-the-price-of-one bargain that never gets old .
this is where an england fan 's indoctrination begins , with a joyous moment .
our national sporting obsession with germany has its roots in happiness - in the gap-toothed smile and carefree jig of midfielder nobby stiles .
the bitterness does n't begin until you 've been hooked and forced to watch more recent england vintages in the flesh .
then you have to admit that 1966 is as good as it gets .
england did n't even show up for world cup in 1974 or 1978 and our involvement in 1982 is best left unmentioned .
the main recollections of 1986 are of a squat argentinean bloke cheating us out of the tournament .
at least the fat gaucho had a hand -lrb- not literally in this case -rrb- in beating the germans in the final , so he could n't have been all that bad .
penalty pain bildunterschrift : things were equal in 1990 until the shoot-out when england players suddenly forgot how to shoot all of which brings us to italia 90 .
looking back , the only thing i now remember about that tournament is the germans in full group hug mode as england 's broken failures trudged from the pitch , vowing to practice penalties from now on .
that penalty shoot-out defeat to germany in a semi-final was traumatic , mainly because england looked as though they had a team good enough to win the cup for once .
when the european championships came to england in 1996 , the animosity towards germany was still at a pretty low level , despite the tabloids ' lazily digging up the war to try and get an already feverishly patriotic public ready for another semi-final clash against the germans .
italia 90 was an aberration .
we still had 1966 - which was only 30 years of hurt away at that point .
revenge would be ours because , you know , lightning could n't strike twice … could it ?
from today 's vantage point , there was more chance of lightning striking twice than england scoring two penalties .
two spot kicks .
penalty taker against goalkeeper .
it does n't seem that hard , does it ?
and this was a team that knew the heartbreak of losing to the germans on penalties .
surely they would n't let it happen again ?
history tells us that it did .
it also tells us that after beating england , germany went on to win the trophy , as they did in 1990 at the world cup .
one-sided " rivalry " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english tabloids dragged up war rhetoric for the 96 clash two soul-destroying defeats were enough to turn a little rivalry into a massive vendetta for the english .
with the memory of 1966 dimming fast , all that most of us had actually experienced was getting beaten by the germans .
for the germans , however , england 's obsession has never prompted anything other than mild bemusement .
as far as the germans are concerned , england are just another opponent , albeit one with a certain amount of history .
there certainly is n't the rabid reaction in germany to playing each other as there is in the uk .
germany 's grudge match is usually one played against their neighbors to the west in the netherlands .
fans in germany get excited about playing holland in much the same way as englishmen go loopy of the germans .
this fact infuriates the english further .
the rivalry should mean as much to the germans as it means to us - otherwise what 's the point of getting all stewed up about it ?
taking what we can get for england , beating germany is the pinnacle of any campaign .
that 's why a turgid 1-0 win over one of germany 's worst-ever sides in euro 2000 was celebrated like the second coming .
it did n't matter that england were dreadful too - and were n't far behind germany in getting knocked out of the tournament .
we 'd beaten the germans .
it was a hollow victory , but one still held close to english hearts .
meager as it now sounds , a 5-1 demolition in munich in a world cup qualifier a year later was even better .
it felt almost as good as 1966 .

of course england wants to win the world cup but if we ca n't , we at least want to be beat the germans , says dw 's nick amies . every england fan takes great pleasure in watching and re-watching the 4-2 victory over germany in the final of the 1966 world cup .
this is not only because this is the pinnacle of the national team 's success to date , but also because in winning the world cup , england stopped the germans from lifting the trophy .
it 's a two-for-the-price-of-one bargain that never gets old .
this is where an england fan 's indoctrination begins , with a joyous moment .
our national sporting obsession with germany has its roots in happiness - in the gap-toothed smile and carefree jig of midfielder nobby stiles .
the bitterness does n't begin until you 've been hooked and forced to watch more recent england vintages in the flesh .
then you have to admit that 1966 is as good as it gets .
england did n't even show up for world cup in 1974 or 1978 and our involvement in 1982 is best left unmentioned .
the main recollections of 1986 are of a squat argentinean bloke cheating us out of the tournament .
at least the fat gaucho had a hand -lrb- not literally in this case -rrb- in beating the germans in the final , so he could n't have been all that bad .
penalty pain bildunterschrift : things were equal in 1990 until the shoot-out when england players suddenly forgot how to shoot all of which brings us to italia 90 .
looking back , the only thing i now remember about that tournament is the germans in full group hug mode as england 's broken failures trudged from the pitch , vowing to practice penalties from now on .
that penalty shoot-out defeat to germany in a semi-final was traumatic , mainly because england looked as though they had a team good enough to win the cup for once .
when the european championships came to england in 1996 , the animosity towards germany was still at a pretty low level , despite the tabloids ' lazily digging up the war to try and get an already feverishly patriotic public ready for another semi-final clash against the germans .
italia 90 was an aberration .
we still had 1966 - which was only 30 years of hurt away at that point .
revenge would be ours because , you know , lightning could n't strike twice … could it ?
from today 's vantage point , there was more chance of lightning striking twice than england scoring two penalties .
two spot kicks .
penalty taker against goalkeeper .
it does n't seem that hard , does it ?
and this was a team that knew the heartbreak of losing to the germans on penalties .
surely they would n't let it happen again ?
history tells us that it did .
it also tells us that after beating england , germany went on to win the trophy , as they did in 1990 at the world cup .
one-sided " rivalry " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english tabloids dragged up war rhetoric for the 96 clash two soul-destroying defeats were enough to turn a little rivalry into a massive vendetta for the english .
with the memory of 1966 dimming fast , all that most of us had actually experienced was getting beaten by the germans .
for the germans , however , england 's obsession has never prompted anything other than mild bemusement .
as far as the germans are concerned , england are just another opponent , albeit one with a certain amount of history .
there certainly is n't the rabid reaction in germany to playing each other as there is in the uk .
germany 's grudge match is usually one played against their neighbors to the west in the netherlands .
fans in germany get excited about playing holland in much the same way as englishmen go loopy of the germans .
this fact infuriates the english further .
the rivalry should mean as much to the germans as it means to us - otherwise what 's the point of getting all stewed up about it ?
taking what we can get for england , beating germany is the pinnacle of any campaign .
that 's why a turgid 1-0 win over one of germany 's worst-ever sides in euro 2000 was celebrated like the second coming .
it did n't matter that england were dreadful too - and were n't far behind germany in getting knocked out of the tournament .
we 'd beaten the germans .
it was a hollow victory , but one still held close to english hearts .
meager as it now sounds , a 5-1 demolition in munich in a world cup qualifier a year later was even better .
it felt almost as good as 1966 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 26.06.2010 us support for somali government raises questions over military aid back to first page back 2/2 memories of damaging us losses in mogadishu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us relief forces were drawn into bloody fighting in mogadishu while this information will dismay the american public , the fact that the united states is again actively involved in somalia may also come as a shock , especially considering what happened the last time the us was publicly acknowledged as having a role there .
us involvement in somalia has a long history going back to august 1992 when its troops were deployed as part of operation restore hope to prevent mass starvation in somalia .
however , once the initial crisis seemed to be over , the un took control of relief operations leaving a small us logistical , aviation , and quick reaction force behind .
soon the us forces became involved in somalia 's inter-clan power struggles which eventually led to american soldiers being killed or wounded in fierce fighting in the streets of mogadishu .
one of the most psychologically damaging events of the ill-fated campaign took place in early october 1993 when news reports showed dead us soldiers being dragged through the streets by cheering somali mobs .
all un and us personnel were finally withdrawn almost a year later in march 1995 .
as far as the american people were concerned , that was the end of us involvement in somalia .
" the us got a bloody nose in the restore hope debacle , " david hartwell said .
" it was initially very wary of getting involved in somalia again .
but then 9/11 happened and the us started to see somalia through the prism of al qaeda and islamic extremism .
the insurgents also began to see themselves through this prism so there was a development on both sides where they felt they had to confront each other . "
covert operations signal a us return to somalia last year it was reported that a us special operations raid in somalia had killed the alleged head of al qaeda in east africa .
there were also reports that the us had backed ethiopia with military and logistical aid in its 2006 invasion of somalia aimed at eradicating the islamist threat .
a report in the new york times earlier this year revealed that the united states - through its africom command center in nearby djibouti - had begun a new operation in march in support of the transitional government in somalia , the justification being the fight against islamic extremism . " over the past year and a half the us has provided some arms , ammunition , and cash to the transitional somali government , " ej hogendoorn , the director of the horn of africa project at the international crisis group think tank in nairobi , told deutsche welle .
" it is also providing transport to government units being trained abroad .
there are also allegations that it provides some intelligence support and training . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda suspect saleh ali saleh nabhan was killed by us troops in somalia " the only recent covert operations i am aware of are the well-documented killings of saleh ali nabhan , a kenyan sought in the 2002 bombing of an israeli-owned resort in kenya , and al-shabab military commander aden hashi ayro who reportedly trained with al qaeda in afghanistan before 2001 .
both are alleged to have played a role in terrorist attacks against us targets . " " the us has had a focus on the region for some time in the context of its strategy to stop the spread of islamic extremism , " said david hartwell . " but it knows that the situation in somalia is very fluid .
it may be al qaeda this month but it could be a nationalist civil war the next .
what it has to do is support the government as best it can .
this is difficult because it controls so little of mogadishu and the troops it trains are easily bought and turned .
if the us really wants a secure somalia , it will have to step up its efforts and change its approach . " reports suggest that this change in approach is already underway .
us military advisors have allegedly been training somali forces and intelligence officers in the fight against the islamists , and providing logistical , surveillance and material support .
one anonymous us source told the paper that the us was also prepared to launch its own air strikes and more special forces raids on the ground in somalia in support of the government . " the us has been indirectly involved through the ethiopians and also through - highly unconfirmed - covert special forces operations within somalia , targeting al qaeda operatives , " hartwell added .
" clearly , with the us command center at djibouti , they certainly have the assets in place to do this in somalia and also in yemen but they 'll never admit to active involvement on the ground .

of course england wants to win the world cup but if we ca n't , we at least want to be beat the germans , says dw 's nick amies . every england fan takes great pleasure in watching and re-watching the 4-2 victory over germany in the final of the 1966 world cup .
this is not only because this is the pinnacle of the national team 's success to date , but also because in winning the world cup , england stopped the germans from lifting the trophy .
it 's a two-for-the-price-of-one bargain that never gets old .
this is where an england fan 's indoctrination begins , with a joyous moment .
our national sporting obsession with germany has its roots in happiness - in the gap-toothed smile and carefree jig of midfielder nobby stiles .
the bitterness does n't begin until you 've been hooked and forced to watch more recent england vintages in the flesh .
then you have to admit that 1966 is as good as it gets .
england did n't even show up for world cup in 1974 or 1978 and our involvement in 1982 is best left unmentioned .
the main recollections of 1986 are of a squat argentinean bloke cheating us out of the tournament .
at least the fat gaucho had a hand -lrb- not literally in this case -rrb- in beating the germans in the final , so he could n't have been all that bad .
penalty pain bildunterschrift : things were equal in 1990 until the shoot-out when england players suddenly forgot how to shoot all of which brings us to italia 90 .
looking back , the only thing i now remember about that tournament is the germans in full group hug mode as england 's broken failures trudged from the pitch , vowing to practice penalties from now on .
that penalty shoot-out defeat to germany in a semi-final was traumatic , mainly because england looked as though they had a team good enough to win the cup for once .
when the european championships came to england in 1996 , the animosity towards germany was still at a pretty low level , despite the tabloids ' lazily digging up the war to try and get an already feverishly patriotic public ready for another semi-final clash against the germans .
italia 90 was an aberration .
we still had 1966 - which was only 30 years of hurt away at that point .
revenge would be ours because , you know , lightning could n't strike twice … could it ?
from today 's vantage point , there was more chance of lightning striking twice than england scoring two penalties .
two spot kicks .
penalty taker against goalkeeper .
it does n't seem that hard , does it ?
and this was a team that knew the heartbreak of losing to the germans on penalties .
surely they would n't let it happen again ?
history tells us that it did .
it also tells us that after beating england , germany went on to win the trophy , as they did in 1990 at the world cup .
one-sided " rivalry " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english tabloids dragged up war rhetoric for the 96 clash two soul-destroying defeats were enough to turn a little rivalry into a massive vendetta for the english .
with the memory of 1966 dimming fast , all that most of us had actually experienced was getting beaten by the germans .
for the germans , however , england 's obsession has never prompted anything other than mild bemusement .
as far as the germans are concerned , england are just another opponent , albeit one with a certain amount of history .
there certainly is n't the rabid reaction in germany to playing each other as there is in the uk .
germany 's grudge match is usually one played against their neighbors to the west in the netherlands .
fans in germany get excited about playing holland in much the same way as englishmen go loopy of the germans .
this fact infuriates the english further .
the rivalry should mean as much to the germans as it means to us - otherwise what 's the point of getting all stewed up about it ?
taking what we can get for england , beating germany is the pinnacle of any campaign .
that 's why a turgid 1-0 win over one of germany 's worst-ever sides in euro 2000 was celebrated like the second coming .
it did n't matter that england were dreadful too - and were n't far behind germany in getting knocked out of the tournament .
we 'd beaten the germans .
it was a hollow victory , but one still held close to english hearts .
meager as it now sounds , a 5-1 demolition in munich in a world cup qualifier a year later was even better .
it felt almost as good as 1966 .
almost .
bildunterschrift : beating even a woeful germany team , as in 2000 , is better than not beating them at all and so we meet again .
it 's 2010 , and already the highlight reels from 44 years ago are being projected onto a new generation 's formative inner eye , mythologizing events from ancient history and lionizing men who are either no longer with us or who now look very old indeed when wheeled out for comment whenever germany and england clash .
the papers , of course , are beside themselves with glee .
it 's only a matter of time before we see distasteful war-related headlines in the red tops and the demonizing of young german players who do n't much care about beating england , only about winning the world cup .
this is what the coming match should be about for us england fans - about progressing and emulating the heroes of 1966 .
instead it 's about getting one over the germans .
that 's what it 's always about for england .
we may beat germany , but even then we 'll probably meet an even stronger argentina side , managed by a certain fat gaucho , who 'll knock us out .
but we wo n't care .
we 'll have beaten the germans .
and that 's all that matters .
nick amies is a life-long england supporter , and germany detractor .

" i think there is a real opportunity to put the bilateral relations on to a new footing , " cameron said at the group of eight summit in huntsville , canada .
the two leaders met for an hour of bilateral talks on friday on the sidelines of the summit of the world 's leading economies .
they agreed to maintain regular contact and to encourage their foreign ministers to work more closely together .
medvedev agreed there was a new opportunity to set things right .
" we agreed that our bilateral relationship required the personal attention of the leaders of the two countries both in terms of the economy and other issues and we are determined to make them more productive and intense , " he said .
relationship free-fall british-russian relations hit a post-soviet low in 2006 after the fatal poisoning of former russian spy alexander litvinenko in london with a radioactive isotope .
british authorities sought to have russian parliament member andrei lugovol extradited in connection with litvinenko 's death , but moscow refused .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : litvinenko 's death worsened relations between russia and britain britain granted political asylum to some of the kremlin 's enemies and refused to extradite boris berezovsky , a russian billionaire and critic of the russian government .
berezovsky was convicted in absentia of fraud and embezzlement in russia .
the dispute over his extradition led britain to expel russian diplomats , moving russia to follow suit and to shut down two branches of the british council , a cultural and educational organization connected to the british foreign ministry .
the defrosting of uk-russia follows a warm-up between washington and moscow , which agreed last year to a " reset " of their relationship .
last thursday , us presidents barack obama and medvedev met in washington , where they dodged superpower protocol to slip out to one of the us leader 's favorite burger joints .

protestors had hoped to outwit authorities by only revealing the site at the last minute . at least five gay rights activists were roughly arrested and taken to a police car in st. petersburg , russia after taking part in an unsanctioned rally , according to a police spokesman .
some 30 protestors had gathered outside the famous hermitage museum on palace square , shouting slogans such as " equality without compromise , " " homophobia is an illness , " " homophobia - the country 's shame " and " marriage rights without compromises . "
police often violently break up gay rights demonstrations in russia and activists had kept the location of saturday 's rally a secret until the last minute in an attempt to prevent the arrests .
in may , activists in moscow held the first demonstration undisturbed by arrests and violence in five years .
organizers said it was only their " military planning " that prevented further arrests at that rally .
according to local media reports , a small group of anti-gay activists also showed up , attempting to attack the protesters .
at least four of them were also detained .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 26.06.2010 us support for somali government raises questions over military aid back to first page back 2/2 memories of damaging us losses in mogadishu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us relief forces were drawn into bloody fighting in mogadishu while this information will dismay the american public , the fact that the united states is again actively involved in somalia may also come as a shock , especially considering what happened the last time the us was publicly acknowledged as having a role there .
us involvement in somalia has a long history going back to august 1992 when its troops were deployed as part of operation restore hope to prevent mass starvation in somalia .
however , once the initial crisis seemed to be over , the un took control of relief operations leaving a small us logistical , aviation , and quick reaction force behind .
soon the us forces became involved in somalia 's inter-clan power struggles which eventually led to american soldiers being killed or wounded in fierce fighting in the streets of mogadishu .
one of the most psychologically damaging events of the ill-fated campaign took place in early october 1993 when news reports showed dead us soldiers being dragged through the streets by cheering somali mobs .
all un and us personnel were finally withdrawn almost a year later in march 1995 .
as far as the american people were concerned , that was the end of us involvement in somalia .
" the us got a bloody nose in the restore hope debacle , " david hartwell said .
" it was initially very wary of getting involved in somalia again .
but then 9/11 happened and the us started to see somalia through the prism of al qaeda and islamic extremism .
the insurgents also began to see themselves through this prism so there was a development on both sides where they felt they had to confront each other . "
covert operations signal a us return to somalia last year it was reported that a us special operations raid in somalia had killed the alleged head of al qaeda in east africa .
there were also reports that the us had backed ethiopia with military and logistical aid in its 2006 invasion of somalia aimed at eradicating the islamist threat .
a report in the new york times earlier this year revealed that the united states - through its africom command center in nearby djibouti - had begun a new operation in march in support of the transitional government in somalia , the justification being the fight against islamic extremism . " over the past year and a half the us has provided some arms , ammunition , and cash to the transitional somali government , " ej hogendoorn , the director of the horn of africa project at the international crisis group think tank in nairobi , told deutsche welle .
" it is also providing transport to government units being trained abroad .
there are also allegations that it provides some intelligence support and training . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda suspect saleh ali saleh nabhan was killed by us troops in somalia " the only recent covert operations i am aware of are the well-documented killings of saleh ali nabhan , a kenyan sought in the 2002 bombing of an israeli-owned resort in kenya , and al-shabab military commander aden hashi ayro who reportedly trained with al qaeda in afghanistan before 2001 .
both are alleged to have played a role in terrorist attacks against us targets . " " the us has had a focus on the region for some time in the context of its strategy to stop the spread of islamic extremism , " said david hartwell . " but it knows that the situation in somalia is very fluid .
it may be al qaeda this month but it could be a nationalist civil war the next .
what it has to do is support the government as best it can .
this is difficult because it controls so little of mogadishu and the troops it trains are easily bought and turned .
if the us really wants a secure somalia , it will have to step up its efforts and change its approach . " reports suggest that this change in approach is already underway .
us military advisors have allegedly been training somali forces and intelligence officers in the fight against the islamists , and providing logistical , surveillance and material support .
one anonymous us source told the paper that the us was also prepared to launch its own air strikes and more special forces raids on the ground in somalia in support of the government . " the us has been indirectly involved through the ethiopians and also through - highly unconfirmed - covert special forces operations within somalia , targeting al qaeda operatives , " hartwell added .
" clearly , with the us command center at djibouti , they certainly have the assets in place to do this in somalia and also in yemen but they 'll never admit to active involvement on the ground .

meanwhile , the summit of the wider group of g-20 has begun in canada . g-8 leaders did n't pull any punches after their summit in huntsville , canada , this weekend , issuing a final communique critical of iran , north korea , israel , and afghanistan .
the leaders of the world 's eight richest countries called on iran to hold a " transparent dialogue " over its suspect nuclear program , as iranian leader mahmoud ahmedinejad prepares to unveil his conditions for talks .
" we are profoundly concerned by iran 's continued lack of transparency regarding its nuclear activities and its stated intention to continue and expand enriching uranium , including to nearly 20 percent , " g-8 leaders said in their final communique .
" our goal is to persuade iran 's leaders to engage in a transparent dialogue about its nuclear activities and to meet iran 's international obligations , " they wrote , while simultaneously welcoming a deal between iran , turkey and brazil designed to rein in the country 's nuclear enrichment program .
the west believes iran is seeking nuclear weapons , while tehran says its nuclear program is peaceful and is only meant to meet its energy needs . north korea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eight most powerful nations focused on trouble spots around the world the leaders of germany , britain , canada , france , italy , japan , russia and the united states also expressed their " gravest concern about the nuclear test and missile activities " carried out by north korea , reiterating that the country can not become a nuclear power under the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . they also condemned the sinking of a south korean submarine in march , adjudged to have been carried out by the north , that killed 24 sailors near the countries ' disputed maritime border .
" we demand the democratic people 's republic of korea refrain from committing any attacks or threatening hostilities against the republic of korea , " the group concluded .
israel and gaza bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 condemned an israeli raid on this aid flotilla the group 's joint statement welcomed israel 's promise to loosen its blockade on the hamas-run gaza strip , as leaders said they " urge full and effective implementation of this policy in order to address the needs of gaza 's population for humanitarian and commercial goods , civilian reconstruction and infrastructure , and legitimate economic activity . "
" the current arrangements are not sustainable and must be changed . "
the long-standing blockade of the territory came into sharp focus this month after israeli troops stormed a gaza-bound flotilla of aid ships in international waters on may 31 .
the boats were trying to defy the blockade , saying they were taking humanitarian supplies to the region .
the g-8 leaders said they deeply regretted the deaths of nine activists during this israeli intervention .
afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama accepting mcchrystal 's resignation put the afghan mission back in the spotlight finally , the leaders used their chance to address the conflict in afghanistan , days after the sudden resignation of the isaf force 's commanding general , stanley mcchrystal , who has since been replaced by senior us military general , david petraeus .
offering their full support to the current strategy in afghanistan , ahead of a number of major military operations in the country , the g-8 statement said afghan soldiers should be in a position to start taking responsibility for the country 's security " within five years . "
the leaders described the coming months and years as an opportunity for president hamid karzai 's embattled government to improve its performance , " including measures to combat corruption , address illicit drug production and trafficking , improve human rights , -lrb- and -rrb- improve provision of basic services and governance .

of course england wants to win the world cup but if we ca n't , we at least want to be beat the germans , says dw 's nick amies . every england fan takes great pleasure in watching and re-watching the 4-2 victory over germany in the final of the 1966 world cup .
this is not only because this is the pinnacle of the national team 's success to date , but also because in winning the world cup , england stopped the germans from lifting the trophy .
it 's a two-for-the-price-of-one bargain that never gets old .
this is where an england fan 's indoctrination begins , with a joyous moment .
our national sporting obsession with germany has its roots in happiness - in the gap-toothed smile and carefree jig of midfielder nobby stiles .
the bitterness does n't begin until you 've been hooked and forced to watch more recent england vintages in the flesh .
then you have to admit that 1966 is as good as it gets .
england did n't even show up for world cup in 1974 or 1978 and our involvement in 1982 is best left unmentioned .
the main recollections of 1986 are of a squat argentinean bloke cheating us out of the tournament .
at least the fat gaucho had a hand -lrb- not literally in this case -rrb- in beating the germans in the final , so he could n't have been all that bad .
penalty pain bildunterschrift : things were equal in 1990 until the shoot-out when england players suddenly forgot how to shoot all of which brings us to italia 90 .
looking back , the only thing i now remember about that tournament is the germans in full group hug mode as england 's broken failures trudged from the pitch , vowing to practice penalties from now on .
that penalty shoot-out defeat to germany in a semi-final was traumatic , mainly because england looked as though they had a team good enough to win the cup for once .
when the european championships came to england in 1996 , the animosity towards germany was still at a pretty low level , despite the tabloids ' lazily digging up the war to try and get an already feverishly patriotic public ready for another semi-final clash against the germans .
italia 90 was an aberration .
we still had 1966 - which was only 30 years of hurt away at that point .
revenge would be ours because , you know , lightning could n't strike twice … could it ?
from today 's vantage point , there was more chance of lightning striking twice than england scoring two penalties .
two spot kicks .
penalty taker against goalkeeper .
it does n't seem that hard , does it ?
and this was a team that knew the heartbreak of losing to the germans on penalties .
surely they would n't let it happen again ?
history tells us that it did .
it also tells us that after beating england , germany went on to win the trophy , as they did in 1990 at the world cup .
one-sided " rivalry " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english tabloids dragged up war rhetoric for the 96 clash two soul-destroying defeats were enough to turn a little rivalry into a massive vendetta for the english .
with the memory of 1966 dimming fast , all that most of us had actually experienced was getting beaten by the germans .
for the germans , however , england 's obsession has never prompted anything other than mild bemusement .
as far as the germans are concerned , england are just another opponent , albeit one with a certain amount of history .
there certainly is n't the rabid reaction in germany to playing each other as there is in the uk .
germany 's grudge match is usually one played against their neighbors to the west in the netherlands .
fans in germany get excited about playing holland in much the same way as englishmen go loopy of the germans .
this fact infuriates the english further .
the rivalry should mean as much to the germans as it means to us - otherwise what 's the point of getting all stewed up about it ?
taking what we can get for england , beating germany is the pinnacle of any campaign .
that 's why a turgid 1-0 win over one of germany 's worst-ever sides in euro 2000 was celebrated like the second coming .
it did n't matter that england were dreadful too - and were n't far behind germany in getting knocked out of the tournament .
we 'd beaten the germans .
it was a hollow victory , but one still held close to english hearts .
meager as it now sounds , a 5-1 demolition in munich in a world cup qualifier a year later was even better .
it felt almost as good as 1966 .
almost .
bildunterschrift : beating even a woeful germany team , as in 2000 , is better than not beating them at all and so we meet again .
it 's 2010 , and already the highlight reels from 44 years ago are being projected onto a new generation 's formative inner eye , mythologizing events from ancient history and lionizing men who are either no longer with us or who now look very old indeed when wheeled out for comment whenever germany and england clash .
the papers , of course , are beside themselves with glee .
it 's only a matter of time before we see distasteful war-related headlines in the red tops and the demonizing of young german players who do n't much care about beating england , only about winning the world cup .
this is what the coming match should be about for us england fans - about progressing and emulating the heroes of 1966 .
instead it 's about getting one over the germans .
that 's what it 's always about for england .
we may beat germany , but even then we 'll probably meet an even stronger argentina side , managed by a certain fat gaucho , who 'll knock us out .
but we wo n't care .
we 'll have beaten the germans .
and that 's all that matters .
nick amies is a life-long england supporter , and germany detractor .

it 's only a matter of time before we see distasteful war-related headlines in the red tops and the demonizing of young german players who do n't much care about beating england , only about winning the world cup .
this is what the coming match should be about for us england fans - about progressing and emulating the heroes of 1966 .
instead it 's about getting one over the germans .
that 's what it 's always about for england .
we may beat germany , but even then we 'll probably meet an even stronger argentina side , managed by a certain fat gaucho , who 'll knock us out .
but we wo n't care .
we 'll have beaten the germans .
and that 's all that matters .
nick amies is a life-long england supporter , and germany detractor .

us involvement in somalia has a long history going back to august 1992 when its troops were deployed as part of operation restore hope to prevent mass starvation in somalia .
however , once the initial crisis seemed to be over , the un took control of relief operations leaving a small us logistical , aviation , and quick reaction force behind .
soon the us forces became involved in somalia 's inter-clan power struggles which eventually led to american soldiers being killed or wounded in fierce fighting in the streets of mogadishu .
one of the most psychologically damaging events of the ill-fated campaign took place in early october 1993 when news reports showed dead us soldiers being dragged through the streets by cheering somali mobs .
all un and us personnel were finally withdrawn almost a year later in march 1995 .
as far as the american people were concerned , that was the end of us involvement in somalia .
" the us got a bloody nose in the restore hope debacle , " david hartwell said .
" it was initially very wary of getting involved in somalia again .
but then 9/11 happened and the us started to see somalia through the prism of al qaeda and islamic extremism .
the insurgents also began to see themselves through this prism so there was a development on both sides where they felt they had to confront each other . "
covert operations signal a us return to somalia last year it was reported that a us special operations raid in somalia had killed the alleged head of al qaeda in east africa .
there were also reports that the us had backed ethiopia with military and logistical aid in its 2006 invasion of somalia aimed at eradicating the islamist threat .
a report in the new york times earlier this year revealed that the united states - through its africom command center in nearby djibouti - had begun a new operation in march in support of the transitional government in somalia , the justification being the fight against islamic extremism . " over the past year and a half the us has provided some arms , ammunition , and cash to the transitional somali government , " ej hogendoorn , the director of the horn of africa project at the international crisis group think tank in nairobi , told deutsche welle .

both are alleged to have played a role in terrorist attacks against us targets . " " the us has had a focus on the region for some time in the context of its strategy to stop the spread of islamic extremism , " said david hartwell . " but it knows that the situation in somalia is very fluid .
it may be al qaeda this month but it could be a nationalist civil war the next .

" the us has been indirectly involved through the ethiopians and also through - highly unconfirmed - covert special forces operations within somalia , targeting al qaeda operatives , " hartwell added .
" clearly , with the us command center at djibouti , they certainly have the assets in place to do this in somalia and also in yemen but they 'll never admit to active involvement on the ground .

but the victims themselves need no reminder .
many are left not with bruises or broken bones , but with emotional and psychological scars that remain years after the torture has ceased – and music is being used by some as torture instrument of choice .
" you lose control and start to hallucinate .
you 're pushed to a threshold , and you realize that insanity is lurking on the other side .
and once you cross that line , there 's no going back .
i saw that threshold several times , " said binyam mohamed in an interview with uk prisoners ' advocacy organization reprieve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : binyam mohamed suffered harsh interrogation techniques in guantanamo mohamed , a former inmate at the " dark prison " in afghanistan and later at the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , is one of an untold number of victims of so-called " no-touch " torture techniques .
these are psychological techniques , often employed during interrogations , that leave few or no physical marks on the victim but can have lasting psychological consequences .
music used as part of ' cruel and degrading ' treatment mohamed described an interrogation period of almost three weeks , during which he was hung up in stress positions and allowed to sleep only occasionally and for a few hours at a time , as music played at ear-splitting volumes .
this music changed from tracks by popular rappers eminem and dr dre to " horrible ghost laughter and halloween sounds " , mohamed said .
" the cia worked on people , including me , day and night - plenty lost their minds .
i could hear people knocking their heads against the walls and the doors , screaming their heads off " , he added .
in february this year , the united kingdom court of appeal ruled that mohamed 's treatment at the hands of united states authorities was " cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some former guantanamo bay detainees claim they were tortured with music another former guantanamo detainee , ruhal ahmed , described the musical torture as more brutal than physical abuse .
" it 's as if you had very bad migraines , and then someone shows up and yells at you – and take that times a thousand .
you ca n't concentrate on anything , " he told german weekly der spiegel .
" before that , when i was beaten , i could use my imagination to forget the pain .
but the music makes you completely disoriented .
it takes over your brain . "
human rights groups say that in recent years there 's been an increase in the use of these invisible torture techniques , though the use of music as a torture instrument dates back centuries .
" we know that even from ancient history , extremely loud sounds were used to terrify populations before the army was going to invade the next day , " said dr suzanne cusick , a musicologist at new york university .
" we know that people would be put in caves so that the resonant qualities of the stone would make small sounds seem ubiquitous and extremely loud , " she added .
" but we can now do that for hundreds of people at a time and we do n't depend on a cave to do it . "
invisible torture techniques go back decades modern use of music and sound during interrogations grew out of research from the 1950s in which the cia conducted experiments to work out how to break people psychologically .
the british subjected irish prisoners to white-noise in the 70s and the israelis made similar use of music in the 90s .
more recently , experts have accused the us military of holding suspected terrorists inside shipping containers and blasting them with a playlist including not only rock songs like metallica 's " enter sandman " but also contemporary children 's music such as barney the purple dinosaur 's " i love you " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tracks from rock group metallica have been used during prisoner interrogations " with a rhythm , it 's like beating … it gets into your head and you get a headache and you can not concentrate on anything else , " said physician and psychotherapist dr mechthild wenk-ansohn , from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims .
the center treats around 500 children and adults from over 50 countries every year , all of them victims of torture or war-related violence .
music is a particularly versatile form of psychological interrogation as it can be tailored to cause maximum discomfort for specific prisoners .
" in turkey it was used that they played very patriotic music or march music -lsb- to -rsb- these two kurds who had been fighting for their independence .
so this was a way to humiliate them , " wenk-ansohn said .
many survivors suffer flashbacks from acoustic triggers in everyday life – anything from a neighbor 's radio , a car stereo , shopping centers or tv – and many are never able to relate to music in the same way .
new york university 's cusick told of one former guantanamo detainee who had once been a great fan of garage and hard rock .
" he seldom listens to music of any kind now .
he 's extremely sensitive to ambient sound , " she said .
" he remains paranoid now four years after his capture and imprisonment .
he believes that he could be picked up at anytime and consequently he 's afraid to go out of his house . "
not torture – just interrogation , say authorities the us has never considered its use of music during interrogation to be torture at all .
us authorities described it as an enhanced interrogation technique – the same term used to describe sleep deprivation , stress positions and water-boarding .
last year us president barack obama ordered an end to the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques , limiting the cia to interrogation methods explicitly outlined in the us army field manual on interrogations .
the use of music during interrogations is not one of the currently accepted interrogation methods .
stacy sullivan , a new york-based counter-terrorism expert with international ngo human rights watch , said that the organization has no evidence that the use of music during interrogations is on the increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama ordered an end to " harsh interrogation techniques " in 2009 yet there is some evidence that the practise still enjoys widespread use .
wenk-ansohn from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims said that the center is seeing a growing number patients who have been subjected to treatment involving music , including those who have come from turkey , iraq and iran .
dr. julia duchrow from amnesty international germany said these techniques violate the international declaration of human rights and should be recognized as torture " because the music is used intentionally to make someone suffer and create pain in the brains and the mental health of the person . "
duchrow added that germany , like other countries that have signed declarations that prohibit torture , has a responsibility to fight against torture in all its forms .
while some musicians like james hetfield of metallica may not publicly object to their music being used to interrogate suspected terrorists , others like tom morello from the politically active rage against the machine are angry that their music has been used to hurt people .
they and over 25 other bands , as well as amnesty international , are engaged in an ongoing campaign to end the use of music as an instrument of torture .

but the victims themselves need no reminder .
many are left not with bruises or broken bones , but with emotional and psychological scars that remain years after the torture has ceased – and music is being used by some as torture instrument of choice .
" you lose control and start to hallucinate .
you 're pushed to a threshold , and you realize that insanity is lurking on the other side .
and once you cross that line , there 's no going back .
i saw that threshold several times , " said binyam mohamed in an interview with uk prisoners ' advocacy organization reprieve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : binyam mohamed suffered harsh interrogation techniques in guantanamo mohamed , a former inmate at the " dark prison " in afghanistan and later at the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , is one of an untold number of victims of so-called " no-touch " torture techniques .
these are psychological techniques , often employed during interrogations , that leave few or no physical marks on the victim but can have lasting psychological consequences .
music used as part of ' cruel and degrading ' treatment mohamed described an interrogation period of almost three weeks , during which he was hung up in stress positions and allowed to sleep only occasionally and for a few hours at a time , as music played at ear-splitting volumes .
this music changed from tracks by popular rappers eminem and dr dre to " horrible ghost laughter and halloween sounds " , mohamed said .
" the cia worked on people , including me , day and night - plenty lost their minds .
i could hear people knocking their heads against the walls and the doors , screaming their heads off " , he added .
in february this year , the united kingdom court of appeal ruled that mohamed 's treatment at the hands of united states authorities was " cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some former guantanamo bay detainees claim they were tortured with music another former guantanamo detainee , ruhal ahmed , described the musical torture as more brutal than physical abuse .
" it 's as if you had very bad migraines , and then someone shows up and yells at you – and take that times a thousand .
you ca n't concentrate on anything , " he told german weekly der spiegel .
" before that , when i was beaten , i could use my imagination to forget the pain .
but the music makes you completely disoriented .
it takes over your brain . "
human rights groups say that in recent years there 's been an increase in the use of these invisible torture techniques , though the use of music as a torture instrument dates back centuries .
" we know that even from ancient history , extremely loud sounds were used to terrify populations before the army was going to invade the next day , " said dr suzanne cusick , a musicologist at new york university .
" we know that people would be put in caves so that the resonant qualities of the stone would make small sounds seem ubiquitous and extremely loud , " she added .
" but we can now do that for hundreds of people at a time and we do n't depend on a cave to do it . "
invisible torture techniques go back decades modern use of music and sound during interrogations grew out of research from the 1950s in which the cia conducted experiments to work out how to break people psychologically .
the british subjected irish prisoners to white-noise in the 70s and the israelis made similar use of music in the 90s .
more recently , experts have accused the us military of holding suspected terrorists inside shipping containers and blasting them with a playlist including not only rock songs like metallica 's " enter sandman " but also contemporary children 's music such as barney the purple dinosaur 's " i love you " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tracks from rock group metallica have been used during prisoner interrogations " with a rhythm , it 's like beating … it gets into your head and you get a headache and you can not concentrate on anything else , " said physician and psychotherapist dr mechthild wenk-ansohn , from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims .
the center treats around 500 children and adults from over 50 countries every year , all of them victims of torture or war-related violence .
music is a particularly versatile form of psychological interrogation as it can be tailored to cause maximum discomfort for specific prisoners .
" in turkey it was used that they played very patriotic music or march music -lsb- to -rsb- these two kurds who had been fighting for their independence .
so this was a way to humiliate them , " wenk-ansohn said .
many survivors suffer flashbacks from acoustic triggers in everyday life – anything from a neighbor 's radio , a car stereo , shopping centers or tv – and many are never able to relate to music in the same way .
new york university 's cusick told of one former guantanamo detainee who had once been a great fan of garage and hard rock .
" he seldom listens to music of any kind now .
he 's extremely sensitive to ambient sound , " she said .
" he remains paranoid now four years after his capture and imprisonment .
he believes that he could be picked up at anytime and consequently he 's afraid to go out of his house . "
not torture – just interrogation , say authorities the us has never considered its use of music during interrogation to be torture at all .
us authorities described it as an enhanced interrogation technique – the same term used to describe sleep deprivation , stress positions and water-boarding .
last year us president barack obama ordered an end to the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques , limiting the cia to interrogation methods explicitly outlined in the us army field manual on interrogations .
the use of music during interrogations is not one of the currently accepted interrogation methods .
stacy sullivan , a new york-based counter-terrorism expert with international ngo human rights watch , said that the organization has no evidence that the use of music during interrogations is on the increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama ordered an end to " harsh interrogation techniques " in 2009 yet there is some evidence that the practise still enjoys widespread use .
wenk-ansohn from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims said that the center is seeing a growing number patients who have been subjected to treatment involving music , including those who have come from turkey , iraq and iran .
dr. julia duchrow from amnesty international germany said these techniques violate the international declaration of human rights and should be recognized as torture " because the music is used intentionally to make someone suffer and create pain in the brains and the mental health of the person . "
duchrow added that germany , like other countries that have signed declarations that prohibit torture , has a responsibility to fight against torture in all its forms .
while some musicians like james hetfield of metallica may not publicly object to their music being used to interrogate suspected terrorists , others like tom morello from the politically active rage against the machine are angry that their music has been used to hurt people .
they and over 25 other bands , as well as amnesty international , are engaged in an ongoing campaign to end the use of music as an instrument of torture .

the capital of somalia is a microcosm of the countless conflicts that have been plaguing the failed east african state for decades , leading to hundreds of thousands of somalis starving to death and countless others being killed .
the western-backed transitional government has been teetering on the edge of collapse for years under the weight of continued attacks by the al qaeda-linked al shabab militia and fellow islamist militant group hizbul islam .
the two groups control much of central and southern somalia , leaving only a few small parts of the capital under government rule , protected by the somali military , its ahlu sunna waljama militia and african union peacekeepers .
the islamist insurgent groups battle government troops , pro-government militia and even each other in a never-ending struggle for control of a country which has n't had an effective government since 1991 .
even in government-controlled areas , the battles rage .
troops loyal to somalia 's government fight within their ranks for scraps of power on the capital 's scarred streets .
they have even engaged in gun fights with their own police forces as corruption and organized crime eats away at the fragile state security systems in place , playing into the hands of the radical islamist insurgents who aim to take control of the whole country .
meanwhile , to compound the problems , pirates continue to operate off the somali coast .
in the midst of all the chaos , the inter-clan fighting and religious battles , the somali government is accused of deploying child soldiers , some as young as 12 , with assault rifles to protect its interests in mogadishu .
somali use of child soldiers reveals concerns over us aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia 's use of child soldiers has raised un concern a united nations security council report into somalia 's " persistent violations " in the use of child soldiers has not only heightened the international community 's deep concern at the continuing practice in african wars and the state of near-constant war in somalia but has also turned the spotlight on the involvement of the united states in the fight for control .
washington has been the main source of western aid for the transitional government since it came to power three years ago and has pumped millions of dollars into the somali military for weapons and soldiers ' salaries .
last year alone , the us government provided somalia with some 40 tonnes of arms and ammunition .
somalia is also expected to benefit from the obama administration 's 2011 budget request for security assistance programmes in africa which includes $ 38 million -lrb- 30.9 million euros -rrb- for arms sales to african states , $ 21 million for training african officers and $ 24 million for anti-terrorism programmes .
there is some concern that by supporting the somali government , washington has violated a number of international human rights laws and laws against the use of child soldiers .
while it has yet to be proved that the us has actually contravened these laws , they have been complying with other un restrictions , albeit with a certain amount of creativity of interpretation , which allow arms sales to somalia .
" the arms embargo which was put in place in 1992 was amended by the un in 2006 to allow arms to be sold to the transitional government , " david hartwell , an expert at jane 's defense , told deutsche welle .
" the international community has no other choice but to support the somali government and the americans have exploited this to sell arms via the ethiopians and the ugandan peacekeepers , who have bought weapons on behalf of the us and billed washington . "
hartwell says that the americans are n't the only ones providing weapons .
" on the other side we have eritrea which is arming the militants , " he added .
" the eritreans have been complaining about double standards because they are seen as breaking the embargo because they 're not supplying the somali government and yet the us and ethiopia , which is fighting a proxy war against eritrea in somalia , are flooding the country with weapons . "

" before that , when i was beaten , i could use my imagination to forget the pain .
but the music makes you completely disoriented .
it takes over your brain . "
human rights groups say that in recent years there 's been an increase in the use of these invisible torture techniques , though the use of music as a torture instrument dates back centuries .
" we know that even from ancient history , extremely loud sounds were used to terrify populations before the army was going to invade the next day , " said dr suzanne cusick , a musicologist at new york university .
" we know that people would be put in caves so that the resonant qualities of the stone would make small sounds seem ubiquitous and extremely loud , " she added .
" but we can now do that for hundreds of people at a time and we do n't depend on a cave to do it . "
invisible torture techniques go back decades modern use of music and sound during interrogations grew out of research from the 1950s in which the cia conducted experiments to work out how to break people psychologically .
the british subjected irish prisoners to white-noise in the 70s and the israelis made similar use of music in the 90s .
more recently , experts have accused the us military of holding suspected terrorists inside shipping containers and blasting them with a playlist including not only rock songs like metallica 's " enter sandman " but also contemporary children 's music such as barney the purple dinosaur 's " i love you " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tracks from rock group metallica have been used during prisoner interrogations " with a rhythm , it 's like beating … it gets into your head and you get a headache and you can not concentrate on anything else , " said physician and psychotherapist dr mechthild wenk-ansohn , from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims .
the center treats around 500 children and adults from over 50 countries every year , all of them victims of torture or war-related violence .
music is a particularly versatile form of psychological interrogation as it can be tailored to cause maximum discomfort for specific prisoners .
" in turkey it was used that they played very patriotic music or march music -lsb- to -rsb- these two kurds who had been fighting for their independence .
so this was a way to humiliate them , " wenk-ansohn said .
many survivors suffer flashbacks from acoustic triggers in everyday life – anything from a neighbor 's radio , a car stereo , shopping centers or tv – and many are never able to relate to music in the same way .
new york university 's cusick told of one former guantanamo detainee who had once been a great fan of garage and hard rock .
" he seldom listens to music of any kind now .
he 's extremely sensitive to ambient sound , " she said .
" he remains paranoid now four years after his capture and imprisonment .
he believes that he could be picked up at anytime and consequently he 's afraid to go out of his house . "
not torture – just interrogation , say authorities the us has never considered its use of music during interrogation to be torture at all .
us authorities described it as an enhanced interrogation technique – the same term used to describe sleep deprivation , stress positions and water-boarding .
last year us president barack obama ordered an end to the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques , limiting the cia to interrogation methods explicitly outlined in the us army field manual on interrogations .
the use of music during interrogations is not one of the currently accepted interrogation methods .
stacy sullivan , a new york-based counter-terrorism expert with international ngo human rights watch , said that the organization has no evidence that the use of music during interrogations is on the increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama ordered an end to " harsh interrogation techniques " in 2009 yet there is some evidence that the practise still enjoys widespread use .
wenk-ansohn from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims said that the center is seeing a growing number patients who have been subjected to treatment involving music , including those who have come from turkey , iraq and iran .
dr. julia duchrow from amnesty international germany said these techniques violate the international declaration of human rights and should be recognized as torture " because the music is used intentionally to make someone suffer and create pain in the brains and the mental health of the person . "
duchrow added that germany , like other countries that have signed declarations that prohibit torture , has a responsibility to fight against torture in all its forms .
while some musicians like james hetfield of metallica may not publicly object to their music being used to interrogate suspected terrorists , others like tom morello from the politically active rage against the machine are angry that their music has been used to hurt people .
they and over 25 other bands , as well as amnesty international , are engaged in an ongoing campaign to end the use of music as an instrument of torture .

of course england wants to win the world cup but if we ca n't , we at least want to be beat the germans , says dw 's nick amies . every england fan takes great pleasure in watching and re-watching the 4-2 victory over germany in the final of the 1966 world cup .
this is not only because this is the pinnacle of the national team 's success to date , but also because in winning the world cup , england stopped the germans from lifting the trophy .
it 's a two-for-the-price-of-one bargain that never gets old .
this is where an england fan 's indoctrination begins , with a joyous moment .
our national sporting obsession with germany has its roots in happiness - in the gap-toothed smile and carefree jig of midfielder nobby stiles .
the bitterness does n't begin until you 've been hooked and forced to watch more recent england vintages in the flesh .
then you have to admit that 1966 is as good as it gets .
england did n't even show up for world cup in 1974 or 1978 and our involvement in 1982 is best left unmentioned .
the main recollections of 1986 are of a squat argentinean bloke cheating us out of the tournament .
at least the fat gaucho had a hand -lrb- not literally in this case -rrb- in beating the germans in the final , so he could n't have been all that bad .
penalty pain bildunterschrift : things were equal in 1990 until the shoot-out when england players suddenly forgot how to shoot all of which brings us to italia 90 .
looking back , the only thing i now remember about that tournament is the germans in full group hug mode as england 's broken failures trudged from the pitch , vowing to practice penalties from now on .
that penalty shoot-out defeat to germany in a semi-final was traumatic , mainly because england looked as though they had a team good enough to win the cup for once .
when the european championships came to england in 1996 , the animosity towards germany was still at a pretty low level , despite the tabloids ' lazily digging up the war to try and get an already feverishly patriotic public ready for another semi-final clash against the germans .
italia 90 was an aberration .
we still had 1966 - which was only 30 years of hurt away at that point .
revenge would be ours because , you know , lightning could n't strike twice … could it ?
from today 's vantage point , there was more chance of lightning striking twice than england scoring two penalties .
two spot kicks .
penalty taker against goalkeeper .
it does n't seem that hard , does it ?
and this was a team that knew the heartbreak of losing to the germans on penalties .
surely they would n't let it happen again ?
history tells us that it did .
it also tells us that after beating england , germany went on to win the trophy , as they did in 1990 at the world cup .
one-sided " rivalry " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english tabloids dragged up war rhetoric for the 96 clash two soul-destroying defeats were enough to turn a little rivalry into a massive vendetta for the english .
with the memory of 1966 dimming fast , all that most of us had actually experienced was getting beaten by the germans .
for the germans , however , england 's obsession has never prompted anything other than mild bemusement .
as far as the germans are concerned , england are just another opponent , albeit one with a certain amount of history .
there certainly is n't the rabid reaction in germany to playing each other as there is in the uk .
germany 's grudge match is usually one played against their neighbors to the west in the netherlands .
fans in germany get excited about playing holland in much the same way as englishmen go loopy of the germans .
this fact infuriates the english further .
the rivalry should mean as much to the germans as it means to us - otherwise what 's the point of getting all stewed up about it ?
taking what we can get for england , beating germany is the pinnacle of any campaign .
that 's why a turgid 1-0 win over one of germany 's worst-ever sides in euro 2000 was celebrated like the second coming .
it did n't matter that england were dreadful too - and were n't far behind germany in getting knocked out of the tournament .
we 'd beaten the germans .
it was a hollow victory , but one still held close to english hearts .
meager as it now sounds , a 5-1 demolition in munich in a world cup qualifier a year later was even better .
it felt almost as good as 1966 .
almost .
bildunterschrift : beating even a woeful germany team , as in 2000 , is better than not beating them at all and so we meet again .
it 's 2010 , and already the highlight reels from 44 years ago are being projected onto a new generation 's formative inner eye , mythologizing events from ancient history and lionizing men who are either no longer with us or who now look very old indeed when wheeled out for comment whenever germany and england clash .
the papers , of course , are beside themselves with glee .
it 's only a matter of time before we see distasteful war-related headlines in the red tops and the demonizing of young german players who do n't much care about beating england , only about winning the world cup .
this is what the coming match should be about for us england fans - about progressing and emulating the heroes of 1966 .
instead it 's about getting one over the germans .
that 's what it 's always about for england .
we may beat germany , but even then we 'll probably meet an even stronger argentina side , managed by a certain fat gaucho , who 'll knock us out .
but we wo n't care .
we 'll have beaten the germans .
and that 's all that matters .

that 's why a turgid 1-0 win over one of germany 's worst-ever sides in euro 2000 was celebrated like the second coming .
it did n't matter that england were dreadful too - and were n't far behind germany in getting knocked out of the tournament .
we 'd beaten the germans .
it was a hollow victory , but one still held close to english hearts .
meager as it now sounds , a 5-1 demolition in munich in a world cup qualifier a year later was even better .
it felt almost as good as 1966 .
almost .
bildunterschrift : beating even a woeful germany team , as in 2000 , is better than not beating them at all and so we meet again .
it 's 2010 , and already the highlight reels from 44 years ago are being projected onto a new generation 's formative inner eye , mythologizing events from ancient history and lionizing men who are either no longer with us or who now look very old indeed when wheeled out for comment whenever germany and england clash .
the papers , of course , are beside themselves with glee .
it 's only a matter of time before we see distasteful war-related headlines in the red tops and the demonizing of young german players who do n't much care about beating england , only about winning the world cup .
this is what the coming match should be about for us england fans - about progressing and emulating the heroes of 1966 .
instead it 's about getting one over the germans .
that 's what it 's always about for england .
we may beat germany , but even then we 'll probably meet an even stronger argentina side , managed by a certain fat gaucho , who 'll knock us out .
but we wo n't care .
we 'll have beaten the germans .
and that 's all that matters .

the capital of somalia is a microcosm of the countless conflicts that have been plaguing the failed east african state for decades , leading to hundreds of thousands of somalis starving to death and countless others being killed .
the western-backed transitional government has been teetering on the edge of collapse for years under the weight of continued attacks by the al qaeda-linked al shabab militia and fellow islamist militant group hizbul islam .
the two groups control much of central and southern somalia , leaving only a few small parts of the capital under government rule , protected by the somali military , its ahlu sunna waljama militia and african union peacekeepers .
the islamist insurgent groups battle government troops , pro-government militia and even each other in a never-ending struggle for control of a country which has n't had an effective government since 1991 .
even in government-controlled areas , the battles rage .
troops loyal to somalia 's government fight within their ranks for scraps of power on the capital 's scarred streets .
they have even engaged in gun fights with their own police forces as corruption and organized crime eats away at the fragile state security systems in place , playing into the hands of the radical islamist insurgents who aim to take control of the whole country .
meanwhile , to compound the problems , pirates continue to operate off the somali coast .
in the midst of all the chaos , the inter-clan fighting and religious battles , the somali government is accused of deploying child soldiers , some as young as 12 , with assault rifles to protect its interests in mogadishu .
somali use of child soldiers reveals concerns over us aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia 's use of child soldiers has raised un concern a united nations security council report into somalia 's " persistent violations " in the use of child soldiers has not only heightened the international community 's deep concern at the continuing practice in african wars and the state of near-constant war in somalia but has also turned the spotlight on the involvement of the united states in the fight for control .
washington has been the main source of western aid for the transitional government since it came to power three years ago and has pumped millions of dollars into the somali military for weapons and soldiers ' salaries .
last year alone , the us government provided somalia with some 40 tonnes of arms and ammunition .
somalia is also expected to benefit from the obama administration 's 2011 budget request for security assistance programmes in africa which includes $ 38 million -lrb- 30.9 million euros -rrb- for arms sales to african states , $ 21 million for training african officers and $ 24 million for anti-terrorism programmes .
there is some concern that by supporting the somali government , washington has violated a number of international human rights laws and laws against the use of child soldiers .
while it has yet to be proved that the us has actually contravened these laws , they have been complying with other un restrictions , albeit with a certain amount of creativity of interpretation , which allow arms sales to somalia .
" the arms embargo which was put in place in 1992 was amended by the un in 2006 to allow arms to be sold to the transitional government , " david hartwell , an expert at jane 's defense , told deutsche welle .
" the international community has no other choice but to support the somali government and the americans have exploited this to sell arms via the ethiopians and the ugandan peacekeepers , who have bought weapons on behalf of the us and billed washington . "
hartwell says that the americans are n't the only ones providing weapons .
" on the other side we have eritrea which is arming the militants , " he added .
" the eritreans have been complaining about double standards because they are seen as breaking the embargo because they 're not supplying the somali government and yet the us and ethiopia , which is fighting a proxy war against eritrea in somalia , are flooding the country with weapons . "

eight-tentacled paul predicts a win for germany against england as the two sides prepare for their world cup clash . a sea creature famed for predicting football results has tipped germany to beat england in sunday 's eagerly anticipated world cup showdown .
paul the octopus , who lives at the sea life aquarium in the german city of oberhausen , has been making waves with his successful predictions of the outcomes of all of germany 's group-stage matches in south africa .
in his latest test , paul was offered the choice of two plastic boxes containing food - one adorned with england 's st. george flag , the other with a german flag .
paul moved quickly to open the box with the germany flag , to the delight of spectators , and the selection was reported in news broadcasts across germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul picked serbia as the winner ahead of germany 's game with that country - he was right " paul went rather quickly for the germany flag , " said sea life spokeswoman tanja munzig .
" he 's got a 100-percent average in the world cup so far . ”
winning record paul 's keepers said that the octopod , using the same method , had already predicted germany 's group-stage wins over australia and ghana as well as the national side 's loss to serbia .
during the football european championships in 2008 , they said , paul picked the winning side in 80 percent of german games .
england fans might have reason to feel aggrieved at the latest decision reached by the octopus .
paul was , in fact , born a little over two years ago in the english seaside town of weymouth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 26.06.2010 us support for somali government raises questions over military aid 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us involvement is aimed at stopping islamic extremism concern that us military aid and support to the government of somalia may have breached a number of international laws turns the spotlight on washington 's involvement in a country it was supposed to have left years ago . mogadishu is a city constantly at war with itself .
the capital of somalia is a microcosm of the countless conflicts that have been plaguing the failed east african state for decades , leading to hundreds of thousands of somalis starving to death and countless others being killed .
the western-backed transitional government has been teetering on the edge of collapse for years under the weight of continued attacks by the al qaeda-linked al shabab militia and fellow islamist militant group hizbul islam .
the two groups control much of central and southern somalia , leaving only a few small parts of the capital under government rule , protected by the somali military , its ahlu sunna waljama militia and african union peacekeepers .
the islamist insurgent groups battle government troops , pro-government militia and even each other in a never-ending struggle for control of a country which has n't had an effective government since 1991 .
even in government-controlled areas , the battles rage .
troops loyal to somalia 's government fight within their ranks for scraps of power on the capital 's scarred streets .
they have even engaged in gun fights with their own police forces as corruption and organized crime eats away at the fragile state security systems in place , playing into the hands of the radical islamist insurgents who aim to take control of the whole country .
meanwhile , to compound the problems , pirates continue to operate off the somali coast .
in the midst of all the chaos , the inter-clan fighting and religious battles , the somali government is accused of deploying child soldiers , some as young as 12 , with assault rifles to protect its interests in mogadishu .
somali use of child soldiers reveals concerns over us aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia 's use of child soldiers has raised un concern a united nations security council report into somalia 's " persistent violations " in the use of child soldiers has not only heightened the international community 's deep concern at the continuing practice in african wars and the state of near-constant war in somalia but has also turned the spotlight on the involvement of the united states in the fight for control .
washington has been the main source of western aid for the transitional government since it came to power three years ago and has pumped millions of dollars into the somali military for weapons and soldiers ' salaries .
last year alone , the us government provided somalia with some 40 tonnes of arms and ammunition .
somalia is also expected to benefit from the obama administration 's 2011 budget request for security assistance programmes in africa which includes $ 38 million -lrb- 30.9 million euros -rrb- for arms sales to african states , $ 21 million for training african officers and $ 24 million for anti-terrorism programmes .
there is some concern that by supporting the somali government , washington has violated a number of international human rights laws and laws against the use of child soldiers .
while it has yet to be proved that the us has actually contravened these laws , they have been complying with other un restrictions , albeit with a certain amount of creativity of interpretation , which allow arms sales to somalia .
" the arms embargo which was put in place in 1992 was amended by the un in 2006 to allow arms to be sold to the transitional government , " david hartwell , an expert at jane 's defense , told deutsche welle .
" the international community has no other choice but to support the somali government and the americans have exploited this to sell arms via the ethiopians and the ugandan peacekeepers , who have bought weapons on behalf of the us and billed washington . "
hartwell says that the americans are n't the only ones providing weapons .
" on the other side we have eritrea which is arming the militants , " he added .
" the eritreans have been complaining about double standards because they are seen as breaking the embargo because they 're not supplying the somali government and yet the us and ethiopia , which is fighting a proxy war against eritrea in somalia , are flooding the country with weapons . "

the two groups control much of central and southern somalia , leaving only a few small parts of the capital under government rule , protected by the somali military , its ahlu sunna waljama militia and african union peacekeepers .
the islamist insurgent groups battle government troops , pro-government militia and even each other in a never-ending struggle for control of a country which has n't had an effective government since 1991 .
even in government-controlled areas , the battles rage .
troops loyal to somalia 's government fight within their ranks for scraps of power on the capital 's scarred streets .
they have even engaged in gun fights with their own police forces as corruption and organized crime eats away at the fragile state security systems in place , playing into the hands of the radical islamist insurgents who aim to take control of the whole country .
meanwhile , to compound the problems , pirates continue to operate off the somali coast .
in the midst of all the chaos , the inter-clan fighting and religious battles , the somali government is accused of deploying child soldiers , some as young as 12 , with assault rifles to protect its interests in mogadishu .
somali use of child soldiers reveals concerns over us aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia 's use of child soldiers has raised un concern a united nations security council report into somalia 's " persistent violations " in the use of child soldiers has not only heightened the international community 's deep concern at the continuing practice in african wars and the state of near-constant war in somalia but has also turned the spotlight on the involvement of the united states in the fight for control .
washington has been the main source of western aid for the transitional government since it came to power three years ago and has pumped millions of dollars into the somali military for weapons and soldiers ' salaries .
last year alone , the us government provided somalia with some 40 tonnes of arms and ammunition .
somalia is also expected to benefit from the obama administration 's 2011 budget request for security assistance programmes in africa which includes $ 38 million -lrb- 30.9 million euros -rrb- for arms sales to african states , $ 21 million for training african officers and $ 24 million for anti-terrorism programmes .
there is some concern that by supporting the somali government , washington has violated a number of international human rights laws and laws against the use of child soldiers .
while it has yet to be proved that the us has actually contravened these laws , they have been complying with other un restrictions , albeit with a certain amount of creativity of interpretation , which allow arms sales to somalia .
" the arms embargo which was put in place in 1992 was amended by the un in 2006 to allow arms to be sold to the transitional government , " david hartwell , an expert at jane 's defense , told deutsche welle .
" the international community has no other choice but to support the somali government and the americans have exploited this to sell arms via the ethiopians and the ugandan peacekeepers , who have bought weapons on behalf of the us and billed washington . "
hartwell says that the americans are n't the only ones providing weapons .
" on the other side we have eritrea which is arming the militants , " he added .
" the eritreans have been complaining about double standards because they are seen as breaking the embargo because they 're not supplying the somali government and yet the us and ethiopia , which is fighting a proxy war against eritrea in somalia , are flooding the country with weapons . "

a decision on a proposal to end the global moratorium on whaling was postponed . greenland 's indigenous people now have the right to add humpbacks to a list of whales they are allowed to hunt , according to a decision made at the end of the international whaling commission 's annual meeting in agadir , morocco on friday .
they will now be allowed to kill and consume nine of the giant mammals each year through 2012 .
they were previously allowed to hunt 178 minke whales , 19 fin whales and two bowhead whales each year .
the number of fin whales will be reduced so that the total number of whales killed remains the same .
" our rights will be violated if we ca n't get this resolution , " said ane hansen , greenland 's fishing and hunting minister , during a tense plenary session before the decision .
she added that scientists from the commission had determined that harvesting 10 whales every year for a decade would not adversely affect humpback populations .
approved without a vote international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- delegates said there was consensus on the issue and the 88 member countries did not hold a vote on it .
some countries , including japan , had said that denying the humpback extension - or even taking it to a vote - would damage the organization .
several members were , however , resistant to the idea of allowing the humpback whale hunt .
" this population is not exactly starving .
they enjoy one of the highest average household incomes in the world , " said frederic briand , monaco 's negotiator , adding that more than 3,000 small cetaceans - including whales , dolphins and porpoises - are caught every year in greenland 's waters to feed the population of 55,000 .
some environmental groups argued that the whale meat does n't just feed the native people but also ends up in supermarkets and restaurants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some native groups are allowed a limited number of kills a year " whale meat is sold even in copenhagen with the justification that greenlanders live there , " said biologist petra deimar , a member of the iwc scientific committee .
while greenland is a self-ruled territory of denmark , it is not a member of the european union .
the eu supported the extension for greenland after reaching a deal with denmark reducing the total number of whales .
moratorium sticks for now indigenous groups from several countries are exempt from a 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling .
the ban itself was up for discussion at the iwc meeting but talks over ending it collapsed .
debate had centered on iceland , japan and norway , which continue whaling , reducing the total number of whales they hunt each year .
the proposal would have allowed those three rogue countries a small annual commercial hunt .
japan says it hunts whales for scientific purposes , while norway and iceland claim special rights exempt them .
together the three countries killed more than 1,500 whales in the 2008-2009 season .
a decision on the proposal will now be postponed until next year .

the capital of somalia is a microcosm of the countless conflicts that have been plaguing the failed east african state for decades , leading to hundreds of thousands of somalis starving to death and countless others being killed .
the western-backed transitional government has been teetering on the edge of collapse for years under the weight of continued attacks by the al qaeda-linked al shabab militia and fellow islamist militant group hizbul islam .
the two groups control much of central and southern somalia , leaving only a few small parts of the capital under government rule , protected by the somali military , its ahlu sunna waljama militia and african union peacekeepers .
the islamist insurgent groups battle government troops , pro-government militia and even each other in a never-ending struggle for control of a country which has n't had an effective government since 1991 .
even in government-controlled areas , the battles rage .
troops loyal to somalia 's government fight within their ranks for scraps of power on the capital 's scarred streets .
they have even engaged in gun fights with their own police forces as corruption and organized crime eats away at the fragile state security systems in place , playing into the hands of the radical islamist insurgents who aim to take control of the whole country .
meanwhile , to compound the problems , pirates continue to operate off the somali coast .
in the midst of all the chaos , the inter-clan fighting and religious battles , the somali government is accused of deploying child soldiers , some as young as 12 , with assault rifles to protect its interests in mogadishu .
somali use of child soldiers reveals concerns over us aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia 's use of child soldiers has raised un concern a united nations security council report into somalia 's " persistent violations " in the use of child soldiers has not only heightened the international community 's deep concern at the continuing practice in african wars and the state of near-constant war in somalia but has also turned the spotlight on the involvement of the united states in the fight for control .
washington has been the main source of western aid for the transitional government since it came to power three years ago and has pumped millions of dollars into the somali military for weapons and soldiers ' salaries .
last year alone , the us government provided somalia with some 40 tonnes of arms and ammunition .
somalia is also expected to benefit from the obama administration 's 2011 budget request for security assistance programmes in africa which includes $ 38 million -lrb- 30.9 million euros -rrb- for arms sales to african states , $ 21 million for training african officers and $ 24 million for anti-terrorism programmes .
there is some concern that by supporting the somali government , washington has violated a number of international human rights laws and laws against the use of child soldiers .
while it has yet to be proved that the us has actually contravened these laws , they have been complying with other un restrictions , albeit with a certain amount of creativity of interpretation , which allow arms sales to somalia .
" the arms embargo which was put in place in 1992 was amended by the un in 2006 to allow arms to be sold to the transitional government , " david hartwell , an expert at jane 's defense , told deutsche welle .
" the international community has no other choice but to support the somali government and the americans have exploited this to sell arms via the ethiopians and the ugandan peacekeepers , who have bought weapons on behalf of the us and billed washington . "
hartwell says that the americans are n't the only ones providing weapons .
" on the other side we have eritrea which is arming the militants , " he added .
" the eritreans have been complaining about double standards because they are seen as breaking the embargo because they 're not supplying the somali government and yet the us and ethiopia , which is fighting a proxy war against eritrea in somalia , are flooding the country with weapons . "

but the victims themselves need no reminder .
many are left not with bruises or broken bones , but with emotional and psychological scars that remain years after the torture has ceased – and music is being used by some as torture instrument of choice .
" you lose control and start to hallucinate .
you 're pushed to a threshold , and you realize that insanity is lurking on the other side .
and once you cross that line , there 's no going back .
i saw that threshold several times , " said binyam mohamed in an interview with uk prisoners ' advocacy organization reprieve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : binyam mohamed suffered harsh interrogation techniques in guantanamo mohamed , a former inmate at the " dark prison " in afghanistan and later at the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , is one of an untold number of victims of so-called " no-touch " torture techniques .
these are psychological techniques , often employed during interrogations , that leave few or no physical marks on the victim but can have lasting psychological consequences .
music used as part of ' cruel and degrading ' treatment mohamed described an interrogation period of almost three weeks , during which he was hung up in stress positions and allowed to sleep only occasionally and for a few hours at a time , as music played at ear-splitting volumes .
this music changed from tracks by popular rappers eminem and dr dre to " horrible ghost laughter and halloween sounds " , mohamed said .
" the cia worked on people , including me , day and night - plenty lost their minds .
i could hear people knocking their heads against the walls and the doors , screaming their heads off " , he added .
in february this year , the united kingdom court of appeal ruled that mohamed 's treatment at the hands of united states authorities was " cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some former guantanamo bay detainees claim they were tortured with music another former guantanamo detainee , ruhal ahmed , described the musical torture as more brutal than physical abuse .
" it 's as if you had very bad migraines , and then someone shows up and yells at you – and take that times a thousand .
you ca n't concentrate on anything , " he told german weekly der spiegel .
" before that , when i was beaten , i could use my imagination to forget the pain .
but the music makes you completely disoriented .
it takes over your brain . "
human rights groups say that in recent years there 's been an increase in the use of these invisible torture techniques , though the use of music as a torture instrument dates back centuries .
" we know that even from ancient history , extremely loud sounds were used to terrify populations before the army was going to invade the next day , " said dr suzanne cusick , a musicologist at new york university .
" we know that people would be put in caves so that the resonant qualities of the stone would make small sounds seem ubiquitous and extremely loud , " she added .
" but we can now do that for hundreds of people at a time and we do n't depend on a cave to do it . "
invisible torture techniques go back decades modern use of music and sound during interrogations grew out of research from the 1950s in which the cia conducted experiments to work out how to break people psychologically .
the british subjected irish prisoners to white-noise in the 70s and the israelis made similar use of music in the 90s .
more recently , experts have accused the us military of holding suspected terrorists inside shipping containers and blasting them with a playlist including not only rock songs like metallica 's " enter sandman " but also contemporary children 's music such as barney the purple dinosaur 's " i love you " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tracks from rock group metallica have been used during prisoner interrogations " with a rhythm , it 's like beating … it gets into your head and you get a headache and you can not concentrate on anything else , " said physician and psychotherapist dr mechthild wenk-ansohn , from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims .
the center treats around 500 children and adults from over 50 countries every year , all of them victims of torture or war-related violence .
music is a particularly versatile form of psychological interrogation as it can be tailored to cause maximum discomfort for specific prisoners .
" in turkey it was used that they played very patriotic music or march music -lsb- to -rsb- these two kurds who had been fighting for their independence .
so this was a way to humiliate them , " wenk-ansohn said .
many survivors suffer flashbacks from acoustic triggers in everyday life – anything from a neighbor 's radio , a car stereo , shopping centers or tv – and many are never able to relate to music in the same way .
new york university 's cusick told of one former guantanamo detainee who had once been a great fan of garage and hard rock .
" he seldom listens to music of any kind now .
he 's extremely sensitive to ambient sound , " she said .
" he remains paranoid now four years after his capture and imprisonment .
he believes that he could be picked up at anytime and consequently he 's afraid to go out of his house . "
not torture – just interrogation , say authorities the us has never considered its use of music during interrogation to be torture at all .
us authorities described it as an enhanced interrogation technique – the same term used to describe sleep deprivation , stress positions and water-boarding .
last year us president barack obama ordered an end to the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques , limiting the cia to interrogation methods explicitly outlined in the us army field manual on interrogations .
the use of music during interrogations is not one of the currently accepted interrogation methods .
stacy sullivan , a new york-based counter-terrorism expert with international ngo human rights watch , said that the organization has no evidence that the use of music during interrogations is on the increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama ordered an end to " harsh interrogation techniques " in 2009 yet there is some evidence that the practise still enjoys widespread use .
wenk-ansohn from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims said that the center is seeing a growing number patients who have been subjected to treatment involving music , including those who have come from turkey , iraq and iran .
dr. julia duchrow from amnesty international germany said these techniques violate the international declaration of human rights and should be recognized as torture " because the music is used intentionally to make someone suffer and create pain in the brains and the mental health of the person . "
duchrow added that germany , like other countries that have signed declarations that prohibit torture , has a responsibility to fight against torture in all its forms .
while some musicians like james hetfield of metallica may not publicly object to their music being used to interrogate suspected terrorists , others like tom morello from the politically active rage against the machine are angry that their music has been used to hurt people .
they and over 25 other bands , as well as amnesty international , are engaged in an ongoing campaign to end the use of music as an instrument of torture .

and once you cross that line , there 's no going back .
i saw that threshold several times , " said binyam mohamed in an interview with uk prisoners ' advocacy organization reprieve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : binyam mohamed suffered harsh interrogation techniques in guantanamo mohamed , a former inmate at the " dark prison " in afghanistan and later at the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , is one of an untold number of victims of so-called " no-touch " torture techniques .
these are psychological techniques , often employed during interrogations , that leave few or no physical marks on the victim but can have lasting psychological consequences .
music used as part of ' cruel and degrading ' treatment mohamed described an interrogation period of almost three weeks , during which he was hung up in stress positions and allowed to sleep only occasionally and for a few hours at a time , as music played at ear-splitting volumes .
this music changed from tracks by popular rappers eminem and dr dre to " horrible ghost laughter and halloween sounds " , mohamed said .
" the cia worked on people , including me , day and night - plenty lost their minds .
i could hear people knocking their heads against the walls and the doors , screaming their heads off " , he added .
in february this year , the united kingdom court of appeal ruled that mohamed 's treatment at the hands of united states authorities was " cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some former guantanamo bay detainees claim they were tortured with music another former guantanamo detainee , ruhal ahmed , described the musical torture as more brutal than physical abuse .
" it 's as if you had very bad migraines , and then someone shows up and yells at you – and take that times a thousand .
you ca n't concentrate on anything , " he told german weekly der spiegel .
" before that , when i was beaten , i could use my imagination to forget the pain .
but the music makes you completely disoriented .
it takes over your brain . "
human rights groups say that in recent years there 's been an increase in the use of these invisible torture techniques , though the use of music as a torture instrument dates back centuries .
" we know that even from ancient history , extremely loud sounds were used to terrify populations before the army was going to invade the next day , " said dr suzanne cusick , a musicologist at new york university .
" we know that people would be put in caves so that the resonant qualities of the stone would make small sounds seem ubiquitous and extremely loud , " she added .
" but we can now do that for hundreds of people at a time and we do n't depend on a cave to do it . "
invisible torture techniques go back decades modern use of music and sound during interrogations grew out of research from the 1950s in which the cia conducted experiments to work out how to break people psychologically .
the british subjected irish prisoners to white-noise in the 70s and the israelis made similar use of music in the 90s .
more recently , experts have accused the us military of holding suspected terrorists inside shipping containers and blasting them with a playlist including not only rock songs like metallica 's " enter sandman " but also contemporary children 's music such as barney the purple dinosaur 's " i love you " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tracks from rock group metallica have been used during prisoner interrogations " with a rhythm , it 's like beating … it gets into your head and you get a headache and you can not concentrate on anything else , " said physician and psychotherapist dr mechthild wenk-ansohn , from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims .
the center treats around 500 children and adults from over 50 countries every year , all of them victims of torture or war-related violence .
music is a particularly versatile form of psychological interrogation as it can be tailored to cause maximum discomfort for specific prisoners .
" in turkey it was used that they played very patriotic music or march music -lsb- to -rsb- these two kurds who had been fighting for their independence .
so this was a way to humiliate them , " wenk-ansohn said .
many survivors suffer flashbacks from acoustic triggers in everyday life – anything from a neighbor 's radio , a car stereo , shopping centers or tv – and many are never able to relate to music in the same way .
new york university 's cusick told of one former guantanamo detainee who had once been a great fan of garage and hard rock .
" he seldom listens to music of any kind now .
he 's extremely sensitive to ambient sound , " she said .
" he remains paranoid now four years after his capture and imprisonment .
he believes that he could be picked up at anytime and consequently he 's afraid to go out of his house . "
not torture – just interrogation , say authorities the us has never considered its use of music during interrogation to be torture at all .
us authorities described it as an enhanced interrogation technique – the same term used to describe sleep deprivation , stress positions and water-boarding .
last year us president barack obama ordered an end to the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques , limiting the cia to interrogation methods explicitly outlined in the us army field manual on interrogations .
the use of music during interrogations is not one of the currently accepted interrogation methods .
stacy sullivan , a new york-based counter-terrorism expert with international ngo human rights watch , said that the organization has no evidence that the use of music during interrogations is on the increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama ordered an end to " harsh interrogation techniques " in 2009 yet there is some evidence that the practise still enjoys widespread use .
wenk-ansohn from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims said that the center is seeing a growing number patients who have been subjected to treatment involving music , including those who have come from turkey , iraq and iran .
dr. julia duchrow from amnesty international germany said these techniques violate the international declaration of human rights and should be recognized as torture " because the music is used intentionally to make someone suffer and create pain in the brains and the mental health of the person . "
duchrow added that germany , like other countries that have signed declarations that prohibit torture , has a responsibility to fight against torture in all its forms .
while some musicians like james hetfield of metallica may not publicly object to their music being used to interrogate suspected terrorists , others like tom morello from the politically active rage against the machine are angry that their music has been used to hurt people .
they and over 25 other bands , as well as amnesty international , are engaged in an ongoing campaign to end the use of music as an instrument of torture .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : binyam mohamed suffered harsh interrogation techniques in guantanamo mohamed , a former inmate at the " dark prison " in afghanistan and later at the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , is one of an untold number of victims of so-called " no-touch " torture techniques .
these are psychological techniques , often employed during interrogations , that leave few or no physical marks on the victim but can have lasting psychological consequences .
music used as part of ' cruel and degrading ' treatment mohamed described an interrogation period of almost three weeks , during which he was hung up in stress positions and allowed to sleep only occasionally and for a few hours at a time , as music played at ear-splitting volumes .
this music changed from tracks by popular rappers eminem and dr dre to " horrible ghost laughter and halloween sounds " , mohamed said .
" the cia worked on people , including me , day and night - plenty lost their minds .
i could hear people knocking their heads against the walls and the doors , screaming their heads off " , he added .
in february this year , the united kingdom court of appeal ruled that mohamed 's treatment at the hands of united states authorities was " cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some former guantanamo bay detainees claim they were tortured with music another former guantanamo detainee , ruhal ahmed , described the musical torture as more brutal than physical abuse .
" it 's as if you had very bad migraines , and then someone shows up and yells at you – and take that times a thousand .
you ca n't concentrate on anything , " he told german weekly der spiegel .
" before that , when i was beaten , i could use my imagination to forget the pain .
but the music makes you completely disoriented .
it takes over your brain . "
human rights groups say that in recent years there 's been an increase in the use of these invisible torture techniques , though the use of music as a torture instrument dates back centuries .
" we know that even from ancient history , extremely loud sounds were used to terrify populations before the army was going to invade the next day , " said dr suzanne cusick , a musicologist at new york university .
" we know that people would be put in caves so that the resonant qualities of the stone would make small sounds seem ubiquitous and extremely loud , " she added .
" but we can now do that for hundreds of people at a time and we do n't depend on a cave to do it . "
invisible torture techniques go back decades modern use of music and sound during interrogations grew out of research from the 1950s in which the cia conducted experiments to work out how to break people psychologically .
the british subjected irish prisoners to white-noise in the 70s and the israelis made similar use of music in the 90s .
more recently , experts have accused the us military of holding suspected terrorists inside shipping containers and blasting them with a playlist including not only rock songs like metallica 's " enter sandman " but also contemporary children 's music such as barney the purple dinosaur 's " i love you " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tracks from rock group metallica have been used during prisoner interrogations " with a rhythm , it 's like beating … it gets into your head and you get a headache and you can not concentrate on anything else , " said physician and psychotherapist dr mechthild wenk-ansohn , from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims .
the center treats around 500 children and adults from over 50 countries every year , all of them victims of torture or war-related violence .
music is a particularly versatile form of psychological interrogation as it can be tailored to cause maximum discomfort for specific prisoners .
" in turkey it was used that they played very patriotic music or march music -lsb- to -rsb- these two kurds who had been fighting for their independence .
so this was a way to humiliate them , " wenk-ansohn said .
many survivors suffer flashbacks from acoustic triggers in everyday life – anything from a neighbor 's radio , a car stereo , shopping centers or tv – and many are never able to relate to music in the same way .
new york university 's cusick told of one former guantanamo detainee who had once been a great fan of garage and hard rock .
" he seldom listens to music of any kind now .
he 's extremely sensitive to ambient sound , " she said .
" he remains paranoid now four years after his capture and imprisonment .
he believes that he could be picked up at anytime and consequently he 's afraid to go out of his house . "
not torture – just interrogation , say authorities the us has never considered its use of music during interrogation to be torture at all .
us authorities described it as an enhanced interrogation technique – the same term used to describe sleep deprivation , stress positions and water-boarding .
last year us president barack obama ordered an end to the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques , limiting the cia to interrogation methods explicitly outlined in the us army field manual on interrogations .
the use of music during interrogations is not one of the currently accepted interrogation methods .
stacy sullivan , a new york-based counter-terrorism expert with international ngo human rights watch , said that the organization has no evidence that the use of music during interrogations is on the increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama ordered an end to " harsh interrogation techniques " in 2009 yet there is some evidence that the practise still enjoys widespread use .
wenk-ansohn from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims said that the center is seeing a growing number patients who have been subjected to treatment involving music , including those who have come from turkey , iraq and iran .
dr. julia duchrow from amnesty international germany said these techniques violate the international declaration of human rights and should be recognized as torture " because the music is used intentionally to make someone suffer and create pain in the brains and the mental health of the person . "
duchrow added that germany , like other countries that have signed declarations that prohibit torture , has a responsibility to fight against torture in all its forms .
while some musicians like james hetfield of metallica may not publicly object to their music being used to interrogate suspected terrorists , others like tom morello from the politically active rage against the machine are angry that their music has been used to hurt people .
they and over 25 other bands , as well as amnesty international , are engaged in an ongoing campaign to end the use of music as an instrument of torture .

of course england wants to win the world cup but if we ca n't , we at least want to be beat the germans , says dw 's nick amies . every england fan takes great pleasure in watching and re-watching the 4-2 victory over germany in the final of the 1966 world cup .
this is not only because this is the pinnacle of the national team 's success to date , but also because in winning the world cup , england stopped the germans from lifting the trophy .
it 's a two-for-the-price-of-one bargain that never gets old .
this is where an england fan 's indoctrination begins , with a joyous moment .
our national sporting obsession with germany has its roots in happiness - in the gap-toothed smile and carefree jig of midfielder nobby stiles .
the bitterness does n't begin until you 've been hooked and forced to watch more recent england vintages in the flesh .
then you have to admit that 1966 is as good as it gets .
england did n't even show up for world cup in 1974 or 1978 and our involvement in 1982 is best left unmentioned .
the main recollections of 1986 are of a squat argentinean bloke cheating us out of the tournament .
at least the fat gaucho had a hand -lrb- not literally in this case -rrb- in beating the germans in the final , so he could n't have been all that bad .
penalty pain bildunterschrift : things were equal in 1990 until the shoot-out when england players suddenly forgot how to shoot all of which brings us to italia 90 .
looking back , the only thing i now remember about that tournament is the germans in full group hug mode as england 's broken failures trudged from the pitch , vowing to practice penalties from now on .
that penalty shoot-out defeat to germany in a semi-final was traumatic , mainly because england looked as though they had a team good enough to win the cup for once .
when the european championships came to england in 1996 , the animosity towards germany was still at a pretty low level , despite the tabloids ' lazily digging up the war to try and get an already feverishly patriotic public ready for another semi-final clash against the germans .
italia 90 was an aberration .
we still had 1966 - which was only 30 years of hurt away at that point .
revenge would be ours because , you know , lightning could n't strike twice … could it ?
from today 's vantage point , there was more chance of lightning striking twice than england scoring two penalties .
two spot kicks .
penalty taker against goalkeeper .
it does n't seem that hard , does it ?
and this was a team that knew the heartbreak of losing to the germans on penalties .
surely they would n't let it happen again ?
history tells us that it did .
it also tells us that after beating england , germany went on to win the trophy , as they did in 1990 at the world cup .
one-sided " rivalry " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english tabloids dragged up war rhetoric for the 96 clash two soul-destroying defeats were enough to turn a little rivalry into a massive vendetta for the english .
with the memory of 1966 dimming fast , all that most of us had actually experienced was getting beaten by the germans .
for the germans , however , england 's obsession has never prompted anything other than mild bemusement .
as far as the germans are concerned , england are just another opponent , albeit one with a certain amount of history .
there certainly is n't the rabid reaction in germany to playing each other as there is in the uk .
germany 's grudge match is usually one played against their neighbors to the west in the netherlands .
fans in germany get excited about playing holland in much the same way as englishmen go loopy of the germans .
this fact infuriates the english further .
the rivalry should mean as much to the germans as it means to us - otherwise what 's the point of getting all stewed up about it ?
taking what we can get for england , beating germany is the pinnacle of any campaign .
that 's why a turgid 1-0 win over one of germany 's worst-ever sides in euro 2000 was celebrated like the second coming .
it did n't matter that england were dreadful too - and were n't far behind germany in getting knocked out of the tournament .
we 'd beaten the germans .
it was a hollow victory , but one still held close to english hearts .
meager as it now sounds , a 5-1 demolition in munich in a world cup qualifier a year later was even better .
it felt almost as good as 1966 .
almost .
bildunterschrift : beating even a woeful germany team , as in 2000 , is better than not beating them at all and so we meet again .
it 's 2010 , and already the highlight reels from 44 years ago are being projected onto a new generation 's formative inner eye , mythologizing events from ancient history and lionizing men who are either no longer with us or who now look very old indeed when wheeled out for comment whenever germany and england clash .
the papers , of course , are beside themselves with glee .
it 's only a matter of time before we see distasteful war-related headlines in the red tops and the demonizing of young german players who do n't much care about beating england , only about winning the world cup .
this is what the coming match should be about for us england fans - about progressing and emulating the heroes of 1966 .
instead it 's about getting one over the germans .
that 's what it 's always about for england .
we may beat germany , but even then we 'll probably meet an even stronger argentina side , managed by a certain fat gaucho , who 'll knock us out .
but we wo n't care .
we 'll have beaten the germans .
and that 's all that matters .

with the memory of 1966 dimming fast , all that most of us had actually experienced was getting beaten by the germans .
for the germans , however , england 's obsession has never prompted anything other than mild bemusement .
as far as the germans are concerned , england are just another opponent , albeit one with a certain amount of history .
there certainly is n't the rabid reaction in germany to playing each other as there is in the uk .
germany 's grudge match is usually one played against their neighbors to the west in the netherlands .
fans in germany get excited about playing holland in much the same way as englishmen go loopy of the germans .
this fact infuriates the english further .
the rivalry should mean as much to the germans as it means to us - otherwise what 's the point of getting all stewed up about it ?
taking what we can get for england , beating germany is the pinnacle of any campaign .
that 's why a turgid 1-0 win over one of germany 's worst-ever sides in euro 2000 was celebrated like the second coming .
it did n't matter that england were dreadful too - and were n't far behind germany in getting knocked out of the tournament .
we 'd beaten the germans .
it was a hollow victory , but one still held close to english hearts .
meager as it now sounds , a 5-1 demolition in munich in a world cup qualifier a year later was even better .
it felt almost as good as 1966 .
almost .
bildunterschrift : beating even a woeful germany team , as in 2000 , is better than not beating them at all and so we meet again .
it 's 2010 , and already the highlight reels from 44 years ago are being projected onto a new generation 's formative inner eye , mythologizing events from ancient history and lionizing men who are either no longer with us or who now look very old indeed when wheeled out for comment whenever germany and england clash .
the papers , of course , are beside themselves with glee .
it 's only a matter of time before we see distasteful war-related headlines in the red tops and the demonizing of young german players who do n't much care about beating england , only about winning the world cup .
this is what the coming match should be about for us england fans - about progressing and emulating the heroes of 1966 .
instead it 's about getting one over the germans .
that 's what it 's always about for england .
we may beat germany , but even then we 'll probably meet an even stronger argentina side , managed by a certain fat gaucho , who 'll knock us out .
but we wo n't care .
we 'll have beaten the germans .
and that 's all that matters .

of course england wants to win the world cup but if we ca n't , we at least want to be beat the germans , says dw 's nick amies . every england fan takes great pleasure in watching and re-watching the 4-2 victory over germany in the final of the 1966 world cup .
this is not only because this is the pinnacle of the national team 's success to date , but also because in winning the world cup , england stopped the germans from lifting the trophy .
it 's a two-for-the-price-of-one bargain that never gets old .
this is where an england fan 's indoctrination begins , with a joyous moment .
our national sporting obsession with germany has its roots in happiness - in the gap-toothed smile and carefree jig of midfielder nobby stiles .
the bitterness does n't begin until you 've been hooked and forced to watch more recent england vintages in the flesh .
then you have to admit that 1966 is as good as it gets .
england did n't even show up for world cup in 1974 or 1978 and our involvement in 1982 is best left unmentioned .
the main recollections of 1986 are of a squat argentinean bloke cheating us out of the tournament .
at least the fat gaucho had a hand -lrb- not literally in this case -rrb- in beating the germans in the final , so he could n't have been all that bad .
penalty pain bildunterschrift : things were equal in 1990 until the shoot-out when england players suddenly forgot how to shoot all of which brings us to italia 90 .
looking back , the only thing i now remember about that tournament is the germans in full group hug mode as england 's broken failures trudged from the pitch , vowing to practice penalties from now on .
that penalty shoot-out defeat to germany in a semi-final was traumatic , mainly because england looked as though they had a team good enough to win the cup for once .
when the european championships came to england in 1996 , the animosity towards germany was still at a pretty low level , despite the tabloids ' lazily digging up the war to try and get an already feverishly patriotic public ready for another semi-final clash against the germans .
italia 90 was an aberration .
we still had 1966 - which was only 30 years of hurt away at that point .
revenge would be ours because , you know , lightning could n't strike twice … could it ?
from today 's vantage point , there was more chance of lightning striking twice than england scoring two penalties .
two spot kicks .
penalty taker against goalkeeper .
it does n't seem that hard , does it ?
and this was a team that knew the heartbreak of losing to the germans on penalties .
surely they would n't let it happen again ?
history tells us that it did .
it also tells us that after beating england , germany went on to win the trophy , as they did in 1990 at the world cup .

" we are profoundly concerned by iran 's continued lack of transparency regarding its nuclear activities and its stated intention to continue and expand enriching uranium , including to nearly 20 percent , " g-8 leaders said in their final communique .
" our goal is to persuade iran 's leaders to engage in a transparent dialogue about its nuclear activities and to meet iran 's international obligations , " they wrote , while simultaneously welcoming a deal between iran , turkey and brazil designed to rein in the country 's nuclear enrichment program .

offering their full support to the current strategy in afghanistan , ahead of a number of major military operations in the country , the g-8 statement said afghan soldiers should be in a position to start taking responsibility for the country 's security " within five years . "

protestors had hoped to outwit authorities by only revealing the site at the last minute . at least five gay rights activists were roughly arrested and taken to a police car in st. petersburg , russia after taking part in an unsanctioned rally , according to a police spokesman .
some 30 protestors had gathered outside the famous hermitage museum on palace square , shouting slogans such as " equality without compromise , " " homophobia is an illness , " " homophobia - the country 's shame " and " marriage rights without compromises . "
police often violently break up gay rights demonstrations in russia and activists had kept the location of saturday 's rally a secret until the last minute in an attempt to prevent the arrests .
in may , activists in moscow held the first demonstration undisturbed by arrests and violence in five years .
organizers said it was only their " military planning " that prevented further arrests at that rally .
according to local media reports , a small group of anti-gay activists also showed up , attempting to attack the protesters .
at least four of them were also detained .
moscow 's mayor yury luzhkov has described gay pride parades as " satanic " and gay rights activists have condemned the russian authorities ' refusal to allow gay rights demonstrations .

a decision on a proposal to end the global moratorium on whaling was postponed . greenland 's indigenous people now have the right to add humpbacks to a list of whales they are allowed to hunt , according to a decision made at the end of the international whaling commission 's annual meeting in agadir , morocco on friday .
they will now be allowed to kill and consume nine of the giant mammals each year through 2012 .
they were previously allowed to hunt 178 minke whales , 19 fin whales and two bowhead whales each year .
the number of fin whales will be reduced so that the total number of whales killed remains the same .
" our rights will be violated if we ca n't get this resolution , " said ane hansen , greenland 's fishing and hunting minister , during a tense plenary session before the decision .
she added that scientists from the commission had determined that harvesting 10 whales every year for a decade would not adversely affect humpback populations .
approved without a vote international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- delegates said there was consensus on the issue and the 88 member countries did not hold a vote on it .
some countries , including japan , had said that denying the humpback extension - or even taking it to a vote - would damage the organization .
several members were , however , resistant to the idea of allowing the humpback whale hunt .
" this population is not exactly starving .
they enjoy one of the highest average household incomes in the world , " said frederic briand , monaco 's negotiator , adding that more than 3,000 small cetaceans - including whales , dolphins and porpoises - are caught every year in greenland 's waters to feed the population of 55,000 .
some environmental groups argued that the whale meat does n't just feed the native people but also ends up in supermarkets and restaurants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some native groups are allowed a limited number of kills a year " whale meat is sold even in copenhagen with the justification that greenlanders live there , " said biologist petra deimar , a member of the iwc scientific committee .
while greenland is a self-ruled territory of denmark , it is not a member of the european union .
the eu supported the extension for greenland after reaching a deal with denmark reducing the total number of whales .
moratorium sticks for now indigenous groups from several countries are exempt from a 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling .
the ban itself was up for discussion at the iwc meeting but talks over ending it collapsed .
debate had centered on iceland , japan and norway , which continue whaling , reducing the total number of whales they hunt each year .
the proposal would have allowed those three rogue countries a small annual commercial hunt .
japan says it hunts whales for scientific purposes , while norway and iceland claim special rights exempt them .
together the three countries killed more than 1,500 whales in the 2008-2009 season .
a decision on the proposal will now be postponed until next year .

a decision on a proposal to end the global moratorium on whaling was postponed . greenland 's indigenous people now have the right to add humpbacks to a list of whales they are allowed to hunt , according to a decision made at the end of the international whaling commission 's annual meeting in agadir , morocco on friday .
they will now be allowed to kill and consume nine of the giant mammals each year through 2012 .
they were previously allowed to hunt 178 minke whales , 19 fin whales and two bowhead whales each year .
the number of fin whales will be reduced so that the total number of whales killed remains the same .
" our rights will be violated if we ca n't get this resolution , " said ane hansen , greenland 's fishing and hunting minister , during a tense plenary session before the decision .
she added that scientists from the commission had determined that harvesting 10 whales every year for a decade would not adversely affect humpback populations .
approved without a vote international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- delegates said there was consensus on the issue and the 88 member countries did not hold a vote on it .
some countries , including japan , had said that denying the humpback extension - or even taking it to a vote - would damage the organization .
several members were , however , resistant to the idea of allowing the humpback whale hunt .
" this population is not exactly starving .
they enjoy one of the highest average household incomes in the world , " said frederic briand , monaco 's negotiator , adding that more than 3,000 small cetaceans - including whales , dolphins and porpoises - are caught every year in greenland 's waters to feed the population of 55,000 .
some environmental groups argued that the whale meat does n't just feed the native people but also ends up in supermarkets and restaurants .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some native groups are allowed a limited number of kills a year " whale meat is sold even in copenhagen with the justification that greenlanders live there , " said biologist petra deimar , a member of the iwc scientific committee .
while greenland is a self-ruled territory of denmark , it is not a member of the european union .
the eu supported the extension for greenland after reaching a deal with denmark reducing the total number of whales .
moratorium sticks for now indigenous groups from several countries are exempt from a 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling .
the ban itself was up for discussion at the iwc meeting but talks over ending it collapsed .
debate had centered on iceland , japan and norway , which continue whaling , reducing the total number of whales they hunt each year .
the proposal would have allowed those three rogue countries a small annual commercial hunt .
japan says it hunts whales for scientific purposes , while norway and iceland claim special rights exempt them .
together the three countries killed more than 1,500 whales in the 2008-2009 season .
a decision on the proposal will now be postponed until next year .

in his latest test , paul was offered the choice of two plastic boxes containing food - one adorned with england 's st. george flag , the other with a german flag .
paul moved quickly to open the box with the germany flag , to the delight of spectators , and the selection was reported in news broadcasts across germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul picked serbia as the winner ahead of germany 's game with that country - he was right " paul went rather quickly for the germany flag , " said sea life spokeswoman tanja munzig .
" he 's got a 100-percent average in the world cup so far . ”
winning record paul 's keepers said that the octopod , using the same method , had already predicted germany 's group-stage wins over australia and ghana as well as the national side 's loss to serbia .
during the football european championships in 2008 , they said , paul picked the winning side in 80 percent of german games .
england fans might have reason to feel aggrieved at the latest decision reached by the octopus .
paul was , in fact , born a little over two years ago in the english seaside town of weymouth .

protestors had hoped to outwit authorities by only revealing the site at the last minute . at least five gay rights activists were roughly arrested and taken to a police car in st. petersburg , russia after taking part in an unsanctioned rally , according to a police spokesman .
some 30 protestors had gathered outside the famous hermitage museum on palace square , shouting slogans such as " equality without compromise , " " homophobia is an illness , " " homophobia - the country 's shame " and " marriage rights without compromises . "
police often violently break up gay rights demonstrations in russia and activists had kept the location of saturday 's rally a secret until the last minute in an attempt to prevent the arrests .
in may , activists in moscow held the first demonstration undisturbed by arrests and violence in five years .
organizers said it was only their " military planning " that prevented further arrests at that rally .
according to local media reports , a small group of anti-gay activists also showed up , attempting to attack the protesters .
at least four of them were also detained .
moscow 's mayor yury luzhkov has described gay pride parades as " satanic " and gay rights activists have condemned the russian authorities ' refusal to allow gay rights demonstrations .

but the victims themselves need no reminder .
many are left not with bruises or broken bones , but with emotional and psychological scars that remain years after the torture has ceased – and music is being used by some as torture instrument of choice .
" you lose control and start to hallucinate .
you 're pushed to a threshold , and you realize that insanity is lurking on the other side .
and once you cross that line , there 's no going back .
i saw that threshold several times , " said binyam mohamed in an interview with uk prisoners ' advocacy organization reprieve .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : binyam mohamed suffered harsh interrogation techniques in guantanamo mohamed , a former inmate at the " dark prison " in afghanistan and later at the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , is one of an untold number of victims of so-called " no-touch " torture techniques .
these are psychological techniques , often employed during interrogations , that leave few or no physical marks on the victim but can have lasting psychological consequences .
music used as part of ' cruel and degrading ' treatment mohamed described an interrogation period of almost three weeks , during which he was hung up in stress positions and allowed to sleep only occasionally and for a few hours at a time , as music played at ear-splitting volumes .
this music changed from tracks by popular rappers eminem and dr dre to " horrible ghost laughter and halloween sounds " , mohamed said .
" the cia worked on people , including me , day and night - plenty lost their minds .
i could hear people knocking their heads against the walls and the doors , screaming their heads off " , he added .
in february this year , the united kingdom court of appeal ruled that mohamed 's treatment at the hands of united states authorities was " cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some former guantanamo bay detainees claim they were tortured with music another former guantanamo detainee , ruhal ahmed , described the musical torture as more brutal than physical abuse .
" it 's as if you had very bad migraines , and then someone shows up and yells at you – and take that times a thousand .
you ca n't concentrate on anything , " he told german weekly der spiegel .
" before that , when i was beaten , i could use my imagination to forget the pain .
but the music makes you completely disoriented .
it takes over your brain . "
human rights groups say that in recent years there 's been an increase in the use of these invisible torture techniques , though the use of music as a torture instrument dates back centuries .
" we know that even from ancient history , extremely loud sounds were used to terrify populations before the army was going to invade the next day , " said dr suzanne cusick , a musicologist at new york university .
" we know that people would be put in caves so that the resonant qualities of the stone would make small sounds seem ubiquitous and extremely loud , " she added .
" but we can now do that for hundreds of people at a time and we do n't depend on a cave to do it . "
invisible torture techniques go back decades modern use of music and sound during interrogations grew out of research from the 1950s in which the cia conducted experiments to work out how to break people psychologically .
the british subjected irish prisoners to white-noise in the 70s and the israelis made similar use of music in the 90s .
more recently , experts have accused the us military of holding suspected terrorists inside shipping containers and blasting them with a playlist including not only rock songs like metallica 's " enter sandman " but also contemporary children 's music such as barney the purple dinosaur 's " i love you " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tracks from rock group metallica have been used during prisoner interrogations " with a rhythm , it 's like beating … it gets into your head and you get a headache and you can not concentrate on anything else , " said physician and psychotherapist dr mechthild wenk-ansohn , from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims .
the center treats around 500 children and adults from over 50 countries every year , all of them victims of torture or war-related violence .
music is a particularly versatile form of psychological interrogation as it can be tailored to cause maximum discomfort for specific prisoners .
" in turkey it was used that they played very patriotic music or march music -lsb- to -rsb- these two kurds who had been fighting for their independence .
so this was a way to humiliate them , " wenk-ansohn said .
many survivors suffer flashbacks from acoustic triggers in everyday life – anything from a neighbor 's radio , a car stereo , shopping centers or tv – and many are never able to relate to music in the same way .
new york university 's cusick told of one former guantanamo detainee who had once been a great fan of garage and hard rock .
" he seldom listens to music of any kind now .
he 's extremely sensitive to ambient sound , " she said .
" he remains paranoid now four years after his capture and imprisonment .
he believes that he could be picked up at anytime and consequently he 's afraid to go out of his house . "
not torture – just interrogation , say authorities the us has never considered its use of music during interrogation to be torture at all .
us authorities described it as an enhanced interrogation technique – the same term used to describe sleep deprivation , stress positions and water-boarding .
last year us president barack obama ordered an end to the use of so-called enhanced interrogation techniques , limiting the cia to interrogation methods explicitly outlined in the us army field manual on interrogations .
the use of music during interrogations is not one of the currently accepted interrogation methods .
stacy sullivan , a new york-based counter-terrorism expert with international ngo human rights watch , said that the organization has no evidence that the use of music during interrogations is on the increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president barack obama ordered an end to " harsh interrogation techniques " in 2009 yet there is some evidence that the practise still enjoys widespread use .
wenk-ansohn from the berlin center for the treatment of torture victims said that the center is seeing a growing number patients who have been subjected to treatment involving music , including those who have come from turkey , iraq and iran .
dr. julia duchrow from amnesty international germany said these techniques violate the international declaration of human rights and should be recognized as torture " because the music is used intentionally to make someone suffer and create pain in the brains and the mental health of the person . "
duchrow added that germany , like other countries that have signed declarations that prohibit torture , has a responsibility to fight against torture in all its forms .
while some musicians like james hetfield of metallica may not publicly object to their music being used to interrogate suspected terrorists , others like tom morello from the politically active rage against the machine are angry that their music has been used to hurt people .
they and over 25 other bands , as well as amnesty international , are engaged in an ongoing campaign to end the use of music as an instrument of torture .

of course england wants to win the world cup but if we ca n't , we at least want to be beat the germans , says dw 's nick amies . every england fan takes great pleasure in watching and re-watching the 4-2 victory over germany in the final of the 1966 world cup .
this is not only because this is the pinnacle of the national team 's success to date , but also because in winning the world cup , england stopped the germans from lifting the trophy .
it 's a two-for-the-price-of-one bargain that never gets old .
this is where an england fan 's indoctrination begins , with a joyous moment .
our national sporting obsession with germany has its roots in happiness - in the gap-toothed smile and carefree jig of midfielder nobby stiles .
the bitterness does n't begin until you 've been hooked and forced to watch more recent england vintages in the flesh .
then you have to admit that 1966 is as good as it gets .
england did n't even show up for world cup in 1974 or 1978 and our involvement in 1982 is best left unmentioned .
the main recollections of 1986 are of a squat argentinean bloke cheating us out of the tournament .
at least the fat gaucho had a hand -lrb- not literally in this case -rrb- in beating the germans in the final , so he could n't have been all that bad .
penalty pain bildunterschrift : things were equal in 1990 until the shoot-out when england players suddenly forgot how to shoot all of which brings us to italia 90 .
looking back , the only thing i now remember about that tournament is the germans in full group hug mode as england 's broken failures trudged from the pitch , vowing to practice penalties from now on .
that penalty shoot-out defeat to germany in a semi-final was traumatic , mainly because england looked as though they had a team good enough to win the cup for once .
when the european championships came to england in 1996 , the animosity towards germany was still at a pretty low level , despite the tabloids ' lazily digging up the war to try and get an already feverishly patriotic public ready for another semi-final clash against the germans .
italia 90 was an aberration .
we still had 1966 - which was only 30 years of hurt away at that point .
revenge would be ours because , you know , lightning could n't strike twice … could it ?
from today 's vantage point , there was more chance of lightning striking twice than england scoring two penalties .
two spot kicks .
penalty taker against goalkeeper .
it does n't seem that hard , does it ?
and this was a team that knew the heartbreak of losing to the germans on penalties .
surely they would n't let it happen again ?
history tells us that it did .
it also tells us that after beating england , germany went on to win the trophy , as they did in 1990 at the world cup .
one-sided " rivalry " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english tabloids dragged up war rhetoric for the 96 clash two soul-destroying defeats were enough to turn a little rivalry into a massive vendetta for the english .
with the memory of 1966 dimming fast , all that most of us had actually experienced was getting beaten by the germans .
for the germans , however , england 's obsession has never prompted anything other than mild bemusement .
as far as the germans are concerned , england are just another opponent , albeit one with a certain amount of history .
there certainly is n't the rabid reaction in germany to playing each other as there is in the uk .
germany 's grudge match is usually one played against their neighbors to the west in the netherlands .
fans in germany get excited about playing holland in much the same way as englishmen go loopy of the germans .
this fact infuriates the english further .
the rivalry should mean as much to the germans as it means to us - otherwise what 's the point of getting all stewed up about it ?
taking what we can get for england , beating germany is the pinnacle of any campaign .
that 's why a turgid 1-0 win over one of germany 's worst-ever sides in euro 2000 was celebrated like the second coming .
it did n't matter that england were dreadful too - and were n't far behind germany in getting knocked out of the tournament .
we 'd beaten the germans .
it was a hollow victory , but one still held close to english hearts .
meager as it now sounds , a 5-1 demolition in munich in a world cup qualifier a year later was even better .
it felt almost as good as 1966 .
almost .
bildunterschrift : beating even a woeful germany team , as in 2000 , is better than not beating them at all and so we meet again .
it 's 2010 , and already the highlight reels from 44 years ago are being projected onto a new generation 's formative inner eye , mythologizing events from ancient history and lionizing men who are either no longer with us or who now look very old indeed when wheeled out for comment whenever germany and england clash .
the papers , of course , are beside themselves with glee .
it 's only a matter of time before we see distasteful war-related headlines in the red tops and the demonizing of young german players who do n't much care about beating england , only about winning the world cup .
this is what the coming match should be about for us england fans - about progressing and emulating the heroes of 1966 .
instead it 's about getting one over the germans .
that 's what it 's always about for england .
we may beat germany , but even then we 'll probably meet an even stronger argentina side , managed by a certain fat gaucho , who 'll knock us out .
but we wo n't care .
we 'll have beaten the germans .
and that 's all that matters .
nick amies is a life-long england supporter , and germany detractor .

dw-world.de germany face england as the world cup gets its first real clash of rivals with the group stages almost at an end , the 2010 world cup is about to begin its nerve-wracking knock-out rounds .

the capital of somalia is a microcosm of the countless conflicts that have been plaguing the failed east african state for decades , leading to hundreds of thousands of somalis starving to death and countless others being killed .
the western-backed transitional government has been teetering on the edge of collapse for years under the weight of continued attacks by the al qaeda-linked al shabab militia and fellow islamist militant group hizbul islam .
the two groups control much of central and southern somalia , leaving only a few small parts of the capital under government rule , protected by the somali military , its ahlu sunna waljama militia and african union peacekeepers .
the islamist insurgent groups battle government troops , pro-government militia and even each other in a never-ending struggle for control of a country which has n't had an effective government since 1991 .
even in government-controlled areas , the battles rage .
troops loyal to somalia 's government fight within their ranks for scraps of power on the capital 's scarred streets .
they have even engaged in gun fights with their own police forces as corruption and organized crime eats away at the fragile state security systems in place , playing into the hands of the radical islamist insurgents who aim to take control of the whole country .
meanwhile , to compound the problems , pirates continue to operate off the somali coast .
in the midst of all the chaos , the inter-clan fighting and religious battles , the somali government is accused of deploying child soldiers , some as young as 12 , with assault rifles to protect its interests in mogadishu .
somali use of child soldiers reveals concerns over us aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia 's use of child soldiers has raised un concern a united nations security council report into somalia 's " persistent violations " in the use of child soldiers has not only heightened the international community 's deep concern at the continuing practice in african wars and the state of near-constant war in somalia but has also turned the spotlight on the involvement of the united states in the fight for control .
washington has been the main source of western aid for the transitional government since it came to power three years ago and has pumped millions of dollars into the somali military for weapons and soldiers ' salaries .
last year alone , the us government provided somalia with some 40 tonnes of arms and ammunition .
somalia is also expected to benefit from the obama administration 's 2011 budget request for security assistance programmes in africa which includes $ 38 million -lrb- 30.9 million euros -rrb- for arms sales to african states , $ 21 million for training african officers and $ 24 million for anti-terrorism programmes .
there is some concern that by supporting the somali government , washington has violated a number of international human rights laws and laws against the use of child soldiers .
while it has yet to be proved that the us has actually contravened these laws , they have been complying with other un restrictions , albeit with a certain amount of creativity of interpretation , which allow arms sales to somalia .
" the arms embargo which was put in place in 1992 was amended by the un in 2006 to allow arms to be sold to the transitional government , " david hartwell , an expert at jane 's defense , told deutsche welle .
" the international community has no other choice but to support the somali government and the americans have exploited this to sell arms via the ethiopians and the ugandan peacekeepers , who have bought weapons on behalf of the us and billed washington . "
hartwell says that the americans are n't the only ones providing weapons .
" on the other side we have eritrea which is arming the militants , " he added .
" the eritreans have been complaining about double standards because they are seen as breaking the embargo because they 're not supplying the somali government and yet the us and ethiopia , which is fighting a proxy war against eritrea in somalia , are flooding the country with weapons . "

the capital of somalia is a microcosm of the countless conflicts that have been plaguing the failed east african state for decades , leading to hundreds of thousands of somalis starving to death and countless others being killed .
the western-backed transitional government has been teetering on the edge of collapse for years under the weight of continued attacks by the al qaeda-linked al shabab militia and fellow islamist militant group hizbul islam .
the two groups control much of central and southern somalia , leaving only a few small parts of the capital under government rule , protected by the somali military , its ahlu sunna waljama militia and african union peacekeepers .
the islamist insurgent groups battle government troops , pro-government militia and even each other in a never-ending struggle for control of a country which has n't had an effective government since 1991 .
even in government-controlled areas , the battles rage .
troops loyal to somalia 's government fight within their ranks for scraps of power on the capital 's scarred streets .
they have even engaged in gun fights with their own police forces as corruption and organized crime eats away at the fragile state security systems in place , playing into the hands of the radical islamist insurgents who aim to take control of the whole country .
meanwhile , to compound the problems , pirates continue to operate off the somali coast .
in the midst of all the chaos , the inter-clan fighting and religious battles , the somali government is accused of deploying child soldiers , some as young as 12 , with assault rifles to protect its interests in mogadishu .
somali use of child soldiers reveals concerns over us aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia 's use of child soldiers has raised un concern a united nations security council report into somalia 's " persistent violations " in the use of child soldiers has not only heightened the international community 's deep concern at the continuing practice in african wars and the state of near-constant war in somalia but has also turned the spotlight on the involvement of the united states in the fight for control .
washington has been the main source of western aid for the transitional government since it came to power three years ago and has pumped millions of dollars into the somali military for weapons and soldiers ' salaries .
last year alone , the us government provided somalia with some 40 tonnes of arms and ammunition .
somalia is also expected to benefit from the obama administration 's 2011 budget request for security assistance programmes in africa which includes $ 38 million -lrb- 30.9 million euros -rrb- for arms sales to african states , $ 21 million for training african officers and $ 24 million for anti-terrorism programmes .
there is some concern that by supporting the somali government , washington has violated a number of international human rights laws and laws against the use of child soldiers .
while it has yet to be proved that the us has actually contravened these laws , they have been complying with other un restrictions , albeit with a certain amount of creativity of interpretation , which allow arms sales to somalia .
" the arms embargo which was put in place in 1992 was amended by the un in 2006 to allow arms to be sold to the transitional government , " david hartwell , an expert at jane 's defense , told deutsche welle .
" the international community has no other choice but to support the somali government and the americans have exploited this to sell arms via the ethiopians and the ugandan peacekeepers , who have bought weapons on behalf of the us and billed washington . "
hartwell says that the americans are n't the only ones providing weapons .
" on the other side we have eritrea which is arming the militants , " he added .
" the eritreans have been complaining about double standards because they are seen as breaking the embargo because they 're not supplying the somali government and yet the us and ethiopia , which is fighting a proxy war against eritrea in somalia , are flooding the country with weapons . "

meanwhile , to compound the problems , pirates continue to operate off the somali coast .
in the midst of all the chaos , the inter-clan fighting and religious battles , the somali government is accused of deploying child soldiers , some as young as 12 , with assault rifles to protect its interests in mogadishu .
somali use of child soldiers reveals concerns over us aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia 's use of child soldiers has raised un concern a united nations security council report into somalia 's " persistent violations " in the use of child soldiers has not only heightened the international community 's deep concern at the continuing practice in african wars and the state of near-constant war in somalia but has also turned the spotlight on the involvement of the united states in the fight for control .
washington has been the main source of western aid for the transitional government since it came to power three years ago and has pumped millions of dollars into the somali military for weapons and soldiers ' salaries .
last year alone , the us government provided somalia with some 40 tonnes of arms and ammunition .
somalia is also expected to benefit from the obama administration 's 2011 budget request for security assistance programmes in africa which includes $ 38 million -lrb- 30.9 million euros -rrb- for arms sales to african states , $ 21 million for training african officers and $ 24 million for anti-terrorism programmes .
there is some concern that by supporting the somali government , washington has violated a number of international human rights laws and laws against the use of child soldiers .
while it has yet to be proved that the us has actually contravened these laws , they have been complying with other un restrictions , albeit with a certain amount of creativity of interpretation , which allow arms sales to somalia .
" the arms embargo which was put in place in 1992 was amended by the un in 2006 to allow arms to be sold to the transitional government , " david hartwell , an expert at jane 's defense , told deutsche welle .
" the international community has no other choice but to support the somali government and the americans have exploited this to sell arms via the ethiopians and the ugandan peacekeepers , who have bought weapons on behalf of the us and billed washington . "
hartwell says that the americans are n't the only ones providing weapons .
" on the other side we have eritrea which is arming the militants , " he added .
" the eritreans have been complaining about double standards because they are seen as breaking the embargo because they 're not supplying the somali government and yet the us and ethiopia , which is fighting a proxy war against eritrea in somalia , are flooding the country with weapons . "

" the arms embargo which was put in place in 1992 was amended by the un in 2006 to allow arms to be sold to the transitional government , " david hartwell , an expert at jane 's defense , told deutsche welle .
" the international community has no other choice but to support the somali government and the americans have exploited this to sell arms via the ethiopians and the ugandan peacekeepers , who have bought weapons on behalf of the us and billed washington . "
hartwell says that the americans are n't the only ones providing weapons .
" on the other side we have eritrea which is arming the militants , " he added .
" the eritreans have been complaining about double standards because they are seen as breaking the embargo because they 're not supplying the somali government and yet the us and ethiopia , which is fighting a proxy war against eritrea in somalia , are flooding the country with weapons . "

the capital of somalia is a microcosm of the countless conflicts that have been plaguing the failed east african state for decades , leading to hundreds of thousands of somalis starving to death and countless others being killed .
the western-backed transitional government has been teetering on the edge of collapse for years under the weight of continued attacks by the al qaeda-linked al shabab militia and fellow islamist militant group hizbul islam .
the two groups control much of central and southern somalia , leaving only a few small parts of the capital under government rule , protected by the somali military , its ahlu sunna waljama militia and african union peacekeepers .
the islamist insurgent groups battle government troops , pro-government militia and even each other in a never-ending struggle for control of a country which has n't had an effective government since 1991 .
even in government-controlled areas , the battles rage .
troops loyal to somalia 's government fight within their ranks for scraps of power on the capital 's scarred streets .
they have even engaged in gun fights with their own police forces as corruption and organized crime eats away at the fragile state security systems in place , playing into the hands of the radical islamist insurgents who aim to take control of the whole country .
meanwhile , to compound the problems , pirates continue to operate off the somali coast .
in the midst of all the chaos , the inter-clan fighting and religious battles , the somali government is accused of deploying child soldiers , some as young as 12 , with assault rifles to protect its interests in mogadishu .
somali use of child soldiers reveals concerns over us aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia 's use of child soldiers has raised un concern a united nations security council report into somalia 's " persistent violations " in the use of child soldiers has not only heightened the international community 's deep concern at the continuing practice in african wars and the state of near-constant war in somalia but has also turned the spotlight on the involvement of the united states in the fight for control .
washington has been the main source of western aid for the transitional government since it came to power three years ago and has pumped millions of dollars into the somali military for weapons and soldiers ' salaries .
last year alone , the us government provided somalia with some 40 tonnes of arms and ammunition .
somalia is also expected to benefit from the obama administration 's 2011 budget request for security assistance programmes in africa which includes $ 38 million -lrb- 30.9 million euros -rrb- for arms sales to african states , $ 21 million for training african officers and $ 24 million for anti-terrorism programmes .
there is some concern that by supporting the somali government , washington has violated a number of international human rights laws and laws against the use of child soldiers .
while it has yet to be proved that the us has actually contravened these laws , they have been complying with other un restrictions , albeit with a certain amount of creativity of interpretation , which allow arms sales to somalia .

us involvement in somalia has a long history going back to august 1992 when its troops were deployed as part of operation restore hope to prevent mass starvation in somalia .
however , once the initial crisis seemed to be over , the un took control of relief operations leaving a small us logistical , aviation , and quick reaction force behind .
soon the us forces became involved in somalia 's inter-clan power struggles which eventually led to american soldiers being killed or wounded in fierce fighting in the streets of mogadishu .
one of the most psychologically damaging events of the ill-fated campaign took place in early october 1993 when news reports showed dead us soldiers being dragged through the streets by cheering somali mobs .
all un and us personnel were finally withdrawn almost a year later in march 1995 .
as far as the american people were concerned , that was the end of us involvement in somalia .
" the us got a bloody nose in the restore hope debacle , " david hartwell said .
" it was initially very wary of getting involved in somalia again .
but then 9/11 happened and the us started to see somalia through the prism of al qaeda and islamic extremism .
the insurgents also began to see themselves through this prism so there was a development on both sides where they felt they had to confront each other . "
covert operations signal a us return to somalia last year it was reported that a us special operations raid in somalia had killed the alleged head of al qaeda in east africa .
there were also reports that the us had backed ethiopia with military and logistical aid in its 2006 invasion of somalia aimed at eradicating the islamist threat .

us involvement in somalia has a long history going back to august 1992 when its troops were deployed as part of operation restore hope to prevent mass starvation in somalia .
however , once the initial crisis seemed to be over , the un took control of relief operations leaving a small us logistical , aviation , and quick reaction force behind .
soon the us forces became involved in somalia 's inter-clan power struggles which eventually led to american soldiers being killed or wounded in fierce fighting in the streets of mogadishu .
one of the most psychologically damaging events of the ill-fated campaign took place in early october 1993 when news reports showed dead us soldiers being dragged through the streets by cheering somali mobs .
all un and us personnel were finally withdrawn almost a year later in march 1995 .
as far as the american people were concerned , that was the end of us involvement in somalia .
" the us got a bloody nose in the restore hope debacle , " david hartwell said .
" it was initially very wary of getting involved in somalia again .
but then 9/11 happened and the us started to see somalia through the prism of al qaeda and islamic extremism .

covert operations signal a us return to somalia last year it was reported that a us special operations raid in somalia had killed the alleged head of al qaeda in east africa .
there were also reports that the us had backed ethiopia with military and logistical aid in its 2006 invasion of somalia aimed at eradicating the islamist threat .
a report in the new york times earlier this year revealed that the united states - through its africom command center in nearby djibouti - had begun a new operation in march in support of the transitional government in somalia , the justification being the fight against islamic extremism . " over the past year and a half the us has provided some arms , ammunition , and cash to the transitional somali government , " ej hogendoorn , the director of the horn of africa project at the international crisis group think tank in nairobi , told deutsche welle .

both are alleged to have played a role in terrorist attacks against us targets . " " the us has had a focus on the region for some time in the context of its strategy to stop the spread of islamic extremism , " said david hartwell . " but it knows that the situation in somalia is very fluid .

of course england wants to win the world cup but if we ca n't , we at least want to be beat the germans , says dw 's nick amies . every england fan takes great pleasure in watching and re-watching the 4-2 victory over germany in the final of the 1966 world cup .
this is not only because this is the pinnacle of the national team 's success to date , but also because in winning the world cup , england stopped the germans from lifting the trophy .
it 's a two-for-the-price-of-one bargain that never gets old .
this is where an england fan 's indoctrination begins , with a joyous moment .
our national sporting obsession with germany has its roots in happiness - in the gap-toothed smile and carefree jig of midfielder nobby stiles .
the bitterness does n't begin until you 've been hooked and forced to watch more recent england vintages in the flesh .
then you have to admit that 1966 is as good as it gets .
england did n't even show up for world cup in 1974 or 1978 and our involvement in 1982 is best left unmentioned .
the main recollections of 1986 are of a squat argentinean bloke cheating us out of the tournament .
at least the fat gaucho had a hand -lrb- not literally in this case -rrb- in beating the germans in the final , so he could n't have been all that bad .
penalty pain bildunterschrift : things were equal in 1990 until the shoot-out when england players suddenly forgot how to shoot all of which brings us to italia 90 .
looking back , the only thing i now remember about that tournament is the germans in full group hug mode as england 's broken failures trudged from the pitch , vowing to practice penalties from now on .
that penalty shoot-out defeat to germany in a semi-final was traumatic , mainly because england looked as though they had a team good enough to win the cup for once .
when the european championships came to england in 1996 , the animosity towards germany was still at a pretty low level , despite the tabloids ' lazily digging up the war to try and get an already feverishly patriotic public ready for another semi-final clash against the germans .
italia 90 was an aberration .
we still had 1966 - which was only 30 years of hurt away at that point .
revenge would be ours because , you know , lightning could n't strike twice … could it ?
from today 's vantage point , there was more chance of lightning striking twice than england scoring two penalties .
two spot kicks .
penalty taker against goalkeeper .
it does n't seem that hard , does it ?
and this was a team that knew the heartbreak of losing to the germans on penalties .
surely they would n't let it happen again ?
history tells us that it did .
it also tells us that after beating england , germany went on to win the trophy , as they did in 1990 at the world cup .
one-sided " rivalry " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english tabloids dragged up war rhetoric for the 96 clash two soul-destroying defeats were enough to turn a little rivalry into a massive vendetta for the english .
with the memory of 1966 dimming fast , all that most of us had actually experienced was getting beaten by the germans .
for the germans , however , england 's obsession has never prompted anything other than mild bemusement .
as far as the germans are concerned , england are just another opponent , albeit one with a certain amount of history .
there certainly is n't the rabid reaction in germany to playing each other as there is in the uk .
germany 's grudge match is usually one played against their neighbors to the west in the netherlands .
fans in germany get excited about playing holland in much the same way as englishmen go loopy of the germans .
this fact infuriates the english further .
the rivalry should mean as much to the germans as it means to us - otherwise what 's the point of getting all stewed up about it ?
taking what we can get for england , beating germany is the pinnacle of any campaign .
that 's why a turgid 1-0 win over one of germany 's worst-ever sides in euro 2000 was celebrated like the second coming .
it did n't matter that england were dreadful too - and were n't far behind germany in getting knocked out of the tournament .
we 'd beaten the germans .
it was a hollow victory , but one still held close to english hearts .
meager as it now sounds , a 5-1 demolition in munich in a world cup qualifier a year later was even better .
it felt almost as good as 1966 .
almost .
bildunterschrift : beating even a woeful germany team , as in 2000 , is better than not beating them at all and so we meet again .
it 's 2010 , and already the highlight reels from 44 years ago are being projected onto a new generation 's formative inner eye , mythologizing events from ancient history and lionizing men who are either no longer with us or who now look very old indeed when wheeled out for comment whenever germany and england clash .
the papers , of course , are beside themselves with glee .
it 's only a matter of time before we see distasteful war-related headlines in the red tops and the demonizing of young german players who do n't much care about beating england , only about winning the world cup .
this is what the coming match should be about for us england fans - about progressing and emulating the heroes of 1966 .
instead it 's about getting one over the germans .
that 's what it 's always about for england .
we may beat germany , but even then we 'll probably meet an even stronger argentina side , managed by a certain fat gaucho , who 'll knock us out .
but we wo n't care .
we 'll have beaten the germans .
and that 's all that matters .
nick amies is a life-long england supporter , and germany detractor .

of course england wants to win the world cup but if we ca n't , we at least want to be beat the germans , says dw 's nick amies . every england fan takes great pleasure in watching and re-watching the 4-2 victory over germany in the final of the 1966 world cup .
this is not only because this is the pinnacle of the national team 's success to date , but also because in winning the world cup , england stopped the germans from lifting the trophy .
it 's a two-for-the-price-of-one bargain that never gets old .
this is where an england fan 's indoctrination begins , with a joyous moment .
our national sporting obsession with germany has its roots in happiness - in the gap-toothed smile and carefree jig of midfielder nobby stiles .
the bitterness does n't begin until you 've been hooked and forced to watch more recent england vintages in the flesh .
then you have to admit that 1966 is as good as it gets .
england did n't even show up for world cup in 1974 or 1978 and our involvement in 1982 is best left unmentioned .
the main recollections of 1986 are of a squat argentinean bloke cheating us out of the tournament .
at least the fat gaucho had a hand -lrb- not literally in this case -rrb- in beating the germans in the final , so he could n't have been all that bad .
penalty pain bildunterschrift : things were equal in 1990 until the shoot-out when england players suddenly forgot how to shoot all of which brings us to italia 90 .
looking back , the only thing i now remember about that tournament is the germans in full group hug mode as england 's broken failures trudged from the pitch , vowing to practice penalties from now on .
that penalty shoot-out defeat to germany in a semi-final was traumatic , mainly because england looked as though they had a team good enough to win the cup for once .
when the european championships came to england in 1996 , the animosity towards germany was still at a pretty low level , despite the tabloids ' lazily digging up the war to try and get an already feverishly patriotic public ready for another semi-final clash against the germans .
italia 90 was an aberration .
we still had 1966 - which was only 30 years of hurt away at that point .
revenge would be ours because , you know , lightning could n't strike twice … could it ?
from today 's vantage point , there was more chance of lightning striking twice than england scoring two penalties .
two spot kicks .
penalty taker against goalkeeper .
it does n't seem that hard , does it ?
and this was a team that knew the heartbreak of losing to the germans on penalties .
surely they would n't let it happen again ?
history tells us that it did .
it also tells us that after beating england , germany went on to win the trophy , as they did in 1990 at the world cup .
one-sided " rivalry " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english tabloids dragged up war rhetoric for the 96 clash two soul-destroying defeats were enough to turn a little rivalry into a massive vendetta for the english .
with the memory of 1966 dimming fast , all that most of us had actually experienced was getting beaten by the germans .
for the germans , however , england 's obsession has never prompted anything other than mild bemusement .
as far as the germans are concerned , england are just another opponent , albeit one with a certain amount of history .
there certainly is n't the rabid reaction in germany to playing each other as there is in the uk .
germany 's grudge match is usually one played against their neighbors to the west in the netherlands .
fans in germany get excited about playing holland in much the same way as englishmen go loopy of the germans .
this fact infuriates the english further .
the rivalry should mean as much to the germans as it means to us - otherwise what 's the point of getting all stewed up about it ?
taking what we can get for england , beating germany is the pinnacle of any campaign .
that 's why a turgid 1-0 win over one of germany 's worst-ever sides in euro 2000 was celebrated like the second coming .
it did n't matter that england were dreadful too - and were n't far behind germany in getting knocked out of the tournament .
we 'd beaten the germans .
it was a hollow victory , but one still held close to english hearts .
meager as it now sounds , a 5-1 demolition in munich in a world cup qualifier a year later was even better .
it felt almost as good as 1966 .
almost .
bildunterschrift : beating even a woeful germany team , as in 2000 , is better than not beating them at all and so we meet again .
it 's 2010 , and already the highlight reels from 44 years ago are being projected onto a new generation 's formative inner eye , mythologizing events from ancient history and lionizing men who are either no longer with us or who now look very old indeed when wheeled out for comment whenever germany and england clash .
the papers , of course , are beside themselves with glee .
it 's only a matter of time before we see distasteful war-related headlines in the red tops and the demonizing of young german players who do n't much care about beating england , only about winning the world cup .
this is what the coming match should be about for us england fans - about progressing and emulating the heroes of 1966 .
instead it 's about getting one over the germans .
that 's what it 's always about for england .
we may beat germany , but even then we 'll probably meet an even stronger argentina side , managed by a certain fat gaucho , who 'll knock us out .
but we wo n't care .
we 'll have beaten the germans .
and that 's all that matters .
nick amies is a life-long england supporter , and germany detractor .

our national sporting obsession with germany has its roots in happiness - in the gap-toothed smile and carefree jig of midfielder nobby stiles .
the bitterness does n't begin until you 've been hooked and forced to watch more recent england vintages in the flesh .
then you have to admit that 1966 is as good as it gets .
england did n't even show up for world cup in 1974 or 1978 and our involvement in 1982 is best left unmentioned .
the main recollections of 1986 are of a squat argentinean bloke cheating us out of the tournament .
at least the fat gaucho had a hand -lrb- not literally in this case -rrb- in beating the germans in the final , so he could n't have been all that bad .
penalty pain bildunterschrift : things were equal in 1990 until the shoot-out when england players suddenly forgot how to shoot all of which brings us to italia 90 .
looking back , the only thing i now remember about that tournament is the germans in full group hug mode as england 's broken failures trudged from the pitch , vowing to practice penalties from now on .
that penalty shoot-out defeat to germany in a semi-final was traumatic , mainly because england looked as though they had a team good enough to win the cup for once .
when the european championships came to england in 1996 , the animosity towards germany was still at a pretty low level , despite the tabloids ' lazily digging up the war to try and get an already feverishly patriotic public ready for another semi-final clash against the germans .
italia 90 was an aberration .
we still had 1966 - which was only 30 years of hurt away at that point .
revenge would be ours because , you know , lightning could n't strike twice … could it ?
from today 's vantage point , there was more chance of lightning striking twice than england scoring two penalties .
two spot kicks .
penalty taker against goalkeeper .
it does n't seem that hard , does it ?
and this was a team that knew the heartbreak of losing to the germans on penalties .
surely they would n't let it happen again ?
history tells us that it did .
it also tells us that after beating england , germany went on to win the trophy , as they did in 1990 at the world cup .
one-sided " rivalry " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english tabloids dragged up war rhetoric for the 96 clash two soul-destroying defeats were enough to turn a little rivalry into a massive vendetta for the english .
with the memory of 1966 dimming fast , all that most of us had actually experienced was getting beaten by the germans .
for the germans , however , england 's obsession has never prompted anything other than mild bemusement .
as far as the germans are concerned , england are just another opponent , albeit one with a certain amount of history .
there certainly is n't the rabid reaction in germany to playing each other as there is in the uk .
germany 's grudge match is usually one played against their neighbors to the west in the netherlands .
fans in germany get excited about playing holland in much the same way as englishmen go loopy of the germans .
this fact infuriates the english further .
the rivalry should mean as much to the germans as it means to us - otherwise what 's the point of getting all stewed up about it ?
taking what we can get for england , beating germany is the pinnacle of any campaign .
that 's why a turgid 1-0 win over one of germany 's worst-ever sides in euro 2000 was celebrated like the second coming .
it did n't matter that england were dreadful too - and were n't far behind germany in getting knocked out of the tournament .
we 'd beaten the germans .
it was a hollow victory , but one still held close to english hearts .
meager as it now sounds , a 5-1 demolition in munich in a world cup qualifier a year later was even better .
it felt almost as good as 1966 .
almost .
bildunterschrift : beating even a woeful germany team , as in 2000 , is better than not beating them at all and so we meet again .
it 's 2010 , and already the highlight reels from 44 years ago are being projected onto a new generation 's formative inner eye , mythologizing events from ancient history and lionizing men who are either no longer with us or who now look very old indeed when wheeled out for comment whenever germany and england clash .
the papers , of course , are beside themselves with glee .
it 's only a matter of time before we see distasteful war-related headlines in the red tops and the demonizing of young german players who do n't much care about beating england , only about winning the world cup .
this is what the coming match should be about for us england fans - about progressing and emulating the heroes of 1966 .
instead it 's about getting one over the germans .
that 's what it 's always about for england .
we may beat germany , but even then we 'll probably meet an even stronger argentina side , managed by a certain fat gaucho , who 'll knock us out .
but we wo n't care .
we 'll have beaten the germans .
and that 's all that matters .

the capital of somalia is a microcosm of the countless conflicts that have been plaguing the failed east african state for decades , leading to hundreds of thousands of somalis starving to death and countless others being killed .
the western-backed transitional government has been teetering on the edge of collapse for years under the weight of continued attacks by the al qaeda-linked al shabab militia and fellow islamist militant group hizbul islam .
the two groups control much of central and southern somalia , leaving only a few small parts of the capital under government rule , protected by the somali military , its ahlu sunna waljama militia and african union peacekeepers .
the islamist insurgent groups battle government troops , pro-government militia and even each other in a never-ending struggle for control of a country which has n't had an effective government since 1991 .
even in government-controlled areas , the battles rage .
troops loyal to somalia 's government fight within their ranks for scraps of power on the capital 's scarred streets .
they have even engaged in gun fights with their own police forces as corruption and organized crime eats away at the fragile state security systems in place , playing into the hands of the radical islamist insurgents who aim to take control of the whole country .
meanwhile , to compound the problems , pirates continue to operate off the somali coast .
in the midst of all the chaos , the inter-clan fighting and religious battles , the somali government is accused of deploying child soldiers , some as young as 12 , with assault rifles to protect its interests in mogadishu .
somali use of child soldiers reveals concerns over us aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalia 's use of child soldiers has raised un concern a united nations security council report into somalia 's " persistent violations " in the use of child soldiers has not only heightened the international community 's deep concern at the continuing practice in african wars and the state of near-constant war in somalia but has also turned the spotlight on the involvement of the united states in the fight for control .
washington has been the main source of western aid for the transitional government since it came to power three years ago and has pumped millions of dollars into the somali military for weapons and soldiers ' salaries .
last year alone , the us government provided somalia with some 40 tonnes of arms and ammunition .
somalia is also expected to benefit from the obama administration 's 2011 budget request for security assistance programmes in africa which includes $ 38 million -lrb- 30.9 million euros -rrb- for arms sales to african states , $ 21 million for training african officers and $ 24 million for anti-terrorism programmes .
there is some concern that by supporting the somali government , washington has violated a number of international human rights laws and laws against the use of child soldiers .
while it has yet to be proved that the us has actually contravened these laws , they have been complying with other un restrictions , albeit with a certain amount of creativity of interpretation , which allow arms sales to somalia .
" the arms embargo which was put in place in 1992 was amended by the un in 2006 to allow arms to be sold to the transitional government , " david hartwell , an expert at jane 's defense , told deutsche welle .
" the international community has no other choice but to support the somali government and the americans have exploited this to sell arms via the ethiopians and the ugandan peacekeepers , who have bought weapons on behalf of the us and billed washington . "
hartwell says that the americans are n't the only ones providing weapons .
" on the other side we have eritrea which is arming the militants , " he added .
" the eritreans have been complaining about double standards because they are seen as breaking the embargo because they 're not supplying the somali government and yet the us and ethiopia , which is fighting a proxy war against eritrea in somalia , are flooding the country with weapons . "

of course england wants to win the world cup but if we ca n't , we at least want to be beat the germans , says dw 's nick amies . every england fan takes great pleasure in watching and re-watching the 4-2 victory over germany in the final of the 1966 world cup .
this is not only because this is the pinnacle of the national team 's success to date , but also because in winning the world cup , england stopped the germans from lifting the trophy .
it 's a two-for-the-price-of-one bargain that never gets old .
this is where an england fan 's indoctrination begins , with a joyous moment .
our national sporting obsession with germany has its roots in happiness - in the gap-toothed smile and carefree jig of midfielder nobby stiles .
the bitterness does n't begin until you 've been hooked and forced to watch more recent england vintages in the flesh .
then you have to admit that 1966 is as good as it gets .
england did n't even show up for world cup in 1974 or 1978 and our involvement in 1982 is best left unmentioned .
the main recollections of 1986 are of a squat argentinean bloke cheating us out of the tournament .
at least the fat gaucho had a hand -lrb- not literally in this case -rrb- in beating the germans in the final , so he could n't have been all that bad .
penalty pain bildunterschrift : things were equal in 1990 until the shoot-out when england players suddenly forgot how to shoot all of which brings us to italia 90 .
looking back , the only thing i now remember about that tournament is the germans in full group hug mode as england 's broken failures trudged from the pitch , vowing to practice penalties from now on .
that penalty shoot-out defeat to germany in a semi-final was traumatic , mainly because england looked as though they had a team good enough to win the cup for once .
when the european championships came to england in 1996 , the animosity towards germany was still at a pretty low level , despite the tabloids ' lazily digging up the war to try and get an already feverishly patriotic public ready for another semi-final clash against the germans .
italia 90 was an aberration .
we still had 1966 - which was only 30 years of hurt away at that point .
revenge would be ours because , you know , lightning could n't strike twice … could it ?
from today 's vantage point , there was more chance of lightning striking twice than england scoring two penalties .
two spot kicks .
penalty taker against goalkeeper .
it does n't seem that hard , does it ?
and this was a team that knew the heartbreak of losing to the germans on penalties .
surely they would n't let it happen again ?
history tells us that it did .
it also tells us that after beating england , germany went on to win the trophy , as they did in 1990 at the world cup .
one-sided " rivalry " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english tabloids dragged up war rhetoric for the 96 clash two soul-destroying defeats were enough to turn a little rivalry into a massive vendetta for the english .
with the memory of 1966 dimming fast , all that most of us had actually experienced was getting beaten by the germans .
for the germans , however , england 's obsession has never prompted anything other than mild bemusement .
as far as the germans are concerned , england are just another opponent , albeit one with a certain amount of history .
there certainly is n't the rabid reaction in germany to playing each other as there is in the uk .
germany 's grudge match is usually one played against their neighbors to the west in the netherlands .
fans in germany get excited about playing holland in much the same way as englishmen go loopy of the germans .
this fact infuriates the english further .
the rivalry should mean as much to the germans as it means to us - otherwise what 's the point of getting all stewed up about it ?
taking what we can get for england , beating germany is the pinnacle of any campaign .
that 's why a turgid 1-0 win over one of germany 's worst-ever sides in euro 2000 was celebrated like the second coming .
it did n't matter that england were dreadful too - and were n't far behind germany in getting knocked out of the tournament .
we 'd beaten the germans .
it was a hollow victory , but one still held close to english hearts .
meager as it now sounds , a 5-1 demolition in munich in a world cup qualifier a year later was even better .
it felt almost as good as 1966 .
almost .
bildunterschrift : beating even a woeful germany team , as in 2000 , is better than not beating them at all and so we meet again .
it 's 2010 , and already the highlight reels from 44 years ago are being projected onto a new generation 's formative inner eye , mythologizing events from ancient history and lionizing men who are either no longer with us or who now look very old indeed when wheeled out for comment whenever germany and england clash .
the papers , of course , are beside themselves with glee .
it 's only a matter of time before we see distasteful war-related headlines in the red tops and the demonizing of young german players who do n't much care about beating england , only about winning the world cup .
this is what the coming match should be about for us england fans - about progressing and emulating the heroes of 1966 .
instead it 's about getting one over the germans .
that 's what it 's always about for england .
we may beat germany , but even then we 'll probably meet an even stronger argentina side , managed by a certain fat gaucho , who 'll knock us out .
but we wo n't care .
we 'll have beaten the germans .

as the tough commander of the us war effort in afghanistan is removed from his post , the bbc 's lyse doucet remembers a previous meeting with the popular general , stanley mcchrystal , when considering how he slipped up .
the general was fired over an article in rolling stone magazine general mcchrystal looked down at his boots .
he was strangely quiet , distant , as we sat facing each other on straight-backed chairs , waiting to start our interview .
i wondered what weighed so heavily on his mind .
he was usually so quick to smile and talk .
i knew he had just come from the presidential palace .
questions raced through my mind .
had something gone wrong again with president karzai ?
or on the battlefield ?
to break the silence , i simply said : " tough job . "
" yes , " he replied , " i just heard my college room-mate died .
he 's been ill . "
" oh , i 'm sorry , " i said .
" would you like more time ? "
" no , " the general insisted , visibly tightening his jaw and sitting up straight .
" this is my job . "
and the general focused .
that was gen mcchrystal in the field , in his element , in command .
secretive force when i first met him in kabul a year ago , just after he took up his post , i asked how he would cope with the pressure of being the face of what was being called " obama 's war " .
he smiled with palpable confidence .
" i 've brought a lot of good people with me . "
this was team mcchrystal , a tight-knit team of fiercely loyal advisors and aides .
there was much myth-making around the gaunt commander some had worked with him in iraq , some belonged to his band of brothers - as soldiers say - from the elite west point military academy .
they had graduated in 1976 , in the shadow of the vietnam war , amid deep anti-war sentiment .
it took real courage and commitment to want to be a soldier then , one of his aides once told me .
that is the kind of reputation the general brought to afghanistan .
a soldier 's soldier .
no-one talked much about what had really gone on when he headed what is called the most secretive force in the us military , the special operations unit hunting al-qaeda militants in iraq .
there was much myth-making around the gaunt commander who slept four hours a night , ate one meal a day , and removed cushions from office chairs so visitors would not stay too long .
similar approaches the same kind of tales had emerged about the man who now replaces him , the general who was the face of america 's last big war , in iraq .
gen david petraeus is is one of america 's best-known military figures gen david petraeus was also said to sleep little , run a lot , work all the time .
i once joked with gen petraeus that he had to spend more time in afghanistan because he was being outdone in the image stakes by the other hard-charging general .
he laughed : " i know about stan 's one meal a day , " he said .
" he eats one meal a day , all day long . "
the two men worked closely together .
both said afghanistan would be more difficult than iraq .
both were poster boys for a new way of fighting wars .
it is called counter-insurgency , or coin .
but gen mcchrystal put his personal stamp all over it , emphasising the need to avoid civilian casualties , to protect the population .
it earned him rare praise and trust from a most reluctant commander-in-chief , president hamid karzai .
i saw how that relationship worked when i travelled with them to the southern city of kandahar in april , at the very moment when relations between president karzai and washington were in deep crisis over the president 's extraordinary outburst , accusing the americans of perpetrating election fraud in afghanistan .
there seemed to be two sides to this general would the trip have to be cancelled ?
no .
the president , the general , and their aides huddled together in a special pod in the military plane that took us south .
and then they strode into a meeting to face hundreds of tough-minded , plain-speaking tribal elders .
the president told the tribesmen of his respect for a general who took responsibility when afghan civilians were wrongly killed in battles against the taliban .
he stabbed the air with his finger , and said : " when he admits his mistakes , we should forgive him . "
there was a murmur from the floor at this public endorsement of the american general even though many of the elders had deep misgivings about his strategy .
careful touch back in washington , gen mcchrystal was praised as the man who knew how to deal with a difficult ally , unlike almost everyone else on obama 's afghan team .
gen mcchrystal was adamant that us strategy was still working so what happened to the general 's careful touch when it came to dealing with his own president 's team ?
there seemed to be two sides to this general - a careful commander in the field and a coarser one that emerged in the magazine article that brought him down .
on that day in early june when we sat together on straight-backed chairs in kabul he did not rise to the ringing phrases he had used only weeks before .
he rejected , again and again , reports from the south that his much-vaunted strategy was running into trouble , saying wars never go as planned .
on - and off - the record , he insisted : " i still believe we can win . "
i walked with him to the door of his office .
when we parted , i said : " i 'm sorry about your college friend . "
no , its ok , he replied brusquely , i should not have said it .
weeks later , that is what he is saying over and over again .

bbc news - eating leaves and lizards to survive in niger british broadcasting corporation home accessibility links mobile version skip to content skip to local navigation skip to bbc.co.uk navigation skip to bbc.co.uk search help accessibility help bbc radio 4 from our own correspondent bbc news from our own correspondent archive about the programme faqs latest world news africa americas asia pacific europe middle east south asia related bbc sites radio 4 bbc news crossing continents hardtalk this world page last updated at 11:38 gmt , saturday , 26 june 2010 12:38 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version eating leaves and lizards to survive in niger by chris stewart niger aid organisations are warning that millions of people are facing starvation from drought and crop failure in the west african country of niger , and some people are turning to desperate measures to survive .
famine hit niger in 1984 and 2005 if you look up " bo " on the internet , nothing that makes sense comes up .
but we were looking at a bo , or rather looking for it .
we were walking along the bank of the niger river , searching for the tracks of a hippopotamus that was ravaging the corn on karim 's farm .
all of a sudden , a lizard about the size of a small crocodile hurtled out of the undergrowth and raced up a nearby baobab tree .
" it 's a bo , " everybody cried , racing to the foot of the enormous tree .
now i had never seen a bo before , so i was interested out of pure curiosity .
the handful of villagers with us had other ideas , though .
" the bo is delicious , " explained karim .
" it has the taste and texture of fish , and the inside of it is all white .
" you do n't see them very often .
there are not that many about . "
moustafa , karim 's head man , was talking excitedly into his mobile phone .
" he 's calling the kids from the village , " explained our host .
" he wants them to climb the tree and get the poor creature down . "
it was hardly surprising , i thought , that the bo was scarce .
it is rotten luck to be a delicious animal in a land where people are hungry .
tortured beauty for people are hungry in niger .
the rains failed last year and the staple diet of millet is running out .
cattle are finding it hard to survive there was famine in 1984 , and again in 2005 .
now it is about to happen once more .
we travelled north to tillaberi , a rolling landscape of sand , wind-blown dust , and sparsely scattered bushes and trees , seemingly in the very last stages of desiccation .
here and there were thin cows , beautiful cows with tall horns , but with their hides hanging from fleshless frames .
the goats , too , the lovely black and white african goat , that looks as if it were jet black but had the front part of the body dyed white , have long ago given up hope of finding even the least scrap of sustenance from the parched earth .
as we travelled on , the country became even more barren , with here and there a dead cow , others on their last legs , moving like wraiths among the leafless trees .
this is not to say that the place was devoid of beauty .
it possessed a tortured and hellish majesty .
at length we emerged from the nothingness we had passed through to a strange and unexpected scene : the wells of timbouloulag .
dotted amongst the sparse trees were a dozen low mounds .
on the top of each was a hole , the edges of which were defined with twisted logs , set flush into the ground , like wooden lips .
standing forlornly among the trees were scores of animals , patiently waiting to drink .
hope among despair in the shade of a particularly leafy tree sat a group of women , each enveloped in robes of beautifully printed cotton .
standing nearby , at one of the wells , was a corresponding group of men .
akili mayaki hopes for a brighter future " salaam alaikum . "
they smiled in welcome as we shook their hands .
they were a dozen or so , and they looked truly magnificent , tall and graceful with skin of flawless black , and swathed in robes of blue , black and white .
a proud-looking man stepped forward as spokesman .
he was akili mayaki , about 50 years old , and wearing a blue-and-white-striped djellaba and an immaculate white turban .
his people were destitute .
many of their cattle , their sole source of support , were now too weak to stand .
there was hope that this year the rains would not fail , and that somehow they would come through .
hope there was too for the future , with improving education perhaps it would never get this bad again .
finally , i asked him what i really wanted to know : how did he feel about this land he lived upon ?
would he ever leave and go to the city in search of a less precarious existence ?
akili looked at me weighing his words , then he said : " when the rains come , and all these trees burst into leaf and flower , and the earth is deep in lush grass , then i tell you there is no more beautiful place on this earth .
" i would not leave here , not even to go to paris . "
tatola leaves are soaked and cooked for three hours before eating next , i turned to talk with the women .
who reclined , each with her baby , in the dappled shade .
they had a tin bowl full of what looked like dried bay leaves .
" these are the leaves of the tatola tree , " said the young spokeswoman .
" we boil them and pound them and add a little salt , then we put them with the millet husks , which are all we have left now .
" the husks do not satisfy our hunger , but if we add some boiled leaves , it helps . "
much later , far away back home in spain i got an e-mail from karim .
the village kids were still camped beneath the baobab , waiting for the poor bo to come down .
