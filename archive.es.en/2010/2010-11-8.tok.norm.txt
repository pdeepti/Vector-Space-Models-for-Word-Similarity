program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 08.11.2010 greek striker gekas revives his career at improving frankfurt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gekas made the difference against wolfsburg theofanis gekas is anything but a complete player , but he knows how to do a striker 's main job - score goals .
and this year the crafty greek is reminding opponents just how uncannily efficient he can be . after eleven rounds of play , no one had more goals - 11 in total - than a 30-year-old many bundesliga fans would probably classify as a journeyman .
but ask the man himself and he 'll tell you that goal-getting is an innate ability that 's anything but the norm .
" i started playing football really young , and i was always a striker , " gekas said in interview with the german football league .
" i was born with my scoring ability .
it seems like a gift from god . "
his teammates had another potentially supernatural explanation after gekas scored a brace on saturday .
“ we asked ourselves in the dressing room if he 's sold his soul , ” defender marco russ told the bild newspaper .
“ even his badly taken penalty went in . ”
gekas came to the bundesliga in 2005 on a one-year loan from panathinaikos athens to bochum and promptly won the league scoring title .
his then coach described him as " our life-insurance policy . "
but bochum decided they could not afford the premiums and failed to exercise their right to purchase the greek goal-getter .
it was a bad decision .
bochum became a perennial relegation candidate and now play in the second division .
for his part , gekas moved on to leverkusen , where he never established himself .
although he scored a respectable 11 goals in his first season with his new club , he was often criticized as lacking in work ethic and was loaned out to hertha berlin at the beginning of 2010 .
with hertha also getting relegated , gekas formally returned to leverkusen , before promptly moving on to frankfurt .
his was hardly one of the high-profile signings of the off-season , but now he 's getting a chance to prove that his detractors , if not completely wrong , missed the point .
ice-cold killer bildunterschrift : in addition to his 11 league goals , gekas has scored 2 in the german cup gekas is neither a particularly great dribbler or passer , and he 's never been known to track back and help out on defense .
but he is one of the most prolific poachers the league has seen in recent years .
that 's just the way he described the role of a striker in a recent interview .
" the most important thing is that -lsb- a striker -rsb- has good teammates who are always looking to get him the ball , " gekas told the online portal of the eurosport television network .
" in addition , he needs the talent to get himself in the right position to score goals . "
on teams that fail to utilize his nose for goal , gekas is most conspicuous for the amount of times he 's caught offside .
but on teams that figure out how to employ his particular talent , he can be lethal .
indeed , a tarantino-esque tattoo on gekas ' arm reads " eiskalter vollstrecker , " -lrb- ice-cold killer -rrb- - the nickname he earned at bochum .
understatement , as you 've probably guessed by now , is n't gekas ' strong suit .
" the fact that i did n't score -lsb- for leverkusen and hertha -rsb- was because the people in positions of responsibility did n't trust me , " gekas told the bundesliga .
" but frankfurt coach michael skibbe , whom i know from my time in leverkusen , does have that trust .
that has a direct effect on my game and the number of goals i score . "
instinct and vision bildunterschrift : gekas has been doing all his talking on pitch this season seen negatively , gekas is one-dimensional .
seen positively , he does exactly what he 's supposed to do , hang around in dangerous positions and convert chances as they materialize .
wolfsburg were given a display of the latter qualities , as their trip to frankfurt on saturday ended in a 3-1 defeat .
the hosts ' first goal in that match was archetypal gekas .
the greek striker lurked on the edge of the penalty area , and when a low pass came his way , he took it directly and curled it into the bottom left-hand corner .
the goal was only possible because gekas did n't hesitate or try to control the ball , but rather reacted on instinct .
that 's a quality his coach appreciates .
" there are n't many strikers who can see a situation in advance as well as gekas , " michael skibbe told the bild newspaper earlier this season .
" in the build-up , he follows pass combinations very intensely and then instinctively runs where he expects the ball to be . "
gekas goals may often appear to be lucky , but the numbers argue for his basic quality .
in addition to his achievements in the bundesliga , the striker has scored 20 goals in 51 matches for the greek national team .
gekas officially retired from the greece squad in september , citing " special circumstances . "
few people , if indeed anyone other than the striker himself , knew what he was referring to .
that 's not uncommon with gekas , who , despite playing for years in the bundesliga , says he sees no need to learn german .
and this season , he 's drastically scaled back the number of interviews he 's prepared to give .
but if gekas can keep up anything near his early pace of a goal per game , no one is likely to care about his disinterest in communication .
as he himself might say , a striker 's job is not to make himself understood .
putting the ball in the net speaks louder than words .

as one man remains in a coma after a weekend beating , two more journalists have reported being attacked . as two more journalist beatings were reported in russia on monday , president dmitry medvedev said those behind a near-fatal attack over the weekend would be found and punished .
reacting to intense media scrutiny over the handling of previous journalist beatings , medvedev said the culprits responsible for the saturday beating of kommersant business daily reporter oleg kashin would be held accountable , regardless of their potential rank or title .
" whoever is involved in this crime will be punished , regardless of his position , place in society or accomplishments , " medvedev said in comments broadcast on state television throughout the evening .
" i have seen it written in the press that -lsb- the people behind the crime -rsb- will not be found .
they will be found .
there is no doubt . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kashin remains in a coma after his near-death beating the russian prosecutor general called monday for any witnesses of the beating to come forward .
he said investigators had as of yet received no leads in the case .
in the line of fire medvedev added that assaults on reporters must be treated with extra care by society and not be grouped with other crimes .
" reporters are people who find themselves in an area of heightened risk , " he said .
the president 's comments come as purported video footage of the weekend beating hit russian websites and state tv news .
the recording showed two assailants attack a man as he approached a gate to a residential building at night .
one person held him by the upper body while the other beat him with what appeared to be a metal shaft .
kashin remains in a coma , his legs , skull and fingers smashed in one of a long line of attacks on russia reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya was murdered in 2006 international condemnation the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , called the attack " brutal " and " obviously unacceptable . "
the media freedom representative of the organization for security and cooperation in europe , dunja mijatovic , said the assault " confirms a worrying trend of continuous violence against journalists " in russia .
there have been 19 unsolved murders of journalists in russia since 2000 , including the 2006 killing of kremlin critic anna politkovskaya .
meanwhile , two more journalist beatings were reported monday .
one was a reporter with the zhukovskiye vesti suburban moscow weekly , and the other the editor of the volga region 's saratovsky reporter .
zhukovskiye reporter anatoly adamchuk says he was struck twice in the head and was recuperating at home .
he said the only item stolen during the incident was his computer memory card .

up to 17,000 policemen , at a cost of up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- , were used over the weekend to keep an estimated 35,000 people from blocking the path of the train , and more demonstrators – along with local farmers - are continuing to arrive to block the path of the road convoy as it continues its journey .
there were varying reports of whether violence had occurred .
the police said that officers had been directly attacked , while protest organizers countered that demonstrators had only sabotaged the tracks .
rainer wendt , head of the police union , said , the officers " proceeded very sensitively , " and " made the right decision – namely to carry the people from the tracks . "
he added that where violence was used against police officers , they reacted " accordingly " and " proportionately . "
dirk seifert , spokesman for the environmental protest group robin wood , told a different story .
" you have to say that the police were disproportionate in their use of tear-gas and pepper spray , " he told deutsche welle .
" the police also hit people who were already lying on the ground , both with their fists as well as truncheons . "
there was also the issue of what happened to those peaceful protesters once they were removed from the tracks .
seifert complained of demonstrators being kept for hours on end in an open field in the cold of the night .
" that is usually called false imprisonment , he said , " the law says people have to be brought to a custodial judge as soon as possible .
that did not happen . "
bildunterschrift : the protests continued throughout the weekend and into monday issues converging what has made this particular demonstration so explosive is the coincidence of this transport of nuclear waste with the government 's decision to overturn former legislation aimed at phasing out nuclear power by around 2020 .
chancellor angela merkel 's conservative coalition of christian democrats and the pro-business free democrats , recently passed a bill through parliament allowing nuclear power stations to remain open another 12 years .
environment minister norbert roettgen has been at pains to separate the issues of lifespan-extension and dealing with nuclear waste .
" we have been using nuclear power for over 40 years , " he said .
" we have created electricity from it and created waste , and we have a responsibility to deal with that – independent of the question of lifespan extension . "
yet seifert is unimpressed with this distinction .
" the fact is that this government has decided to produce even more nuclear waste by extending the life spans of the existing nuclear power stations . "
but some demonstrators arrived at the railway tracks with self-evidently different agendas .
stuttgart 21 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgarters angry about a new railway station have joined the anti-nuclear protests several protestors against the new railway station known as stuttgart 21 were also present , and were celebrated at the podium .
this suggests that the anti-nuclear movement has become a rallying point for many people who feel the current government 's policies are leaving them disenfranchised .
" there is a growing feeling that policies are being made for minorities or a certain clientele , like large corporations , and that this government does not see it as necessary to work for the good of the whole population , " said seifert .
" a lot of people in stuttgart have the feeling that their opinion is not respected – the government is just doing what it wants over the heads of the population . "
opinion polls show that opposition political parties , particularly the greens , are benefitting from this groundswell .
indeed , prominent green party figure claudia roth took part in the weekend 's demonstrations , though politicians were not permitted to speak at the podium .
" we are certainly interested in working together with members of those parties , but the parties have the parliament , and we have the streets , " said seifert .
" we are a social movement and we have to separate the two places of expression . "

up to 17,000 policemen , at a cost of up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- , were used over the weekend to keep an estimated 35,000 people from blocking the path of the train , and more demonstrators – along with local farmers - are continuing to arrive to block the path of the road convoy as it continues its journey .
there were varying reports of whether violence had occurred .
the police said that officers had been directly attacked , while protest organizers countered that demonstrators had only sabotaged the tracks .
rainer wendt , head of the police union , said , the officers " proceeded very sensitively , " and " made the right decision – namely to carry the people from the tracks . "
he added that where violence was used against police officers , they reacted " accordingly " and " proportionately . "
dirk seifert , spokesman for the environmental protest group robin wood , told a different story .
" you have to say that the police were disproportionate in their use of tear-gas and pepper spray , " he told deutsche welle .
" the police also hit people who were already lying on the ground , both with their fists as well as truncheons . "
there was also the issue of what happened to those peaceful protesters once they were removed from the tracks .
seifert complained of demonstrators being kept for hours on end in an open field in the cold of the night .
" that is usually called false imprisonment , he said , " the law says people have to be brought to a custodial judge as soon as possible .
that did not happen . "
bildunterschrift : the protests continued throughout the weekend and into monday issues converging what has made this particular demonstration so explosive is the coincidence of this transport of nuclear waste with the government 's decision to overturn former legislation aimed at phasing out nuclear power by around 2020 .
chancellor angela merkel 's conservative coalition of christian democrats and the pro-business free democrats , recently passed a bill through parliament allowing nuclear power stations to remain open another 12 years .
environment minister norbert roettgen has been at pains to separate the issues of lifespan-extension and dealing with nuclear waste .
" we have been using nuclear power for over 40 years , " he said .
" we have created electricity from it and created waste , and we have a responsibility to deal with that – independent of the question of lifespan extension . "
yet seifert is unimpressed with this distinction .
" the fact is that this government has decided to produce even more nuclear waste by extending the life spans of the existing nuclear power stations . "
but some demonstrators arrived at the railway tracks with self-evidently different agendas .
stuttgart 21 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgarters angry about a new railway station have joined the anti-nuclear protests several protestors against the new railway station known as stuttgart 21 were also present , and were celebrated at the podium .
this suggests that the anti-nuclear movement has become a rallying point for many people who feel the current government 's policies are leaving them disenfranchised .
" there is a growing feeling that policies are being made for minorities or a certain clientele , like large corporations , and that this government does not see it as necessary to work for the good of the whole population , " said seifert .
" a lot of people in stuttgart have the feeling that their opinion is not respected – the government is just doing what it wants over the heads of the population . "
opinion polls show that opposition political parties , particularly the greens , are benefitting from this groundswell .
indeed , prominent green party figure claudia roth took part in the weekend 's demonstrations , though politicians were not permitted to speak at the podium .
" we are certainly interested in working together with members of those parties , but the parties have the parliament , and we have the streets , " said seifert .
" we are a social movement and we have to separate the two places of expression . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 08.11.2010 western democracies dismiss myanmar poll as corrupt and unfair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers noted misdeeds such as coercion and vote-buying in the election western democracies broadly dismissed sunday 's election in myanmar , saying it was neither free nor fair , and violence erupted on the thai border as ballots were counted . numerous western countries dismissed myanmar 's first multiparty election in 20 years , saying it was neither free nor fair .
they also repeated calls to free imprisoned opposition leader aung san suu kyi .
however , myanmar 's ally china refused to join the chorus of international disapproval .
the state-owned newspaper global times reported the government considered the controversial polls " a step forward . "
an official statement is still awaited .
statement by us , australia the us , eu , uk , australia and japan all condemned vote as being neither free nor fair . in a joint statement , the us and australia urged the regime 's leaders to ensure that " post-election institutions be transparent , accountable and responsive to their citizens ' aspirations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers say the election results were rigged us president barack obama , speaking on a visit to india on monday , went so far as to accuse the ruling myanmar military junta of stealing the election .
" it is unacceptable to steal an election , as the regime in burma has done again for all the world to see , " he said in a speech at the indian parliament , in which he referred to myanmar by its former name .
obama critiques those who fail to speak out he cited myanmar as an example of a country where a " bankrupt regime " imprisoned opponents and gunned down protesters .
and he shot a barb at his host country when he accused mumbai of failling to speak out sufficiently on the rights of the repressed .
" faced with such gross violations of human rights , it is the responsibility of the international community , especially leaders like the united states and india , to condemn it . "
obama said .
" if i can be frank , in international fora , india has often shied away from these issues , " he added .
ethnic violence erupts at border in the us , secretary of state hillary clinton said her country would uphold " rigorous sanctions " against myanmar 's regime as long as it abuses human rights and holds political prisoners .
independent burmese observers reported widespread allegations of voter intimidation and bribery in the elections , and most international observers had already written off the vote as a sham designed to further entrench miltiary rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy icon aung san suu kyi was sidelined in the election representatives of the military junta 's political arm , the union solidarity and development party -lrb- usdp -rrb- are alleged to have conducted widespread voter coercion , intimidation and vote-buying .
and concerns have been raised about votes being counted away from public or opposition party scrutiny .
meanwhile , as the ballots were counted on monday , violence erupted between government soldiers and ethnic minority karen rebels in the border town of myawaddy .
some 10,000 refugees fled across the border into thailand to escape the post-election fighting .
scales tipped for the military while myanmar officially ended half a century of direct army rule on sunday , a variety of restrictions accompanying the election made a pro-democracy upset virtually impossible .
for instance , 25 percent of parliamentary seats are reserved for the military .
and the government-crafted constitution and skewed election rules heavily favored the military government 's candidates .
that means that for now , myanmar 's military will uphold its power through affiliated parties .
candidates backed by the regime enjoyed substantial financial support and were also accused of intimidating opposing parties .
" for the people of burma , it will mean the return to power of a brutal regime that has pillaged the nation 's resources and overseen widespread human rights abuses , including arbitrary detentions , enforced disappearances , rape and torture , " britain 's foreign secretary william hague said in response to sunday 's election .
china is supportive of regime meanwhile , china 's global times reported the chinese government supported " myanmar 's plan to transform its political system , but knows it will not happen overnight . "
china has long helped economically-dysfunctional myanmar to keep afloat through trade ties , arms sales , and by shielding it from un sanctions over rights abuses as a veto-wielding member of the un security council .
in the first five months of this year , china has invested about $ 8 billion -lrb- 11 billion euros -rrb- in myanmar , which it sees as a strategic ally and important trading partner , especially for its energy-hungry western provinces .
it will likely be many days before official results are released , since the process of vote counting in myanmar is painstaking and slow .

as counting of votes got underway , a fire fight erupted between a splinter group of armed forces from the democratic karen buddhist army -lrb- dkba -rrb- and the army in the border town of myawaddy leading to hundreds of people being forced to flee into thailand for safety .
reports also say the government has placed the country under a 90-day state of emergency .
army-backed parties set to sweep polls over 3,000 candidates had stood from 37 parties for national parliament and regional assemblies in sunday 's vote .
but harsh election laws had prevented several parties from taking part including opposition leader , aung san suu kyi 's national league for democracy or nld .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a myanmar soldier gestures while talking with police officers as they provide security during the election parties aligned to the ruling military , union solidarity and development party -lrb- usdp -rrb- and national unity party , were set to win a majority of seats .
the armed forces are also guaranteed a quarter of parliamentary seats under a 2008 constitution .
ron hoffman , canadian ambassador to thailand and myanmar , said the international community needs to keep pressure on myanmar ’ s military .
" it 's not a democratic exercise .
it does n't even come close to meeting any standard of international electoral processes . "
aung san suu kyi 's detention expires on saturday soe aung , a spokesman for the forum for democracy in burma , says the parliament will have little power but to act as a rubber stamp for the military leaders .
he says the parliament will be dominated by the regime backed candidates after the elections .
" and the parliamentarians will have no other chance but to become a rubber stamp parliament to endorse the executive council or the national security and defence council , by name .
this would be headed by the president and also the commander in chief .
this council will run the country after all . "
bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi in yangon 2009 analysts are now watching whether the military will release aung san suu kyi from detention , expected next saturday .
if the nobel laureate is freed analysts expect she will face tough restrictions after spending much of the past two decades under detention .

looking ahead to this week 's meeting of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- nations in seoul , the former us trade representative said the world needed a new regime to succeed the bretton woods ii system of floating currencies , which has been in place since the fixed-rate currency system linked to gold broke down in 1971 .
although the gold standard helped guard against inflation , it was abandoned because it did not allow for the flexible monetary policy many economists believe is essential in counteracting economic shocks .
" although textbooks may view gold as the old money , markets are using gold as an alternative monetary asset today , " zoellick wrote .
the new system " is likely to need to involve the dollar , the euro , the yen , the pound and a renminbi -lrb- chinese yuan -rrb- that moves towards internationalization and then an open capital account , " he said .
" the system should also consider employing gold as an international reference point of market expectations about inflation , deflation and future currency values . "
currency war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick says the world needs to rethink currency exchange rates zoellick 's comments came amid fears of a so-called " currency war " that would see countries jostle for trade advantage by massaging their exchange rates lower .
the united states has led accusations that china cheats in world trade by artificially weakening its currency .
but china and germany , both major exporters , have complained that washington 's policy of quantitative easing - effectively printing money - is weakening the dollar and harming emerging markets ' competitiveness .
investors are pumping dollars into emerging markets in search of higher yields , and the potentially destabilizing impact of this , along with big current account deficits and china 's reluctance to let the yuan appreciate faster , are set to dominate the g20 summit on thursday and friday .
new structures france , which takes over the g20 chair after this week 's summit , says it plans to work on a new international monetary system to bring greater currency stability .
beijing 's central bank chief has suggested an alternative monetary system based on using the international monetary fund 's special drawing rights , a notional unit of value based on a basket of major currencies , instead of the dollar as the sole global reserve currency .
zoellick said a new monetary system would take time to develop and should be part of a package approach including possible changes in international monetary fund rules to review capital as well as current account policies , and linking imf monetary assessments to world trade organization obligations .
he also called on the g20 to forge structural reforms , including the promotion of domestic demand in china and the reduction of debt in the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 08.11.2010 author alfred grosser is controversial choice for kristallnacht speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grosser has been criticized for his views on israel every year on november 9 , st paul 's church in frankfurt commemorates the kristallnacht pogrom of 1938 .
deutsche welle spoke to the controversial writer alfred grosser who has been chosen to give the keynote speech . on november 9 the author alfred grosser is to give a speech in remembrance of the kristallnacht , or the night of broken glass , pogrom against jews in germany carried out under the nazis in 1938 .
the choice of speaker has caused controversy with historians and germany 's central council of jews questioning grosser 's credentials .
grosser comes from a jewish family and emigrated to france with them in 1933 .
the political academic and author of numerous books and essays is seen as an important pioneer in post-war franco-german understanding .
in recent years he has become increasingly interested in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
his 2009 book " von auschwitz nach jerusalem " -lrb- " from auschwitz to jerusalem " -rrb- caused controversy as he dealt with the question of how much it is permissible to question the policies of israel . germany 's central council of jews is not happy , and has written to the mayor of frankfurt to complain that grosser is an inappropriate choice of speaker .
deutsche welle : alfred grosser , you 're french with german and jewish roots .
you were born in 1925 in frankfurt and fled from there to france in 1933 .
now you are to give a speech in the place of your birth at the november 9 memorial .
regardless of the criticism , what were your thoughts and feelings about doing this ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of synagogues and businesses were attacked during kristallnacht alfred grosser : first of all , there is a need to remember this particular day .
since august 1944 in marseille , when i heard that part of my family had been transported to auschwitz , i have been sure that there is no collective german guilt and yet that i also share some responsibility for the future of liberal democracy in germany .
this was my starting point for the speech .
how exactly does one qualify to make such a speech ?
is it for instance through a certain behaviour or membership of some kind of official jewish organisation .
is only a " real " jew allowed to give such a speech ?
you have been accused of distancing yourself from judaism .
that is , at least , what the german historian michael wolffsohn asserts .
what does that have to do with my speech ?
a non-jew could also be chosen make the speech because the speech should also be for all german people .
there is an enormous volume published by raphael gross that documents all the terrible things that happened .
in contrast , there is also the fact that hundreds of non-jewish germans helped jewish germans .
that is something that is always downplayed .
i will also speak about this .
there is no collective guilt .
how , in 2010 , should november 9 be remembered ?
is there a way of doing it , so that it is not simply a ritual repeating the maxim " never again " ?
perhaps i was invited so that it would not become a pure ritual .
but it now seems that a lot of people in germany are upset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli author david grossman won the 2010 german book trade peace prize there are not that many people , let 's not exaggerate .
yes , the general secretary of the jewish organization - he was very upset .
but , david grossman , who this year won the peace prize of the german book trade is someone who constantly criticizes israeli policy and yet , he won that prize .
so , what 's the problem ?
the problem seems to be that you , it is said , have distanced yourself from judaism and have lived in france for a long time .
it is said that someone like grossman , who comes from israel is on more of a position to criticize , even if he does meet with criticism himself in israel for his opinions .
yes , but it is possible to speak freely in israel .
in germany the central council of jews would like it if there were only one single truth .
the american historian fritz stern and the former chancellor helmut schmidt both said that they are amazed that , from organizations here in germany you only hear a case of " right or wrong – my israel . "
during the german book trade presentation ceremony , i was very moved by what joachim gauck , correctly , said .
" my country right or wrong – if it is right , let it keep it right , if it is wrong , let it set it right . "
that means that we should judge each israeli policy accordingly .
you criticize the policies of israel – for example the policy of occupation and the separation wall between israelis and palestinians .
from a french point of view , why do you think such criticism always leads to such strong reactions from jewish organisations in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grosser praised comments made by joachim gauck -lrb- r . -rrb- at the german book prize it 's exactly the same in france .
one of the people i admire most , the former concentration camp inmate and french ambassador stephane estell - who also worked on the international declaration of human rights - has now travelled to gaza from egypt to see what the situation is like there .
immediately there were complaints , worse than i have had in germany – that he had not really been in the concentration camp , that he had in fact been a spy and so on ...
yes , we do have those reactions as well , at least from a few .
but it is a sensitive issue .
here in germany , of course , political correctness obviously plays a certain role .
i do n't know .
i would cite the former president koehler who in his speech to the israeli knesset - without referring to the palestinians - said that , as a result of its past , germany has the duty to defend human rights across the world .
that is something that is crucial for me and something that we should explain to young people who increasingly distance themselves and ask why they should bear any responsibility .
the responsibility is to learn from the past to defend so that we can defend human rights around the world , including germany .
what sort of reaction are you expecting on november 9 in frankfurt ?
it 's difficult to say .
i think that when i say the word israel , some of the listeners will listen more attentively while others will leave the room .
i have always found that it never comes to a debate .
i constantly try to debate the issues .
for example , at the launch of my last book " von auschwitz nach jerusalem " -lrb- “ from auschwitz to jerusalem ” -rrb- , about germany and israel , i insisted upon inviting jewish congregations in several german cities , but they did not come .
they do not want to debate because they do not want to have to always prove that they are right .

deutsche welle spoke to the controversial writer alfred grosser who has been chosen to give the keynote speech . on november 9 the author alfred grosser is to give a speech in remembrance of the kristallnacht , or the night of broken glass , pogrom against jews in germany carried out under the nazis in 1938 .
the choice of speaker has caused controversy with historians and germany 's central council of jews questioning grosser 's credentials .
grosser comes from a jewish family and emigrated to france with them in 1933 .
the political academic and author of numerous books and essays is seen as an important pioneer in post-war franco-german understanding .
in recent years he has become increasingly interested in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
his 2009 book " von auschwitz nach jerusalem " -lrb- " from auschwitz to jerusalem " -rrb- caused controversy as he dealt with the question of how much it is permissible to question the policies of israel . germany 's central council of jews is not happy , and has written to the mayor of frankfurt to complain that grosser is an inappropriate choice of speaker .
deutsche welle : alfred grosser , you 're french with german and jewish roots .
you were born in 1925 in frankfurt and fled from there to france in 1933 .
now you are to give a speech in the place of your birth at the november 9 memorial .
regardless of the criticism , what were your thoughts and feelings about doing this ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of synagogues and businesses were attacked during kristallnacht alfred grosser : first of all , there is a need to remember this particular day .
since august 1944 in marseille , when i heard that part of my family had been transported to auschwitz , i have been sure that there is no collective german guilt and yet that i also share some responsibility for the future of liberal democracy in germany .
this was my starting point for the speech .
how exactly does one qualify to make such a speech ?
is it for instance through a certain behaviour or membership of some kind of official jewish organisation .
is only a " real " jew allowed to give such a speech ?
you have been accused of distancing yourself from judaism .
that is , at least , what the german historian michael wolffsohn asserts .
what does that have to do with my speech ?
a non-jew could also be chosen make the speech because the speech should also be for all german people .
there is an enormous volume published by raphael gross that documents all the terrible things that happened .
in contrast , there is also the fact that hundreds of non-jewish germans helped jewish germans .
that is something that is always downplayed .
i will also speak about this .
there is no collective guilt .
how , in 2010 , should november 9 be remembered ?
is there a way of doing it , so that it is not simply a ritual repeating the maxim " never again " ?
perhaps i was invited so that it would not become a pure ritual .
but it now seems that a lot of people in germany are upset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli author david grossman won the 2010 german book trade peace prize there are not that many people , let 's not exaggerate .
yes , the general secretary of the jewish organization - he was very upset .
but , david grossman , who this year won the peace prize of the german book trade is someone who constantly criticizes israeli policy and yet , he won that prize .
so , what 's the problem ?
the problem seems to be that you , it is said , have distanced yourself from judaism and have lived in france for a long time .
it is said that someone like grossman , who comes from israel is on more of a position to criticize , even if he does meet with criticism himself in israel for his opinions .
yes , but it is possible to speak freely in israel .
in germany the central council of jews would like it if there were only one single truth .

looking ahead to this week 's meeting of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- nations in seoul , the former us trade representative said the world needed a new regime to succeed the bretton woods ii system of floating currencies , which has been in place since the fixed-rate currency system linked to gold broke down in 1971 .
although the gold standard helped guard against inflation , it was abandoned because it did not allow for the flexible monetary policy many economists believe is essential in counteracting economic shocks .
" although textbooks may view gold as the old money , markets are using gold as an alternative monetary asset today , " zoellick wrote .
the new system " is likely to need to involve the dollar , the euro , the yen , the pound and a renminbi -lrb- chinese yuan -rrb- that moves towards internationalization and then an open capital account , " he said .
" the system should also consider employing gold as an international reference point of market expectations about inflation , deflation and future currency values . "
currency war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick says the world needs to rethink currency exchange rates zoellick 's comments came amid fears of a so-called " currency war " that would see countries jostle for trade advantage by massaging their exchange rates lower .
the united states has led accusations that china cheats in world trade by artificially weakening its currency .
but china and germany , both major exporters , have complained that washington 's policy of quantitative easing - effectively printing money - is weakening the dollar and harming emerging markets ' competitiveness .
investors are pumping dollars into emerging markets in search of higher yields , and the potentially destabilizing impact of this , along with big current account deficits and china 's reluctance to let the yuan appreciate faster , are set to dominate the g20 summit on thursday and friday .
new structures france , which takes over the g20 chair after this week 's summit , says it plans to work on a new international monetary system to bring greater currency stability .
beijing 's central bank chief has suggested an alternative monetary system based on using the international monetary fund 's special drawing rights , a notional unit of value based on a basket of major currencies , instead of the dollar as the sole global reserve currency .
zoellick said a new monetary system would take time to develop and should be part of a package approach including possible changes in international monetary fund rules to review capital as well as current account policies , and linking imf monetary assessments to world trade organization obligations .
he also called on the g20 to forge structural reforms , including the promotion of domestic demand in china and the reduction of debt in the united states .

looking ahead to this week 's meeting of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- nations in seoul , the former us trade representative said the world needed a new regime to succeed the bretton woods ii system of floating currencies , which has been in place since the fixed-rate currency system linked to gold broke down in 1971 .
although the gold standard helped guard against inflation , it was abandoned because it did not allow for the flexible monetary policy many economists believe is essential in counteracting economic shocks .
" although textbooks may view gold as the old money , markets are using gold as an alternative monetary asset today , " zoellick wrote .
the new system " is likely to need to involve the dollar , the euro , the yen , the pound and a renminbi -lrb- chinese yuan -rrb- that moves towards internationalization and then an open capital account , " he said .
" the system should also consider employing gold as an international reference point of market expectations about inflation , deflation and future currency values . "
currency war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick says the world needs to rethink currency exchange rates zoellick 's comments came amid fears of a so-called " currency war " that would see countries jostle for trade advantage by massaging their exchange rates lower .
the united states has led accusations that china cheats in world trade by artificially weakening its currency .
but china and germany , both major exporters , have complained that washington 's policy of quantitative easing - effectively printing money - is weakening the dollar and harming emerging markets ' competitiveness .
investors are pumping dollars into emerging markets in search of higher yields , and the potentially destabilizing impact of this , along with big current account deficits and china 's reluctance to let the yuan appreciate faster , are set to dominate the g20 summit on thursday and friday .
new structures france , which takes over the g20 chair after this week 's summit , says it plans to work on a new international monetary system to bring greater currency stability .
beijing 's central bank chief has suggested an alternative monetary system based on using the international monetary fund 's special drawing rights , a notional unit of value based on a basket of major currencies , instead of the dollar as the sole global reserve currency .
zoellick said a new monetary system would take time to develop and should be part of a package approach including possible changes in international monetary fund rules to review capital as well as current account policies , and linking imf monetary assessments to world trade organization obligations .
he also called on the g20 to forge structural reforms , including the promotion of domestic demand in china and the reduction of debt in the united states .

the ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security . interior ministers of the european union 's 27 member states unanimously agreed on monday to eliminate visa requirements for citizens of albania and bosnia-herzegovina .
under the agreement , albanians and bosnians with biometric passports would be able to travel to the 25 eu nations in the border-free schengen zone , which excludes ireland and the united kingdom , for up to three months .
the decision came after france , germany and the netherlands expressed concerns that there could be an increase in unfounded asylum claims from the two countries .
the eu got rid of visa requirements for serbia , montenegro and macedonia late last year , apparently leading to an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia .
european commission could roll back decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has seen an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia the ministers stipulated that the european commission could " propose the suspension of visa-free travel " if it felt that citizens of the two countries were abusing the system .
" it is of the utmost importance that albania and bosnia-herzegovina continue to intensify their information campaign with the aim to properly explain to their citizens the meaning of short-term visa-free travel , " cecilia malmstrom , eu commissioner for home affairs , said in a statement .
" a visa-free regime also comes with responsibilities . "
malmstrom said the european parliament and the bloc 's member states must still approve the proposal , and that it could enter into force as early as mid-december .
it would leave kosovo , whose independence is not recognized by all eu states , as the only balkan country without visa-free travel in the eu .
both bosnia and albania hope to join the eu , but face years of tough democratic reforms before they will likely be able to do so .
stricter rules on cargo security eu interior ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security in the aftermath of a string of eu-bound parcel bombs originating from yemen and greece last week .
for instance , airports with inadequate security measures could appear on a blacklist . german interior minister thomas de maiziere said security concerns should trump fears over extra costs due to increased control procedures . " if this is going to be more expensive , then it might be a little more expensive .
there is no security for free " , de maiziere told reporters before presenting his five key points to his eu colleagues . according to de maiziere , the eu must focus on coordination before halting cargo shipments , agree on which countries are to be considered unsafe freight senders , improve security in those unsafe airports , tighten controls on suspect parcels and define responsibilities between commercial shippers and national authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there is no security for free , " says de maiziere the german proposal was welcomed by belgian interior minister annemie turtelboom who is in charge of chairing the eu meeting . " when we see everything that happened last week , we must really discuss how we can travel together , work together and how we can work together not only with the united states but also with some countries in africa , " she said . spanish interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba called measures on enhancing security coordination " an ever more pressing need " for eu countries . but siim kallas , eu transport commissioner , warned on friday that panic should not lead to an excessive increase of security measures . " the fight against terrorism is eternal , and aviation remains the most sensitive target for such attacks , but panic is not the remedy , " he said .
" we must find a proportionate and adequate response . " de maiziere wants to implement a working group which is due to get results by the end of this year .

" faced with such gross violations of human rights , it is the responsibility of the international community , especially leaders like the united states and india , to condemn it . "
obama said .

the regulator said it did not view the circumstances of the downstream acquisition as " unacceptable . "
ulitmate goal : leighton the german and australian companies had asked the takeovers panel to intervene in acs ' 2.76 billion euro all-share takeover offer for hochtief on the grounds that leighton was the ultimate target .
hochtief 's stake in leighton is valued at almost as much as the whole of the essen-based construction company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees are concerned about their jobs under a new owner in its submission to the panel , leighton said it was concerned that if acs grabbed hochtief 's stake , minority shareholders in leighton would be disadvantaged and the company would lose the independence it had enjoyed under german stewardship .

the ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security . interior ministers of the european union 's 27 member states unanimously agreed on monday to eliminate visa requirements for citizens of albania and bosnia-herzegovina .
under the agreement , albanians and bosnians with biometric passports would be able to travel to the 25 eu nations in the border-free schengen zone , which excludes ireland and the united kingdom , for up to three months .
the decision came after france , germany and the netherlands expressed concerns that there could be an increase in unfounded asylum claims from the two countries .
the eu got rid of visa requirements for serbia , montenegro and macedonia late last year , apparently leading to an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia .
european commission could roll back decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has seen an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia the ministers stipulated that the european commission could " propose the suspension of visa-free travel " if it felt that citizens of the two countries were abusing the system .
" it is of the utmost importance that albania and bosnia-herzegovina continue to intensify their information campaign with the aim to properly explain to their citizens the meaning of short-term visa-free travel , " cecilia malmstrom , eu commissioner for home affairs , said in a statement .
" a visa-free regime also comes with responsibilities . "
malmstrom said the european parliament and the bloc 's member states must still approve the proposal , and that it could enter into force as early as mid-december .
it would leave kosovo , whose independence is not recognized by all eu states , as the only balkan country without visa-free travel in the eu .
both bosnia and albania hope to join the eu , but face years of tough democratic reforms before they will likely be able to do so .
stricter rules on cargo security eu interior ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security in the aftermath of a string of eu-bound parcel bombs originating from yemen and greece last week .
for instance , airports with inadequate security measures could appear on a blacklist . german interior minister thomas de maiziere said security concerns should trump fears over extra costs due to increased control procedures . " if this is going to be more expensive , then it might be a little more expensive .
there is no security for free " , de maiziere told reporters before presenting his five key points to his eu colleagues . according to de maiziere , the eu must focus on coordination before halting cargo shipments , agree on which countries are to be considered unsafe freight senders , improve security in those unsafe airports , tighten controls on suspect parcels and define responsibilities between commercial shippers and national authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there is no security for free , " says de maiziere the german proposal was welcomed by belgian interior minister annemie turtelboom who is in charge of chairing the eu meeting . " when we see everything that happened last week , we must really discuss how we can travel together , work together and how we can work together not only with the united states but also with some countries in africa , " she said . spanish interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba called measures on enhancing security coordination " an ever more pressing need " for eu countries . but siim kallas , eu transport commissioner , warned on friday that panic should not lead to an excessive increase of security measures . " the fight against terrorism is eternal , and aviation remains the most sensitive target for such attacks , but panic is not the remedy , " he said .
" we must find a proportionate and adequate response . " de maiziere wants to implement a working group which is due to get results by the end of this year .

papandreou had been seeking a mandate for his austerity drive . greek prime minister george papandreou has said he will not call a snap parliamentary election , claiming to have won sufficient support in local and regional polls to press ahead with austerity reforms .
papandreou made the announcement on sunday as his socialist party -lrb- pasok -rrb- appeared to have emerged narrowly ahead of rivals . the threat of a general election had rattled financial markets , with fears that the greek government would not be able to follow through on its unpopular budget drive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the budget measures come after an international rescue package was agreed in a televised address to the nation on sunday , papandreou - who only came to power last year - said he felt satisfied with a fresh mandate to press ahead with the program .
" making changes is not easy , " papandreou said .
" greek people brought us to power a year ago and today confirmed that they want this change .
we will continue with our task tomorrow , " estimates early on monday put pasok ahead in seven out of 13 regions .
the center-right new democracy party led in the remaining regions , although some races were so tight that they are likely to be contested again next sunday .
welcome news for markets risk premiums on greek government debt had risen in advance of the elections because of political uncertainty and the news was broadly welcomed by observers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austerity drive has led to strikes and protests " it 's good news that papandreou can continue and that no political uncertainty enters the fray , " said andreas scheuerle , an economist at germany 's dekabank .
papandreou had at no stage indicated the criteria he would use to decide whether or not to call a fresh general election .
the government was forced to adopt a program of pay cuts , tax rises and a freeze in pensions - prompting strikes , riots and protests - after state finances were revealed to be far in a far worse state than expected earlier this year .
those reforms were agreed as part of 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 154.4 billion -rrb- bailout package from the international monetary fund and the european union in may .
the greek economy , which represents about 2.5 percent of that of the euro zone , is expected to shrink by 4 percent this year .

up to 17,000 policemen , at a cost of up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- , were used over the weekend to keep an estimated 35,000 people from blocking the path of the train , and more demonstrators – along with local farmers - are continuing to arrive to block the path of the road convoy as it continues its journey .
there were varying reports of whether violence had occurred .
the police said that officers had been directly attacked , while protest organizers countered that demonstrators had only sabotaged the tracks .
rainer wendt , head of the police union , said , the officers " proceeded very sensitively , " and " made the right decision – namely to carry the people from the tracks . "
he added that where violence was used against police officers , they reacted " accordingly " and " proportionately . "
dirk seifert , spokesman for the environmental protest group robin wood , told a different story .
" you have to say that the police were disproportionate in their use of tear-gas and pepper spray , " he told deutsche welle .
" the police also hit people who were already lying on the ground , both with their fists as well as truncheons . "
there was also the issue of what happened to those peaceful protesters once they were removed from the tracks .
seifert complained of demonstrators being kept for hours on end in an open field in the cold of the night .
" that is usually called false imprisonment , he said , " the law says people have to be brought to a custodial judge as soon as possible .
that did not happen . "
bildunterschrift : the protests continued throughout the weekend and into monday issues converging what has made this particular demonstration so explosive is the coincidence of this transport of nuclear waste with the government 's decision to overturn former legislation aimed at phasing out nuclear power by around 2020 .
chancellor angela merkel 's conservative coalition of christian democrats and the pro-business free democrats , recently passed a bill through parliament allowing nuclear power stations to remain open another 12 years .
environment minister norbert roettgen has been at pains to separate the issues of lifespan-extension and dealing with nuclear waste .
" we have been using nuclear power for over 40 years , " he said .
" we have created electricity from it and created waste , and we have a responsibility to deal with that – independent of the question of lifespan extension . "
yet seifert is unimpressed with this distinction .
" the fact is that this government has decided to produce even more nuclear waste by extending the life spans of the existing nuclear power stations . "
but some demonstrators arrived at the railway tracks with self-evidently different agendas .
stuttgart 21 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgarters angry about a new railway station have joined the anti-nuclear protests several protestors against the new railway station known as stuttgart 21 were also present , and were celebrated at the podium .
this suggests that the anti-nuclear movement has become a rallying point for many people who feel the current government 's policies are leaving them disenfranchised .
" there is a growing feeling that policies are being made for minorities or a certain clientele , like large corporations , and that this government does not see it as necessary to work for the good of the whole population , " said seifert .
" a lot of people in stuttgart have the feeling that their opinion is not respected – the government is just doing what it wants over the heads of the population . "
opinion polls show that opposition political parties , particularly the greens , are benefitting from this groundswell .
indeed , prominent green party figure claudia roth took part in the weekend 's demonstrations , though politicians were not permitted to speak at the podium .
" we are certainly interested in working together with members of those parties , but the parties have the parliament , and we have the streets , " said seifert .
" we are a social movement and we have to separate the two places of expression . "

looking ahead to this week 's meeting of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- nations in seoul , the former us trade representative said the world needed a new regime to succeed the bretton woods ii system of floating currencies , which has been in place since the fixed-rate currency system linked to gold broke down in 1971 .
although the gold standard helped guard against inflation , it was abandoned because it did not allow for the flexible monetary policy many economists believe is essential in counteracting economic shocks .
" although textbooks may view gold as the old money , markets are using gold as an alternative monetary asset today , " zoellick wrote .
the new system " is likely to need to involve the dollar , the euro , the yen , the pound and a renminbi -lrb- chinese yuan -rrb- that moves towards internationalization and then an open capital account , " he said .
" the system should also consider employing gold as an international reference point of market expectations about inflation , deflation and future currency values . "
currency war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick says the world needs to rethink currency exchange rates zoellick 's comments came amid fears of a so-called " currency war " that would see countries jostle for trade advantage by massaging their exchange rates lower .
the united states has led accusations that china cheats in world trade by artificially weakening its currency .
but china and germany , both major exporters , have complained that washington 's policy of quantitative easing - effectively printing money - is weakening the dollar and harming emerging markets ' competitiveness .
investors are pumping dollars into emerging markets in search of higher yields , and the potentially destabilizing impact of this , along with big current account deficits and china 's reluctance to let the yuan appreciate faster , are set to dominate the g20 summit on thursday and friday .
new structures france , which takes over the g20 chair after this week 's summit , says it plans to work on a new international monetary system to bring greater currency stability .
beijing 's central bank chief has suggested an alternative monetary system based on using the international monetary fund 's special drawing rights , a notional unit of value based on a basket of major currencies , instead of the dollar as the sole global reserve currency .
zoellick said a new monetary system would take time to develop and should be part of a package approach including possible changes in international monetary fund rules to review capital as well as current account policies , and linking imf monetary assessments to world trade organization obligations .
he also called on the g20 to forge structural reforms , including the promotion of domestic demand in china and the reduction of debt in the united states .

the ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security . interior ministers of the european union 's 27 member states unanimously agreed on monday to eliminate visa requirements for citizens of albania and bosnia-herzegovina .
under the agreement , albanians and bosnians with biometric passports would be able to travel to the 25 eu nations in the border-free schengen zone , which excludes ireland and the united kingdom , for up to three months .
the decision came after france , germany and the netherlands expressed concerns that there could be an increase in unfounded asylum claims from the two countries .
the eu got rid of visa requirements for serbia , montenegro and macedonia late last year , apparently leading to an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia .
european commission could roll back decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has seen an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia the ministers stipulated that the european commission could " propose the suspension of visa-free travel " if it felt that citizens of the two countries were abusing the system .
" it is of the utmost importance that albania and bosnia-herzegovina continue to intensify their information campaign with the aim to properly explain to their citizens the meaning of short-term visa-free travel , " cecilia malmstrom , eu commissioner for home affairs , said in a statement .
" a visa-free regime also comes with responsibilities . "
malmstrom said the european parliament and the bloc 's member states must still approve the proposal , and that it could enter into force as early as mid-december .
it would leave kosovo , whose independence is not recognized by all eu states , as the only balkan country without visa-free travel in the eu .
both bosnia and albania hope to join the eu , but face years of tough democratic reforms before they will likely be able to do so .
stricter rules on cargo security eu interior ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security in the aftermath of a string of eu-bound parcel bombs originating from yemen and greece last week .
for instance , airports with inadequate security measures could appear on a blacklist . german interior minister thomas de maiziere said security concerns should trump fears over extra costs due to increased control procedures . " if this is going to be more expensive , then it might be a little more expensive .
there is no security for free " , de maiziere told reporters before presenting his five key points to his eu colleagues . according to de maiziere , the eu must focus on coordination before halting cargo shipments , agree on which countries are to be considered unsafe freight senders , improve security in those unsafe airports , tighten controls on suspect parcels and define responsibilities between commercial shippers and national authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there is no security for free , " says de maiziere the german proposal was welcomed by belgian interior minister annemie turtelboom who is in charge of chairing the eu meeting . " when we see everything that happened last week , we must really discuss how we can travel together , work together and how we can work together not only with the united states but also with some countries in africa , " she said . spanish interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba called measures on enhancing security coordination " an ever more pressing need " for eu countries . but siim kallas , eu transport commissioner , warned on friday that panic should not lead to an excessive increase of security measures . " the fight against terrorism is eternal , and aviation remains the most sensitive target for such attacks , but panic is not the remedy , " he said .
" we must find a proportionate and adequate response . " de maiziere wants to implement a working group which is due to get results by the end of this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de travel -pipe- 08.11.2010 eu scraps visa requirements for albania and bosnia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albanians and bosnians may enter the eu for three months albania and bosnia are soon to join other balkan countries in enjoying visa-free travel to the european union , eu interior ministers announced monday .
the ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security . interior ministers of the european union 's 27 member states unanimously agreed on monday to eliminate visa requirements for citizens of albania and bosnia-herzegovina .
under the agreement , albanians and bosnians with biometric passports would be able to travel to the 25 eu nations in the border-free schengen zone , which excludes ireland and the united kingdom , for up to three months .
the decision came after france , germany and the netherlands expressed concerns that there could be an increase in unfounded asylum claims from the two countries .
the eu got rid of visa requirements for serbia , montenegro and macedonia late last year , apparently leading to an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia .
european commission could roll back decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has seen an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia the ministers stipulated that the european commission could " propose the suspension of visa-free travel " if it felt that citizens of the two countries were abusing the system .
" it is of the utmost importance that albania and bosnia-herzegovina continue to intensify their information campaign with the aim to properly explain to their citizens the meaning of short-term visa-free travel , " cecilia malmstrom , eu commissioner for home affairs , said in a statement .
" a visa-free regime also comes with responsibilities . "
malmstrom said the european parliament and the bloc 's member states must still approve the proposal , and that it could enter into force as early as mid-december .
it would leave kosovo , whose independence is not recognized by all eu states , as the only balkan country without visa-free travel in the eu .
both bosnia and albania hope to join the eu , but face years of tough democratic reforms before they will likely be able to do so .
stricter rules on cargo security eu interior ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security in the aftermath of a string of eu-bound parcel bombs originating from yemen and greece last week .
for instance , airports with inadequate security measures could appear on a blacklist . german interior minister thomas de maiziere said security concerns should trump fears over extra costs due to increased control procedures . " if this is going to be more expensive , then it might be a little more expensive .
there is no security for free " , de maiziere told reporters before presenting his five key points to his eu colleagues . according to de maiziere , the eu must focus on coordination before halting cargo shipments , agree on which countries are to be considered unsafe freight senders , improve security in those unsafe airports , tighten controls on suspect parcels and define responsibilities between commercial shippers and national authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there is no security for free , " says de maiziere the german proposal was welcomed by belgian interior minister annemie turtelboom who is in charge of chairing the eu meeting . " when we see everything that happened last week , we must really discuss how we can travel together , work together and how we can work together not only with the united states but also with some countries in africa , " she said . spanish interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba called measures on enhancing security coordination " an ever more pressing need " for eu countries . but siim kallas , eu transport commissioner , warned on friday that panic should not lead to an excessive increase of security measures . " the fight against terrorism is eternal , and aviation remains the most sensitive target for such attacks , but panic is not the remedy , " he said .
" we must find a proportionate and adequate response . " de maiziere wants to implement a working group which is due to get results by the end of this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 08.11.2010 greek striker gekas revives his career at improving frankfurt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gekas made the difference against wolfsburg theofanis gekas is anything but a complete player , but he knows how to do a striker 's main job - score goals .
and this year the crafty greek is reminding opponents just how uncannily efficient he can be . after eleven rounds of play , no one had more goals - 11 in total - than a 30-year-old many bundesliga fans would probably classify as a journeyman .
but ask the man himself and he 'll tell you that goal-getting is an innate ability that 's anything but the norm .
" i started playing football really young , and i was always a striker , " gekas said in interview with the german football league .
" i was born with my scoring ability .
it seems like a gift from god . "
his teammates had another potentially supernatural explanation after gekas scored a brace on saturday .
“ we asked ourselves in the dressing room if he 's sold his soul , ” defender marco russ told the bild newspaper .
“ even his badly taken penalty went in . ”
gekas came to the bundesliga in 2005 on a one-year loan from panathinaikos athens to bochum and promptly won the league scoring title .
his then coach described him as " our life-insurance policy . "
but bochum decided they could not afford the premiums and failed to exercise their right to purchase the greek goal-getter .
it was a bad decision .
bochum became a perennial relegation candidate and now play in the second division .
for his part , gekas moved on to leverkusen , where he never established himself .
although he scored a respectable 11 goals in his first season with his new club , he was often criticized as lacking in work ethic and was loaned out to hertha berlin at the beginning of 2010 .
with hertha also getting relegated , gekas formally returned to leverkusen , before promptly moving on to frankfurt .
his was hardly one of the high-profile signings of the off-season , but now he 's getting a chance to prove that his detractors , if not completely wrong , missed the point .
ice-cold killer bildunterschrift : in addition to his 11 league goals , gekas has scored 2 in the german cup gekas is neither a particularly great dribbler or passer , and he 's never been known to track back and help out on defense .
but he is one of the most prolific poachers the league has seen in recent years .
that 's just the way he described the role of a striker in a recent interview .
" the most important thing is that -lsb- a striker -rsb- has good teammates who are always looking to get him the ball , " gekas told the online portal of the eurosport television network .
" in addition , he needs the talent to get himself in the right position to score goals . "
on teams that fail to utilize his nose for goal , gekas is most conspicuous for the amount of times he 's caught offside .
but on teams that figure out how to employ his particular talent , he can be lethal .
indeed , a tarantino-esque tattoo on gekas ' arm reads " eiskalter vollstrecker , " -lrb- ice-cold killer -rrb- - the nickname he earned at bochum .
understatement , as you 've probably guessed by now , is n't gekas ' strong suit .
" the fact that i did n't score -lsb- for leverkusen and hertha -rsb- was because the people in positions of responsibility did n't trust me , " gekas told the bundesliga .
" but frankfurt coach michael skibbe , whom i know from my time in leverkusen , does have that trust .
that has a direct effect on my game and the number of goals i score . "
instinct and vision bildunterschrift : gekas has been doing all his talking on pitch this season seen negatively , gekas is one-dimensional .
seen positively , he does exactly what he 's supposed to do , hang around in dangerous positions and convert chances as they materialize .
wolfsburg were given a display of the latter qualities , as their trip to frankfurt on saturday ended in a 3-1 defeat .
the hosts ' first goal in that match was archetypal gekas .
the greek striker lurked on the edge of the penalty area , and when a low pass came his way , he took it directly and curled it into the bottom left-hand corner .
the goal was only possible because gekas did n't hesitate or try to control the ball , but rather reacted on instinct .
that 's a quality his coach appreciates .
" there are n't many strikers who can see a situation in advance as well as gekas , " michael skibbe told the bild newspaper earlier this season .
" in the build-up , he follows pass combinations very intensely and then instinctively runs where he expects the ball to be . "
gekas goals may often appear to be lucky , but the numbers argue for his basic quality .
in addition to his achievements in the bundesliga , the striker has scored 20 goals in 51 matches for the greek national team .
gekas officially retired from the greece squad in september , citing " special circumstances . "
few people , if indeed anyone other than the striker himself , knew what he was referring to .
that 's not uncommon with gekas , who , despite playing for years in the bundesliga , says he sees no need to learn german .
and this season , he 's drastically scaled back the number of interviews he 's prepared to give .
but if gekas can keep up anything near his early pace of a goal per game , no one is likely to care about his disinterest in communication .
as he himself might say , a striker 's job is not to make himself understood .
putting the ball in the net speaks louder than words .

" government strikes back christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- secretary general hermann groehe weighed into the debate monday , saying trittin 's reversal on calling on green members to renounce demonstrations back in 2001 was a clear example of double standards . " to call for discretion in government times , but then to add fuel to the fire in opposition is the height of hypocrisy , " groehe said in berlin on monday . alexander dobrindt , the secretary general of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , accused the greens of turning into the " political arm of the rioters , arsonists and stone throwers . " he added that green party leaders claudia roth and cem oezdemir were lending " moral support to the violation of the public peace . " green party on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezdemir and roth have won the greens support through their anti-nuclear platform nuclear energy is a highly contentious issue in germany , and recent polls suggest that the green party has benefitted from the rising anti-nuclear sentiment stoked by the government 's energy policy . a weekend survey by ard found that a record 22 percent of voters would support the green party if an election were held now . oezdemir wrote in an article published monday in the daily hamburger abendblatt that the massive mobilization should lead to a greater public engagement in organized politics . " i would really hope that as many as possible of these well-informed , educated and engaged people of all age groups and backgrounds are also looking toward the path of organizations , political parties and the government , " he said , referring also to the popular movement against the " stuttgart 21 " rail station renewal project . he added that the protestors were neither " naively idealist nor egotistical , nor radical .

industry associations partly blame schools for not offering a designated course devoted to general economics and personal finance .
focusing regularly on business there are exceptions .
once a month , a large german newspaper publishes a business page , which is both written and designed by school students .
" youth and business " is the name of the newspaper project .
it 's sponsored by the federal association of german banks , and requires students to focus regularly on the newspaper 's business pages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of teenagers and young adults know how to spend and pile up debt , but not save the project exists only because it 's privately financed .
inge niebergall , a director of the banking association , does n't understand why general economics courses are n't part of the regular curriculum .
" last year we asked students if they wanted to learn more about economics in school , " niebergall said .
" some 78 percent of them responded positively .
more than 80 percent of the adults we surveyed approved of the idea as well because they see a real need . "
not only the banking federation but other industry associations and unions also complain about the insufficient economic education of young people .
thomas retzmann , a professor at the duisburg-essen university and chairman of the german society of economic studies , speaks of a desolate – and alarming – situation .
very few young people today , he complains , are familiar with terms like inflation and company pension funds .
" they need to have a basic understanding of economics to participate in daily life , " retzmann said .
" it begins with the news they see in the newspaper or on tv or in the other new media channels .
they need to have an idea of what 's happening to form an opinion . "
lack of a common economic course german schools are n't completely void of economics studies .
but education in germany is governed by the states .
so what students in schleswig-holstein learn is n't necessarily the same as what those in bavaria or north rhine-westphalia learn . the one thing that all states do have in common is the lack of a common economics curriculum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people need a basic understanding of economics " to participate in daily life " " today , schools often teach economics in a very fragmented way ; the subject is spread across very different course : calculating prices , for instance , is math , globalization is german , and economic geography is geography , " said otto kentzler , president of the confederation of german trades .
" we need new ideas to systematically give students the armor they require to become ' responsible economic citizens . " '
what 's necessary is not only a curriculum reform but also changes to teachers ' training , retzmann added : " how should a teacher who has not studied economics and has never heard of economic education be able to teach basic economic principles ? "
in two expert reports , retzmann outlined what school students should know about economics by the end of their schooling and what that implies for teaching professionals among his recommendations : establish economics as a major for teachers in training .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 08.11.2010 author alfred grosser is controversial choice for kristallnacht speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grosser has been criticized for his views on israel every year on november 9 , st paul 's church in frankfurt commemorates the kristallnacht pogrom of 1938 .
deutsche welle spoke to the controversial writer alfred grosser who has been chosen to give the keynote speech . on november 9 the author alfred grosser is to give a speech in remembrance of the kristallnacht , or the night of broken glass , pogrom against jews in germany carried out under the nazis in 1938 .
the choice of speaker has caused controversy with historians and germany 's central council of jews questioning grosser 's credentials .
grosser comes from a jewish family and emigrated to france with them in 1933 .
the political academic and author of numerous books and essays is seen as an important pioneer in post-war franco-german understanding .
in recent years he has become increasingly interested in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
his 2009 book " von auschwitz nach jerusalem " -lrb- " from auschwitz to jerusalem " -rrb- caused controversy as he dealt with the question of how much it is permissible to question the policies of israel . germany 's central council of jews is not happy , and has written to the mayor of frankfurt to complain that grosser is an inappropriate choice of speaker .
deutsche welle : alfred grosser , you 're french with german and jewish roots .
you were born in 1925 in frankfurt and fled from there to france in 1933 .
now you are to give a speech in the place of your birth at the november 9 memorial .
regardless of the criticism , what were your thoughts and feelings about doing this ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of synagogues and businesses were attacked during kristallnacht alfred grosser : first of all , there is a need to remember this particular day .
since august 1944 in marseille , when i heard that part of my family had been transported to auschwitz , i have been sure that there is no collective german guilt and yet that i also share some responsibility for the future of liberal democracy in germany .
this was my starting point for the speech .
how exactly does one qualify to make such a speech ?
is it for instance through a certain behaviour or membership of some kind of official jewish organisation .
is only a " real " jew allowed to give such a speech ?
you have been accused of distancing yourself from judaism .
that is , at least , what the german historian michael wolffsohn asserts .
what does that have to do with my speech ?
a non-jew could also be chosen make the speech because the speech should also be for all german people .
there is an enormous volume published by raphael gross that documents all the terrible things that happened .
in contrast , there is also the fact that hundreds of non-jewish germans helped jewish germans .
that is something that is always downplayed .
i will also speak about this .
there is no collective guilt .
how , in 2010 , should november 9 be remembered ?
is there a way of doing it , so that it is not simply a ritual repeating the maxim " never again " ?
perhaps i was invited so that it would not become a pure ritual .
but it now seems that a lot of people in germany are upset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli author david grossman won the 2010 german book trade peace prize there are not that many people , let 's not exaggerate .
yes , the general secretary of the jewish organization - he was very upset .
but , david grossman , who this year won the peace prize of the german book trade is someone who constantly criticizes israeli policy and yet , he won that prize .
so , what 's the problem ?
the problem seems to be that you , it is said , have distanced yourself from judaism and have lived in france for a long time .
it is said that someone like grossman , who comes from israel is on more of a position to criticize , even if he does meet with criticism himself in israel for his opinions .
yes , but it is possible to speak freely in israel .
in germany the central council of jews would like it if there were only one single truth .
the american historian fritz stern and the former chancellor helmut schmidt both said that they are amazed that , from organizations here in germany you only hear a case of " right or wrong – my israel . "
during the german book trade presentation ceremony , i was very moved by what joachim gauck , correctly , said .
" my country right or wrong – if it is right , let it keep it right , if it is wrong , let it set it right . "
that means that we should judge each israeli policy accordingly .
you criticize the policies of israel – for example the policy of occupation and the separation wall between israelis and palestinians .
from a french point of view , why do you think such criticism always leads to such strong reactions from jewish organisations in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grosser praised comments made by joachim gauck -lrb- r . -rrb- at the german book prize it 's exactly the same in france .
one of the people i admire most , the former concentration camp inmate and french ambassador stephane estell - who also worked on the international declaration of human rights - has now travelled to gaza from egypt to see what the situation is like there .
immediately there were complaints , worse than i have had in germany – that he had not really been in the concentration camp , that he had in fact been a spy and so on ...
yes , we do have those reactions as well , at least from a few .
but it is a sensitive issue .
here in germany , of course , political correctness obviously plays a certain role .
i do n't know .
i would cite the former president koehler who in his speech to the israeli knesset - without referring to the palestinians - said that , as a result of its past , germany has the duty to defend human rights across the world .
that is something that is crucial for me and something that we should explain to young people who increasingly distance themselves and ask why they should bear any responsibility .
the responsibility is to learn from the past to defend so that we can defend human rights around the world , including germany .
what sort of reaction are you expecting on november 9 in frankfurt ?
it 's difficult to say .
i think that when i say the word israel , some of the listeners will listen more attentively while others will leave the room .
i have always found that it never comes to a debate .
i constantly try to debate the issues .
for example , at the launch of my last book " von auschwitz nach jerusalem " -lrb- “ from auschwitz to jerusalem ” -rrb- , about germany and israel , i insisted upon inviting jewish congregations in several german cities , but they did not come .
they do not want to debate because they do not want to have to always prove that they are right .

deutsche welle spoke to the controversial writer alfred grosser who has been chosen to give the keynote speech . on november 9 the author alfred grosser is to give a speech in remembrance of the kristallnacht , or the night of broken glass , pogrom against jews in germany carried out under the nazis in 1938 .
the choice of speaker has caused controversy with historians and germany 's central council of jews questioning grosser 's credentials .
grosser comes from a jewish family and emigrated to france with them in 1933 .
the political academic and author of numerous books and essays is seen as an important pioneer in post-war franco-german understanding .
in recent years he has become increasingly interested in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
his 2009 book " von auschwitz nach jerusalem " -lrb- " from auschwitz to jerusalem " -rrb- caused controversy as he dealt with the question of how much it is permissible to question the policies of israel . germany 's central council of jews is not happy , and has written to the mayor of frankfurt to complain that grosser is an inappropriate choice of speaker .
deutsche welle : alfred grosser , you 're french with german and jewish roots .
you were born in 1925 in frankfurt and fled from there to france in 1933 .
now you are to give a speech in the place of your birth at the november 9 memorial .
regardless of the criticism , what were your thoughts and feelings about doing this ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of synagogues and businesses were attacked during kristallnacht alfred grosser : first of all , there is a need to remember this particular day .
since august 1944 in marseille , when i heard that part of my family had been transported to auschwitz , i have been sure that there is no collective german guilt and yet that i also share some responsibility for the future of liberal democracy in germany .
this was my starting point for the speech .
how exactly does one qualify to make such a speech ?
is it for instance through a certain behaviour or membership of some kind of official jewish organisation .
is only a " real " jew allowed to give such a speech ?
you have been accused of distancing yourself from judaism .
that is , at least , what the german historian michael wolffsohn asserts .
what does that have to do with my speech ?
a non-jew could also be chosen make the speech because the speech should also be for all german people .
there is an enormous volume published by raphael gross that documents all the terrible things that happened .
in contrast , there is also the fact that hundreds of non-jewish germans helped jewish germans .
that is something that is always downplayed .
i will also speak about this .
there is no collective guilt .
how , in 2010 , should november 9 be remembered ?
is there a way of doing it , so that it is not simply a ritual repeating the maxim " never again " ?
perhaps i was invited so that it would not become a pure ritual .
but it now seems that a lot of people in germany are upset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli author david grossman won the 2010 german book trade peace prize there are not that many people , let 's not exaggerate .
yes , the general secretary of the jewish organization - he was very upset .
but , david grossman , who this year won the peace prize of the german book trade is someone who constantly criticizes israeli policy and yet , he won that prize .
so , what 's the problem ?
the problem seems to be that you , it is said , have distanced yourself from judaism and have lived in france for a long time .
it is said that someone like grossman , who comes from israel is on more of a position to criticize , even if he does meet with criticism himself in israel for his opinions .
yes , but it is possible to speak freely in israel .
in germany the central council of jews would like it if there were only one single truth .
the american historian fritz stern and the former chancellor helmut schmidt both said that they are amazed that , from organizations here in germany you only hear a case of " right or wrong – my israel . "
during the german book trade presentation ceremony , i was very moved by what joachim gauck , correctly , said .
" my country right or wrong – if it is right , let it keep it right , if it is wrong , let it set it right . "
that means that we should judge each israeli policy accordingly .
you criticize the policies of israel – for example the policy of occupation and the separation wall between israelis and palestinians .
from a french point of view , why do you think such criticism always leads to such strong reactions from jewish organisations in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grosser praised comments made by joachim gauck -lrb- r . -rrb- at the german book prize it 's exactly the same in france .
one of the people i admire most , the former concentration camp inmate and french ambassador stephane estell - who also worked on the international declaration of human rights - has now travelled to gaza from egypt to see what the situation is like there .
immediately there were complaints , worse than i have had in germany – that he had not really been in the concentration camp , that he had in fact been a spy and so on ...
yes , we do have those reactions as well , at least from a few .
but it is a sensitive issue .
here in germany , of course , political correctness obviously plays a certain role .
i do n't know .
i would cite the former president koehler who in his speech to the israeli knesset - without referring to the palestinians - said that , as a result of its past , germany has the duty to defend human rights across the world .
that is something that is crucial for me and something that we should explain to young people who increasingly distance themselves and ask why they should bear any responsibility .
the responsibility is to learn from the past to defend so that we can defend human rights around the world , including germany .
what sort of reaction are you expecting on november 9 in frankfurt ?
it 's difficult to say .
i think that when i say the word israel , some of the listeners will listen more attentively while others will leave the room .
i have always found that it never comes to a debate .
i constantly try to debate the issues .
for example , at the launch of my last book " von auschwitz nach jerusalem " -lrb- “ from auschwitz to jerusalem ” -rrb- , about germany and israel , i insisted upon inviting jewish congregations in several german cities , but they did not come .
they do not want to debate because they do not want to have to always prove that they are right .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear -pipe- 08.11.2010 mounting disappointments boost anti-nuclear protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence broke out between police and some demonstrators the massive demos along the route of the radioactive waste transport to gorleben have benefitted from other hot spots like stuttgart 21 , a controversial infrastructure project . the ongoing civil disobedience campaign against a train delivery of nuclear waste to a storage facility in gorleben is being reported as one of the biggest of its kind ever in germany .
up to 17,000 policemen , at a cost of up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- , were used over the weekend to keep an estimated 35,000 people from blocking the path of the train , and more demonstrators – along with local farmers - are continuing to arrive to block the path of the road convoy as it continues its journey .
there were varying reports of whether violence had occurred .
the police said that officers had been directly attacked , while protest organizers countered that demonstrators had only sabotaged the tracks .
rainer wendt , head of the police union , said , the officers " proceeded very sensitively , " and " made the right decision – namely to carry the people from the tracks . "
he added that where violence was used against police officers , they reacted " accordingly " and " proportionately . "
dirk seifert , spokesman for the environmental protest group robin wood , told a different story .
" you have to say that the police were disproportionate in their use of tear-gas and pepper spray , " he told deutsche welle .
" the police also hit people who were already lying on the ground , both with their fists as well as truncheons . "
there was also the issue of what happened to those peaceful protesters once they were removed from the tracks .
seifert complained of demonstrators being kept for hours on end in an open field in the cold of the night .
" that is usually called false imprisonment , he said , " the law says people have to be brought to a custodial judge as soon as possible .
that did not happen . "
bildunterschrift : the protests continued throughout the weekend and into monday issues converging what has made this particular demonstration so explosive is the coincidence of this transport of nuclear waste with the government 's decision to overturn former legislation aimed at phasing out nuclear power by around 2020 .
chancellor angela merkel 's conservative coalition of christian democrats and the pro-business free democrats , recently passed a bill through parliament allowing nuclear power stations to remain open another 12 years .
environment minister norbert roettgen has been at pains to separate the issues of lifespan-extension and dealing with nuclear waste .
" we have been using nuclear power for over 40 years , " he said .
" we have created electricity from it and created waste , and we have a responsibility to deal with that – independent of the question of lifespan extension . "
yet seifert is unimpressed with this distinction .
" the fact is that this government has decided to produce even more nuclear waste by extending the life spans of the existing nuclear power stations . "
but some demonstrators arrived at the railway tracks with self-evidently different agendas .
stuttgart 21 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgarters angry about a new railway station have joined the anti-nuclear protests several protestors against the new railway station known as stuttgart 21 were also present , and were celebrated at the podium .
this suggests that the anti-nuclear movement has become a rallying point for many people who feel the current government 's policies are leaving them disenfranchised .
" there is a growing feeling that policies are being made for minorities or a certain clientele , like large corporations , and that this government does not see it as necessary to work for the good of the whole population , " said seifert .
" a lot of people in stuttgart have the feeling that their opinion is not respected – the government is just doing what it wants over the heads of the population . "
opinion polls show that opposition political parties , particularly the greens , are benefitting from this groundswell .
indeed , prominent green party figure claudia roth took part in the weekend 's demonstrations , though politicians were not permitted to speak at the podium .
" we are certainly interested in working together with members of those parties , but the parties have the parliament , and we have the streets , " said seifert .
" we are a social movement and we have to separate the two places of expression . "

looking ahead to this week 's meeting of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- nations in seoul , the former us trade representative said the world needed a new regime to succeed the bretton woods ii system of floating currencies , which has been in place since the fixed-rate currency system linked to gold broke down in 1971 .
although the gold standard helped guard against inflation , it was abandoned because it did not allow for the flexible monetary policy many economists believe is essential in counteracting economic shocks .
" although textbooks may view gold as the old money , markets are using gold as an alternative monetary asset today , " zoellick wrote .
the new system " is likely to need to involve the dollar , the euro , the yen , the pound and a renminbi -lrb- chinese yuan -rrb- that moves towards internationalization and then an open capital account , " he said .
" the system should also consider employing gold as an international reference point of market expectations about inflation , deflation and future currency values . "
currency war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick says the world needs to rethink currency exchange rates zoellick 's comments came amid fears of a so-called " currency war " that would see countries jostle for trade advantage by massaging their exchange rates lower .
the united states has led accusations that china cheats in world trade by artificially weakening its currency .
but china and germany , both major exporters , have complained that washington 's policy of quantitative easing - effectively printing money - is weakening the dollar and harming emerging markets ' competitiveness .
investors are pumping dollars into emerging markets in search of higher yields , and the potentially destabilizing impact of this , along with big current account deficits and china 's reluctance to let the yuan appreciate faster , are set to dominate the g20 summit on thursday and friday .
new structures france , which takes over the g20 chair after this week 's summit , says it plans to work on a new international monetary system to bring greater currency stability .
beijing 's central bank chief has suggested an alternative monetary system based on using the international monetary fund 's special drawing rights , a notional unit of value based on a basket of major currencies , instead of the dollar as the sole global reserve currency .
zoellick said a new monetary system would take time to develop and should be part of a package approach including possible changes in international monetary fund rules to review capital as well as current account policies , and linking imf monetary assessments to world trade organization obligations .
he also called on the g20 to forge structural reforms , including the promotion of domestic demand in china and the reduction of debt in the united states .

up to 17,000 policemen , at a cost of up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- , were used over the weekend to keep an estimated 35,000 people from blocking the path of the train , and more demonstrators – along with local farmers - are continuing to arrive to block the path of the road convoy as it continues its journey .
there were varying reports of whether violence had occurred .
the police said that officers had been directly attacked , while protest organizers countered that demonstrators had only sabotaged the tracks .
rainer wendt , head of the police union , said , the officers " proceeded very sensitively , " and " made the right decision – namely to carry the people from the tracks . "
he added that where violence was used against police officers , they reacted " accordingly " and " proportionately . "
dirk seifert , spokesman for the environmental protest group robin wood , told a different story .
" you have to say that the police were disproportionate in their use of tear-gas and pepper spray , " he told deutsche welle .
" the police also hit people who were already lying on the ground , both with their fists as well as truncheons . "
there was also the issue of what happened to those peaceful protesters once they were removed from the tracks .
seifert complained of demonstrators being kept for hours on end in an open field in the cold of the night .
" that is usually called false imprisonment , he said , " the law says people have to be brought to a custodial judge as soon as possible .
that did not happen . "
bildunterschrift : the protests continued throughout the weekend and into monday issues converging what has made this particular demonstration so explosive is the coincidence of this transport of nuclear waste with the government 's decision to overturn former legislation aimed at phasing out nuclear power by around 2020 .
chancellor angela merkel 's conservative coalition of christian democrats and the pro-business free democrats , recently passed a bill through parliament allowing nuclear power stations to remain open another 12 years .
environment minister norbert roettgen has been at pains to separate the issues of lifespan-extension and dealing with nuclear waste .
" we have been using nuclear power for over 40 years , " he said .
" we have created electricity from it and created waste , and we have a responsibility to deal with that – independent of the question of lifespan extension . "
yet seifert is unimpressed with this distinction .
" the fact is that this government has decided to produce even more nuclear waste by extending the life spans of the existing nuclear power stations . "
but some demonstrators arrived at the railway tracks with self-evidently different agendas .
stuttgart 21 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgarters angry about a new railway station have joined the anti-nuclear protests several protestors against the new railway station known as stuttgart 21 were also present , and were celebrated at the podium .
this suggests that the anti-nuclear movement has become a rallying point for many people who feel the current government 's policies are leaving them disenfranchised .
" there is a growing feeling that policies are being made for minorities or a certain clientele , like large corporations , and that this government does not see it as necessary to work for the good of the whole population , " said seifert .
" a lot of people in stuttgart have the feeling that their opinion is not respected – the government is just doing what it wants over the heads of the population . "
opinion polls show that opposition political parties , particularly the greens , are benefitting from this groundswell .
indeed , prominent green party figure claudia roth took part in the weekend 's demonstrations , though politicians were not permitted to speak at the podium .
" we are certainly interested in working together with members of those parties , but the parties have the parliament , and we have the streets , " said seifert .
" we are a social movement and we have to separate the two places of expression . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de exchange rates -pipe- 08.11.2010 world bank chief calls on g20 to reconsider gold standard großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gold underpinned exchange rates between 1946 and 1971 world bank president robert zoellick has called on bickering g20 nations to bring gold back into the global monetary system as an anchor to guide currency movements . in a commentary published in monday 's financial times , world bank president robert zoellick wrote that an updated gold standard could help retool the world economy amid tensions over currencies and the united states ' monetary policy .
looking ahead to this week 's meeting of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- nations in seoul , the former us trade representative said the world needed a new regime to succeed the bretton woods ii system of floating currencies , which has been in place since the fixed-rate currency system linked to gold broke down in 1971 .
although the gold standard helped guard against inflation , it was abandoned because it did not allow for the flexible monetary policy many economists believe is essential in counteracting economic shocks .
" although textbooks may view gold as the old money , markets are using gold as an alternative monetary asset today , " zoellick wrote .
the new system " is likely to need to involve the dollar , the euro , the yen , the pound and a renminbi -lrb- chinese yuan -rrb- that moves towards internationalization and then an open capital account , " he said .
" the system should also consider employing gold as an international reference point of market expectations about inflation , deflation and future currency values . "
currency war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick says the world needs to rethink currency exchange rates zoellick 's comments came amid fears of a so-called " currency war " that would see countries jostle for trade advantage by massaging their exchange rates lower .
the united states has led accusations that china cheats in world trade by artificially weakening its currency .
but china and germany , both major exporters , have complained that washington 's policy of quantitative easing - effectively printing money - is weakening the dollar and harming emerging markets ' competitiveness .
investors are pumping dollars into emerging markets in search of higher yields , and the potentially destabilizing impact of this , along with big current account deficits and china 's reluctance to let the yuan appreciate faster , are set to dominate the g20 summit on thursday and friday .
new structures france , which takes over the g20 chair after this week 's summit , says it plans to work on a new international monetary system to bring greater currency stability .
beijing 's central bank chief has suggested an alternative monetary system based on using the international monetary fund 's special drawing rights , a notional unit of value based on a basket of major currencies , instead of the dollar as the sole global reserve currency .
zoellick said a new monetary system would take time to develop and should be part of a package approach including possible changes in international monetary fund rules to review capital as well as current account policies , and linking imf monetary assessments to world trade organization obligations .
he also called on the g20 to forge structural reforms , including the promotion of domestic demand in china and the reduction of debt in the united states .

the ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security . interior ministers of the european union 's 27 member states unanimously agreed on monday to eliminate visa requirements for citizens of albania and bosnia-herzegovina .
under the agreement , albanians and bosnians with biometric passports would be able to travel to the 25 eu nations in the border-free schengen zone , which excludes ireland and the united kingdom , for up to three months .
the decision came after france , germany and the netherlands expressed concerns that there could be an increase in unfounded asylum claims from the two countries .
the eu got rid of visa requirements for serbia , montenegro and macedonia late last year , apparently leading to an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia .
european commission could roll back decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has seen an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia the ministers stipulated that the european commission could " propose the suspension of visa-free travel " if it felt that citizens of the two countries were abusing the system .
" it is of the utmost importance that albania and bosnia-herzegovina continue to intensify their information campaign with the aim to properly explain to their citizens the meaning of short-term visa-free travel , " cecilia malmstrom , eu commissioner for home affairs , said in a statement .
" a visa-free regime also comes with responsibilities . "
malmstrom said the european parliament and the bloc 's member states must still approve the proposal , and that it could enter into force as early as mid-december .
it would leave kosovo , whose independence is not recognized by all eu states , as the only balkan country without visa-free travel in the eu .
both bosnia and albania hope to join the eu , but face years of tough democratic reforms before they will likely be able to do so .
stricter rules on cargo security eu interior ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security in the aftermath of a string of eu-bound parcel bombs originating from yemen and greece last week .
for instance , airports with inadequate security measures could appear on a blacklist . german interior minister thomas de maiziere said security concerns should trump fears over extra costs due to increased control procedures . " if this is going to be more expensive , then it might be a little more expensive .
there is no security for free " , de maiziere told reporters before presenting his five key points to his eu colleagues . according to de maiziere , the eu must focus on coordination before halting cargo shipments , agree on which countries are to be considered unsafe freight senders , improve security in those unsafe airports , tighten controls on suspect parcels and define responsibilities between commercial shippers and national authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there is no security for free , " says de maiziere the german proposal was welcomed by belgian interior minister annemie turtelboom who is in charge of chairing the eu meeting . " when we see everything that happened last week , we must really discuss how we can travel together , work together and how we can work together not only with the united states but also with some countries in africa , " she said . spanish interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba called measures on enhancing security coordination " an ever more pressing need " for eu countries . but siim kallas , eu transport commissioner , warned on friday that panic should not lead to an excessive increase of security measures . " the fight against terrorism is eternal , and aviation remains the most sensitive target for such attacks , but panic is not the remedy , " he said .
" we must find a proportionate and adequate response . " de maiziere wants to implement a working group which is due to get results by the end of this year .

the ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security . interior ministers of the european union 's 27 member states unanimously agreed on monday to eliminate visa requirements for citizens of albania and bosnia-herzegovina .
under the agreement , albanians and bosnians with biometric passports would be able to travel to the 25 eu nations in the border-free schengen zone , which excludes ireland and the united kingdom , for up to three months .
the decision came after france , germany and the netherlands expressed concerns that there could be an increase in unfounded asylum claims from the two countries .
the eu got rid of visa requirements for serbia , montenegro and macedonia late last year , apparently leading to an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia .
european commission could roll back decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has seen an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia the ministers stipulated that the european commission could " propose the suspension of visa-free travel " if it felt that citizens of the two countries were abusing the system .
" it is of the utmost importance that albania and bosnia-herzegovina continue to intensify their information campaign with the aim to properly explain to their citizens the meaning of short-term visa-free travel , " cecilia malmstrom , eu commissioner for home affairs , said in a statement .
" a visa-free regime also comes with responsibilities . "
malmstrom said the european parliament and the bloc 's member states must still approve the proposal , and that it could enter into force as early as mid-december .
it would leave kosovo , whose independence is not recognized by all eu states , as the only balkan country without visa-free travel in the eu .
both bosnia and albania hope to join the eu , but face years of tough democratic reforms before they will likely be able to do so .
stricter rules on cargo security eu interior ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security in the aftermath of a string of eu-bound parcel bombs originating from yemen and greece last week .
for instance , airports with inadequate security measures could appear on a blacklist . german interior minister thomas de maiziere said security concerns should trump fears over extra costs due to increased control procedures . " if this is going to be more expensive , then it might be a little more expensive .
there is no security for free " , de maiziere told reporters before presenting his five key points to his eu colleagues . according to de maiziere , the eu must focus on coordination before halting cargo shipments , agree on which countries are to be considered unsafe freight senders , improve security in those unsafe airports , tighten controls on suspect parcels and define responsibilities between commercial shippers and national authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there is no security for free , " says de maiziere the german proposal was welcomed by belgian interior minister annemie turtelboom who is in charge of chairing the eu meeting .

"
his statement , made in an address to members of both of india 's houses of parliament , was greeted with thunderous desk-thumping .
while clearly indicating that any such move lies well in the future , the comment , and the praise-filled speech he gave , was considered by many to be a major sign of growing economic and security ties between india and the united states .
in his speech , obama said the country had established itself as a world power and as a natural ally of the united states on the global stage . he promised the two countries would work as equal partners on projects in afghanistan , as well as broaden their dialogue to include nuclear proliferation and regional security in east asia .

kicking off his visit in mumbai , india 's financial capital , obama pleased the crowd by saying this was his first visit to india but " my longest visit to another country since becoming president . " in mumbai , both the first lady and the president interacted with college students , and the first lady broke into an impromptu dance while meeting students in a primary school during a celebration of the hindu festival of diwali .
promising to remove restrictions on sensitive high-tech exports - a nagging irritant in the evolution of bilateral ties - obama declared deals worth $ 15 billion -lrb- 10.6 billion euros -rrb- that would support some 54,000 american jobs and seek to answer critics back home .
his description of india as a world power set the tone for negotiations with the political leadership in new delhi that saw a raft of commercial deals signed and agreements to cooperate more closely in agriculture , health and energy .

" our nations are the two largest democracies on earth .
we are bound by a common language and common values , shared aspirations and a shared belief that opportunity should be limited only by how hard you are willing to work , only by how hard you are willing to try . "
this sentiment was reciprocated by indian prime minister manmohan singh .
" the new deals that have been struck , they all happen to be in infrastructure .
and infrastructure today is the biggest bottleneck to the faster growth of india , to the faster growth of employment .
and these deals the president has mentioned are truly an example of trade being a win-win situation for both countries . "
alongside singh , obama said while both india and pakistan had an interest in reducing tensions in the region , the us " can not impose a solution to these problems . "
he made it clear that it was up to india and pakistan to settle their differences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama inspected the troops at the presidential palace in new dehli " i am absolutely convinced that it is in both india 's and pakistan 's interest to reduce tensions and that will enable them , i think , to focus on the range of both challenges and opportunities each country faces , " he said .
singh pointed out that he was willing to engage pakistan on all issues including kashmir but not when the terror infrastructure was still intact .
" we are committed to engaging pakistan , we are committed to resolve all outstanding issues between our two countries including the word ' k ' , we are not afraid of that .
but it is our request that you can not simultaneously be talking and at the same time , the terror machine is active as ever before , " he said .

they also repeated calls to free imprisoned opposition leader aung san suu kyi .
however , myanmar 's ally china refused to join the chorus of international disapproval .
the state-owned newspaper global times reported the government considered the controversial polls " a step forward . "
an official statement is still awaited .
statement by us , australia the us , eu , uk , australia and japan all condemned vote as being neither free nor fair . in a joint statement , the us and australia urged the regime 's leaders to ensure that " post-election institutions be transparent , accountable and responsive to their citizens ' aspirations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers say the election results were rigged us president barack obama , speaking on a visit to india on monday , went so far as to accuse the ruling myanmar military junta of stealing the election .
" it is unacceptable to steal an election , as the regime in burma has done again for all the world to see , " he said in a speech at the indian parliament , in which he referred to myanmar by its former name .
obama critiques those who fail to speak out he cited myanmar as an example of a country where a " bankrupt regime " imprisoned opponents and gunned down protesters .
and he shot a barb at his host country when he accused mumbai of failling to speak out sufficiently on the rights of the repressed .
" faced with such gross violations of human rights , it is the responsibility of the international community , especially leaders like the united states and india , to condemn it . "
obama said .
" if i can be frank , in international fora , india has often shied away from these issues , " he added .
ethnic violence erupts at border in the us , secretary of state hillary clinton said her country would uphold " rigorous sanctions " against myanmar 's regime as long as it abuses human rights and holds political prisoners .
independent burmese observers reported widespread allegations of voter intimidation and bribery in the elections , and most international observers had already written off the vote as a sham designed to further entrench miltiary rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy icon aung san suu kyi was sidelined in the election representatives of the military junta 's political arm , the union solidarity and development party -lrb- usdp -rrb- are alleged to have conducted widespread voter coercion , intimidation and vote-buying .
and concerns have been raised about votes being counted away from public or opposition party scrutiny .
meanwhile , as the ballots were counted on monday , violence erupted between government soldiers and ethnic minority karen rebels in the border town of myawaddy .
some 10,000 refugees fled across the border into thailand to escape the post-election fighting .
scales tipped for the military while myanmar officially ended half a century of direct army rule on sunday , a variety of restrictions accompanying the election made a pro-democracy upset virtually impossible .
for instance , 25 percent of parliamentary seats are reserved for the military .
and the government-crafted constitution and skewed election rules heavily favored the military government 's candidates .
that means that for now , myanmar 's military will uphold its power through affiliated parties .
candidates backed by the regime enjoyed substantial financial support and were also accused of intimidating opposing parties .
" for the people of burma , it will mean the return to power of a brutal regime that has pillaged the nation 's resources and overseen widespread human rights abuses , including arbitrary detentions , enforced disappearances , rape and torture , " britain 's foreign secretary william hague said in response to sunday 's election .
china is supportive of regime meanwhile , china 's global times reported the chinese government supported " myanmar 's plan to transform its political system , but knows it will not happen overnight . "
china has long helped economically-dysfunctional myanmar to keep afloat through trade ties , arms sales , and by shielding it from un sanctions over rights abuses as a veto-wielding member of the un security council .
in the first five months of this year , china has invested about $ 8 billion -lrb- 11 billion euros -rrb- in myanmar , which it sees as a strategic ally and important trading partner , especially for its energy-hungry western provinces .
it will likely be many days before official results are released , since the process of vote counting in myanmar is painstaking and slow .

"
his statement , made in an address to members of both of india 's houses of parliament , was greeted with thunderous desk-thumping .
while clearly indicating that any such move lies well in the future , the comment , and the praise-filled speech he gave , was considered by many to be a major sign of growing economic and security ties between india and the united states .
in his speech , obama said the country had established itself as a world power and as a natural ally of the united states on the global stage . he promised the two countries would work as equal partners on projects in afghanistan , as well as broaden their dialogue to include nuclear proliferation and regional security in east asia .
diwali dance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michelle obama danced at a celebration of diwali , the festival of lights overall , obama 's visit to india was seen as a success .
he and his wife , michelle , reached out to sections of the country 's political and business classes , as well as students , villagers and artisans .
kicking off his visit in mumbai , india 's financial capital , obama pleased the crowd by saying this was his first visit to india but " my longest visit to another country since becoming president . " in mumbai , both the first lady and the president interacted with college students , and the first lady broke into an impromptu dance while meeting students in a primary school during a celebration of the hindu festival of diwali .
promising to remove restrictions on sensitive high-tech exports - a nagging irritant in the evolution of bilateral ties - obama declared deals worth $ 15 billion -lrb- 10.6 billion euros -rrb- that would support some 54,000 american jobs and seek to answer critics back home .
his description of india as a world power set the tone for negotiations with the political leadership in new delhi that saw a raft of commercial deals signed and agreements to cooperate more closely in agriculture , health and energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visit to humayun 's tomb in new delhi was part of the program ' defining and indispensible partnership ' " i believe that the relationship between the us and india will be one of the defining and indispensable partnerships of the 21st century , " said obama .
" our nations are the two largest democracies on earth .
we are bound by a common language and common values , shared aspirations and a shared belief that opportunity should be limited only by how hard you are willing to work , only by how hard you are willing to try . "
this sentiment was reciprocated by indian prime minister manmohan singh .
" the new deals that have been struck , they all happen to be in infrastructure .
and infrastructure today is the biggest bottleneck to the faster growth of india , to the faster growth of employment .
and these deals the president has mentioned are truly an example of trade being a win-win situation for both countries . "
alongside singh , obama said while both india and pakistan had an interest in reducing tensions in the region , the us " can not impose a solution to these problems . "
he made it clear that it was up to india and pakistan to settle their differences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama inspected the troops at the presidential palace in new dehli " i am absolutely convinced that it is in both india 's and pakistan 's interest to reduce tensions and that will enable them , i think , to focus on the range of both challenges and opportunities each country faces , " he said .
singh pointed out that he was willing to engage pakistan on all issues including kashmir but not when the terror infrastructure was still intact .
" we are committed to engaging pakistan , we are committed to resolve all outstanding issues between our two countries including the word ' k ' , we are not afraid of that .
but it is our request that you can not simultaneously be talking and at the same time , the terror machine is active as ever before , " he said .
obama continues his 10-day asia trip in indonesia on tuesday , and then travels on to south korea and japan .

the junta has placed the country under a 90-day state of emergency . vote counting in myanmar 's first election in 20 years began monday amid accusations of voter intimidation and fraud as well as condemnation by the international community that the weekend election was neither free nor fair .
as counting of votes got underway , a fire fight erupted between a splinter group of armed forces from the democratic karen buddhist army -lrb- dkba -rrb- and the army in the border town of myawaddy leading to hundreds of people being forced to flee into thailand for safety .
reports also say the government has placed the country under a 90-day state of emergency .
army-backed parties set to sweep polls over 3,000 candidates had stood from 37 parties for national parliament and regional assemblies in sunday 's vote .
but harsh election laws had prevented several parties from taking part including opposition leader , aung san suu kyi 's national league for democracy or nld .

the armed forces are also guaranteed a quarter of parliamentary seats under a 2008 constitution .
ron hoffman , canadian ambassador to thailand and myanmar , said the international community needs to keep pressure on myanmar ’ s military .
" it 's not a democratic exercise .
it does n't even come close to meeting any standard of international electoral processes . "
aung san suu kyi 's detention expires on saturday soe aung , a spokesman for the forum for democracy in burma , says the parliament will have little power but to act as a rubber stamp for the military leaders .
he says the parliament will be dominated by the regime backed candidates after the elections .
" and the parliamentarians will have no other chance but to become a rubber stamp parliament to endorse the executive council or the national security and defence council , by name .
this would be headed by the president and also the commander in chief .
this council will run the country after all . "

if the nobel laureate is freed analysts expect she will face tough restrictions after spending much of the past two decades under detention .

the junta has placed the country under a 90-day state of emergency . vote counting in myanmar 's first election in 20 years began monday amid accusations of voter intimidation and fraud as well as condemnation by the international community that the weekend election was neither free nor fair .
as counting of votes got underway , a fire fight erupted between a splinter group of armed forces from the democratic karen buddhist army -lrb- dkba -rrb- and the army in the border town of myawaddy leading to hundreds of people being forced to flee into thailand for safety .
reports also say the government has placed the country under a 90-day state of emergency .
army-backed parties set to sweep polls over 3,000 candidates had stood from 37 parties for national parliament and regional assemblies in sunday 's vote .
but harsh election laws had prevented several parties from taking part including opposition leader , aung san suu kyi 's national league for democracy or nld .

aung san suu kyi 's detention expires on saturday soe aung , a spokesman for the forum for democracy in burma , says the parliament will have little power but to act as a rubber stamp for the military leaders .
he says the parliament will be dominated by the regime backed candidates after the elections .
" and the parliamentarians will have no other chance but to become a rubber stamp parliament to endorse the executive council or the national security and defence council , by name .
this would be headed by the president and also the commander in chief .
this council will run the country after all . "
bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi in yangon 2009 analysts are now watching whether the military will release aung san suu kyi from detention , expected next saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 08.11.2010 greek striker gekas revives his career at improving frankfurt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gekas made the difference against wolfsburg theofanis gekas is anything but a complete player , but he knows how to do a striker 's main job - score goals .
and this year the crafty greek is reminding opponents just how uncannily efficient he can be . after eleven rounds of play , no one had more goals - 11 in total - than a 30-year-old many bundesliga fans would probably classify as a journeyman .
but ask the man himself and he 'll tell you that goal-getting is an innate ability that 's anything but the norm .
" i started playing football really young , and i was always a striker , " gekas said in interview with the german football league .
" i was born with my scoring ability .
it seems like a gift from god . "
his teammates had another potentially supernatural explanation after gekas scored a brace on saturday .
“ we asked ourselves in the dressing room if he 's sold his soul , ” defender marco russ told the bild newspaper .
“ even his badly taken penalty went in . ”
gekas came to the bundesliga in 2005 on a one-year loan from panathinaikos athens to bochum and promptly won the league scoring title .
his then coach described him as " our life-insurance policy . "
but bochum decided they could not afford the premiums and failed to exercise their right to purchase the greek goal-getter .
it was a bad decision .
bochum became a perennial relegation candidate and now play in the second division .
for his part , gekas moved on to leverkusen , where he never established himself .
although he scored a respectable 11 goals in his first season with his new club , he was often criticized as lacking in work ethic and was loaned out to hertha berlin at the beginning of 2010 .
with hertha also getting relegated , gekas formally returned to leverkusen , before promptly moving on to frankfurt .
his was hardly one of the high-profile signings of the off-season , but now he 's getting a chance to prove that his detractors , if not completely wrong , missed the point .
ice-cold killer bildunterschrift : in addition to his 11 league goals , gekas has scored 2 in the german cup gekas is neither a particularly great dribbler or passer , and he 's never been known to track back and help out on defense .
but he is one of the most prolific poachers the league has seen in recent years .
that 's just the way he described the role of a striker in a recent interview .
" the most important thing is that -lsb- a striker -rsb- has good teammates who are always looking to get him the ball , " gekas told the online portal of the eurosport television network .
" in addition , he needs the talent to get himself in the right position to score goals . "
on teams that fail to utilize his nose for goal , gekas is most conspicuous for the amount of times he 's caught offside .
but on teams that figure out how to employ his particular talent , he can be lethal .
indeed , a tarantino-esque tattoo on gekas ' arm reads " eiskalter vollstrecker , " -lrb- ice-cold killer -rrb- - the nickname he earned at bochum .
understatement , as you 've probably guessed by now , is n't gekas ' strong suit .
" the fact that i did n't score -lsb- for leverkusen and hertha -rsb- was because the people in positions of responsibility did n't trust me , " gekas told the bundesliga .
" but frankfurt coach michael skibbe , whom i know from my time in leverkusen , does have that trust .
that has a direct effect on my game and the number of goals i score . "
instinct and vision bildunterschrift : gekas has been doing all his talking on pitch this season seen negatively , gekas is one-dimensional .
seen positively , he does exactly what he 's supposed to do , hang around in dangerous positions and convert chances as they materialize .
wolfsburg were given a display of the latter qualities , as their trip to frankfurt on saturday ended in a 3-1 defeat .
the hosts ' first goal in that match was archetypal gekas .
the greek striker lurked on the edge of the penalty area , and when a low pass came his way , he took it directly and curled it into the bottom left-hand corner .
the goal was only possible because gekas did n't hesitate or try to control the ball , but rather reacted on instinct .
that 's a quality his coach appreciates .
" there are n't many strikers who can see a situation in advance as well as gekas , " michael skibbe told the bild newspaper earlier this season .
" in the build-up , he follows pass combinations very intensely and then instinctively runs where he expects the ball to be . "
gekas goals may often appear to be lucky , but the numbers argue for his basic quality .
in addition to his achievements in the bundesliga , the striker has scored 20 goals in 51 matches for the greek national team .
gekas officially retired from the greece squad in september , citing " special circumstances . "
few people , if indeed anyone other than the striker himself , knew what he was referring to .
that 's not uncommon with gekas , who , despite playing for years in the bundesliga , says he sees no need to learn german .
and this season , he 's drastically scaled back the number of interviews he 's prepared to give .
but if gekas can keep up anything near his early pace of a goal per game , no one is likely to care about his disinterest in communication .
as he himself might say , a striker 's job is not to make himself understood .
putting the ball in the net speaks louder than words .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 08.11.2010 greek striker gekas revives his career at improving frankfurt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gekas made the difference against wolfsburg theofanis gekas is anything but a complete player , but he knows how to do a striker 's main job - score goals .
and this year the crafty greek is reminding opponents just how uncannily efficient he can be . after eleven rounds of play , no one had more goals - 11 in total - than a 30-year-old many bundesliga fans would probably classify as a journeyman .
but ask the man himself and he 'll tell you that goal-getting is an innate ability that 's anything but the norm .
" i started playing football really young , and i was always a striker , " gekas said in interview with the german football league .
" i was born with my scoring ability .
it seems like a gift from god . "
his teammates had another potentially supernatural explanation after gekas scored a brace on saturday .
“ we asked ourselves in the dressing room if he 's sold his soul , ” defender marco russ told the bild newspaper .
“ even his badly taken penalty went in . ”
gekas came to the bundesliga in 2005 on a one-year loan from panathinaikos athens to bochum and promptly won the league scoring title .
his then coach described him as " our life-insurance policy . "
but bochum decided they could not afford the premiums and failed to exercise their right to purchase the greek goal-getter .
it was a bad decision .
bochum became a perennial relegation candidate and now play in the second division .
for his part , gekas moved on to leverkusen , where he never established himself .
although he scored a respectable 11 goals in his first season with his new club , he was often criticized as lacking in work ethic and was loaned out to hertha berlin at the beginning of 2010 .
with hertha also getting relegated , gekas formally returned to leverkusen , before promptly moving on to frankfurt .
his was hardly one of the high-profile signings of the off-season , but now he 's getting a chance to prove that his detractors , if not completely wrong , missed the point .
ice-cold killer bildunterschrift : in addition to his 11 league goals , gekas has scored 2 in the german cup gekas is neither a particularly great dribbler or passer , and he 's never been known to track back and help out on defense .
but he is one of the most prolific poachers the league has seen in recent years .
that 's just the way he described the role of a striker in a recent interview .
" the most important thing is that -lsb- a striker -rsb- has good teammates who are always looking to get him the ball , " gekas told the online portal of the eurosport television network .
" in addition , he needs the talent to get himself in the right position to score goals . "
on teams that fail to utilize his nose for goal , gekas is most conspicuous for the amount of times he 's caught offside .
but on teams that figure out how to employ his particular talent , he can be lethal .
indeed , a tarantino-esque tattoo on gekas ' arm reads " eiskalter vollstrecker , " -lrb- ice-cold killer -rrb- - the nickname he earned at bochum .
understatement , as you 've probably guessed by now , is n't gekas ' strong suit .
" the fact that i did n't score -lsb- for leverkusen and hertha -rsb- was because the people in positions of responsibility did n't trust me , " gekas told the bundesliga .
" but frankfurt coach michael skibbe , whom i know from my time in leverkusen , does have that trust .
that has a direct effect on my game and the number of goals i score . "
instinct and vision bildunterschrift : gekas has been doing all his talking on pitch this season seen negatively , gekas is one-dimensional .
seen positively , he does exactly what he 's supposed to do , hang around in dangerous positions and convert chances as they materialize .
wolfsburg were given a display of the latter qualities , as their trip to frankfurt on saturday ended in a 3-1 defeat .
the hosts ' first goal in that match was archetypal gekas .
the greek striker lurked on the edge of the penalty area , and when a low pass came his way , he took it directly and curled it into the bottom left-hand corner .
the goal was only possible because gekas did n't hesitate or try to control the ball , but rather reacted on instinct .
that 's a quality his coach appreciates .
" there are n't many strikers who can see a situation in advance as well as gekas , " michael skibbe told the bild newspaper earlier this season .
" in the build-up , he follows pass combinations very intensely and then instinctively runs where he expects the ball to be . "
gekas goals may often appear to be lucky , but the numbers argue for his basic quality .
in addition to his achievements in the bundesliga , the striker has scored 20 goals in 51 matches for the greek national team .
gekas officially retired from the greece squad in september , citing " special circumstances . "
few people , if indeed anyone other than the striker himself , knew what he was referring to .
that 's not uncommon with gekas , who , despite playing for years in the bundesliga , says he sees no need to learn german .
and this season , he 's drastically scaled back the number of interviews he 's prepared to give .
but if gekas can keep up anything near his early pace of a goal per game , no one is likely to care about his disinterest in communication .
as he himself might say , a striker 's job is not to make himself understood .
putting the ball in the net speaks louder than words .

the regulator said it did not view the circumstances of the downstream acquisition as " unacceptable . "
ulitmate goal : leighton the german and australian companies had asked the takeovers panel to intervene in acs ' 2.76 billion euro all-share takeover offer for hochtief on the grounds that leighton was the ultimate target .
hochtief 's stake in leighton is valued at almost as much as the whole of the essen-based construction company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees are concerned about their jobs under a new owner in its submission to the panel , leighton said it was concerned that if acs grabbed hochtief 's stake , minority shareholders in leighton would be disadvantaged and the company would lose the independence it had enjoyed under german stewardship .
but statements by acs to the contrary have prompted both the takeoves panel and leighton to embrace the deal .
acs has contacted leighton and indicated a willingness to enter into a written and binding governance agreement , according to leighton chairman david mortimer .
independence assurance " we are encouraged by the public statements from acs and their direct contact , and intend to actively pursue such an agreement to protect the interests of our minority shareholders , ” mortimer said in a statement .
“ leighton believes the existing governance arrangements , which have been in place for a long period with hochtief , have contributed substantially to the value created for all of leighton 's 67,000 shareholders .
we welcome the opportunity to put in place appropriate and similar governance arrangement with acs . "
in august , acs made a hostile all-share bid to raise its stake in hochtief from 29 percent to 50 percent .
the german construction company , which has been trying to block the takeover ever since , had appealed to the australian regulator in an attempt to force the spanish company into a cash bid for leighton .
hochtief is running out of options .
last week , german economics minister rainer bruederle said that although he would like to see the company 's headquarters remain on german turf , he was not willing to intervene in the market process .
chancellor angela merkel agreed on both counts . author : john blau -lrb- dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 08.11.2010 new urine test is possible breakthrough in diagnosing heart disease großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other diagnosis techniques are more complicated than the urine test heart disease accounts for half of all deaths in europe and costs the european union economy 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 281 billion -rrb- a year .
now , scientists have found a new way to detect heart disease by analyzing urine . according to the european heart network , some 4.3 million europeans die of heart disease every year - half of all deaths , and it is the main cause of death for european women .
the disease is caused when blood vessels are clogged with plaque , made up of protein and fat .
if too much of this builds up , the blood vessel can rupture and blood flow is blocked , causing a heart attack .
when the disease has advanced this far , it can be too late to treat effectively .
most medical officials suggest that cholesterol and blood pressure be monitored regularly , but this is n't always done in practice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heart disease is caused by a build-up of fat and protein in blood vessels however , a new paper , published this month in the journal of hypertension , proposed a new method of potential diagnosing heart disease by analyzing urine .
" we analyzed all the proteins in the urine and asked the question , ' are there distinct differences between patients that have coronary heart disease and those that do not have coronary heart disease ? " ' one of the paper 's authors , harald mischak , a professor of proteomics at the university of glasgow in scotland , told deutsche welle .
protein content the scientists looked at a series of peptides and proteins that are present in plaque build-up in the arteries , including the long protein collagen .
some collagen , along with other proteins , makes its way into the body 's waste system , and is eventually excreted .
researchers were able to isolate the difference in urine samples between hundreds of people with known heart disease and hundreds known not to have it .
they then determined that by scanning for this protein signature , they could use it as a diagnostic tool for yet another set of patients that might be at risk in the future .
mischak added that this also changes the fundamental understanding of what heart disease is .
" i think it is well-justified to see coronary heart disease not as an isolated disease but rather as a systemic vascular disease , " the austrian scientist noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heart disease is connected to obesity and kills several million people a year ' an important step ' dr. bukurt pieske , head of the division of cardiology at the university of graz in austria , said this new method could be a significant improvement .
he added that previous scanning tools , like ecgs or heart biopsies , were more complicated and invasive .
" they have developed a risk score for coronary artery disease or a diagnostic score for coronary heart disease that was better than any previous non-invasive marker for coronary heart disease , " said pieske .
" if this is proven and can be repeated , this would be a big step forward . "
pieske added that , apart from the people who have already shown some symptoms of heart disease , another group could benefit .
" we can identify people at risk who are asymptomatic , who do not know anything about their early stage of the disease and these people are very amenable to preventive measures , to prevent the disease from evolving , " he said .

up to 17,000 policemen , at a cost of up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- , were used over the weekend to keep an estimated 35,000 people from blocking the path of the train , and more demonstrators – along with local farmers - are continuing to arrive to block the path of the road convoy as it continues its journey .
there were varying reports of whether violence had occurred .
the police said that officers had been directly attacked , while protest organizers countered that demonstrators had only sabotaged the tracks .
rainer wendt , head of the police union , said , the officers " proceeded very sensitively , " and " made the right decision – namely to carry the people from the tracks . "
he added that where violence was used against police officers , they reacted " accordingly " and " proportionately . "
dirk seifert , spokesman for the environmental protest group robin wood , told a different story .
" you have to say that the police were disproportionate in their use of tear-gas and pepper spray , " he told deutsche welle .
" the police also hit people who were already lying on the ground , both with their fists as well as truncheons . "
there was also the issue of what happened to those peaceful protesters once they were removed from the tracks .
seifert complained of demonstrators being kept for hours on end in an open field in the cold of the night .
" that is usually called false imprisonment , he said , " the law says people have to be brought to a custodial judge as soon as possible .
that did not happen . "
bildunterschrift : the protests continued throughout the weekend and into monday issues converging what has made this particular demonstration so explosive is the coincidence of this transport of nuclear waste with the government 's decision to overturn former legislation aimed at phasing out nuclear power by around 2020 .
chancellor angela merkel 's conservative coalition of christian democrats and the pro-business free democrats , recently passed a bill through parliament allowing nuclear power stations to remain open another 12 years .
environment minister norbert roettgen has been at pains to separate the issues of lifespan-extension and dealing with nuclear waste .
" we have been using nuclear power for over 40 years , " he said .
" we have created electricity from it and created waste , and we have a responsibility to deal with that – independent of the question of lifespan extension . "
yet seifert is unimpressed with this distinction .
" the fact is that this government has decided to produce even more nuclear waste by extending the life spans of the existing nuclear power stations . "
but some demonstrators arrived at the railway tracks with self-evidently different agendas .
stuttgart 21 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgarters angry about a new railway station have joined the anti-nuclear protests several protestors against the new railway station known as stuttgart 21 were also present , and were celebrated at the podium .
this suggests that the anti-nuclear movement has become a rallying point for many people who feel the current government 's policies are leaving them disenfranchised .
" there is a growing feeling that policies are being made for minorities or a certain clientele , like large corporations , and that this government does not see it as necessary to work for the good of the whole population , " said seifert .
" a lot of people in stuttgart have the feeling that their opinion is not respected – the government is just doing what it wants over the heads of the population . "
opinion polls show that opposition political parties , particularly the greens , are benefitting from this groundswell .
indeed , prominent green party figure claudia roth took part in the weekend 's demonstrations , though politicians were not permitted to speak at the podium .
" we are certainly interested in working together with members of those parties , but the parties have the parliament , and we have the streets , " said seifert .
" we are a social movement and we have to separate the two places of expression . "

the junta has placed the country under a 90-day state of emergency . vote counting in myanmar 's first election in 20 years began monday amid accusations of voter intimidation and fraud as well as condemnation by the international community that the weekend election was neither free nor fair .
as counting of votes got underway , a fire fight erupted between a splinter group of armed forces from the democratic karen buddhist army -lrb- dkba -rrb- and the army in the border town of myawaddy leading to hundreds of people being forced to flee into thailand for safety .
reports also say the government has placed the country under a 90-day state of emergency .
army-backed parties set to sweep polls over 3,000 candidates had stood from 37 parties for national parliament and regional assemblies in sunday 's vote .
but harsh election laws had prevented several parties from taking part including opposition leader , aung san suu kyi 's national league for democracy or nld .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a myanmar soldier gestures while talking with police officers as they provide security during the election parties aligned to the ruling military , union solidarity and development party -lrb- usdp -rrb- and national unity party , were set to win a majority of seats .
the armed forces are also guaranteed a quarter of parliamentary seats under a 2008 constitution .
ron hoffman , canadian ambassador to thailand and myanmar , said the international community needs to keep pressure on myanmar ’ s military .
" it 's not a democratic exercise .
it does n't even come close to meeting any standard of international electoral processes . "
aung san suu kyi 's detention expires on saturday soe aung , a spokesman for the forum for democracy in burma , says the parliament will have little power but to act as a rubber stamp for the military leaders .
he says the parliament will be dominated by the regime backed candidates after the elections .
" and the parliamentarians will have no other chance but to become a rubber stamp parliament to endorse the executive council or the national security and defence council , by name .
this would be headed by the president and also the commander in chief .
this council will run the country after all . "
bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi in yangon 2009 analysts are now watching whether the military will release aung san suu kyi from detention , expected next saturday .
if the nobel laureate is freed analysts expect she will face tough restrictions after spending much of the past two decades under detention .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de exchange rates -pipe- 08.11.2010 world bank chief calls on g20 to reconsider gold standard großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gold underpinned exchange rates between 1946 and 1971 world bank president robert zoellick has called on bickering g20 nations to bring gold back into the global monetary system as an anchor to guide currency movements . in a commentary published in monday 's financial times , world bank president robert zoellick wrote that an updated gold standard could help retool the world economy amid tensions over currencies and the united states ' monetary policy .
looking ahead to this week 's meeting of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- nations in seoul , the former us trade representative said the world needed a new regime to succeed the bretton woods ii system of floating currencies , which has been in place since the fixed-rate currency system linked to gold broke down in 1971 .
although the gold standard helped guard against inflation , it was abandoned because it did not allow for the flexible monetary policy many economists believe is essential in counteracting economic shocks .
" although textbooks may view gold as the old money , markets are using gold as an alternative monetary asset today , " zoellick wrote .
the new system " is likely to need to involve the dollar , the euro , the yen , the pound and a renminbi -lrb- chinese yuan -rrb- that moves towards internationalization and then an open capital account , " he said .
" the system should also consider employing gold as an international reference point of market expectations about inflation , deflation and future currency values . "
currency war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick says the world needs to rethink currency exchange rates zoellick 's comments came amid fears of a so-called " currency war " that would see countries jostle for trade advantage by massaging their exchange rates lower .
the united states has led accusations that china cheats in world trade by artificially weakening its currency .
but china and germany , both major exporters , have complained that washington 's policy of quantitative easing - effectively printing money - is weakening the dollar and harming emerging markets ' competitiveness .
investors are pumping dollars into emerging markets in search of higher yields , and the potentially destabilizing impact of this , along with big current account deficits and china 's reluctance to let the yuan appreciate faster , are set to dominate the g20 summit on thursday and friday .
new structures france , which takes over the g20 chair after this week 's summit , says it plans to work on a new international monetary system to bring greater currency stability .
beijing 's central bank chief has suggested an alternative monetary system based on using the international monetary fund 's special drawing rights , a notional unit of value based on a basket of major currencies , instead of the dollar as the sole global reserve currency .

the last stretch is to be completed on tuesday by trucks , but activists have vowed to block the way . demonstrators , including farmers with tractors , blocked roads as authorities loaded the nuclear waste cargo on trucks for the 20-kilometer trip to the final storage facility at gorleben in northern germany . greenpeace activists used a vehicle concealed as a beer truck to block the semis from delivering their nuclear cargo to its final destination . the 123 tons of nuclear waste have been transported from northern france by rail to the city of dannenberg .
the last stretch to the gorleben site is to be completed by truck as soon as police manage to clear the demonstrators blocking the way . the train journey over the weekend had already been interrupted several times by massive protests along the way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another blockade awaits the nuclear waste in gorleben green party co-chair claudia roth , who took part in a sit-in blocking the streets over the weekend , defended the demonstrations and attacked chancellor angela merkel 's government for its new energy policy , which would extend the lifespan of germany 's 17 nuclear reactors by an average of 12 years . " the coalition government has torn apart a societal consensus , provoking the citizens to action , " she said .
while protests have occurred every time nuclear waste has been transported in germany , roth said it was new " that so many groups are now getting involved " in the protests . change of course in energy policy in an interview with public broadcaster ard on monday , green party parliamentary leader and former environment minister juergen trittin said the growth of the protests was a " clear answer " to the government 's lifespan extension of nuclear reactors , which he called a " multibillion euro present " to the nuclear energy industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trittin called merkel 's energy policy a ' present ' to nuclear energy companies as environment minister , trittin and the center-left government of gerhard schroeder enacted a plan to phase out nuclear energy in germany by 2021 . he also said at that time that green party members should not demonstrate against the transport of nuclear waste - a situation which he said has now changed . " we limited the lifespan of germany 's nuclear reactors , and thus limited the production of nuclear waste , " he said .
" now there will be additional waste produced .
that 's the difference , that 's what people are protesting on the streets - and they 're right to do so .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 08.11.2010 author alfred grosser is controversial choice for kristallnacht speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grosser has been criticized for his views on israel every year on november 9 , st paul 's church in frankfurt commemorates the kristallnacht pogrom of 1938 .
deutsche welle spoke to the controversial writer alfred grosser who has been chosen to give the keynote speech . on november 9 the author alfred grosser is to give a speech in remembrance of the kristallnacht , or the night of broken glass , pogrom against jews in germany carried out under the nazis in 1938 .
the choice of speaker has caused controversy with historians and germany 's central council of jews questioning grosser 's credentials .
grosser comes from a jewish family and emigrated to france with them in 1933 .
the political academic and author of numerous books and essays is seen as an important pioneer in post-war franco-german understanding .
in recent years he has become increasingly interested in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
his 2009 book " von auschwitz nach jerusalem " -lrb- " from auschwitz to jerusalem " -rrb- caused controversy as he dealt with the question of how much it is permissible to question the policies of israel . germany 's central council of jews is not happy , and has written to the mayor of frankfurt to complain that grosser is an inappropriate choice of speaker .
deutsche welle : alfred grosser , you 're french with german and jewish roots .
you were born in 1925 in frankfurt and fled from there to france in 1933 .
now you are to give a speech in the place of your birth at the november 9 memorial .
regardless of the criticism , what were your thoughts and feelings about doing this ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of synagogues and businesses were attacked during kristallnacht alfred grosser : first of all , there is a need to remember this particular day .
since august 1944 in marseille , when i heard that part of my family had been transported to auschwitz , i have been sure that there is no collective german guilt and yet that i also share some responsibility for the future of liberal democracy in germany .
this was my starting point for the speech .
how exactly does one qualify to make such a speech ?
is it for instance through a certain behaviour or membership of some kind of official jewish organisation .
is only a " real " jew allowed to give such a speech ?
you have been accused of distancing yourself from judaism .
that is , at least , what the german historian michael wolffsohn asserts .
what does that have to do with my speech ?
a non-jew could also be chosen make the speech because the speech should also be for all german people .
there is an enormous volume published by raphael gross that documents all the terrible things that happened .
in contrast , there is also the fact that hundreds of non-jewish germans helped jewish germans .
that is something that is always downplayed .
i will also speak about this .
there is no collective guilt .
how , in 2010 , should november 9 be remembered ?
is there a way of doing it , so that it is not simply a ritual repeating the maxim " never again " ?
perhaps i was invited so that it would not become a pure ritual .
but it now seems that a lot of people in germany are upset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli author david grossman won the 2010 german book trade peace prize there are not that many people , let 's not exaggerate .
yes , the general secretary of the jewish organization - he was very upset .
but , david grossman , who this year won the peace prize of the german book trade is someone who constantly criticizes israeli policy and yet , he won that prize .
so , what 's the problem ?
the problem seems to be that you , it is said , have distanced yourself from judaism and have lived in france for a long time .
it is said that someone like grossman , who comes from israel is on more of a position to criticize , even if he does meet with criticism himself in israel for his opinions .
yes , but it is possible to speak freely in israel .
in germany the central council of jews would like it if there were only one single truth .
the american historian fritz stern and the former chancellor helmut schmidt both said that they are amazed that , from organizations here in germany you only hear a case of " right or wrong – my israel . "
during the german book trade presentation ceremony , i was very moved by what joachim gauck , correctly , said .
" my country right or wrong – if it is right , let it keep it right , if it is wrong , let it set it right . "
that means that we should judge each israeli policy accordingly .
you criticize the policies of israel – for example the policy of occupation and the separation wall between israelis and palestinians .
from a french point of view , why do you think such criticism always leads to such strong reactions from jewish organisations in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grosser praised comments made by joachim gauck -lrb- r . -rrb- at the german book prize it 's exactly the same in france .
one of the people i admire most , the former concentration camp inmate and french ambassador stephane estell - who also worked on the international declaration of human rights - has now travelled to gaza from egypt to see what the situation is like there .
immediately there were complaints , worse than i have had in germany – that he had not really been in the concentration camp , that he had in fact been a spy and so on ...
yes , we do have those reactions as well , at least from a few .
but it is a sensitive issue .
here in germany , of course , political correctness obviously plays a certain role .
i do n't know .
i would cite the former president koehler who in his speech to the israeli knesset - without referring to the palestinians - said that , as a result of its past , germany has the duty to defend human rights across the world .
that is something that is crucial for me and something that we should explain to young people who increasingly distance themselves and ask why they should bear any responsibility .
the responsibility is to learn from the past to defend so that we can defend human rights around the world , including germany .
what sort of reaction are you expecting on november 9 in frankfurt ?
it 's difficult to say .
i think that when i say the word israel , some of the listeners will listen more attentively while others will leave the room .
i have always found that it never comes to a debate .
i constantly try to debate the issues .
for example , at the launch of my last book " von auschwitz nach jerusalem " -lrb- “ from auschwitz to jerusalem ” -rrb- , about germany and israel , i insisted upon inviting jewish congregations in several german cities , but they did not come .
they do not want to debate because they do not want to have to always prove that they are right .

"
his statement , made in an address to members of both of india 's houses of parliament , was greeted with thunderous desk-thumping .
while clearly indicating that any such move lies well in the future , the comment , and the praise-filled speech he gave , was considered by many to be a major sign of growing economic and security ties between india and the united states .
in his speech , obama said the country had established itself as a world power and as a natural ally of the united states on the global stage . he promised the two countries would work as equal partners on projects in afghanistan , as well as broaden their dialogue to include nuclear proliferation and regional security in east asia .

promising to remove restrictions on sensitive high-tech exports - a nagging irritant in the evolution of bilateral ties - obama declared deals worth $ 15 billion -lrb- 10.6 billion euros -rrb- that would support some 54,000 american jobs and seek to answer critics back home .

" we are committed to engaging pakistan , we are committed to resolve all outstanding issues between our two countries including the word ' k ' , we are not afraid of that .

the regulator said it did not view the circumstances of the downstream acquisition as " unacceptable . "
ulitmate goal : leighton the german and australian companies had asked the takeovers panel to intervene in acs ' 2.76 billion euro all-share takeover offer for hochtief on the grounds that leighton was the ultimate target .
hochtief 's stake in leighton is valued at almost as much as the whole of the essen-based construction company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees are concerned about their jobs under a new owner in its submission to the panel , leighton said it was concerned that if acs grabbed hochtief 's stake , minority shareholders in leighton would be disadvantaged and the company would lose the independence it had enjoyed under german stewardship .
but statements by acs to the contrary have prompted both the takeoves panel and leighton to embrace the deal .
acs has contacted leighton and indicated a willingness to enter into a written and binding governance agreement , according to leighton chairman david mortimer .
independence assurance " we are encouraged by the public statements from acs and their direct contact , and intend to actively pursue such an agreement to protect the interests of our minority shareholders , ” mortimer said in a statement .
“ leighton believes the existing governance arrangements , which have been in place for a long period with hochtief , have contributed substantially to the value created for all of leighton 's 67,000 shareholders .
we welcome the opportunity to put in place appropriate and similar governance arrangement with acs . "
in august , acs made a hostile all-share bid to raise its stake in hochtief from 29 percent to 50 percent .
the german construction company , which has been trying to block the takeover ever since , had appealed to the australian regulator in an attempt to force the spanish company into a cash bid for leighton .
hochtief is running out of options .
last week , german economics minister rainer bruederle said that although he would like to see the company 's headquarters remain on german turf , he was not willing to intervene in the market process .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 08.11.2010 greek striker gekas revives his career at improving frankfurt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gekas made the difference against wolfsburg theofanis gekas is anything but a complete player , but he knows how to do a striker 's main job - score goals .
and this year the crafty greek is reminding opponents just how uncannily efficient he can be . after eleven rounds of play , no one had more goals - 11 in total - than a 30-year-old many bundesliga fans would probably classify as a journeyman .
but ask the man himself and he 'll tell you that goal-getting is an innate ability that 's anything but the norm .
" i started playing football really young , and i was always a striker , " gekas said in interview with the german football league .
" i was born with my scoring ability .
it seems like a gift from god . "
his teammates had another potentially supernatural explanation after gekas scored a brace on saturday .
“ we asked ourselves in the dressing room if he 's sold his soul , ” defender marco russ told the bild newspaper .
“ even his badly taken penalty went in . ”
gekas came to the bundesliga in 2005 on a one-year loan from panathinaikos athens to bochum and promptly won the league scoring title .
his then coach described him as " our life-insurance policy . "
but bochum decided they could not afford the premiums and failed to exercise their right to purchase the greek goal-getter .
it was a bad decision .
bochum became a perennial relegation candidate and now play in the second division .
for his part , gekas moved on to leverkusen , where he never established himself .
although he scored a respectable 11 goals in his first season with his new club , he was often criticized as lacking in work ethic and was loaned out to hertha berlin at the beginning of 2010 .
with hertha also getting relegated , gekas formally returned to leverkusen , before promptly moving on to frankfurt .
his was hardly one of the high-profile signings of the off-season , but now he 's getting a chance to prove that his detractors , if not completely wrong , missed the point .
ice-cold killer bildunterschrift : in addition to his 11 league goals , gekas has scored 2 in the german cup gekas is neither a particularly great dribbler or passer , and he 's never been known to track back and help out on defense .
but he is one of the most prolific poachers the league has seen in recent years .
that 's just the way he described the role of a striker in a recent interview .
" the most important thing is that -lsb- a striker -rsb- has good teammates who are always looking to get him the ball , " gekas told the online portal of the eurosport television network .
" in addition , he needs the talent to get himself in the right position to score goals . "
on teams that fail to utilize his nose for goal , gekas is most conspicuous for the amount of times he 's caught offside .
but on teams that figure out how to employ his particular talent , he can be lethal .
indeed , a tarantino-esque tattoo on gekas ' arm reads " eiskalter vollstrecker , " -lrb- ice-cold killer -rrb- - the nickname he earned at bochum .
understatement , as you 've probably guessed by now , is n't gekas ' strong suit .
" the fact that i did n't score -lsb- for leverkusen and hertha -rsb- was because the people in positions of responsibility did n't trust me , " gekas told the bundesliga .
" but frankfurt coach michael skibbe , whom i know from my time in leverkusen , does have that trust .
that has a direct effect on my game and the number of goals i score . "
instinct and vision bildunterschrift : gekas has been doing all his talking on pitch this season seen negatively , gekas is one-dimensional .
seen positively , he does exactly what he 's supposed to do , hang around in dangerous positions and convert chances as they materialize .
wolfsburg were given a display of the latter qualities , as their trip to frankfurt on saturday ended in a 3-1 defeat .
the hosts ' first goal in that match was archetypal gekas .
the greek striker lurked on the edge of the penalty area , and when a low pass came his way , he took it directly and curled it into the bottom left-hand corner .
the goal was only possible because gekas did n't hesitate or try to control the ball , but rather reacted on instinct .
that 's a quality his coach appreciates .
" there are n't many strikers who can see a situation in advance as well as gekas , " michael skibbe told the bild newspaper earlier this season .
" in the build-up , he follows pass combinations very intensely and then instinctively runs where he expects the ball to be . "
gekas goals may often appear to be lucky , but the numbers argue for his basic quality .
in addition to his achievements in the bundesliga , the striker has scored 20 goals in 51 matches for the greek national team .
gekas officially retired from the greece squad in september , citing " special circumstances . "
few people , if indeed anyone other than the striker himself , knew what he was referring to .
that 's not uncommon with gekas , who , despite playing for years in the bundesliga , says he sees no need to learn german .
and this season , he 's drastically scaled back the number of interviews he 's prepared to give .
but if gekas can keep up anything near his early pace of a goal per game , no one is likely to care about his disinterest in communication .
as he himself might say , a striker 's job is not to make himself understood .
putting the ball in the net speaks louder than words .

but ask the man himself and he 'll tell you that goal-getting is an innate ability that 's anything but the norm .
" i started playing football really young , and i was always a striker , " gekas said in interview with the german football league .
" i was born with my scoring ability .
it seems like a gift from god . "
his teammates had another potentially supernatural explanation after gekas scored a brace on saturday .
“ we asked ourselves in the dressing room if he 's sold his soul , ” defender marco russ told the bild newspaper .
“ even his badly taken penalty went in . ”
gekas came to the bundesliga in 2005 on a one-year loan from panathinaikos athens to bochum and promptly won the league scoring title .
his then coach described him as " our life-insurance policy . "
but bochum decided they could not afford the premiums and failed to exercise their right to purchase the greek goal-getter .
it was a bad decision .
bochum became a perennial relegation candidate and now play in the second division .
for his part , gekas moved on to leverkusen , where he never established himself .
although he scored a respectable 11 goals in his first season with his new club , he was often criticized as lacking in work ethic and was loaned out to hertha berlin at the beginning of 2010 .
with hertha also getting relegated , gekas formally returned to leverkusen , before promptly moving on to frankfurt .
his was hardly one of the high-profile signings of the off-season , but now he 's getting a chance to prove that his detractors , if not completely wrong , missed the point .
ice-cold killer bildunterschrift : in addition to his 11 league goals , gekas has scored 2 in the german cup gekas is neither a particularly great dribbler or passer , and he 's never been known to track back and help out on defense .
but he is one of the most prolific poachers the league has seen in recent years .
that 's just the way he described the role of a striker in a recent interview .
" the most important thing is that -lsb- a striker -rsb- has good teammates who are always looking to get him the ball , " gekas told the online portal of the eurosport television network .
" in addition , he needs the talent to get himself in the right position to score goals . "
on teams that fail to utilize his nose for goal , gekas is most conspicuous for the amount of times he 's caught offside .
but on teams that figure out how to employ his particular talent , he can be lethal .
indeed , a tarantino-esque tattoo on gekas ' arm reads " eiskalter vollstrecker , " -lrb- ice-cold killer -rrb- - the nickname he earned at bochum .
understatement , as you 've probably guessed by now , is n't gekas ' strong suit .
" the fact that i did n't score -lsb- for leverkusen and hertha -rsb- was because the people in positions of responsibility did n't trust me , " gekas told the bundesliga .
" but frankfurt coach michael skibbe , whom i know from my time in leverkusen , does have that trust .
that has a direct effect on my game and the number of goals i score . "
instinct and vision bildunterschrift : gekas has been doing all his talking on pitch this season seen negatively , gekas is one-dimensional .
seen positively , he does exactly what he 's supposed to do , hang around in dangerous positions and convert chances as they materialize .
wolfsburg were given a display of the latter qualities , as their trip to frankfurt on saturday ended in a 3-1 defeat .
the hosts ' first goal in that match was archetypal gekas .
the greek striker lurked on the edge of the penalty area , and when a low pass came his way , he took it directly and curled it into the bottom left-hand corner .
the goal was only possible because gekas did n't hesitate or try to control the ball , but rather reacted on instinct .
that 's a quality his coach appreciates .
" there are n't many strikers who can see a situation in advance as well as gekas , " michael skibbe told the bild newspaper earlier this season .
" in the build-up , he follows pass combinations very intensely and then instinctively runs where he expects the ball to be . "
gekas goals may often appear to be lucky , but the numbers argue for his basic quality .
in addition to his achievements in the bundesliga , the striker has scored 20 goals in 51 matches for the greek national team .
gekas officially retired from the greece squad in september , citing " special circumstances . "
few people , if indeed anyone other than the striker himself , knew what he was referring to .
that 's not uncommon with gekas , who , despite playing for years in the bundesliga , says he sees no need to learn german .
and this season , he 's drastically scaled back the number of interviews he 's prepared to give .
but if gekas can keep up anything near his early pace of a goal per game , no one is likely to care about his disinterest in communication .
as he himself might say , a striker 's job is not to make himself understood .
putting the ball in the net speaks louder than words .

looking ahead to this week 's meeting of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- nations in seoul , the former us trade representative said the world needed a new regime to succeed the bretton woods ii system of floating currencies , which has been in place since the fixed-rate currency system linked to gold broke down in 1971 .
although the gold standard helped guard against inflation , it was abandoned because it did not allow for the flexible monetary policy many economists believe is essential in counteracting economic shocks .
" although textbooks may view gold as the old money , markets are using gold as an alternative monetary asset today , " zoellick wrote .
the new system " is likely to need to involve the dollar , the euro , the yen , the pound and a renminbi -lrb- chinese yuan -rrb- that moves towards internationalization and then an open capital account , " he said .
" the system should also consider employing gold as an international reference point of market expectations about inflation , deflation and future currency values . "
currency war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick says the world needs to rethink currency exchange rates zoellick 's comments came amid fears of a so-called " currency war " that would see countries jostle for trade advantage by massaging their exchange rates lower .
the united states has led accusations that china cheats in world trade by artificially weakening its currency .
but china and germany , both major exporters , have complained that washington 's policy of quantitative easing - effectively printing money - is weakening the dollar and harming emerging markets ' competitiveness .
investors are pumping dollars into emerging markets in search of higher yields , and the potentially destabilizing impact of this , along with big current account deficits and china 's reluctance to let the yuan appreciate faster , are set to dominate the g20 summit on thursday and friday .
new structures france , which takes over the g20 chair after this week 's summit , says it plans to work on a new international monetary system to bring greater currency stability .
beijing 's central bank chief has suggested an alternative monetary system based on using the international monetary fund 's special drawing rights , a notional unit of value based on a basket of major currencies , instead of the dollar as the sole global reserve currency .
zoellick said a new monetary system would take time to develop and should be part of a package approach including possible changes in international monetary fund rules to review capital as well as current account policies , and linking imf monetary assessments to world trade organization obligations .
he also called on the g20 to forge structural reforms , including the promotion of domestic demand in china and the reduction of debt in the united states .

obama critiques those who fail to speak out he cited myanmar as an example of a country where a " bankrupt regime " imprisoned opponents and gunned down protesters .
and he shot a barb at his host country when he accused mumbai of failling to speak out sufficiently on the rights of the repressed .
" faced with such gross violations of human rights , it is the responsibility of the international community , especially leaders like the united states and india , to condemn it . "
obama said .
" if i can be frank , in international fora , india has often shied away from these issues , " he added .
ethnic violence erupts at border in the us , secretary of state hillary clinton said her country would uphold " rigorous sanctions " against myanmar 's regime as long as it abuses human rights and holds political prisoners .
independent burmese observers reported widespread allegations of voter intimidation and bribery in the elections , and most international observers had already written off the vote as a sham designed to further entrench miltiary rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy icon aung san suu kyi was sidelined in the election representatives of the military junta 's political arm , the union solidarity and development party -lrb- usdp -rrb- are alleged to have conducted widespread voter coercion , intimidation and vote-buying .
and concerns have been raised about votes being counted away from public or opposition party scrutiny .
meanwhile , as the ballots were counted on monday , violence erupted between government soldiers and ethnic minority karen rebels in the border town of myawaddy .
some 10,000 refugees fled across the border into thailand to escape the post-election fighting .
scales tipped for the military while myanmar officially ended half a century of direct army rule on sunday , a variety of restrictions accompanying the election made a pro-democracy upset virtually impossible .
for instance , 25 percent of parliamentary seats are reserved for the military .
and the government-crafted constitution and skewed election rules heavily favored the military government 's candidates .
that means that for now , myanmar 's military will uphold its power through affiliated parties .
candidates backed by the regime enjoyed substantial financial support and were also accused of intimidating opposing parties .
" for the people of burma , it will mean the return to power of a brutal regime that has pillaged the nation 's resources and overseen widespread human rights abuses , including arbitrary detentions , enforced disappearances , rape and torture , " britain 's foreign secretary william hague said in response to sunday 's election .
china is supportive of regime meanwhile , china 's global times reported the chinese government supported " myanmar 's plan to transform its political system , but knows it will not happen overnight . "
china has long helped economically-dysfunctional myanmar to keep afloat through trade ties , arms sales , and by shielding it from un sanctions over rights abuses as a veto-wielding member of the un security council .
in the first five months of this year , china has invested about $ 8 billion -lrb- 11 billion euros -rrb- in myanmar , which it sees as a strategic ally and important trading partner , especially for its energy-hungry western provinces .
it will likely be many days before official results are released , since the process of vote counting in myanmar is painstaking and slow .

the ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security . interior ministers of the european union 's 27 member states unanimously agreed on monday to eliminate visa requirements for citizens of albania and bosnia-herzegovina .
under the agreement , albanians and bosnians with biometric passports would be able to travel to the 25 eu nations in the border-free schengen zone , which excludes ireland and the united kingdom , for up to three months .
the decision came after france , germany and the netherlands expressed concerns that there could be an increase in unfounded asylum claims from the two countries .
the eu got rid of visa requirements for serbia , montenegro and macedonia late last year , apparently leading to an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia .
european commission could roll back decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has seen an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia the ministers stipulated that the european commission could " propose the suspension of visa-free travel " if it felt that citizens of the two countries were abusing the system .
" it is of the utmost importance that albania and bosnia-herzegovina continue to intensify their information campaign with the aim to properly explain to their citizens the meaning of short-term visa-free travel , " cecilia malmstrom , eu commissioner for home affairs , said in a statement .
" a visa-free regime also comes with responsibilities . "
malmstrom said the european parliament and the bloc 's member states must still approve the proposal , and that it could enter into force as early as mid-december .
it would leave kosovo , whose independence is not recognized by all eu states , as the only balkan country without visa-free travel in the eu .
both bosnia and albania hope to join the eu , but face years of tough democratic reforms before they will likely be able to do so .
stricter rules on cargo security eu interior ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security in the aftermath of a string of eu-bound parcel bombs originating from yemen and greece last week .
for instance , airports with inadequate security measures could appear on a blacklist . german interior minister thomas de maiziere said security concerns should trump fears over extra costs due to increased control procedures . " if this is going to be more expensive , then it might be a little more expensive .
there is no security for free " , de maiziere told reporters before presenting his five key points to his eu colleagues . according to de maiziere , the eu must focus on coordination before halting cargo shipments , agree on which countries are to be considered unsafe freight senders , improve security in those unsafe airports , tighten controls on suspect parcels and define responsibilities between commercial shippers and national authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there is no security for free , " says de maiziere the german proposal was welcomed by belgian interior minister annemie turtelboom who is in charge of chairing the eu meeting . " when we see everything that happened last week , we must really discuss how we can travel together , work together and how we can work together not only with the united states but also with some countries in africa , " she said . spanish interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba called measures on enhancing security coordination " an ever more pressing need " for eu countries . but siim kallas , eu transport commissioner , warned on friday that panic should not lead to an excessive increase of security measures . " the fight against terrorism is eternal , and aviation remains the most sensitive target for such attacks , but panic is not the remedy , " he said .
" we must find a proportionate and adequate response . " de maiziere wants to implement a working group which is due to get results by the end of this year .

the ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security . interior ministers of the european union 's 27 member states unanimously agreed on monday to eliminate visa requirements for citizens of albania and bosnia-herzegovina .
under the agreement , albanians and bosnians with biometric passports would be able to travel to the 25 eu nations in the border-free schengen zone , which excludes ireland and the united kingdom , for up to three months .
the decision came after france , germany and the netherlands expressed concerns that there could be an increase in unfounded asylum claims from the two countries .
the eu got rid of visa requirements for serbia , montenegro and macedonia late last year , apparently leading to an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia .
european commission could roll back decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has seen an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia the ministers stipulated that the european commission could " propose the suspension of visa-free travel " if it felt that citizens of the two countries were abusing the system .
" it is of the utmost importance that albania and bosnia-herzegovina continue to intensify their information campaign with the aim to properly explain to their citizens the meaning of short-term visa-free travel , " cecilia malmstrom , eu commissioner for home affairs , said in a statement .
" a visa-free regime also comes with responsibilities . "
malmstrom said the european parliament and the bloc 's member states must still approve the proposal , and that it could enter into force as early as mid-december .
it would leave kosovo , whose independence is not recognized by all eu states , as the only balkan country without visa-free travel in the eu .
both bosnia and albania hope to join the eu , but face years of tough democratic reforms before they will likely be able to do so .
stricter rules on cargo security eu interior ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security in the aftermath of a string of eu-bound parcel bombs originating from yemen and greece last week .
for instance , airports with inadequate security measures could appear on a blacklist . german interior minister thomas de maiziere said security concerns should trump fears over extra costs due to increased control procedures . " if this is going to be more expensive , then it might be a little more expensive .
there is no security for free " , de maiziere told reporters before presenting his five key points to his eu colleagues . according to de maiziere , the eu must focus on coordination before halting cargo shipments , agree on which countries are to be considered unsafe freight senders , improve security in those unsafe airports , tighten controls on suspect parcels and define responsibilities between commercial shippers and national authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there is no security for free , " says de maiziere the german proposal was welcomed by belgian interior minister annemie turtelboom who is in charge of chairing the eu meeting .

now , scientists have found a new way to detect heart disease by analyzing urine . according to the european heart network , some 4.3 million europeans die of heart disease every year - half of all deaths , and it is the main cause of death for european women .
the disease is caused when blood vessels are clogged with plaque , made up of protein and fat .
if too much of this builds up , the blood vessel can rupture and blood flow is blocked , causing a heart attack .
when the disease has advanced this far , it can be too late to treat effectively .
most medical officials suggest that cholesterol and blood pressure be monitored regularly , but this is n't always done in practice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heart disease is caused by a build-up of fat and protein in blood vessels however , a new paper , published this month in the journal of hypertension , proposed a new method of potential diagnosing heart disease by analyzing urine .
" we analyzed all the proteins in the urine and asked the question , ' are there distinct differences between patients that have coronary heart disease and those that do not have coronary heart disease ? " ' one of the paper 's authors , harald mischak , a professor of proteomics at the university of glasgow in scotland , told deutsche welle .
protein content the scientists looked at a series of peptides and proteins that are present in plaque build-up in the arteries , including the long protein collagen .
some collagen , along with other proteins , makes its way into the body 's waste system , and is eventually excreted .
researchers were able to isolate the difference in urine samples between hundreds of people with known heart disease and hundreds known not to have it .
they then determined that by scanning for this protein signature , they could use it as a diagnostic tool for yet another set of patients that might be at risk in the future .
mischak added that this also changes the fundamental understanding of what heart disease is .
" i think it is well-justified to see coronary heart disease not as an isolated disease but rather as a systemic vascular disease , " the austrian scientist noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heart disease is connected to obesity and kills several million people a year ' an important step ' dr. bukurt pieske , head of the division of cardiology at the university of graz in austria , said this new method could be a significant improvement .
he added that previous scanning tools , like ecgs or heart biopsies , were more complicated and invasive .
" they have developed a risk score for coronary artery disease or a diagnostic score for coronary heart disease that was better than any previous non-invasive marker for coronary heart disease , " said pieske .
" if this is proven and can be repeated , this would be a big step forward . "
pieske added that , apart from the people who have already shown some symptoms of heart disease , another group could benefit .
" we can identify people at risk who are asymptomatic , who do not know anything about their early stage of the disease and these people are very amenable to preventive measures , to prevent the disease from evolving , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 08.11.2010 author alfred grosser is controversial choice for kristallnacht speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grosser has been criticized for his views on israel every year on november 9 , st paul 's church in frankfurt commemorates the kristallnacht pogrom of 1938 .
deutsche welle spoke to the controversial writer alfred grosser who has been chosen to give the keynote speech . on november 9 the author alfred grosser is to give a speech in remembrance of the kristallnacht , or the night of broken glass , pogrom against jews in germany carried out under the nazis in 1938 .
the choice of speaker has caused controversy with historians and germany 's central council of jews questioning grosser 's credentials .
grosser comes from a jewish family and emigrated to france with them in 1933 .
the political academic and author of numerous books and essays is seen as an important pioneer in post-war franco-german understanding .
in recent years he has become increasingly interested in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
his 2009 book " von auschwitz nach jerusalem " -lrb- " from auschwitz to jerusalem " -rrb- caused controversy as he dealt with the question of how much it is permissible to question the policies of israel . germany 's central council of jews is not happy , and has written to the mayor of frankfurt to complain that grosser is an inappropriate choice of speaker .
deutsche welle : alfred grosser , you 're french with german and jewish roots .
you were born in 1925 in frankfurt and fled from there to france in 1933 .
now you are to give a speech in the place of your birth at the november 9 memorial .
regardless of the criticism , what were your thoughts and feelings about doing this ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of synagogues and businesses were attacked during kristallnacht alfred grosser : first of all , there is a need to remember this particular day .
since august 1944 in marseille , when i heard that part of my family had been transported to auschwitz , i have been sure that there is no collective german guilt and yet that i also share some responsibility for the future of liberal democracy in germany .
this was my starting point for the speech .
how exactly does one qualify to make such a speech ?
is it for instance through a certain behaviour or membership of some kind of official jewish organisation .
is only a " real " jew allowed to give such a speech ?
you have been accused of distancing yourself from judaism .
that is , at least , what the german historian michael wolffsohn asserts .
what does that have to do with my speech ?
a non-jew could also be chosen make the speech because the speech should also be for all german people .
there is an enormous volume published by raphael gross that documents all the terrible things that happened .
in contrast , there is also the fact that hundreds of non-jewish germans helped jewish germans .
that is something that is always downplayed .
i will also speak about this .
there is no collective guilt .
how , in 2010 , should november 9 be remembered ?
is there a way of doing it , so that it is not simply a ritual repeating the maxim " never again " ?
perhaps i was invited so that it would not become a pure ritual .
but it now seems that a lot of people in germany are upset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli author david grossman won the 2010 german book trade peace prize there are not that many people , let 's not exaggerate .
yes , the general secretary of the jewish organization - he was very upset .
but , david grossman , who this year won the peace prize of the german book trade is someone who constantly criticizes israeli policy and yet , he won that prize .
so , what 's the problem ?
the problem seems to be that you , it is said , have distanced yourself from judaism and have lived in france for a long time .
it is said that someone like grossman , who comes from israel is on more of a position to criticize , even if he does meet with criticism himself in israel for his opinions .
yes , but it is possible to speak freely in israel .
in germany the central council of jews would like it if there were only one single truth .
the american historian fritz stern and the former chancellor helmut schmidt both said that they are amazed that , from organizations here in germany you only hear a case of " right or wrong – my israel . "
during the german book trade presentation ceremony , i was very moved by what joachim gauck , correctly , said .
" my country right or wrong – if it is right , let it keep it right , if it is wrong , let it set it right . "
that means that we should judge each israeli policy accordingly .
you criticize the policies of israel – for example the policy of occupation and the separation wall between israelis and palestinians .
from a french point of view , why do you think such criticism always leads to such strong reactions from jewish organisations in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grosser praised comments made by joachim gauck -lrb- r . -rrb- at the german book prize it 's exactly the same in france .
one of the people i admire most , the former concentration camp inmate and french ambassador stephane estell - who also worked on the international declaration of human rights - has now travelled to gaza from egypt to see what the situation is like there .
immediately there were complaints , worse than i have had in germany – that he had not really been in the concentration camp , that he had in fact been a spy and so on ...
yes , we do have those reactions as well , at least from a few .
but it is a sensitive issue .
here in germany , of course , political correctness obviously plays a certain role .
i do n't know .
i would cite the former president koehler who in his speech to the israeli knesset - without referring to the palestinians - said that , as a result of its past , germany has the duty to defend human rights across the world .
that is something that is crucial for me and something that we should explain to young people who increasingly distance themselves and ask why they should bear any responsibility .
the responsibility is to learn from the past to defend so that we can defend human rights around the world , including germany .
what sort of reaction are you expecting on november 9 in frankfurt ?
it 's difficult to say .
i think that when i say the word israel , some of the listeners will listen more attentively while others will leave the room .
i have always found that it never comes to a debate .
i constantly try to debate the issues .
for example , at the launch of my last book " von auschwitz nach jerusalem " -lrb- “ from auschwitz to jerusalem ” -rrb- , about germany and israel , i insisted upon inviting jewish congregations in several german cities , but they did not come .
they do not want to debate because they do not want to have to always prove that they are right .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear -pipe- 08.11.2010 mounting disappointments boost anti-nuclear protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence broke out between police and some demonstrators the massive demos along the route of the radioactive waste transport to gorleben have benefitted from other hot spots like stuttgart 21 , a controversial infrastructure project . the ongoing civil disobedience campaign against a train delivery of nuclear waste to a storage facility in gorleben is being reported as one of the biggest of its kind ever in germany .
up to 17,000 policemen , at a cost of up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- , were used over the weekend to keep an estimated 35,000 people from blocking the path of the train , and more demonstrators – along with local farmers - are continuing to arrive to block the path of the road convoy as it continues its journey .
there were varying reports of whether violence had occurred .
the police said that officers had been directly attacked , while protest organizers countered that demonstrators had only sabotaged the tracks .
rainer wendt , head of the police union , said , the officers " proceeded very sensitively , " and " made the right decision – namely to carry the people from the tracks . "
he added that where violence was used against police officers , they reacted " accordingly " and " proportionately . "
dirk seifert , spokesman for the environmental protest group robin wood , told a different story .
" you have to say that the police were disproportionate in their use of tear-gas and pepper spray , " he told deutsche welle .
" the police also hit people who were already lying on the ground , both with their fists as well as truncheons . "
there was also the issue of what happened to those peaceful protesters once they were removed from the tracks .
seifert complained of demonstrators being kept for hours on end in an open field in the cold of the night .
" that is usually called false imprisonment , he said , " the law says people have to be brought to a custodial judge as soon as possible .
that did not happen . "
bildunterschrift : the protests continued throughout the weekend and into monday issues converging what has made this particular demonstration so explosive is the coincidence of this transport of nuclear waste with the government 's decision to overturn former legislation aimed at phasing out nuclear power by around 2020 .
chancellor angela merkel 's conservative coalition of christian democrats and the pro-business free democrats , recently passed a bill through parliament allowing nuclear power stations to remain open another 12 years .
environment minister norbert roettgen has been at pains to separate the issues of lifespan-extension and dealing with nuclear waste .
" we have been using nuclear power for over 40 years , " he said .
" we have created electricity from it and created waste , and we have a responsibility to deal with that – independent of the question of lifespan extension . "
yet seifert is unimpressed with this distinction .
" the fact is that this government has decided to produce even more nuclear waste by extending the life spans of the existing nuclear power stations . "
but some demonstrators arrived at the railway tracks with self-evidently different agendas .
stuttgart 21 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgarters angry about a new railway station have joined the anti-nuclear protests several protestors against the new railway station known as stuttgart 21 were also present , and were celebrated at the podium .
this suggests that the anti-nuclear movement has become a rallying point for many people who feel the current government 's policies are leaving them disenfranchised .
" there is a growing feeling that policies are being made for minorities or a certain clientele , like large corporations , and that this government does not see it as necessary to work for the good of the whole population , " said seifert .
" a lot of people in stuttgart have the feeling that their opinion is not respected – the government is just doing what it wants over the heads of the population . "
opinion polls show that opposition political parties , particularly the greens , are benefitting from this groundswell .
indeed , prominent green party figure claudia roth took part in the weekend 's demonstrations , though politicians were not permitted to speak at the podium .
" we are certainly interested in working together with members of those parties , but the parties have the parliament , and we have the streets , " said seifert .
" we are a social movement and we have to separate the two places of expression . "

up to 17,000 policemen , at a cost of up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- , were used over the weekend to keep an estimated 35,000 people from blocking the path of the train , and more demonstrators – along with local farmers - are continuing to arrive to block the path of the road convoy as it continues its journey .
there were varying reports of whether violence had occurred .
the police said that officers had been directly attacked , while protest organizers countered that demonstrators had only sabotaged the tracks .
rainer wendt , head of the police union , said , the officers " proceeded very sensitively , " and " made the right decision – namely to carry the people from the tracks . "
he added that where violence was used against police officers , they reacted " accordingly " and " proportionately . "
dirk seifert , spokesman for the environmental protest group robin wood , told a different story .
" you have to say that the police were disproportionate in their use of tear-gas and pepper spray , " he told deutsche welle .
" the police also hit people who were already lying on the ground , both with their fists as well as truncheons . "
there was also the issue of what happened to those peaceful protesters once they were removed from the tracks .
seifert complained of demonstrators being kept for hours on end in an open field in the cold of the night .
" that is usually called false imprisonment , he said , " the law says people have to be brought to a custodial judge as soon as possible .
that did not happen . "
bildunterschrift : the protests continued throughout the weekend and into monday issues converging what has made this particular demonstration so explosive is the coincidence of this transport of nuclear waste with the government 's decision to overturn former legislation aimed at phasing out nuclear power by around 2020 .
chancellor angela merkel 's conservative coalition of christian democrats and the pro-business free democrats , recently passed a bill through parliament allowing nuclear power stations to remain open another 12 years .
environment minister norbert roettgen has been at pains to separate the issues of lifespan-extension and dealing with nuclear waste .
" we have been using nuclear power for over 40 years , " he said .
" we have created electricity from it and created waste , and we have a responsibility to deal with that – independent of the question of lifespan extension . "
yet seifert is unimpressed with this distinction .
" the fact is that this government has decided to produce even more nuclear waste by extending the life spans of the existing nuclear power stations . "
but some demonstrators arrived at the railway tracks with self-evidently different agendas .
stuttgart 21 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgarters angry about a new railway station have joined the anti-nuclear protests several protestors against the new railway station known as stuttgart 21 were also present , and were celebrated at the podium .
this suggests that the anti-nuclear movement has become a rallying point for many people who feel the current government 's policies are leaving them disenfranchised .
" there is a growing feeling that policies are being made for minorities or a certain clientele , like large corporations , and that this government does not see it as necessary to work for the good of the whole population , " said seifert .
" a lot of people in stuttgart have the feeling that their opinion is not respected – the government is just doing what it wants over the heads of the population . "
opinion polls show that opposition political parties , particularly the greens , are benefitting from this groundswell .
indeed , prominent green party figure claudia roth took part in the weekend 's demonstrations , though politicians were not permitted to speak at the podium .
" we are certainly interested in working together with members of those parties , but the parties have the parliament , and we have the streets , " said seifert .
" we are a social movement and we have to separate the two places of expression . "

as one man remains in a coma after a weekend beating , two more journalists have reported being attacked . as two more journalist beatings were reported in russia on monday , president dmitry medvedev said those behind a near-fatal attack over the weekend would be found and punished .
reacting to intense media scrutiny over the handling of previous journalist beatings , medvedev said the culprits responsible for the saturday beating of kommersant business daily reporter oleg kashin would be held accountable , regardless of their potential rank or title .
" whoever is involved in this crime will be punished , regardless of his position , place in society or accomplishments , " medvedev said in comments broadcast on state television throughout the evening .
" i have seen it written in the press that -lsb- the people behind the crime -rsb- will not be found .
they will be found .
there is no doubt . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kashin remains in a coma after his near-death beating the russian prosecutor general called monday for any witnesses of the beating to come forward .
he said investigators had as of yet received no leads in the case .
in the line of fire medvedev added that assaults on reporters must be treated with extra care by society and not be grouped with other crimes .
" reporters are people who find themselves in an area of heightened risk , " he said .
the president 's comments come as purported video footage of the weekend beating hit russian websites and state tv news .
the recording showed two assailants attack a man as he approached a gate to a residential building at night .
one person held him by the upper body while the other beat him with what appeared to be a metal shaft .
kashin remains in a coma , his legs , skull and fingers smashed in one of a long line of attacks on russia reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya was murdered in 2006 international condemnation the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , called the attack " brutal " and " obviously unacceptable . "
the media freedom representative of the organization for security and cooperation in europe , dunja mijatovic , said the assault " confirms a worrying trend of continuous violence against journalists " in russia .
there have been 19 unsolved murders of journalists in russia since 2000 , including the 2006 killing of kremlin critic anna politkovskaya .
meanwhile , two more journalist beatings were reported monday .
one was a reporter with the zhukovskiye vesti suburban moscow weekly , and the other the editor of the volga region 's saratovsky reporter .
zhukovskiye reporter anatoly adamchuk says he was struck twice in the head and was recuperating at home .
he said the only item stolen during the incident was his computer memory card .

papandreou made the announcement on sunday as his socialist party -lrb- pasok -rrb- appeared to have emerged narrowly ahead of rivals . the threat of a general election had rattled financial markets , with fears that the greek government would not be able to follow through on its unpopular budget drive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the budget measures come after an international rescue package was agreed in a televised address to the nation on sunday , papandreou - who only came to power last year - said he felt satisfied with a fresh mandate to press ahead with the program .
" making changes is not easy , " papandreou said .
" greek people brought us to power a year ago and today confirmed that they want this change .
we will continue with our task tomorrow , " estimates early on monday put pasok ahead in seven out of 13 regions .
the center-right new democracy party led in the remaining regions , although some races were so tight that they are likely to be contested again next sunday .

papandreou had at no stage indicated the criteria he would use to decide whether or not to call a fresh general election .
the government was forced to adopt a program of pay cuts , tax rises and a freeze in pensions - prompting strikes , riots and protests - after state finances were revealed to be far in a far worse state than expected earlier this year .
those reforms were agreed as part of 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 154.4 billion -rrb- bailout package from the international monetary fund and the european union in may .
the greek economy , which represents about 2.5 percent of that of the euro zone , is expected to shrink by 4 percent this year .

they also repeated calls to free imprisoned opposition leader aung san suu kyi .
however , myanmar 's ally china refused to join the chorus of international disapproval .
the state-owned newspaper global times reported the government considered the controversial polls " a step forward . "
an official statement is still awaited .
statement by us , australia the us , eu , uk , australia and japan all condemned vote as being neither free nor fair . in a joint statement , the us and australia urged the regime 's leaders to ensure that " post-election institutions be transparent , accountable and responsive to their citizens ' aspirations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers say the election results were rigged us president barack obama , speaking on a visit to india on monday , went so far as to accuse the ruling myanmar military junta of stealing the election .
" it is unacceptable to steal an election , as the regime in burma has done again for all the world to see , " he said in a speech at the indian parliament , in which he referred to myanmar by its former name .
obama critiques those who fail to speak out he cited myanmar as an example of a country where a " bankrupt regime " imprisoned opponents and gunned down protesters .
and he shot a barb at his host country when he accused mumbai of failling to speak out sufficiently on the rights of the repressed .
" faced with such gross violations of human rights , it is the responsibility of the international community , especially leaders like the united states and india , to condemn it . "
obama said .
" if i can be frank , in international fora , india has often shied away from these issues , " he added .
ethnic violence erupts at border in the us , secretary of state hillary clinton said her country would uphold " rigorous sanctions " against myanmar 's regime as long as it abuses human rights and holds political prisoners .
independent burmese observers reported widespread allegations of voter intimidation and bribery in the elections , and most international observers had already written off the vote as a sham designed to further entrench miltiary rule .

and concerns have been raised about votes being counted away from public or opposition party scrutiny .
meanwhile , as the ballots were counted on monday , violence erupted between government soldiers and ethnic minority karen rebels in the border town of myawaddy .
some 10,000 refugees fled across the border into thailand to escape the post-election fighting .
scales tipped for the military while myanmar officially ended half a century of direct army rule on sunday , a variety of restrictions accompanying the election made a pro-democracy upset virtually impossible .
for instance , 25 percent of parliamentary seats are reserved for the military .
and the government-crafted constitution and skewed election rules heavily favored the military government 's candidates .
that means that for now , myanmar 's military will uphold its power through affiliated parties .
candidates backed by the regime enjoyed substantial financial support and were also accused of intimidating opposing parties .
" for the people of burma , it will mean the return to power of a brutal regime that has pillaged the nation 's resources and overseen widespread human rights abuses , including arbitrary detentions , enforced disappearances , rape and torture , " britain 's foreign secretary william hague said in response to sunday 's election .
china is supportive of regime meanwhile , china 's global times reported the chinese government supported " myanmar 's plan to transform its political system , but knows it will not happen overnight . "
china has long helped economically-dysfunctional myanmar to keep afloat through trade ties , arms sales , and by shielding it from un sanctions over rights abuses as a veto-wielding member of the un security council .
in the first five months of this year , china has invested about $ 8 billion -lrb- 11 billion euros -rrb- in myanmar , which it sees as a strategic ally and important trading partner , especially for its energy-hungry western provinces .
it will likely be many days before official results are released , since the process of vote counting in myanmar is painstaking and slow .

the junta has placed the country under a 90-day state of emergency . vote counting in myanmar 's first election in 20 years began monday amid accusations of voter intimidation and fraud as well as condemnation by the international community that the weekend election was neither free nor fair .
as counting of votes got underway , a fire fight erupted between a splinter group of armed forces from the democratic karen buddhist army -lrb- dkba -rrb- and the army in the border town of myawaddy leading to hundreds of people being forced to flee into thailand for safety .
reports also say the government has placed the country under a 90-day state of emergency .
army-backed parties set to sweep polls over 3,000 candidates had stood from 37 parties for national parliament and regional assemblies in sunday 's vote .
but harsh election laws had prevented several parties from taking part including opposition leader , aung san suu kyi 's national league for democracy or nld .

the armed forces are also guaranteed a quarter of parliamentary seats under a 2008 constitution .
ron hoffman , canadian ambassador to thailand and myanmar , said the international community needs to keep pressure on myanmar ’ s military .
" it 's not a democratic exercise .
it does n't even come close to meeting any standard of international electoral processes . "
aung san suu kyi 's detention expires on saturday soe aung , a spokesman for the forum for democracy in burma , says the parliament will have little power but to act as a rubber stamp for the military leaders .
he says the parliament will be dominated by the regime backed candidates after the elections .
" and the parliamentarians will have no other chance but to become a rubber stamp parliament to endorse the executive council or the national security and defence council , by name .
this would be headed by the president and also the commander in chief .
this council will run the country after all . "

if the nobel laureate is freed analysts expect she will face tough restrictions after spending much of the past two decades under detention .

the ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security . interior ministers of the european union 's 27 member states unanimously agreed on monday to eliminate visa requirements for citizens of albania and bosnia-herzegovina .
under the agreement , albanians and bosnians with biometric passports would be able to travel to the 25 eu nations in the border-free schengen zone , which excludes ireland and the united kingdom , for up to three months .
the decision came after france , germany and the netherlands expressed concerns that there could be an increase in unfounded asylum claims from the two countries .
the eu got rid of visa requirements for serbia , montenegro and macedonia late last year , apparently leading to an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia .
european commission could roll back decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has seen an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia the ministers stipulated that the european commission could " propose the suspension of visa-free travel " if it felt that citizens of the two countries were abusing the system .
" it is of the utmost importance that albania and bosnia-herzegovina continue to intensify their information campaign with the aim to properly explain to their citizens the meaning of short-term visa-free travel , " cecilia malmstrom , eu commissioner for home affairs , said in a statement .
" a visa-free regime also comes with responsibilities . "
malmstrom said the european parliament and the bloc 's member states must still approve the proposal , and that it could enter into force as early as mid-december .
it would leave kosovo , whose independence is not recognized by all eu states , as the only balkan country without visa-free travel in the eu .
both bosnia and albania hope to join the eu , but face years of tough democratic reforms before they will likely be able to do so .
stricter rules on cargo security eu interior ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security in the aftermath of a string of eu-bound parcel bombs originating from yemen and greece last week .
for instance , airports with inadequate security measures could appear on a blacklist . german interior minister thomas de maiziere said security concerns should trump fears over extra costs due to increased control procedures . " if this is going to be more expensive , then it might be a little more expensive .
there is no security for free " , de maiziere told reporters before presenting his five key points to his eu colleagues . according to de maiziere , the eu must focus on coordination before halting cargo shipments , agree on which countries are to be considered unsafe freight senders , improve security in those unsafe airports , tighten controls on suspect parcels and define responsibilities between commercial shippers and national authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there is no security for free , " says de maiziere the german proposal was welcomed by belgian interior minister annemie turtelboom who is in charge of chairing the eu meeting . " when we see everything that happened last week , we must really discuss how we can travel together , work together and how we can work together not only with the united states but also with some countries in africa , " she said . spanish interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba called measures on enhancing security coordination " an ever more pressing need " for eu countries . but siim kallas , eu transport commissioner , warned on friday that panic should not lead to an excessive increase of security measures . " the fight against terrorism is eternal , and aviation remains the most sensitive target for such attacks , but panic is not the remedy , " he said .
" we must find a proportionate and adequate response . " de maiziere wants to implement a working group which is due to get results by the end of this year .

the junta has placed the country under a 90-day state of emergency . vote counting in myanmar 's first election in 20 years began monday amid accusations of voter intimidation and fraud as well as condemnation by the international community that the weekend election was neither free nor fair .
as counting of votes got underway , a fire fight erupted between a splinter group of armed forces from the democratic karen buddhist army -lrb- dkba -rrb- and the army in the border town of myawaddy leading to hundreds of people being forced to flee into thailand for safety .
reports also say the government has placed the country under a 90-day state of emergency .
army-backed parties set to sweep polls over 3,000 candidates had stood from 37 parties for national parliament and regional assemblies in sunday 's vote .
but harsh election laws had prevented several parties from taking part including opposition leader , aung san suu kyi 's national league for democracy or nld .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a myanmar soldier gestures while talking with police officers as they provide security during the election parties aligned to the ruling military , union solidarity and development party -lrb- usdp -rrb- and national unity party , were set to win a majority of seats .
the armed forces are also guaranteed a quarter of parliamentary seats under a 2008 constitution .
ron hoffman , canadian ambassador to thailand and myanmar , said the international community needs to keep pressure on myanmar ’ s military .
" it 's not a democratic exercise .
it does n't even come close to meeting any standard of international electoral processes . "
aung san suu kyi 's detention expires on saturday soe aung , a spokesman for the forum for democracy in burma , says the parliament will have little power but to act as a rubber stamp for the military leaders .
he says the parliament will be dominated by the regime backed candidates after the elections .
" and the parliamentarians will have no other chance but to become a rubber stamp parliament to endorse the executive council or the national security and defence council , by name .
this would be headed by the president and also the commander in chief .
this council will run the country after all . "
bildunterschrift : aung san suu kyi in yangon 2009 analysts are now watching whether the military will release aung san suu kyi from detention , expected next saturday .
if the nobel laureate is freed analysts expect she will face tough restrictions after spending much of the past two decades under detention .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 08.11.2010 greek striker gekas revives his career at improving frankfurt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gekas made the difference against wolfsburg theofanis gekas is anything but a complete player , but he knows how to do a striker 's main job - score goals .
and this year the crafty greek is reminding opponents just how uncannily efficient he can be . after eleven rounds of play , no one had more goals - 11 in total - than a 30-year-old many bundesliga fans would probably classify as a journeyman .
but ask the man himself and he 'll tell you that goal-getting is an innate ability that 's anything but the norm .
" i started playing football really young , and i was always a striker , " gekas said in interview with the german football league .
" i was born with my scoring ability .
it seems like a gift from god . "
his teammates had another potentially supernatural explanation after gekas scored a brace on saturday .
“ we asked ourselves in the dressing room if he 's sold his soul , ” defender marco russ told the bild newspaper .
“ even his badly taken penalty went in . ”
gekas came to the bundesliga in 2005 on a one-year loan from panathinaikos athens to bochum and promptly won the league scoring title .
his then coach described him as " our life-insurance policy . "
but bochum decided they could not afford the premiums and failed to exercise their right to purchase the greek goal-getter .
it was a bad decision .
bochum became a perennial relegation candidate and now play in the second division .
for his part , gekas moved on to leverkusen , where he never established himself .
although he scored a respectable 11 goals in his first season with his new club , he was often criticized as lacking in work ethic and was loaned out to hertha berlin at the beginning of 2010 .
with hertha also getting relegated , gekas formally returned to leverkusen , before promptly moving on to frankfurt .
his was hardly one of the high-profile signings of the off-season , but now he 's getting a chance to prove that his detractors , if not completely wrong , missed the point .
ice-cold killer bildunterschrift : in addition to his 11 league goals , gekas has scored 2 in the german cup gekas is neither a particularly great dribbler or passer , and he 's never been known to track back and help out on defense .
but he is one of the most prolific poachers the league has seen in recent years .
that 's just the way he described the role of a striker in a recent interview .
" the most important thing is that -lsb- a striker -rsb- has good teammates who are always looking to get him the ball , " gekas told the online portal of the eurosport television network .
" in addition , he needs the talent to get himself in the right position to score goals . "
on teams that fail to utilize his nose for goal , gekas is most conspicuous for the amount of times he 's caught offside .
but on teams that figure out how to employ his particular talent , he can be lethal .
indeed , a tarantino-esque tattoo on gekas ' arm reads " eiskalter vollstrecker , " -lrb- ice-cold killer -rrb- - the nickname he earned at bochum .
understatement , as you 've probably guessed by now , is n't gekas ' strong suit .
" the fact that i did n't score -lsb- for leverkusen and hertha -rsb- was because the people in positions of responsibility did n't trust me , " gekas told the bundesliga .
" but frankfurt coach michael skibbe , whom i know from my time in leverkusen , does have that trust .
that has a direct effect on my game and the number of goals i score . "
instinct and vision bildunterschrift : gekas has been doing all his talking on pitch this season seen negatively , gekas is one-dimensional .
seen positively , he does exactly what he 's supposed to do , hang around in dangerous positions and convert chances as they materialize .
wolfsburg were given a display of the latter qualities , as their trip to frankfurt on saturday ended in a 3-1 defeat .
the hosts ' first goal in that match was archetypal gekas .
the greek striker lurked on the edge of the penalty area , and when a low pass came his way , he took it directly and curled it into the bottom left-hand corner .
the goal was only possible because gekas did n't hesitate or try to control the ball , but rather reacted on instinct .
that 's a quality his coach appreciates .
" there are n't many strikers who can see a situation in advance as well as gekas , " michael skibbe told the bild newspaper earlier this season .
" in the build-up , he follows pass combinations very intensely and then instinctively runs where he expects the ball to be . "
gekas goals may often appear to be lucky , but the numbers argue for his basic quality .
in addition to his achievements in the bundesliga , the striker has scored 20 goals in 51 matches for the greek national team .
gekas officially retired from the greece squad in september , citing " special circumstances . "
few people , if indeed anyone other than the striker himself , knew what he was referring to .
that 's not uncommon with gekas , who , despite playing for years in the bundesliga , says he sees no need to learn german .
and this season , he 's drastically scaled back the number of interviews he 's prepared to give .
but if gekas can keep up anything near his early pace of a goal per game , no one is likely to care about his disinterest in communication .
as he himself might say , a striker 's job is not to make himself understood .
putting the ball in the net speaks louder than words .

"
his statement , made in an address to members of both of india 's houses of parliament , was greeted with thunderous desk-thumping .
while clearly indicating that any such move lies well in the future , the comment , and the praise-filled speech he gave , was considered by many to be a major sign of growing economic and security ties between india and the united states .
in his speech , obama said the country had established itself as a world power and as a natural ally of the united states on the global stage . he promised the two countries would work as equal partners on projects in afghanistan , as well as broaden their dialogue to include nuclear proliferation and regional security in east asia .

he and his wife , michelle , reached out to sections of the country 's political and business classes , as well as students , villagers and artisans .
kicking off his visit in mumbai , india 's financial capital , obama pleased the crowd by saying this was his first visit to india but " my longest visit to another country since becoming president . " in mumbai , both the first lady and the president interacted with college students , and the first lady broke into an impromptu dance while meeting students in a primary school during a celebration of the hindu festival of diwali .
promising to remove restrictions on sensitive high-tech exports - a nagging irritant in the evolution of bilateral ties - obama declared deals worth $ 15 billion -lrb- 10.6 billion euros -rrb- that would support some 54,000 american jobs and seek to answer critics back home .
his description of india as a world power set the tone for negotiations with the political leadership in new delhi that saw a raft of commercial deals signed and agreements to cooperate more closely in agriculture , health and energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visit to humayun 's tomb in new delhi was part of the program ' defining and indispensible partnership ' " i believe that the relationship between the us and india will be one of the defining and indispensable partnerships of the 21st century , " said obama .
" our nations are the two largest democracies on earth .
we are bound by a common language and common values , shared aspirations and a shared belief that opportunity should be limited only by how hard you are willing to work , only by how hard you are willing to try . "
this sentiment was reciprocated by indian prime minister manmohan singh .
" the new deals that have been struck , they all happen to be in infrastructure .
and infrastructure today is the biggest bottleneck to the faster growth of india , to the faster growth of employment .
and these deals the president has mentioned are truly an example of trade being a win-win situation for both countries . "
alongside singh , obama said while both india and pakistan had an interest in reducing tensions in the region , the us " can not impose a solution to these problems . "
he made it clear that it was up to india and pakistan to settle their differences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama inspected the troops at the presidential palace in new dehli " i am absolutely convinced that it is in both india 's and pakistan 's interest to reduce tensions and that will enable them , i think , to focus on the range of both challenges and opportunities each country faces , " he said .
singh pointed out that he was willing to engage pakistan on all issues including kashmir but not when the terror infrastructure was still intact .
" we are committed to engaging pakistan , we are committed to resolve all outstanding issues between our two countries including the word ' k ' , we are not afraid of that .
but it is our request that you can not simultaneously be talking and at the same time , the terror machine is active as ever before , " he said .
obama continues his 10-day asia trip in indonesia on tuesday , and then travels on to south korea and japan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 08.11.2010 new urine test is possible breakthrough in diagnosing heart disease großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other diagnosis techniques are more complicated than the urine test heart disease accounts for half of all deaths in europe and costs the european union economy 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 281 billion -rrb- a year .
now , scientists have found a new way to detect heart disease by analyzing urine . according to the european heart network , some 4.3 million europeans die of heart disease every year - half of all deaths , and it is the main cause of death for european women .
the disease is caused when blood vessels are clogged with plaque , made up of protein and fat .
if too much of this builds up , the blood vessel can rupture and blood flow is blocked , causing a heart attack .
when the disease has advanced this far , it can be too late to treat effectively .
most medical officials suggest that cholesterol and blood pressure be monitored regularly , but this is n't always done in practice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heart disease is caused by a build-up of fat and protein in blood vessels however , a new paper , published this month in the journal of hypertension , proposed a new method of potential diagnosing heart disease by analyzing urine .
" we analyzed all the proteins in the urine and asked the question , ' are there distinct differences between patients that have coronary heart disease and those that do not have coronary heart disease ? " ' one of the paper 's authors , harald mischak , a professor of proteomics at the university of glasgow in scotland , told deutsche welle .
protein content the scientists looked at a series of peptides and proteins that are present in plaque build-up in the arteries , including the long protein collagen .
some collagen , along with other proteins , makes its way into the body 's waste system , and is eventually excreted .
researchers were able to isolate the difference in urine samples between hundreds of people with known heart disease and hundreds known not to have it .
they then determined that by scanning for this protein signature , they could use it as a diagnostic tool for yet another set of patients that might be at risk in the future .
mischak added that this also changes the fundamental understanding of what heart disease is .
" i think it is well-justified to see coronary heart disease not as an isolated disease but rather as a systemic vascular disease , " the austrian scientist noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heart disease is connected to obesity and kills several million people a year ' an important step ' dr. bukurt pieske , head of the division of cardiology at the university of graz in austria , said this new method could be a significant improvement .
he added that previous scanning tools , like ecgs or heart biopsies , were more complicated and invasive .
" they have developed a risk score for coronary artery disease or a diagnostic score for coronary heart disease that was better than any previous non-invasive marker for coronary heart disease , " said pieske .
" if this is proven and can be repeated , this would be a big step forward . "
pieske added that , apart from the people who have already shown some symptoms of heart disease , another group could benefit .
" we can identify people at risk who are asymptomatic , who do not know anything about their early stage of the disease and these people are very amenable to preventive measures , to prevent the disease from evolving , " he said .

looking ahead to this week 's meeting of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- nations in seoul , the former us trade representative said the world needed a new regime to succeed the bretton woods ii system of floating currencies , which has been in place since the fixed-rate currency system linked to gold broke down in 1971 .
although the gold standard helped guard against inflation , it was abandoned because it did not allow for the flexible monetary policy many economists believe is essential in counteracting economic shocks .
" although textbooks may view gold as the old money , markets are using gold as an alternative monetary asset today , " zoellick wrote .
the new system " is likely to need to involve the dollar , the euro , the yen , the pound and a renminbi -lrb- chinese yuan -rrb- that moves towards internationalization and then an open capital account , " he said .
" the system should also consider employing gold as an international reference point of market expectations about inflation , deflation and future currency values . "
currency war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick says the world needs to rethink currency exchange rates zoellick 's comments came amid fears of a so-called " currency war " that would see countries jostle for trade advantage by massaging their exchange rates lower .
the united states has led accusations that china cheats in world trade by artificially weakening its currency .
but china and germany , both major exporters , have complained that washington 's policy of quantitative easing - effectively printing money - is weakening the dollar and harming emerging markets ' competitiveness .
investors are pumping dollars into emerging markets in search of higher yields , and the potentially destabilizing impact of this , along with big current account deficits and china 's reluctance to let the yuan appreciate faster , are set to dominate the g20 summit on thursday and friday .
new structures france , which takes over the g20 chair after this week 's summit , says it plans to work on a new international monetary system to bring greater currency stability .
beijing 's central bank chief has suggested an alternative monetary system based on using the international monetary fund 's special drawing rights , a notional unit of value based on a basket of major currencies , instead of the dollar as the sole global reserve currency .
zoellick said a new monetary system would take time to develop and should be part of a package approach including possible changes in international monetary fund rules to review capital as well as current account policies , and linking imf monetary assessments to world trade organization obligations .
he also called on the g20 to forge structural reforms , including the promotion of domestic demand in china and the reduction of debt in the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de exchange rates -pipe- 08.11.2010 world bank chief calls on g20 to reconsider gold standard großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gold underpinned exchange rates between 1946 and 1971 world bank president robert zoellick has called on bickering g20 nations to bring gold back into the global monetary system as an anchor to guide currency movements . in a commentary published in monday 's financial times , world bank president robert zoellick wrote that an updated gold standard could help retool the world economy amid tensions over currencies and the united states ' monetary policy .
looking ahead to this week 's meeting of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- nations in seoul , the former us trade representative said the world needed a new regime to succeed the bretton woods ii system of floating currencies , which has been in place since the fixed-rate currency system linked to gold broke down in 1971 .
although the gold standard helped guard against inflation , it was abandoned because it did not allow for the flexible monetary policy many economists believe is essential in counteracting economic shocks .
" although textbooks may view gold as the old money , markets are using gold as an alternative monetary asset today , " zoellick wrote .
the new system " is likely to need to involve the dollar , the euro , the yen , the pound and a renminbi -lrb- chinese yuan -rrb- that moves towards internationalization and then an open capital account , " he said .
" the system should also consider employing gold as an international reference point of market expectations about inflation , deflation and future currency values . "
currency war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick says the world needs to rethink currency exchange rates zoellick 's comments came amid fears of a so-called " currency war " that would see countries jostle for trade advantage by massaging their exchange rates lower .
the united states has led accusations that china cheats in world trade by artificially weakening its currency .
but china and germany , both major exporters , have complained that washington 's policy of quantitative easing - effectively printing money - is weakening the dollar and harming emerging markets ' competitiveness .
investors are pumping dollars into emerging markets in search of higher yields , and the potentially destabilizing impact of this , along with big current account deficits and china 's reluctance to let the yuan appreciate faster , are set to dominate the g20 summit on thursday and friday .
new structures france , which takes over the g20 chair after this week 's summit , says it plans to work on a new international monetary system to bring greater currency stability .
beijing 's central bank chief has suggested an alternative monetary system based on using the international monetary fund 's special drawing rights , a notional unit of value based on a basket of major currencies , instead of the dollar as the sole global reserve currency .
zoellick said a new monetary system would take time to develop and should be part of a package approach including possible changes in international monetary fund rules to review capital as well as current account policies , and linking imf monetary assessments to world trade organization obligations .
he also called on the g20 to forge structural reforms , including the promotion of domestic demand in china and the reduction of debt in the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de travel -pipe- 08.11.2010 eu scraps visa requirements for albania and bosnia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albanians and bosnians may enter the eu for three months albania and bosnia are soon to join other balkan countries in enjoying visa-free travel to the european union , eu interior ministers announced monday .
the ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security . interior ministers of the european union 's 27 member states unanimously agreed on monday to eliminate visa requirements for citizens of albania and bosnia-herzegovina .
under the agreement , albanians and bosnians with biometric passports would be able to travel to the 25 eu nations in the border-free schengen zone , which excludes ireland and the united kingdom , for up to three months .
the decision came after france , germany and the netherlands expressed concerns that there could be an increase in unfounded asylum claims from the two countries .
the eu got rid of visa requirements for serbia , montenegro and macedonia late last year , apparently leading to an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia .
european commission could roll back decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has seen an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia the ministers stipulated that the european commission could " propose the suspension of visa-free travel " if it felt that citizens of the two countries were abusing the system .
" it is of the utmost importance that albania and bosnia-herzegovina continue to intensify their information campaign with the aim to properly explain to their citizens the meaning of short-term visa-free travel , " cecilia malmstrom , eu commissioner for home affairs , said in a statement .
" a visa-free regime also comes with responsibilities . "
malmstrom said the european parliament and the bloc 's member states must still approve the proposal , and that it could enter into force as early as mid-december .
it would leave kosovo , whose independence is not recognized by all eu states , as the only balkan country without visa-free travel in the eu .
both bosnia and albania hope to join the eu , but face years of tough democratic reforms before they will likely be able to do so .
stricter rules on cargo security eu interior ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security in the aftermath of a string of eu-bound parcel bombs originating from yemen and greece last week .
for instance , airports with inadequate security measures could appear on a blacklist . german interior minister thomas de maiziere said security concerns should trump fears over extra costs due to increased control procedures . " if this is going to be more expensive , then it might be a little more expensive .
there is no security for free " , de maiziere told reporters before presenting his five key points to his eu colleagues . according to de maiziere , the eu must focus on coordination before halting cargo shipments , agree on which countries are to be considered unsafe freight senders , improve security in those unsafe airports , tighten controls on suspect parcels and define responsibilities between commercial shippers and national authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there is no security for free , " says de maiziere the german proposal was welcomed by belgian interior minister annemie turtelboom who is in charge of chairing the eu meeting . " when we see everything that happened last week , we must really discuss how we can travel together , work together and how we can work together not only with the united states but also with some countries in africa , " she said . spanish interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba called measures on enhancing security coordination " an ever more pressing need " for eu countries . but siim kallas , eu transport commissioner , warned on friday that panic should not lead to an excessive increase of security measures . " the fight against terrorism is eternal , and aviation remains the most sensitive target for such attacks , but panic is not the remedy , " he said .
" we must find a proportionate and adequate response . " de maiziere wants to implement a working group which is due to get results by the end of this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 08.11.2010 new urine test is possible breakthrough in diagnosing heart disease großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other diagnosis techniques are more complicated than the urine test heart disease accounts for half of all deaths in europe and costs the european union economy 200 billion euros -lrb- $ 281 billion -rrb- a year .
now , scientists have found a new way to detect heart disease by analyzing urine . according to the european heart network , some 4.3 million europeans die of heart disease every year - half of all deaths , and it is the main cause of death for european women .
the disease is caused when blood vessels are clogged with plaque , made up of protein and fat .
if too much of this builds up , the blood vessel can rupture and blood flow is blocked , causing a heart attack .
when the disease has advanced this far , it can be too late to treat effectively .
most medical officials suggest that cholesterol and blood pressure be monitored regularly , but this is n't always done in practice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heart disease is caused by a build-up of fat and protein in blood vessels however , a new paper , published this month in the journal of hypertension , proposed a new method of potential diagnosing heart disease by analyzing urine .
" we analyzed all the proteins in the urine and asked the question , ' are there distinct differences between patients that have coronary heart disease and those that do not have coronary heart disease ? " ' one of the paper 's authors , harald mischak , a professor of proteomics at the university of glasgow in scotland , told deutsche welle .
protein content the scientists looked at a series of peptides and proteins that are present in plaque build-up in the arteries , including the long protein collagen .
some collagen , along with other proteins , makes its way into the body 's waste system , and is eventually excreted .
researchers were able to isolate the difference in urine samples between hundreds of people with known heart disease and hundreds known not to have it .
they then determined that by scanning for this protein signature , they could use it as a diagnostic tool for yet another set of patients that might be at risk in the future .
mischak added that this also changes the fundamental understanding of what heart disease is .
" i think it is well-justified to see coronary heart disease not as an isolated disease but rather as a systemic vascular disease , " the austrian scientist noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heart disease is connected to obesity and kills several million people a year ' an important step ' dr. bukurt pieske , head of the division of cardiology at the university of graz in austria , said this new method could be a significant improvement .
he added that previous scanning tools , like ecgs or heart biopsies , were more complicated and invasive .
" they have developed a risk score for coronary artery disease or a diagnostic score for coronary heart disease that was better than any previous non-invasive marker for coronary heart disease , " said pieske .
" if this is proven and can be repeated , this would be a big step forward . "
pieske added that , apart from the people who have already shown some symptoms of heart disease , another group could benefit .
" we can identify people at risk who are asymptomatic , who do not know anything about their early stage of the disease and these people are very amenable to preventive measures , to prevent the disease from evolving , " he said .

in august , acs made a hostile all-share bid to raise its stake in hochtief from 29 percent to 50 percent .

papandreou had been seeking a mandate for his austerity drive . greek prime minister george papandreou has said he will not call a snap parliamentary election , claiming to have won sufficient support in local and regional polls to press ahead with austerity reforms .
papandreou made the announcement on sunday as his socialist party -lrb- pasok -rrb- appeared to have emerged narrowly ahead of rivals . the threat of a general election had rattled financial markets , with fears that the greek government would not be able to follow through on its unpopular budget drive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the budget measures come after an international rescue package was agreed in a televised address to the nation on sunday , papandreou - who only came to power last year - said he felt satisfied with a fresh mandate to press ahead with the program .
" making changes is not easy , " papandreou said .
" greek people brought us to power a year ago and today confirmed that they want this change .
we will continue with our task tomorrow , " estimates early on monday put pasok ahead in seven out of 13 regions .
the center-right new democracy party led in the remaining regions , although some races were so tight that they are likely to be contested again next sunday .
welcome news for markets risk premiums on greek government debt had risen in advance of the elections because of political uncertainty and the news was broadly welcomed by observers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austerity drive has led to strikes and protests " it 's good news that papandreou can continue and that no political uncertainty enters the fray , " said andreas scheuerle , an economist at germany 's dekabank .
papandreou had at no stage indicated the criteria he would use to decide whether or not to call a fresh general election .
the government was forced to adopt a program of pay cuts , tax rises and a freeze in pensions - prompting strikes , riots and protests - after state finances were revealed to be far in a far worse state than expected earlier this year .
those reforms were agreed as part of 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 154.4 billion -rrb- bailout package from the international monetary fund and the european union in may .
the greek economy , which represents about 2.5 percent of that of the euro zone , is expected to shrink by 4 percent this year .

as one man remains in a coma after a weekend beating , two more journalists have reported being attacked . as two more journalist beatings were reported in russia on monday , president dmitry medvedev said those behind a near-fatal attack over the weekend would be found and punished .
reacting to intense media scrutiny over the handling of previous journalist beatings , medvedev said the culprits responsible for the saturday beating of kommersant business daily reporter oleg kashin would be held accountable , regardless of their potential rank or title .
" whoever is involved in this crime will be punished , regardless of his position , place in society or accomplishments , " medvedev said in comments broadcast on state television throughout the evening .
" i have seen it written in the press that -lsb- the people behind the crime -rsb- will not be found .
they will be found .
there is no doubt . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kashin remains in a coma after his near-death beating the russian prosecutor general called monday for any witnesses of the beating to come forward .
he said investigators had as of yet received no leads in the case .
in the line of fire medvedev added that assaults on reporters must be treated with extra care by society and not be grouped with other crimes .
" reporters are people who find themselves in an area of heightened risk , " he said .
the president 's comments come as purported video footage of the weekend beating hit russian websites and state tv news .
the recording showed two assailants attack a man as he approached a gate to a residential building at night .
one person held him by the upper body while the other beat him with what appeared to be a metal shaft .
kashin remains in a coma , his legs , skull and fingers smashed in one of a long line of attacks on russia reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya was murdered in 2006 international condemnation the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , called the attack " brutal " and " obviously unacceptable . "
the media freedom representative of the organization for security and cooperation in europe , dunja mijatovic , said the assault " confirms a worrying trend of continuous violence against journalists " in russia .
there have been 19 unsolved murders of journalists in russia since 2000 , including the 2006 killing of kremlin critic anna politkovskaya .
meanwhile , two more journalist beatings were reported monday .
one was a reporter with the zhukovskiye vesti suburban moscow weekly , and the other the editor of the volga region 's saratovsky reporter .
zhukovskiye reporter anatoly adamchuk says he was struck twice in the head and was recuperating at home .
he said the only item stolen during the incident was his computer memory card .

up to 17,000 policemen , at a cost of up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- , were used over the weekend to keep an estimated 35,000 people from blocking the path of the train , and more demonstrators – along with local farmers - are continuing to arrive to block the path of the road convoy as it continues its journey .
there were varying reports of whether violence had occurred .
the police said that officers had been directly attacked , while protest organizers countered that demonstrators had only sabotaged the tracks .
rainer wendt , head of the police union , said , the officers " proceeded very sensitively , " and " made the right decision – namely to carry the people from the tracks . "
he added that where violence was used against police officers , they reacted " accordingly " and " proportionately . "
dirk seifert , spokesman for the environmental protest group robin wood , told a different story .
" you have to say that the police were disproportionate in their use of tear-gas and pepper spray , " he told deutsche welle .
" the police also hit people who were already lying on the ground , both with their fists as well as truncheons . "
there was also the issue of what happened to those peaceful protesters once they were removed from the tracks .
seifert complained of demonstrators being kept for hours on end in an open field in the cold of the night .
" that is usually called false imprisonment , he said , " the law says people have to be brought to a custodial judge as soon as possible .
that did not happen . "
bildunterschrift : the protests continued throughout the weekend and into monday issues converging what has made this particular demonstration so explosive is the coincidence of this transport of nuclear waste with the government 's decision to overturn former legislation aimed at phasing out nuclear power by around 2020 .
chancellor angela merkel 's conservative coalition of christian democrats and the pro-business free democrats , recently passed a bill through parliament allowing nuclear power stations to remain open another 12 years .
environment minister norbert roettgen has been at pains to separate the issues of lifespan-extension and dealing with nuclear waste .
" we have been using nuclear power for over 40 years , " he said .
" we have created electricity from it and created waste , and we have a responsibility to deal with that – independent of the question of lifespan extension . "
yet seifert is unimpressed with this distinction .
" the fact is that this government has decided to produce even more nuclear waste by extending the life spans of the existing nuclear power stations . "
but some demonstrators arrived at the railway tracks with self-evidently different agendas .
stuttgart 21 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgarters angry about a new railway station have joined the anti-nuclear protests several protestors against the new railway station known as stuttgart 21 were also present , and were celebrated at the podium .
this suggests that the anti-nuclear movement has become a rallying point for many people who feel the current government 's policies are leaving them disenfranchised .
" there is a growing feeling that policies are being made for minorities or a certain clientele , like large corporations , and that this government does not see it as necessary to work for the good of the whole population , " said seifert .
" a lot of people in stuttgart have the feeling that their opinion is not respected – the government is just doing what it wants over the heads of the population . "
opinion polls show that opposition political parties , particularly the greens , are benefitting from this groundswell .
indeed , prominent green party figure claudia roth took part in the weekend 's demonstrations , though politicians were not permitted to speak at the podium .
" we are certainly interested in working together with members of those parties , but the parties have the parliament , and we have the streets , " said seifert .
" we are a social movement and we have to separate the two places of expression . "

papandreou had been seeking a mandate for his austerity drive . greek prime minister george papandreou has said he will not call a snap parliamentary election , claiming to have won sufficient support in local and regional polls to press ahead with austerity reforms .
papandreou made the announcement on sunday as his socialist party -lrb- pasok -rrb- appeared to have emerged narrowly ahead of rivals . the threat of a general election had rattled financial markets , with fears that the greek government would not be able to follow through on its unpopular budget drive .

deutsche welle spoke to the controversial writer alfred grosser who has been chosen to give the keynote speech . on november 9 the author alfred grosser is to give a speech in remembrance of the kristallnacht , or the night of broken glass , pogrom against jews in germany carried out under the nazis in 1938 .
the choice of speaker has caused controversy with historians and germany 's central council of jews questioning grosser 's credentials .
grosser comes from a jewish family and emigrated to france with them in 1933 .
the political academic and author of numerous books and essays is seen as an important pioneer in post-war franco-german understanding .
in recent years he has become increasingly interested in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
his 2009 book " von auschwitz nach jerusalem " -lrb- " from auschwitz to jerusalem " -rrb- caused controversy as he dealt with the question of how much it is permissible to question the policies of israel . germany 's central council of jews is not happy , and has written to the mayor of frankfurt to complain that grosser is an inappropriate choice of speaker .
deutsche welle : alfred grosser , you 're french with german and jewish roots .
you were born in 1925 in frankfurt and fled from there to france in 1933 .
now you are to give a speech in the place of your birth at the november 9 memorial .
regardless of the criticism , what were your thoughts and feelings about doing this ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of synagogues and businesses were attacked during kristallnacht alfred grosser : first of all , there is a need to remember this particular day .
since august 1944 in marseille , when i heard that part of my family had been transported to auschwitz , i have been sure that there is no collective german guilt and yet that i also share some responsibility for the future of liberal democracy in germany .
this was my starting point for the speech .
how exactly does one qualify to make such a speech ?
is it for instance through a certain behaviour or membership of some kind of official jewish organisation .
is only a " real " jew allowed to give such a speech ?
you have been accused of distancing yourself from judaism .
that is , at least , what the german historian michael wolffsohn asserts .
what does that have to do with my speech ?
a non-jew could also be chosen make the speech because the speech should also be for all german people .
there is an enormous volume published by raphael gross that documents all the terrible things that happened .
in contrast , there is also the fact that hundreds of non-jewish germans helped jewish germans .
that is something that is always downplayed .
i will also speak about this .
there is no collective guilt .
how , in 2010 , should november 9 be remembered ?
is there a way of doing it , so that it is not simply a ritual repeating the maxim " never again " ?
perhaps i was invited so that it would not become a pure ritual .
but it now seems that a lot of people in germany are upset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli author david grossman won the 2010 german book trade peace prize there are not that many people , let 's not exaggerate .
yes , the general secretary of the jewish organization - he was very upset .
but , david grossman , who this year won the peace prize of the german book trade is someone who constantly criticizes israeli policy and yet , he won that prize .
so , what 's the problem ?
the problem seems to be that you , it is said , have distanced yourself from judaism and have lived in france for a long time .
it is said that someone like grossman , who comes from israel is on more of a position to criticize , even if he does meet with criticism himself in israel for his opinions .
yes , but it is possible to speak freely in israel .
in germany the central council of jews would like it if there were only one single truth .
the american historian fritz stern and the former chancellor helmut schmidt both said that they are amazed that , from organizations here in germany you only hear a case of " right or wrong – my israel . "
during the german book trade presentation ceremony , i was very moved by what joachim gauck , correctly , said .
" my country right or wrong – if it is right , let it keep it right , if it is wrong , let it set it right . "
that means that we should judge each israeli policy accordingly .
you criticize the policies of israel – for example the policy of occupation and the separation wall between israelis and palestinians .
from a french point of view , why do you think such criticism always leads to such strong reactions from jewish organisations in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grosser praised comments made by joachim gauck -lrb- r . -rrb- at the german book prize it 's exactly the same in france .
one of the people i admire most , the former concentration camp inmate and french ambassador stephane estell - who also worked on the international declaration of human rights - has now travelled to gaza from egypt to see what the situation is like there .
immediately there were complaints , worse than i have had in germany – that he had not really been in the concentration camp , that he had in fact been a spy and so on ...
yes , we do have those reactions as well , at least from a few .
but it is a sensitive issue .
here in germany , of course , political correctness obviously plays a certain role .
i do n't know .
i would cite the former president koehler who in his speech to the israeli knesset - without referring to the palestinians - said that , as a result of its past , germany has the duty to defend human rights across the world .
that is something that is crucial for me and something that we should explain to young people who increasingly distance themselves and ask why they should bear any responsibility .
the responsibility is to learn from the past to defend so that we can defend human rights around the world , including germany .
what sort of reaction are you expecting on november 9 in frankfurt ?
it 's difficult to say .
i think that when i say the word israel , some of the listeners will listen more attentively while others will leave the room .
i have always found that it never comes to a debate .
i constantly try to debate the issues .
for example , at the launch of my last book " von auschwitz nach jerusalem " -lrb- “ from auschwitz to jerusalem ” -rrb- , about germany and israel , i insisted upon inviting jewish congregations in several german cities , but they did not come .
they do not want to debate because they do not want to have to always prove that they are right .

the regulator said it did not view the circumstances of the downstream acquisition as " unacceptable . "
ulitmate goal : leighton the german and australian companies had asked the takeovers panel to intervene in acs ' 2.76 billion euro all-share takeover offer for hochtief on the grounds that leighton was the ultimate target .
hochtief 's stake in leighton is valued at almost as much as the whole of the essen-based construction company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees are concerned about their jobs under a new owner in its submission to the panel , leighton said it was concerned that if acs grabbed hochtief 's stake , minority shareholders in leighton would be disadvantaged and the company would lose the independence it had enjoyed under german stewardship .
but statements by acs to the contrary have prompted both the takeoves panel and leighton to embrace the deal .
acs has contacted leighton and indicated a willingness to enter into a written and binding governance agreement , according to leighton chairman david mortimer .
independence assurance " we are encouraged by the public statements from acs and their direct contact , and intend to actively pursue such an agreement to protect the interests of our minority shareholders , ” mortimer said in a statement .

and this year the crafty greek is reminding opponents just how uncannily efficient he can be . after eleven rounds of play , no one had more goals - 11 in total - than a 30-year-old many bundesliga fans would probably classify as a journeyman .
but ask the man himself and he 'll tell you that goal-getting is an innate ability that 's anything but the norm .
" i started playing football really young , and i was always a striker , " gekas said in interview with the german football league .
" i was born with my scoring ability .
it seems like a gift from god . "
his teammates had another potentially supernatural explanation after gekas scored a brace on saturday .
“ we asked ourselves in the dressing room if he 's sold his soul , ” defender marco russ told the bild newspaper .
“ even his badly taken penalty went in . ”
gekas came to the bundesliga in 2005 on a one-year loan from panathinaikos athens to bochum and promptly won the league scoring title .
his then coach described him as " our life-insurance policy . "
but bochum decided they could not afford the premiums and failed to exercise their right to purchase the greek goal-getter .
it was a bad decision .
bochum became a perennial relegation candidate and now play in the second division .
for his part , gekas moved on to leverkusen , where he never established himself .
although he scored a respectable 11 goals in his first season with his new club , he was often criticized as lacking in work ethic and was loaned out to hertha berlin at the beginning of 2010 .
with hertha also getting relegated , gekas formally returned to leverkusen , before promptly moving on to frankfurt .
his was hardly one of the high-profile signings of the off-season , but now he 's getting a chance to prove that his detractors , if not completely wrong , missed the point .
ice-cold killer bildunterschrift : in addition to his 11 league goals , gekas has scored 2 in the german cup gekas is neither a particularly great dribbler or passer , and he 's never been known to track back and help out on defense .
but he is one of the most prolific poachers the league has seen in recent years .
that 's just the way he described the role of a striker in a recent interview .
" the most important thing is that -lsb- a striker -rsb- has good teammates who are always looking to get him the ball , " gekas told the online portal of the eurosport television network .
" in addition , he needs the talent to get himself in the right position to score goals . "
on teams that fail to utilize his nose for goal , gekas is most conspicuous for the amount of times he 's caught offside .
but on teams that figure out how to employ his particular talent , he can be lethal .
indeed , a tarantino-esque tattoo on gekas ' arm reads " eiskalter vollstrecker , " -lrb- ice-cold killer -rrb- - the nickname he earned at bochum .
understatement , as you 've probably guessed by now , is n't gekas ' strong suit .
" the fact that i did n't score -lsb- for leverkusen and hertha -rsb- was because the people in positions of responsibility did n't trust me , " gekas told the bundesliga .
" but frankfurt coach michael skibbe , whom i know from my time in leverkusen , does have that trust .
that has a direct effect on my game and the number of goals i score . "
instinct and vision bildunterschrift : gekas has been doing all his talking on pitch this season seen negatively , gekas is one-dimensional .
seen positively , he does exactly what he 's supposed to do , hang around in dangerous positions and convert chances as they materialize .
wolfsburg were given a display of the latter qualities , as their trip to frankfurt on saturday ended in a 3-1 defeat .
the hosts ' first goal in that match was archetypal gekas .
the greek striker lurked on the edge of the penalty area , and when a low pass came his way , he took it directly and curled it into the bottom left-hand corner .
the goal was only possible because gekas did n't hesitate or try to control the ball , but rather reacted on instinct .
that 's a quality his coach appreciates .
" there are n't many strikers who can see a situation in advance as well as gekas , " michael skibbe told the bild newspaper earlier this season .
" in the build-up , he follows pass combinations very intensely and then instinctively runs where he expects the ball to be . "
gekas goals may often appear to be lucky , but the numbers argue for his basic quality .
in addition to his achievements in the bundesliga , the striker has scored 20 goals in 51 matches for the greek national team .
gekas officially retired from the greece squad in september , citing " special circumstances . "
few people , if indeed anyone other than the striker himself , knew what he was referring to .
that 's not uncommon with gekas , who , despite playing for years in the bundesliga , says he sees no need to learn german .
and this season , he 's drastically scaled back the number of interviews he 's prepared to give .
but if gekas can keep up anything near his early pace of a goal per game , no one is likely to care about his disinterest in communication .
as he himself might say , a striker 's job is not to make himself understood .
putting the ball in the net speaks louder than words .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de travel -pipe- 08.11.2010 eu scraps visa requirements for albania and bosnia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albanians and bosnians may enter the eu for three months albania and bosnia are soon to join other balkan countries in enjoying visa-free travel to the european union , eu interior ministers announced monday .
the ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security . interior ministers of the european union 's 27 member states unanimously agreed on monday to eliminate visa requirements for citizens of albania and bosnia-herzegovina .
under the agreement , albanians and bosnians with biometric passports would be able to travel to the 25 eu nations in the border-free schengen zone , which excludes ireland and the united kingdom , for up to three months .
the decision came after france , germany and the netherlands expressed concerns that there could be an increase in unfounded asylum claims from the two countries .
the eu got rid of visa requirements for serbia , montenegro and macedonia late last year , apparently leading to an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia .
european commission could roll back decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has seen an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia the ministers stipulated that the european commission could " propose the suspension of visa-free travel " if it felt that citizens of the two countries were abusing the system .
" it is of the utmost importance that albania and bosnia-herzegovina continue to intensify their information campaign with the aim to properly explain to their citizens the meaning of short-term visa-free travel , " cecilia malmstrom , eu commissioner for home affairs , said in a statement .
" a visa-free regime also comes with responsibilities . "
malmstrom said the european parliament and the bloc 's member states must still approve the proposal , and that it could enter into force as early as mid-december .
it would leave kosovo , whose independence is not recognized by all eu states , as the only balkan country without visa-free travel in the eu .
both bosnia and albania hope to join the eu , but face years of tough democratic reforms before they will likely be able to do so .
stricter rules on cargo security eu interior ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security in the aftermath of a string of eu-bound parcel bombs originating from yemen and greece last week .
for instance , airports with inadequate security measures could appear on a blacklist . german interior minister thomas de maiziere said security concerns should trump fears over extra costs due to increased control procedures . " if this is going to be more expensive , then it might be a little more expensive .
there is no security for free " , de maiziere told reporters before presenting his five key points to his eu colleagues . according to de maiziere , the eu must focus on coordination before halting cargo shipments , agree on which countries are to be considered unsafe freight senders , improve security in those unsafe airports , tighten controls on suspect parcels and define responsibilities between commercial shippers and national authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there is no security for free , " says de maiziere the german proposal was welcomed by belgian interior minister annemie turtelboom who is in charge of chairing the eu meeting . " when we see everything that happened last week , we must really discuss how we can travel together , work together and how we can work together not only with the united states but also with some countries in africa , " she said . spanish interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba called measures on enhancing security coordination " an ever more pressing need " for eu countries . but siim kallas , eu transport commissioner , warned on friday that panic should not lead to an excessive increase of security measures . " the fight against terrorism is eternal , and aviation remains the most sensitive target for such attacks , but panic is not the remedy , " he said .
" we must find a proportionate and adequate response . " de maiziere wants to implement a working group which is due to get results by the end of this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de travel -pipe- 08.11.2010 eu scraps visa requirements for albania and bosnia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : albanians and bosnians may enter the eu for three months albania and bosnia are soon to join other balkan countries in enjoying visa-free travel to the european union , eu interior ministers announced monday .
the ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security . interior ministers of the european union 's 27 member states unanimously agreed on monday to eliminate visa requirements for citizens of albania and bosnia-herzegovina .
under the agreement , albanians and bosnians with biometric passports would be able to travel to the 25 eu nations in the border-free schengen zone , which excludes ireland and the united kingdom , for up to three months .
the decision came after france , germany and the netherlands expressed concerns that there could be an increase in unfounded asylum claims from the two countries .
the eu got rid of visa requirements for serbia , montenegro and macedonia late last year , apparently leading to an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia .
european commission could roll back decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has seen an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia the ministers stipulated that the european commission could " propose the suspension of visa-free travel " if it felt that citizens of the two countries were abusing the system .
" it is of the utmost importance that albania and bosnia-herzegovina continue to intensify their information campaign with the aim to properly explain to their citizens the meaning of short-term visa-free travel , " cecilia malmstrom , eu commissioner for home affairs , said in a statement .
" a visa-free regime also comes with responsibilities . "
malmstrom said the european parliament and the bloc 's member states must still approve the proposal , and that it could enter into force as early as mid-december .
it would leave kosovo , whose independence is not recognized by all eu states , as the only balkan country without visa-free travel in the eu .
both bosnia and albania hope to join the eu , but face years of tough democratic reforms before they will likely be able to do so .
stricter rules on cargo security eu interior ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security in the aftermath of a string of eu-bound parcel bombs originating from yemen and greece last week .
for instance , airports with inadequate security measures could appear on a blacklist . german interior minister thomas de maiziere said security concerns should trump fears over extra costs due to increased control procedures . " if this is going to be more expensive , then it might be a little more expensive .
there is no security for free " , de maiziere told reporters before presenting his five key points to his eu colleagues . according to de maiziere , the eu must focus on coordination before halting cargo shipments , agree on which countries are to be considered unsafe freight senders , improve security in those unsafe airports , tighten controls on suspect parcels and define responsibilities between commercial shippers and national authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there is no security for free , " says de maiziere the german proposal was welcomed by belgian interior minister annemie turtelboom who is in charge of chairing the eu meeting . " when we see everything that happened last week , we must really discuss how we can travel together , work together and how we can work together not only with the united states but also with some countries in africa , " she said . spanish interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba called measures on enhancing security coordination " an ever more pressing need " for eu countries . but siim kallas , eu transport commissioner , warned on friday that panic should not lead to an excessive increase of security measures . " the fight against terrorism is eternal , and aviation remains the most sensitive target for such attacks , but panic is not the remedy , " he said .
" we must find a proportionate and adequate response . " de maiziere wants to implement a working group which is due to get results by the end of this year .

looking ahead to this week 's meeting of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- nations in seoul , the former us trade representative said the world needed a new regime to succeed the bretton woods ii system of floating currencies , which has been in place since the fixed-rate currency system linked to gold broke down in 1971 .
although the gold standard helped guard against inflation , it was abandoned because it did not allow for the flexible monetary policy many economists believe is essential in counteracting economic shocks .
" although textbooks may view gold as the old money , markets are using gold as an alternative monetary asset today , " zoellick wrote .
the new system " is likely to need to involve the dollar , the euro , the yen , the pound and a renminbi -lrb- chinese yuan -rrb- that moves towards internationalization and then an open capital account , " he said .
" the system should also consider employing gold as an international reference point of market expectations about inflation , deflation and future currency values . "
currency war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick says the world needs to rethink currency exchange rates zoellick 's comments came amid fears of a so-called " currency war " that would see countries jostle for trade advantage by massaging their exchange rates lower .
the united states has led accusations that china cheats in world trade by artificially weakening its currency .
but china and germany , both major exporters , have complained that washington 's policy of quantitative easing - effectively printing money - is weakening the dollar and harming emerging markets ' competitiveness .
investors are pumping dollars into emerging markets in search of higher yields , and the potentially destabilizing impact of this , along with big current account deficits and china 's reluctance to let the yuan appreciate faster , are set to dominate the g20 summit on thursday and friday .
new structures france , which takes over the g20 chair after this week 's summit , says it plans to work on a new international monetary system to bring greater currency stability .
beijing 's central bank chief has suggested an alternative monetary system based on using the international monetary fund 's special drawing rights , a notional unit of value based on a basket of major currencies , instead of the dollar as the sole global reserve currency .
zoellick said a new monetary system would take time to develop and should be part of a package approach including possible changes in international monetary fund rules to review capital as well as current account policies , and linking imf monetary assessments to world trade organization obligations .
he also called on the g20 to forge structural reforms , including the promotion of domestic demand in china and the reduction of debt in the united states .

zoellick said a new monetary system would take time to develop and should be part of a package approach including possible changes in international monetary fund rules to review capital as well as current account policies , and linking imf monetary assessments to world trade organization obligations .
he also called on the g20 to forge structural reforms , including the promotion of domestic demand in china and the reduction of debt in the united states .

now , scientists have found a new way to detect heart disease by analyzing urine . according to the european heart network , some 4.3 million europeans die of heart disease every year - half of all deaths , and it is the main cause of death for european women .
the disease is caused when blood vessels are clogged with plaque , made up of protein and fat .
if too much of this builds up , the blood vessel can rupture and blood flow is blocked , causing a heart attack .
when the disease has advanced this far , it can be too late to treat effectively .
most medical officials suggest that cholesterol and blood pressure be monitored regularly , but this is n't always done in practice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heart disease is caused by a build-up of fat and protein in blood vessels however , a new paper , published this month in the journal of hypertension , proposed a new method of potential diagnosing heart disease by analyzing urine .
" we analyzed all the proteins in the urine and asked the question , ' are there distinct differences between patients that have coronary heart disease and those that do not have coronary heart disease ? " ' one of the paper 's authors , harald mischak , a professor of proteomics at the university of glasgow in scotland , told deutsche welle .
protein content the scientists looked at a series of peptides and proteins that are present in plaque build-up in the arteries , including the long protein collagen .
some collagen , along with other proteins , makes its way into the body 's waste system , and is eventually excreted .
researchers were able to isolate the difference in urine samples between hundreds of people with known heart disease and hundreds known not to have it .
they then determined that by scanning for this protein signature , they could use it as a diagnostic tool for yet another set of patients that might be at risk in the future .
mischak added that this also changes the fundamental understanding of what heart disease is .
" i think it is well-justified to see coronary heart disease not as an isolated disease but rather as a systemic vascular disease , " the austrian scientist noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heart disease is connected to obesity and kills several million people a year ' an important step ' dr. bukurt pieske , head of the division of cardiology at the university of graz in austria , said this new method could be a significant improvement .
he added that previous scanning tools , like ecgs or heart biopsies , were more complicated and invasive .
" they have developed a risk score for coronary artery disease or a diagnostic score for coronary heart disease that was better than any previous non-invasive marker for coronary heart disease , " said pieske .
" if this is proven and can be repeated , this would be a big step forward . "
pieske added that , apart from the people who have already shown some symptoms of heart disease , another group could benefit .
" we can identify people at risk who are asymptomatic , who do not know anything about their early stage of the disease and these people are very amenable to preventive measures , to prevent the disease from evolving , " he said .

"
his statement , made in an address to members of both of india 's houses of parliament , was greeted with thunderous desk-thumping .
while clearly indicating that any such move lies well in the future , the comment , and the praise-filled speech he gave , was considered by many to be a major sign of growing economic and security ties between india and the united states .
in his speech , obama said the country had established itself as a world power and as a natural ally of the united states on the global stage . he promised the two countries would work as equal partners on projects in afghanistan , as well as broaden their dialogue to include nuclear proliferation and regional security in east asia .
diwali dance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michelle obama danced at a celebration of diwali , the festival of lights overall , obama 's visit to india was seen as a success .
he and his wife , michelle , reached out to sections of the country 's political and business classes , as well as students , villagers and artisans .
kicking off his visit in mumbai , india 's financial capital , obama pleased the crowd by saying this was his first visit to india but " my longest visit to another country since becoming president . " in mumbai , both the first lady and the president interacted with college students , and the first lady broke into an impromptu dance while meeting students in a primary school during a celebration of the hindu festival of diwali .
promising to remove restrictions on sensitive high-tech exports - a nagging irritant in the evolution of bilateral ties - obama declared deals worth $ 15 billion -lrb- 10.6 billion euros -rrb- that would support some 54,000 american jobs and seek to answer critics back home .
his description of india as a world power set the tone for negotiations with the political leadership in new delhi that saw a raft of commercial deals signed and agreements to cooperate more closely in agriculture , health and energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visit to humayun 's tomb in new delhi was part of the program ' defining and indispensible partnership ' " i believe that the relationship between the us and india will be one of the defining and indispensable partnerships of the 21st century , " said obama .
" our nations are the two largest democracies on earth .
we are bound by a common language and common values , shared aspirations and a shared belief that opportunity should be limited only by how hard you are willing to work , only by how hard you are willing to try . "
this sentiment was reciprocated by indian prime minister manmohan singh .
" the new deals that have been struck , they all happen to be in infrastructure .
and infrastructure today is the biggest bottleneck to the faster growth of india , to the faster growth of employment .
and these deals the president has mentioned are truly an example of trade being a win-win situation for both countries . "
alongside singh , obama said while both india and pakistan had an interest in reducing tensions in the region , the us " can not impose a solution to these problems . "
he made it clear that it was up to india and pakistan to settle their differences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama inspected the troops at the presidential palace in new dehli " i am absolutely convinced that it is in both india 's and pakistan 's interest to reduce tensions and that will enable them , i think , to focus on the range of both challenges and opportunities each country faces , " he said .
singh pointed out that he was willing to engage pakistan on all issues including kashmir but not when the terror infrastructure was still intact .
" we are committed to engaging pakistan , we are committed to resolve all outstanding issues between our two countries including the word ' k ' , we are not afraid of that .
but it is our request that you can not simultaneously be talking and at the same time , the terror machine is active as ever before , " he said .

now , scientists have found a new way to detect heart disease by analyzing urine . according to the european heart network , some 4.3 million europeans die of heart disease every year - half of all deaths , and it is the main cause of death for european women .
the disease is caused when blood vessels are clogged with plaque , made up of protein and fat .
if too much of this builds up , the blood vessel can rupture and blood flow is blocked , causing a heart attack .
when the disease has advanced this far , it can be too late to treat effectively .
most medical officials suggest that cholesterol and blood pressure be monitored regularly , but this is n't always done in practice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heart disease is caused by a build-up of fat and protein in blood vessels however , a new paper , published this month in the journal of hypertension , proposed a new method of potential diagnosing heart disease by analyzing urine .
" we analyzed all the proteins in the urine and asked the question , ' are there distinct differences between patients that have coronary heart disease and those that do not have coronary heart disease ? " ' one of the paper 's authors , harald mischak , a professor of proteomics at the university of glasgow in scotland , told deutsche welle .
protein content the scientists looked at a series of peptides and proteins that are present in plaque build-up in the arteries , including the long protein collagen .
some collagen , along with other proteins , makes its way into the body 's waste system , and is eventually excreted .
researchers were able to isolate the difference in urine samples between hundreds of people with known heart disease and hundreds known not to have it .
they then determined that by scanning for this protein signature , they could use it as a diagnostic tool for yet another set of patients that might be at risk in the future .
mischak added that this also changes the fundamental understanding of what heart disease is .
" i think it is well-justified to see coronary heart disease not as an isolated disease but rather as a systemic vascular disease , " the austrian scientist noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heart disease is connected to obesity and kills several million people a year ' an important step ' dr. bukurt pieske , head of the division of cardiology at the university of graz in austria , said this new method could be a significant improvement .
he added that previous scanning tools , like ecgs or heart biopsies , were more complicated and invasive .
" they have developed a risk score for coronary artery disease or a diagnostic score for coronary heart disease that was better than any previous non-invasive marker for coronary heart disease , " said pieske .
" if this is proven and can be repeated , this would be a big step forward . "
pieske added that , apart from the people who have already shown some symptoms of heart disease , another group could benefit .
" we can identify people at risk who are asymptomatic , who do not know anything about their early stage of the disease and these people are very amenable to preventive measures , to prevent the disease from evolving , " he said .

now , scientists have found a new way to detect heart disease by analyzing urine . according to the european heart network , some 4.3 million europeans die of heart disease every year - half of all deaths , and it is the main cause of death for european women .
the disease is caused when blood vessels are clogged with plaque , made up of protein and fat .
if too much of this builds up , the blood vessel can rupture and blood flow is blocked , causing a heart attack .
when the disease has advanced this far , it can be too late to treat effectively .
most medical officials suggest that cholesterol and blood pressure be monitored regularly , but this is n't always done in practice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heart disease is caused by a build-up of fat and protein in blood vessels however , a new paper , published this month in the journal of hypertension , proposed a new method of potential diagnosing heart disease by analyzing urine .
" we analyzed all the proteins in the urine and asked the question , ' are there distinct differences between patients that have coronary heart disease and those that do not have coronary heart disease ? " ' one of the paper 's authors , harald mischak , a professor of proteomics at the university of glasgow in scotland , told deutsche welle .
protein content the scientists looked at a series of peptides and proteins that are present in plaque build-up in the arteries , including the long protein collagen .
some collagen , along with other proteins , makes its way into the body 's waste system , and is eventually excreted .
researchers were able to isolate the difference in urine samples between hundreds of people with known heart disease and hundreds known not to have it .
they then determined that by scanning for this protein signature , they could use it as a diagnostic tool for yet another set of patients that might be at risk in the future .
mischak added that this also changes the fundamental understanding of what heart disease is .
" i think it is well-justified to see coronary heart disease not as an isolated disease but rather as a systemic vascular disease , " the austrian scientist noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heart disease is connected to obesity and kills several million people a year ' an important step ' dr. bukurt pieske , head of the division of cardiology at the university of graz in austria , said this new method could be a significant improvement .
he added that previous scanning tools , like ecgs or heart biopsies , were more complicated and invasive .
" they have developed a risk score for coronary artery disease or a diagnostic score for coronary heart disease that was better than any previous non-invasive marker for coronary heart disease , " said pieske .
" if this is proven and can be repeated , this would be a big step forward . "
pieske added that , apart from the people who have already shown some symptoms of heart disease , another group could benefit .
" we can identify people at risk who are asymptomatic , who do not know anything about their early stage of the disease and these people are very amenable to preventive measures , to prevent the disease from evolving , " he said .

the junta has placed the country under a 90-day state of emergency . vote counting in myanmar 's first election in 20 years began monday amid accusations of voter intimidation and fraud as well as condemnation by the international community that the weekend election was neither free nor fair .
as counting of votes got underway , a fire fight erupted between a splinter group of armed forces from the democratic karen buddhist army -lrb- dkba -rrb- and the army in the border town of myawaddy leading to hundreds of people being forced to flee into thailand for safety .
reports also say the government has placed the country under a 90-day state of emergency .
army-backed parties set to sweep polls over 3,000 candidates had stood from 37 parties for national parliament and regional assemblies in sunday 's vote .
but harsh election laws had prevented several parties from taking part including opposition leader , aung san suu kyi 's national league for democracy or nld .

the armed forces are also guaranteed a quarter of parliamentary seats under a 2008 constitution .
ron hoffman , canadian ambassador to thailand and myanmar , said the international community needs to keep pressure on myanmar ’ s military .
" it 's not a democratic exercise .
it does n't even come close to meeting any standard of international electoral processes . "
aung san suu kyi 's detention expires on saturday soe aung , a spokesman for the forum for democracy in burma , says the parliament will have little power but to act as a rubber stamp for the military leaders .
he says the parliament will be dominated by the regime backed candidates after the elections .
" and the parliamentarians will have no other chance but to become a rubber stamp parliament to endorse the executive council or the national security and defence council , by name .
this would be headed by the president and also the commander in chief .
this council will run the country after all . "

if the nobel laureate is freed analysts expect she will face tough restrictions after spending much of the past two decades under detention .

"
his statement , made in an address to members of both of india 's houses of parliament , was greeted with thunderous desk-thumping .
while clearly indicating that any such move lies well in the future , the comment , and the praise-filled speech he gave , was considered by many to be a major sign of growing economic and security ties between india and the united states .
in his speech , obama said the country had established itself as a world power and as a natural ally of the united states on the global stage . he promised the two countries would work as equal partners on projects in afghanistan , as well as broaden their dialogue to include nuclear proliferation and regional security in east asia .
diwali dance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michelle obama danced at a celebration of diwali , the festival of lights overall , obama 's visit to india was seen as a success .
he and his wife , michelle , reached out to sections of the country 's political and business classes , as well as students , villagers and artisans .
kicking off his visit in mumbai , india 's financial capital , obama pleased the crowd by saying this was his first visit to india but " my longest visit to another country since becoming president . " in mumbai , both the first lady and the president interacted with college students , and the first lady broke into an impromptu dance while meeting students in a primary school during a celebration of the hindu festival of diwali .
promising to remove restrictions on sensitive high-tech exports - a nagging irritant in the evolution of bilateral ties - obama declared deals worth $ 15 billion -lrb- 10.6 billion euros -rrb- that would support some 54,000 american jobs and seek to answer critics back home .
his description of india as a world power set the tone for negotiations with the political leadership in new delhi that saw a raft of commercial deals signed and agreements to cooperate more closely in agriculture , health and energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visit to humayun 's tomb in new delhi was part of the program ' defining and indispensible partnership ' " i believe that the relationship between the us and india will be one of the defining and indispensable partnerships of the 21st century , " said obama .
" our nations are the two largest democracies on earth .
we are bound by a common language and common values , shared aspirations and a shared belief that opportunity should be limited only by how hard you are willing to work , only by how hard you are willing to try . "
this sentiment was reciprocated by indian prime minister manmohan singh .
" the new deals that have been struck , they all happen to be in infrastructure .
and infrastructure today is the biggest bottleneck to the faster growth of india , to the faster growth of employment .
and these deals the president has mentioned are truly an example of trade being a win-win situation for both countries . "
alongside singh , obama said while both india and pakistan had an interest in reducing tensions in the region , the us " can not impose a solution to these problems . "
he made it clear that it was up to india and pakistan to settle their differences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama inspected the troops at the presidential palace in new dehli " i am absolutely convinced that it is in both india 's and pakistan 's interest to reduce tensions and that will enable them , i think , to focus on the range of both challenges and opportunities each country faces , " he said .
singh pointed out that he was willing to engage pakistan on all issues including kashmir but not when the terror infrastructure was still intact .
" we are committed to engaging pakistan , we are committed to resolve all outstanding issues between our two countries including the word ' k ' , we are not afraid of that .
but it is our request that you can not simultaneously be talking and at the same time , the terror machine is active as ever before , " he said .
obama continues his 10-day asia trip in indonesia on tuesday , and then travels on to south korea and japan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear -pipe- 08.11.2010 mounting disappointments boost anti-nuclear protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence broke out between police and some demonstrators the massive demos along the route of the radioactive waste transport to gorleben have benefitted from other hot spots like stuttgart 21 , a controversial infrastructure project . the ongoing civil disobedience campaign against a train delivery of nuclear waste to a storage facility in gorleben is being reported as one of the biggest of its kind ever in germany .
up to 17,000 policemen , at a cost of up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- , were used over the weekend to keep an estimated 35,000 people from blocking the path of the train , and more demonstrators – along with local farmers - are continuing to arrive to block the path of the road convoy as it continues its journey .
there were varying reports of whether violence had occurred .
the police said that officers had been directly attacked , while protest organizers countered that demonstrators had only sabotaged the tracks .
rainer wendt , head of the police union , said , the officers " proceeded very sensitively , " and " made the right decision – namely to carry the people from the tracks . "
he added that where violence was used against police officers , they reacted " accordingly " and " proportionately . "
dirk seifert , spokesman for the environmental protest group robin wood , told a different story .
" you have to say that the police were disproportionate in their use of tear-gas and pepper spray , " he told deutsche welle .
" the police also hit people who were already lying on the ground , both with their fists as well as truncheons . "
there was also the issue of what happened to those peaceful protesters once they were removed from the tracks .
seifert complained of demonstrators being kept for hours on end in an open field in the cold of the night .
" that is usually called false imprisonment , he said , " the law says people have to be brought to a custodial judge as soon as possible .
that did not happen . "
bildunterschrift : the protests continued throughout the weekend and into monday issues converging what has made this particular demonstration so explosive is the coincidence of this transport of nuclear waste with the government 's decision to overturn former legislation aimed at phasing out nuclear power by around 2020 .
chancellor angela merkel 's conservative coalition of christian democrats and the pro-business free democrats , recently passed a bill through parliament allowing nuclear power stations to remain open another 12 years .
environment minister norbert roettgen has been at pains to separate the issues of lifespan-extension and dealing with nuclear waste .
" we have been using nuclear power for over 40 years , " he said .
" we have created electricity from it and created waste , and we have a responsibility to deal with that – independent of the question of lifespan extension . "
yet seifert is unimpressed with this distinction .
" the fact is that this government has decided to produce even more nuclear waste by extending the life spans of the existing nuclear power stations . "
but some demonstrators arrived at the railway tracks with self-evidently different agendas .
stuttgart 21 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgarters angry about a new railway station have joined the anti-nuclear protests several protestors against the new railway station known as stuttgart 21 were also present , and were celebrated at the podium .
this suggests that the anti-nuclear movement has become a rallying point for many people who feel the current government 's policies are leaving them disenfranchised .
" there is a growing feeling that policies are being made for minorities or a certain clientele , like large corporations , and that this government does not see it as necessary to work for the good of the whole population , " said seifert .
" a lot of people in stuttgart have the feeling that their opinion is not respected – the government is just doing what it wants over the heads of the population . "
opinion polls show that opposition political parties , particularly the greens , are benefitting from this groundswell .
indeed , prominent green party figure claudia roth took part in the weekend 's demonstrations , though politicians were not permitted to speak at the podium .
" we are certainly interested in working together with members of those parties , but the parties have the parliament , and we have the streets , " said seifert .
" we are a social movement and we have to separate the two places of expression . "

up to 17,000 policemen , at a cost of up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- , were used over the weekend to keep an estimated 35,000 people from blocking the path of the train , and more demonstrators – along with local farmers - are continuing to arrive to block the path of the road convoy as it continues its journey .
there were varying reports of whether violence had occurred .
the police said that officers had been directly attacked , while protest organizers countered that demonstrators had only sabotaged the tracks .
rainer wendt , head of the police union , said , the officers " proceeded very sensitively , " and " made the right decision – namely to carry the people from the tracks . "
he added that where violence was used against police officers , they reacted " accordingly " and " proportionately . "
dirk seifert , spokesman for the environmental protest group robin wood , told a different story .
" you have to say that the police were disproportionate in their use of tear-gas and pepper spray , " he told deutsche welle .
" the police also hit people who were already lying on the ground , both with their fists as well as truncheons . "
there was also the issue of what happened to those peaceful protesters once they were removed from the tracks .
seifert complained of demonstrators being kept for hours on end in an open field in the cold of the night .
" that is usually called false imprisonment , he said , " the law says people have to be brought to a custodial judge as soon as possible .
that did not happen . "
bildunterschrift : the protests continued throughout the weekend and into monday issues converging what has made this particular demonstration so explosive is the coincidence of this transport of nuclear waste with the government 's decision to overturn former legislation aimed at phasing out nuclear power by around 2020 .
chancellor angela merkel 's conservative coalition of christian democrats and the pro-business free democrats , recently passed a bill through parliament allowing nuclear power stations to remain open another 12 years .
environment minister norbert roettgen has been at pains to separate the issues of lifespan-extension and dealing with nuclear waste .
" we have been using nuclear power for over 40 years , " he said .
" we have created electricity from it and created waste , and we have a responsibility to deal with that – independent of the question of lifespan extension . "
yet seifert is unimpressed with this distinction .
" the fact is that this government has decided to produce even more nuclear waste by extending the life spans of the existing nuclear power stations . "
but some demonstrators arrived at the railway tracks with self-evidently different agendas .
stuttgart 21 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgarters angry about a new railway station have joined the anti-nuclear protests several protestors against the new railway station known as stuttgart 21 were also present , and were celebrated at the podium .
this suggests that the anti-nuclear movement has become a rallying point for many people who feel the current government 's policies are leaving them disenfranchised .
" there is a growing feeling that policies are being made for minorities or a certain clientele , like large corporations , and that this government does not see it as necessary to work for the good of the whole population , " said seifert .
" a lot of people in stuttgart have the feeling that their opinion is not respected – the government is just doing what it wants over the heads of the population . "
opinion polls show that opposition political parties , particularly the greens , are benefitting from this groundswell .
indeed , prominent green party figure claudia roth took part in the weekend 's demonstrations , though politicians were not permitted to speak at the podium .
" we are certainly interested in working together with members of those parties , but the parties have the parliament , and we have the streets , " said seifert .
" we are a social movement and we have to separate the two places of expression . "

up to 17,000 policemen , at a cost of up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- , were used over the weekend to keep an estimated 35,000 people from blocking the path of the train , and more demonstrators – along with local farmers - are continuing to arrive to block the path of the road convoy as it continues its journey .
there were varying reports of whether violence had occurred .
the police said that officers had been directly attacked , while protest organizers countered that demonstrators had only sabotaged the tracks .
rainer wendt , head of the police union , said , the officers " proceeded very sensitively , " and " made the right decision – namely to carry the people from the tracks . "
he added that where violence was used against police officers , they reacted " accordingly " and " proportionately . "
dirk seifert , spokesman for the environmental protest group robin wood , told a different story .
" you have to say that the police were disproportionate in their use of tear-gas and pepper spray , " he told deutsche welle .
" the police also hit people who were already lying on the ground , both with their fists as well as truncheons . "
there was also the issue of what happened to those peaceful protesters once they were removed from the tracks .
seifert complained of demonstrators being kept for hours on end in an open field in the cold of the night .
" that is usually called false imprisonment , he said , " the law says people have to be brought to a custodial judge as soon as possible .
that did not happen . "
bildunterschrift : the protests continued throughout the weekend and into monday issues converging what has made this particular demonstration so explosive is the coincidence of this transport of nuclear waste with the government 's decision to overturn former legislation aimed at phasing out nuclear power by around 2020 .
chancellor angela merkel 's conservative coalition of christian democrats and the pro-business free democrats , recently passed a bill through parliament allowing nuclear power stations to remain open another 12 years .
environment minister norbert roettgen has been at pains to separate the issues of lifespan-extension and dealing with nuclear waste .
" we have been using nuclear power for over 40 years , " he said .
" we have created electricity from it and created waste , and we have a responsibility to deal with that – independent of the question of lifespan extension . "
yet seifert is unimpressed with this distinction .
" the fact is that this government has decided to produce even more nuclear waste by extending the life spans of the existing nuclear power stations . "
but some demonstrators arrived at the railway tracks with self-evidently different agendas .
stuttgart 21 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgarters angry about a new railway station have joined the anti-nuclear protests several protestors against the new railway station known as stuttgart 21 were also present , and were celebrated at the podium .
this suggests that the anti-nuclear movement has become a rallying point for many people who feel the current government 's policies are leaving them disenfranchised .
" there is a growing feeling that policies are being made for minorities or a certain clientele , like large corporations , and that this government does not see it as necessary to work for the good of the whole population , " said seifert .
" a lot of people in stuttgart have the feeling that their opinion is not respected – the government is just doing what it wants over the heads of the population . "
opinion polls show that opposition political parties , particularly the greens , are benefitting from this groundswell .
indeed , prominent green party figure claudia roth took part in the weekend 's demonstrations , though politicians were not permitted to speak at the podium .
" we are certainly interested in working together with members of those parties , but the parties have the parliament , and we have the streets , " said seifert .
" we are a social movement and we have to separate the two places of expression . "

as one man remains in a coma after a weekend beating , two more journalists have reported being attacked . as two more journalist beatings were reported in russia on monday , president dmitry medvedev said those behind a near-fatal attack over the weekend would be found and punished .
reacting to intense media scrutiny over the handling of previous journalist beatings , medvedev said the culprits responsible for the saturday beating of kommersant business daily reporter oleg kashin would be held accountable , regardless of their potential rank or title .
" whoever is involved in this crime will be punished , regardless of his position , place in society or accomplishments , " medvedev said in comments broadcast on state television throughout the evening .
" i have seen it written in the press that -lsb- the people behind the crime -rsb- will not be found .
they will be found .
there is no doubt . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kashin remains in a coma after his near-death beating the russian prosecutor general called monday for any witnesses of the beating to come forward .
he said investigators had as of yet received no leads in the case .
in the line of fire medvedev added that assaults on reporters must be treated with extra care by society and not be grouped with other crimes .
" reporters are people who find themselves in an area of heightened risk , " he said .
the president 's comments come as purported video footage of the weekend beating hit russian websites and state tv news .
the recording showed two assailants attack a man as he approached a gate to a residential building at night .
one person held him by the upper body while the other beat him with what appeared to be a metal shaft .
kashin remains in a coma , his legs , skull and fingers smashed in one of a long line of attacks on russia reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya was murdered in 2006 international condemnation the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , called the attack " brutal " and " obviously unacceptable . "
the media freedom representative of the organization for security and cooperation in europe , dunja mijatovic , said the assault " confirms a worrying trend of continuous violence against journalists " in russia .
there have been 19 unsolved murders of journalists in russia since 2000 , including the 2006 killing of kremlin critic anna politkovskaya .
meanwhile , two more journalist beatings were reported monday .
one was a reporter with the zhukovskiye vesti suburban moscow weekly , and the other the editor of the volga region 's saratovsky reporter .
zhukovskiye reporter anatoly adamchuk says he was struck twice in the head and was recuperating at home .
he said the only item stolen during the incident was his computer memory card .

the junta has placed the country under a 90-day state of emergency . vote counting in myanmar 's first election in 20 years began monday amid accusations of voter intimidation and fraud as well as condemnation by the international community that the weekend election was neither free nor fair .
as counting of votes got underway , a fire fight erupted between a splinter group of armed forces from the democratic karen buddhist army -lrb- dkba -rrb- and the army in the border town of myawaddy leading to hundreds of people being forced to flee into thailand for safety .
reports also say the government has placed the country under a 90-day state of emergency .
army-backed parties set to sweep polls over 3,000 candidates had stood from 37 parties for national parliament and regional assemblies in sunday 's vote .
but harsh election laws had prevented several parties from taking part including opposition leader , aung san suu kyi 's national league for democracy or nld .

the armed forces are also guaranteed a quarter of parliamentary seats under a 2008 constitution .
ron hoffman , canadian ambassador to thailand and myanmar , said the international community needs to keep pressure on myanmar ’ s military .
" it 's not a democratic exercise .
it does n't even come close to meeting any standard of international electoral processes . "
aung san suu kyi 's detention expires on saturday soe aung , a spokesman for the forum for democracy in burma , says the parliament will have little power but to act as a rubber stamp for the military leaders .
he says the parliament will be dominated by the regime backed candidates after the elections .
" and the parliamentarians will have no other chance but to become a rubber stamp parliament to endorse the executive council or the national security and defence council , by name .
this would be headed by the president and also the commander in chief .
this council will run the country after all . "

and this year the crafty greek is reminding opponents just how uncannily efficient he can be . after eleven rounds of play , no one had more goals - 11 in total - than a 30-year-old many bundesliga fans would probably classify as a journeyman .
but ask the man himself and he 'll tell you that goal-getting is an innate ability that 's anything but the norm .
" i started playing football really young , and i was always a striker , " gekas said in interview with the german football league .
" i was born with my scoring ability .
it seems like a gift from god . "
his teammates had another potentially supernatural explanation after gekas scored a brace on saturday .
“ we asked ourselves in the dressing room if he 's sold his soul , ” defender marco russ told the bild newspaper .
“ even his badly taken penalty went in . ”
gekas came to the bundesliga in 2005 on a one-year loan from panathinaikos athens to bochum and promptly won the league scoring title .
his then coach described him as " our life-insurance policy . "
but bochum decided they could not afford the premiums and failed to exercise their right to purchase the greek goal-getter .
it was a bad decision .
bochum became a perennial relegation candidate and now play in the second division .
for his part , gekas moved on to leverkusen , where he never established himself .
although he scored a respectable 11 goals in his first season with his new club , he was often criticized as lacking in work ethic and was loaned out to hertha berlin at the beginning of 2010 .
with hertha also getting relegated , gekas formally returned to leverkusen , before promptly moving on to frankfurt .
his was hardly one of the high-profile signings of the off-season , but now he 's getting a chance to prove that his detractors , if not completely wrong , missed the point .
ice-cold killer bildunterschrift : in addition to his 11 league goals , gekas has scored 2 in the german cup gekas is neither a particularly great dribbler or passer , and he 's never been known to track back and help out on defense .
but he is one of the most prolific poachers the league has seen in recent years .
that 's just the way he described the role of a striker in a recent interview .
" the most important thing is that -lsb- a striker -rsb- has good teammates who are always looking to get him the ball , " gekas told the online portal of the eurosport television network .
" in addition , he needs the talent to get himself in the right position to score goals . "
on teams that fail to utilize his nose for goal , gekas is most conspicuous for the amount of times he 's caught offside .
but on teams that figure out how to employ his particular talent , he can be lethal .
indeed , a tarantino-esque tattoo on gekas ' arm reads " eiskalter vollstrecker , " -lrb- ice-cold killer -rrb- - the nickname he earned at bochum .
understatement , as you 've probably guessed by now , is n't gekas ' strong suit .
" the fact that i did n't score -lsb- for leverkusen and hertha -rsb- was because the people in positions of responsibility did n't trust me , " gekas told the bundesliga .
" but frankfurt coach michael skibbe , whom i know from my time in leverkusen , does have that trust .
that has a direct effect on my game and the number of goals i score . "
instinct and vision bildunterschrift : gekas has been doing all his talking on pitch this season seen negatively , gekas is one-dimensional .
seen positively , he does exactly what he 's supposed to do , hang around in dangerous positions and convert chances as they materialize .
wolfsburg were given a display of the latter qualities , as their trip to frankfurt on saturday ended in a 3-1 defeat .
the hosts ' first goal in that match was archetypal gekas .
the greek striker lurked on the edge of the penalty area , and when a low pass came his way , he took it directly and curled it into the bottom left-hand corner .
the goal was only possible because gekas did n't hesitate or try to control the ball , but rather reacted on instinct .
that 's a quality his coach appreciates .
" there are n't many strikers who can see a situation in advance as well as gekas , " michael skibbe told the bild newspaper earlier this season .
" in the build-up , he follows pass combinations very intensely and then instinctively runs where he expects the ball to be . "
gekas goals may often appear to be lucky , but the numbers argue for his basic quality .
in addition to his achievements in the bundesliga , the striker has scored 20 goals in 51 matches for the greek national team .
gekas officially retired from the greece squad in september , citing " special circumstances . "
few people , if indeed anyone other than the striker himself , knew what he was referring to .
that 's not uncommon with gekas , who , despite playing for years in the bundesliga , says he sees no need to learn german .
and this season , he 's drastically scaled back the number of interviews he 's prepared to give .
but if gekas can keep up anything near his early pace of a goal per game , no one is likely to care about his disinterest in communication .
as he himself might say , a striker 's job is not to make himself understood .
putting the ball in the net speaks louder than words .

the greek striker lurked on the edge of the penalty area , and when a low pass came his way , he took it directly and curled it into the bottom left-hand corner .
the goal was only possible because gekas did n't hesitate or try to control the ball , but rather reacted on instinct .
that 's a quality his coach appreciates .
" there are n't many strikers who can see a situation in advance as well as gekas , " michael skibbe told the bild newspaper earlier this season .
" in the build-up , he follows pass combinations very intensely and then instinctively runs where he expects the ball to be . "
gekas goals may often appear to be lucky , but the numbers argue for his basic quality .
in addition to his achievements in the bundesliga , the striker has scored 20 goals in 51 matches for the greek national team .
gekas officially retired from the greece squad in september , citing " special circumstances . "
few people , if indeed anyone other than the striker himself , knew what he was referring to .
that 's not uncommon with gekas , who , despite playing for years in the bundesliga , says he sees no need to learn german .
and this season , he 's drastically scaled back the number of interviews he 's prepared to give .
but if gekas can keep up anything near his early pace of a goal per game , no one is likely to care about his disinterest in communication .
as he himself might say , a striker 's job is not to make himself understood .
putting the ball in the net speaks louder than words .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 08.11.2010 greek striker gekas revives his career at improving frankfurt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gekas made the difference against wolfsburg theofanis gekas is anything but a complete player , but he knows how to do a striker 's main job - score goals .
and this year the crafty greek is reminding opponents just how uncannily efficient he can be . after eleven rounds of play , no one had more goals - 11 in total - than a 30-year-old many bundesliga fans would probably classify as a journeyman .
but ask the man himself and he 'll tell you that goal-getting is an innate ability that 's anything but the norm .
" i started playing football really young , and i was always a striker , " gekas said in interview with the german football league .
" i was born with my scoring ability .
it seems like a gift from god . "
his teammates had another potentially supernatural explanation after gekas scored a brace on saturday .
“ we asked ourselves in the dressing room if he 's sold his soul , ” defender marco russ told the bild newspaper .
“ even his badly taken penalty went in . ”
gekas came to the bundesliga in 2005 on a one-year loan from panathinaikos athens to bochum and promptly won the league scoring title .
his then coach described him as " our life-insurance policy . "
but bochum decided they could not afford the premiums and failed to exercise their right to purchase the greek goal-getter .
it was a bad decision .
bochum became a perennial relegation candidate and now play in the second division .
for his part , gekas moved on to leverkusen , where he never established himself .
although he scored a respectable 11 goals in his first season with his new club , he was often criticized as lacking in work ethic and was loaned out to hertha berlin at the beginning of 2010 .
with hertha also getting relegated , gekas formally returned to leverkusen , before promptly moving on to frankfurt .
his was hardly one of the high-profile signings of the off-season , but now he 's getting a chance to prove that his detractors , if not completely wrong , missed the point .
ice-cold killer bildunterschrift : in addition to his 11 league goals , gekas has scored 2 in the german cup gekas is neither a particularly great dribbler or passer , and he 's never been known to track back and help out on defense .
but he is one of the most prolific poachers the league has seen in recent years .
that 's just the way he described the role of a striker in a recent interview .
" the most important thing is that -lsb- a striker -rsb- has good teammates who are always looking to get him the ball , " gekas told the online portal of the eurosport television network .
" in addition , he needs the talent to get himself in the right position to score goals . "
on teams that fail to utilize his nose for goal , gekas is most conspicuous for the amount of times he 's caught offside .
but on teams that figure out how to employ his particular talent , he can be lethal .
indeed , a tarantino-esque tattoo on gekas ' arm reads " eiskalter vollstrecker , " -lrb- ice-cold killer -rrb- - the nickname he earned at bochum .
understatement , as you 've probably guessed by now , is n't gekas ' strong suit .
" the fact that i did n't score -lsb- for leverkusen and hertha -rsb- was because the people in positions of responsibility did n't trust me , " gekas told the bundesliga .
" but frankfurt coach michael skibbe , whom i know from my time in leverkusen , does have that trust .
that has a direct effect on my game and the number of goals i score . "
instinct and vision bildunterschrift : gekas has been doing all his talking on pitch this season seen negatively , gekas is one-dimensional .
seen positively , he does exactly what he 's supposed to do , hang around in dangerous positions and convert chances as they materialize .
wolfsburg were given a display of the latter qualities , as their trip to frankfurt on saturday ended in a 3-1 defeat .
the hosts ' first goal in that match was archetypal gekas .
the greek striker lurked on the edge of the penalty area , and when a low pass came his way , he took it directly and curled it into the bottom left-hand corner .
the goal was only possible because gekas did n't hesitate or try to control the ball , but rather reacted on instinct .

independence assurance " we are encouraged by the public statements from acs and their direct contact , and intend to actively pursue such an agreement to protect the interests of our minority shareholders , ” mortimer said in a statement .
“ leighton believes the existing governance arrangements , which have been in place for a long period with hochtief , have contributed substantially to the value created for all of leighton 's 67,000 shareholders .
we welcome the opportunity to put in place appropriate and similar governance arrangement with acs . "
in august , acs made a hostile all-share bid to raise its stake in hochtief from 29 percent to 50 percent .

hochtief is running out of options .
last week , german economics minister rainer bruederle said that although he would like to see the company 's headquarters remain on german turf , he was not willing to intervene in the market process .

deutsche welle spoke to the controversial writer alfred grosser who has been chosen to give the keynote speech . on november 9 the author alfred grosser is to give a speech in remembrance of the kristallnacht , or the night of broken glass , pogrom against jews in germany carried out under the nazis in 1938 .
the choice of speaker has caused controversy with historians and germany 's central council of jews questioning grosser 's credentials .
grosser comes from a jewish family and emigrated to france with them in 1933 .
the political academic and author of numerous books and essays is seen as an important pioneer in post-war franco-german understanding .
in recent years he has become increasingly interested in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
his 2009 book " von auschwitz nach jerusalem " -lrb- " from auschwitz to jerusalem " -rrb- caused controversy as he dealt with the question of how much it is permissible to question the policies of israel . germany 's central council of jews is not happy , and has written to the mayor of frankfurt to complain that grosser is an inappropriate choice of speaker .
deutsche welle : alfred grosser , you 're french with german and jewish roots .
you were born in 1925 in frankfurt and fled from there to france in 1933 .
now you are to give a speech in the place of your birth at the november 9 memorial .
regardless of the criticism , what were your thoughts and feelings about doing this ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of synagogues and businesses were attacked during kristallnacht alfred grosser : first of all , there is a need to remember this particular day .
since august 1944 in marseille , when i heard that part of my family had been transported to auschwitz , i have been sure that there is no collective german guilt and yet that i also share some responsibility for the future of liberal democracy in germany .
this was my starting point for the speech .
how exactly does one qualify to make such a speech ?
is it for instance through a certain behaviour or membership of some kind of official jewish organisation .
is only a " real " jew allowed to give such a speech ?
you have been accused of distancing yourself from judaism .
that is , at least , what the german historian michael wolffsohn asserts .
what does that have to do with my speech ?
a non-jew could also be chosen make the speech because the speech should also be for all german people .
there is an enormous volume published by raphael gross that documents all the terrible things that happened .
in contrast , there is also the fact that hundreds of non-jewish germans helped jewish germans .
that is something that is always downplayed .
i will also speak about this .
there is no collective guilt .
how , in 2010 , should november 9 be remembered ?
is there a way of doing it , so that it is not simply a ritual repeating the maxim " never again " ?
perhaps i was invited so that it would not become a pure ritual .
but it now seems that a lot of people in germany are upset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli author david grossman won the 2010 german book trade peace prize there are not that many people , let 's not exaggerate .
yes , the general secretary of the jewish organization - he was very upset .
but , david grossman , who this year won the peace prize of the german book trade is someone who constantly criticizes israeli policy and yet , he won that prize .
so , what 's the problem ?
the problem seems to be that you , it is said , have distanced yourself from judaism and have lived in france for a long time .
it is said that someone like grossman , who comes from israel is on more of a position to criticize , even if he does meet with criticism himself in israel for his opinions .
yes , but it is possible to speak freely in israel .
in germany the central council of jews would like it if there were only one single truth .
the american historian fritz stern and the former chancellor helmut schmidt both said that they are amazed that , from organizations here in germany you only hear a case of " right or wrong – my israel . "
during the german book trade presentation ceremony , i was very moved by what joachim gauck , correctly , said .
" my country right or wrong – if it is right , let it keep it right , if it is wrong , let it set it right . "
that means that we should judge each israeli policy accordingly .
you criticize the policies of israel – for example the policy of occupation and the separation wall between israelis and palestinians .
from a french point of view , why do you think such criticism always leads to such strong reactions from jewish organisations in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grosser praised comments made by joachim gauck -lrb- r . -rrb- at the german book prize it 's exactly the same in france .
one of the people i admire most , the former concentration camp inmate and french ambassador stephane estell - who also worked on the international declaration of human rights - has now travelled to gaza from egypt to see what the situation is like there .
immediately there were complaints , worse than i have had in germany – that he had not really been in the concentration camp , that he had in fact been a spy and so on ...
yes , we do have those reactions as well , at least from a few .
but it is a sensitive issue .
here in germany , of course , political correctness obviously plays a certain role .
i do n't know .
i would cite the former president koehler who in his speech to the israeli knesset - without referring to the palestinians - said that , as a result of its past , germany has the duty to defend human rights across the world .
that is something that is crucial for me and something that we should explain to young people who increasingly distance themselves and ask why they should bear any responsibility .
the responsibility is to learn from the past to defend so that we can defend human rights around the world , including germany .
what sort of reaction are you expecting on november 9 in frankfurt ?
it 's difficult to say .
i think that when i say the word israel , some of the listeners will listen more attentively while others will leave the room .
i have always found that it never comes to a debate .
i constantly try to debate the issues .
for example , at the launch of my last book " von auschwitz nach jerusalem " -lrb- “ from auschwitz to jerusalem ” -rrb- , about germany and israel , i insisted upon inviting jewish congregations in several german cities , but they did not come .
they do not want to debate because they do not want to have to always prove that they are right .

the last stretch is to be completed on tuesday by trucks , but activists have vowed to block the way . demonstrators , including farmers with tractors , blocked roads as authorities loaded the nuclear waste cargo on trucks for the 20-kilometer trip to the final storage facility at gorleben in northern germany . greenpeace activists used a vehicle concealed as a beer truck to block the semis from delivering their nuclear cargo to its final destination . the 123 tons of nuclear waste have been transported from northern france by rail to the city of dannenberg .
the last stretch to the gorleben site is to be completed by truck as soon as police manage to clear the demonstrators blocking the way . the train journey over the weekend had already been interrupted several times by massive protests along the way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another blockade awaits the nuclear waste in gorleben green party co-chair claudia roth , who took part in a sit-in blocking the streets over the weekend , defended the demonstrations and attacked chancellor angela merkel 's government for its new energy policy , which would extend the lifespan of germany 's 17 nuclear reactors by an average of 12 years . " the coalition government has torn apart a societal consensus , provoking the citizens to action , " she said .
while protests have occurred every time nuclear waste has been transported in germany , roth said it was new " that so many groups are now getting involved " in the protests . change of course in energy policy in an interview with public broadcaster ard on monday , green party parliamentary leader and former environment minister juergen trittin said the growth of the protests was a " clear answer " to the government 's lifespan extension of nuclear reactors , which he called a " multibillion euro present " to the nuclear energy industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trittin called merkel 's energy policy a ' present ' to nuclear energy companies as environment minister , trittin and the center-left government of gerhard schroeder enacted a plan to phase out nuclear energy in germany by 2021 . he also said at that time that green party members should not demonstrate against the transport of nuclear waste - a situation which he said has now changed . " we limited the lifespan of germany 's nuclear reactors , and thus limited the production of nuclear waste , " he said .
" now there will be additional waste produced .
that 's the difference , that 's what people are protesting on the streets - and they 're right to do so . " government strikes back christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- secretary general hermann groehe weighed into the debate monday , saying trittin 's reversal on calling on green members to renounce demonstrations back in 2001 was a clear example of double standards . " to call for discretion in government times , but then to add fuel to the fire in opposition is the height of hypocrisy , " groehe said in berlin on monday . alexander dobrindt , the secretary general of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , accused the greens of turning into the " political arm of the rioters , arsonists and stone throwers . " he added that green party leaders claudia roth and cem oezdemir were lending " moral support to the violation of the public peace . " green party on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezdemir and roth have won the greens support through their anti-nuclear platform nuclear energy is a highly contentious issue in germany , and recent polls suggest that the green party has benefitted from the rising anti-nuclear sentiment stoked by the government 's energy policy . a weekend survey by ard found that a record 22 percent of voters would support the green party if an election were held now . oezdemir wrote in an article published monday in the daily hamburger abendblatt that the massive mobilization should lead to a greater public engagement in organized politics . " i would really hope that as many as possible of these well-informed , educated and engaged people of all age groups and backgrounds are also looking toward the path of organizations , political parties and the government , " he said , referring also to the popular movement against the " stuttgart 21 " rail station renewal project . he added that the protestors were neither " naively idealist nor egotistical , nor radical .

up to 17,000 policemen , at a cost of up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 70 million -rrb- , were used over the weekend to keep an estimated 35,000 people from blocking the path of the train , and more demonstrators – along with local farmers - are continuing to arrive to block the path of the road convoy as it continues its journey .
there were varying reports of whether violence had occurred .
the police said that officers had been directly attacked , while protest organizers countered that demonstrators had only sabotaged the tracks .
rainer wendt , head of the police union , said , the officers " proceeded very sensitively , " and " made the right decision – namely to carry the people from the tracks . "
he added that where violence was used against police officers , they reacted " accordingly " and " proportionately . "
dirk seifert , spokesman for the environmental protest group robin wood , told a different story .
" you have to say that the police were disproportionate in their use of tear-gas and pepper spray , " he told deutsche welle .
" the police also hit people who were already lying on the ground , both with their fists as well as truncheons . "
there was also the issue of what happened to those peaceful protesters once they were removed from the tracks .
seifert complained of demonstrators being kept for hours on end in an open field in the cold of the night .
" that is usually called false imprisonment , he said , " the law says people have to be brought to a custodial judge as soon as possible .
that did not happen . "
bildunterschrift : the protests continued throughout the weekend and into monday issues converging what has made this particular demonstration so explosive is the coincidence of this transport of nuclear waste with the government 's decision to overturn former legislation aimed at phasing out nuclear power by around 2020 .
chancellor angela merkel 's conservative coalition of christian democrats and the pro-business free democrats , recently passed a bill through parliament allowing nuclear power stations to remain open another 12 years .
environment minister norbert roettgen has been at pains to separate the issues of lifespan-extension and dealing with nuclear waste .
" we have been using nuclear power for over 40 years , " he said .
" we have created electricity from it and created waste , and we have a responsibility to deal with that – independent of the question of lifespan extension . "
yet seifert is unimpressed with this distinction .
" the fact is that this government has decided to produce even more nuclear waste by extending the life spans of the existing nuclear power stations . "
but some demonstrators arrived at the railway tracks with self-evidently different agendas .
stuttgart 21 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgarters angry about a new railway station have joined the anti-nuclear protests several protestors against the new railway station known as stuttgart 21 were also present , and were celebrated at the podium .
this suggests that the anti-nuclear movement has become a rallying point for many people who feel the current government 's policies are leaving them disenfranchised .
" there is a growing feeling that policies are being made for minorities or a certain clientele , like large corporations , and that this government does not see it as necessary to work for the good of the whole population , " said seifert .
" a lot of people in stuttgart have the feeling that their opinion is not respected – the government is just doing what it wants over the heads of the population . "
opinion polls show that opposition political parties , particularly the greens , are benefitting from this groundswell .
indeed , prominent green party figure claudia roth took part in the weekend 's demonstrations , though politicians were not permitted to speak at the podium .
" we are certainly interested in working together with members of those parties , but the parties have the parliament , and we have the streets , " said seifert .
" we are a social movement and we have to separate the two places of expression . "

"
his statement , made in an address to members of both of india 's houses of parliament , was greeted with thunderous desk-thumping .
while clearly indicating that any such move lies well in the future , the comment , and the praise-filled speech he gave , was considered by many to be a major sign of growing economic and security ties between india and the united states .
in his speech , obama said the country had established itself as a world power and as a natural ally of the united states on the global stage . he promised the two countries would work as equal partners on projects in afghanistan , as well as broaden their dialogue to include nuclear proliferation and regional security in east asia .
diwali dance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michelle obama danced at a celebration of diwali , the festival of lights overall , obama 's visit to india was seen as a success .
he and his wife , michelle , reached out to sections of the country 's political and business classes , as well as students , villagers and artisans .
kicking off his visit in mumbai , india 's financial capital , obama pleased the crowd by saying this was his first visit to india but " my longest visit to another country since becoming president . " in mumbai , both the first lady and the president interacted with college students , and the first lady broke into an impromptu dance while meeting students in a primary school during a celebration of the hindu festival of diwali .
promising to remove restrictions on sensitive high-tech exports - a nagging irritant in the evolution of bilateral ties - obama declared deals worth $ 15 billion -lrb- 10.6 billion euros -rrb- that would support some 54,000 american jobs and seek to answer critics back home .
his description of india as a world power set the tone for negotiations with the political leadership in new delhi that saw a raft of commercial deals signed and agreements to cooperate more closely in agriculture , health and energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a visit to humayun 's tomb in new delhi was part of the program ' defining and indispensible partnership ' " i believe that the relationship between the us and india will be one of the defining and indispensable partnerships of the 21st century , " said obama .
" our nations are the two largest democracies on earth .
we are bound by a common language and common values , shared aspirations and a shared belief that opportunity should be limited only by how hard you are willing to work , only by how hard you are willing to try . "
this sentiment was reciprocated by indian prime minister manmohan singh .
" the new deals that have been struck , they all happen to be in infrastructure .
and infrastructure today is the biggest bottleneck to the faster growth of india , to the faster growth of employment .
and these deals the president has mentioned are truly an example of trade being a win-win situation for both countries . "
alongside singh , obama said while both india and pakistan had an interest in reducing tensions in the region , the us " can not impose a solution to these problems . "
he made it clear that it was up to india and pakistan to settle their differences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama inspected the troops at the presidential palace in new dehli " i am absolutely convinced that it is in both india 's and pakistan 's interest to reduce tensions and that will enable them , i think , to focus on the range of both challenges and opportunities each country faces , " he said .
singh pointed out that he was willing to engage pakistan on all issues including kashmir but not when the terror infrastructure was still intact .
" we are committed to engaging pakistan , we are committed to resolve all outstanding issues between our two countries including the word ' k ' , we are not afraid of that .
but it is our request that you can not simultaneously be talking and at the same time , the terror machine is active as ever before , " he said .
obama continues his 10-day asia trip in indonesia on tuesday , and then travels on to south korea and japan .

the junta has placed the country under a 90-day state of emergency . vote counting in myanmar 's first election in 20 years began monday amid accusations of voter intimidation and fraud as well as condemnation by the international community that the weekend election was neither free nor fair .

the armed forces are also guaranteed a quarter of parliamentary seats under a 2008 constitution .
ron hoffman , canadian ambassador to thailand and myanmar , said the international community needs to keep pressure on myanmar ’ s military .
" it 's not a democratic exercise .
it does n't even come close to meeting any standard of international electoral processes . "
aung san suu kyi 's detention expires on saturday soe aung , a spokesman for the forum for democracy in burma , says the parliament will have little power but to act as a rubber stamp for the military leaders .
he says the parliament will be dominated by the regime backed candidates after the elections .
" and the parliamentarians will have no other chance but to become a rubber stamp parliament to endorse the executive council or the national security and defence council , by name .
this would be headed by the president and also the commander in chief .
this council will run the country after all . "

this would be headed by the president and also the commander in chief .
this council will run the country after all . "

papandreou had been seeking a mandate for his austerity drive . greek prime minister george papandreou has said he will not call a snap parliamentary election , claiming to have won sufficient support in local and regional polls to press ahead with austerity reforms .
papandreou made the announcement on sunday as his socialist party -lrb- pasok -rrb- appeared to have emerged narrowly ahead of rivals . the threat of a general election had rattled financial markets , with fears that the greek government would not be able to follow through on its unpopular budget drive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the budget measures come after an international rescue package was agreed in a televised address to the nation on sunday , papandreou - who only came to power last year - said he felt satisfied with a fresh mandate to press ahead with the program .
" making changes is not easy , " papandreou said .
" greek people brought us to power a year ago and today confirmed that they want this change .
we will continue with our task tomorrow , " estimates early on monday put pasok ahead in seven out of 13 regions .
the center-right new democracy party led in the remaining regions , although some races were so tight that they are likely to be contested again next sunday .
welcome news for markets risk premiums on greek government debt had risen in advance of the elections because of political uncertainty and the news was broadly welcomed by observers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austerity drive has led to strikes and protests " it 's good news that papandreou can continue and that no political uncertainty enters the fray , " said andreas scheuerle , an economist at germany 's dekabank .

looking ahead to this week 's meeting of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- nations in seoul , the former us trade representative said the world needed a new regime to succeed the bretton woods ii system of floating currencies , which has been in place since the fixed-rate currency system linked to gold broke down in 1971 .
although the gold standard helped guard against inflation , it was abandoned because it did not allow for the flexible monetary policy many economists believe is essential in counteracting economic shocks .
" although textbooks may view gold as the old money , markets are using gold as an alternative monetary asset today , " zoellick wrote .
the new system " is likely to need to involve the dollar , the euro , the yen , the pound and a renminbi -lrb- chinese yuan -rrb- that moves towards internationalization and then an open capital account , " he said .
" the system should also consider employing gold as an international reference point of market expectations about inflation , deflation and future currency values . "
currency war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick says the world needs to rethink currency exchange rates zoellick 's comments came amid fears of a so-called " currency war " that would see countries jostle for trade advantage by massaging their exchange rates lower .
the united states has led accusations that china cheats in world trade by artificially weakening its currency .
but china and germany , both major exporters , have complained that washington 's policy of quantitative easing - effectively printing money - is weakening the dollar and harming emerging markets ' competitiveness .
investors are pumping dollars into emerging markets in search of higher yields , and the potentially destabilizing impact of this , along with big current account deficits and china 's reluctance to let the yuan appreciate faster , are set to dominate the g20 summit on thursday and friday .
new structures france , which takes over the g20 chair after this week 's summit , says it plans to work on a new international monetary system to bring greater currency stability .
beijing 's central bank chief has suggested an alternative monetary system based on using the international monetary fund 's special drawing rights , a notional unit of value based on a basket of major currencies , instead of the dollar as the sole global reserve currency .
zoellick said a new monetary system would take time to develop and should be part of a package approach including possible changes in international monetary fund rules to review capital as well as current account policies , and linking imf monetary assessments to world trade organization obligations .
he also called on the g20 to forge structural reforms , including the promotion of domestic demand in china and the reduction of debt in the united states .

the ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security . interior ministers of the european union 's 27 member states unanimously agreed on monday to eliminate visa requirements for citizens of albania and bosnia-herzegovina .
under the agreement , albanians and bosnians with biometric passports would be able to travel to the 25 eu nations in the border-free schengen zone , which excludes ireland and the united kingdom , for up to three months .
the decision came after france , germany and the netherlands expressed concerns that there could be an increase in unfounded asylum claims from the two countries .
the eu got rid of visa requirements for serbia , montenegro and macedonia late last year , apparently leading to an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia .
european commission could roll back decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has seen an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia the ministers stipulated that the european commission could " propose the suspension of visa-free travel " if it felt that citizens of the two countries were abusing the system .
" it is of the utmost importance that albania and bosnia-herzegovina continue to intensify their information campaign with the aim to properly explain to their citizens the meaning of short-term visa-free travel , " cecilia malmstrom , eu commissioner for home affairs , said in a statement .
" a visa-free regime also comes with responsibilities . "
malmstrom said the european parliament and the bloc 's member states must still approve the proposal , and that it could enter into force as early as mid-december .
it would leave kosovo , whose independence is not recognized by all eu states , as the only balkan country without visa-free travel in the eu .
both bosnia and albania hope to join the eu , but face years of tough democratic reforms before they will likely be able to do so .
stricter rules on cargo security eu interior ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security in the aftermath of a string of eu-bound parcel bombs originating from yemen and greece last week .
for instance , airports with inadequate security measures could appear on a blacklist . german interior minister thomas de maiziere said security concerns should trump fears over extra costs due to increased control procedures . " if this is going to be more expensive , then it might be a little more expensive .
there is no security for free " , de maiziere told reporters before presenting his five key points to his eu colleagues . according to de maiziere , the eu must focus on coordination before halting cargo shipments , agree on which countries are to be considered unsafe freight senders , improve security in those unsafe airports , tighten controls on suspect parcels and define responsibilities between commercial shippers and national authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there is no security for free , " says de maiziere the german proposal was welcomed by belgian interior minister annemie turtelboom who is in charge of chairing the eu meeting . " when we see everything that happened last week , we must really discuss how we can travel together , work together and how we can work together not only with the united states but also with some countries in africa , " she said . spanish interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba called measures on enhancing security coordination " an ever more pressing need " for eu countries . but siim kallas , eu transport commissioner , warned on friday that panic should not lead to an excessive increase of security measures . " the fight against terrorism is eternal , and aviation remains the most sensitive target for such attacks , but panic is not the remedy , " he said .
" we must find a proportionate and adequate response . " de maiziere wants to implement a working group which is due to get results by the end of this year .

they also repeated calls to free imprisoned opposition leader aung san suu kyi .

"
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers say the election results were rigged us president barack obama , speaking on a visit to india on monday , went so far as to accuse the ruling myanmar military junta of stealing the election .
" it is unacceptable to steal an election , as the regime in burma has done again for all the world to see , " he said in a speech at the indian parliament , in which he referred to myanmar by its former name .
obama critiques those who fail to speak out he cited myanmar as an example of a country where a " bankrupt regime " imprisoned opponents and gunned down protesters .
and he shot a barb at his host country when he accused mumbai of failling to speak out sufficiently on the rights of the repressed .
" faced with such gross violations of human rights , it is the responsibility of the international community , especially leaders like the united states and india , to condemn it . "
obama said .
" if i can be frank , in international fora , india has often shied away from these issues , " he added .

meanwhile , as the ballots were counted on monday , violence erupted between government soldiers and ethnic minority karen rebels in the border town of myawaddy .
some 10,000 refugees fled across the border into thailand to escape the post-election fighting .

for instance , 25 percent of parliamentary seats are reserved for the military .
and the government-crafted constitution and skewed election rules heavily favored the military government 's candidates .
that means that for now , myanmar 's military will uphold its power through affiliated parties .
candidates backed by the regime enjoyed substantial financial support and were also accused of intimidating opposing parties .
" for the people of burma , it will mean the return to power of a brutal regime that has pillaged the nation 's resources and overseen widespread human rights abuses , including arbitrary detentions , enforced disappearances , rape and torture , " britain 's foreign secretary william hague said in response to sunday 's election .
china is supportive of regime meanwhile , china 's global times reported the chinese government supported " myanmar 's plan to transform its political system , but knows it will not happen overnight . "
china has long helped economically-dysfunctional myanmar to keep afloat through trade ties , arms sales , and by shielding it from un sanctions over rights abuses as a veto-wielding member of the un security council .
in the first five months of this year , china has invested about $ 8 billion -lrb- 11 billion euros -rrb- in myanmar , which it sees as a strategic ally and important trading partner , especially for its energy-hungry western provinces .
it will likely be many days before official results are released , since the process of vote counting in myanmar is painstaking and slow .

papandreou had been seeking a mandate for his austerity drive . greek prime minister george papandreou has said he will not call a snap parliamentary election , claiming to have won sufficient support in local and regional polls to press ahead with austerity reforms .
papandreou made the announcement on sunday as his socialist party -lrb- pasok -rrb- appeared to have emerged narrowly ahead of rivals . the threat of a general election had rattled financial markets , with fears that the greek government would not be able to follow through on its unpopular budget drive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the budget measures come after an international rescue package was agreed in a televised address to the nation on sunday , papandreou - who only came to power last year - said he felt satisfied with a fresh mandate to press ahead with the program .
" making changes is not easy , " papandreou said .
" greek people brought us to power a year ago and today confirmed that they want this change .
we will continue with our task tomorrow , " estimates early on monday put pasok ahead in seven out of 13 regions .
the center-right new democracy party led in the remaining regions , although some races were so tight that they are likely to be contested again next sunday .
welcome news for markets risk premiums on greek government debt had risen in advance of the elections because of political uncertainty and the news was broadly welcomed by observers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austerity drive has led to strikes and protests " it 's good news that papandreou can continue and that no political uncertainty enters the fray , " said andreas scheuerle , an economist at germany 's dekabank .
papandreou had at no stage indicated the criteria he would use to decide whether or not to call a fresh general election .
the government was forced to adopt a program of pay cuts , tax rises and a freeze in pensions - prompting strikes , riots and protests - after state finances were revealed to be far in a far worse state than expected earlier this year .
those reforms were agreed as part of 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 154.4 billion -rrb- bailout package from the international monetary fund and the european union in may .
the greek economy , which represents about 2.5 percent of that of the euro zone , is expected to shrink by 4 percent this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 08.11.2010 greek striker gekas revives his career at improving frankfurt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gekas made the difference against wolfsburg theofanis gekas is anything but a complete player , but he knows how to do a striker 's main job - score goals .
and this year the crafty greek is reminding opponents just how uncannily efficient he can be . after eleven rounds of play , no one had more goals - 11 in total - than a 30-year-old many bundesliga fans would probably classify as a journeyman .
but ask the man himself and he 'll tell you that goal-getting is an innate ability that 's anything but the norm .
" i started playing football really young , and i was always a striker , " gekas said in interview with the german football league .
" i was born with my scoring ability .
it seems like a gift from god . "
his teammates had another potentially supernatural explanation after gekas scored a brace on saturday .
“ we asked ourselves in the dressing room if he 's sold his soul , ” defender marco russ told the bild newspaper .
“ even his badly taken penalty went in . ”
gekas came to the bundesliga in 2005 on a one-year loan from panathinaikos athens to bochum and promptly won the league scoring title .
his then coach described him as " our life-insurance policy . "
but bochum decided they could not afford the premiums and failed to exercise their right to purchase the greek goal-getter .
it was a bad decision .
bochum became a perennial relegation candidate and now play in the second division .
for his part , gekas moved on to leverkusen , where he never established himself .
although he scored a respectable 11 goals in his first season with his new club , he was often criticized as lacking in work ethic and was loaned out to hertha berlin at the beginning of 2010 .
with hertha also getting relegated , gekas formally returned to leverkusen , before promptly moving on to frankfurt .
his was hardly one of the high-profile signings of the off-season , but now he 's getting a chance to prove that his detractors , if not completely wrong , missed the point .
ice-cold killer bildunterschrift : in addition to his 11 league goals , gekas has scored 2 in the german cup gekas is neither a particularly great dribbler or passer , and he 's never been known to track back and help out on defense .
but he is one of the most prolific poachers the league has seen in recent years .
that 's just the way he described the role of a striker in a recent interview .
" the most important thing is that -lsb- a striker -rsb- has good teammates who are always looking to get him the ball , " gekas told the online portal of the eurosport television network .
" in addition , he needs the talent to get himself in the right position to score goals . "
on teams that fail to utilize his nose for goal , gekas is most conspicuous for the amount of times he 's caught offside .
but on teams that figure out how to employ his particular talent , he can be lethal .
indeed , a tarantino-esque tattoo on gekas ' arm reads " eiskalter vollstrecker , " -lrb- ice-cold killer -rrb- - the nickname he earned at bochum .
understatement , as you 've probably guessed by now , is n't gekas ' strong suit .
" the fact that i did n't score -lsb- for leverkusen and hertha -rsb- was because the people in positions of responsibility did n't trust me , " gekas told the bundesliga .
" but frankfurt coach michael skibbe , whom i know from my time in leverkusen , does have that trust .
that has a direct effect on my game and the number of goals i score . "
instinct and vision bildunterschrift : gekas has been doing all his talking on pitch this season seen negatively , gekas is one-dimensional .
seen positively , he does exactly what he 's supposed to do , hang around in dangerous positions and convert chances as they materialize .
wolfsburg were given a display of the latter qualities , as their trip to frankfurt on saturday ended in a 3-1 defeat .
the hosts ' first goal in that match was archetypal gekas .
the greek striker lurked on the edge of the penalty area , and when a low pass came his way , he took it directly and curled it into the bottom left-hand corner .
the goal was only possible because gekas did n't hesitate or try to control the ball , but rather reacted on instinct .
that 's a quality his coach appreciates .
" there are n't many strikers who can see a situation in advance as well as gekas , " michael skibbe told the bild newspaper earlier this season .
" in the build-up , he follows pass combinations very intensely and then instinctively runs where he expects the ball to be . "
gekas goals may often appear to be lucky , but the numbers argue for his basic quality .
in addition to his achievements in the bundesliga , the striker has scored 20 goals in 51 matches for the greek national team .
gekas officially retired from the greece squad in september , citing " special circumstances . "
few people , if indeed anyone other than the striker himself , knew what he was referring to .
that 's not uncommon with gekas , who , despite playing for years in the bundesliga , says he sees no need to learn german .
and this season , he 's drastically scaled back the number of interviews he 's prepared to give .
but if gekas can keep up anything near his early pace of a goal per game , no one is likely to care about his disinterest in communication .
as he himself might say , a striker 's job is not to make himself understood .
putting the ball in the net speaks louder than words .

although he scored a respectable 11 goals in his first season with his new club , he was often criticized as lacking in work ethic and was loaned out to hertha berlin at the beginning of 2010 .

but he is one of the most prolific poachers the league has seen in recent years .
that 's just the way he described the role of a striker in a recent interview .
" the most important thing is that -lsb- a striker -rsb- has good teammates who are always looking to get him the ball , " gekas told the online portal of the eurosport television network .
" in addition , he needs the talent to get himself in the right position to score goals . "
on teams that fail to utilize his nose for goal , gekas is most conspicuous for the amount of times he 's caught offside .

understatement , as you 've probably guessed by now , is n't gekas ' strong suit .
" the fact that i did n't score -lsb- for leverkusen and hertha -rsb- was because the people in positions of responsibility did n't trust me , " gekas told the bundesliga .

wolfsburg were given a display of the latter qualities , as their trip to frankfurt on saturday ended in a 3-1 defeat .
the hosts ' first goal in that match was archetypal gekas .
the greek striker lurked on the edge of the penalty area , and when a low pass came his way , he took it directly and curled it into the bottom left-hand corner .
the goal was only possible because gekas did n't hesitate or try to control the ball , but rather reacted on instinct .
that 's a quality his coach appreciates .
" there are n't many strikers who can see a situation in advance as well as gekas , " michael skibbe told the bild newspaper earlier this season .
" in the build-up , he follows pass combinations very intensely and then instinctively runs where he expects the ball to be . "
gekas goals may often appear to be lucky , but the numbers argue for his basic quality .
in addition to his achievements in the bundesliga , the striker has scored 20 goals in 51 matches for the greek national team .
gekas officially retired from the greece squad in september , citing " special circumstances . "
few people , if indeed anyone other than the striker himself , knew what he was referring to .
that 's not uncommon with gekas , who , despite playing for years in the bundesliga , says he sees no need to learn german .
and this season , he 's drastically scaled back the number of interviews he 's prepared to give .
but if gekas can keep up anything near his early pace of a goal per game , no one is likely to care about his disinterest in communication .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 08.11.2010 greek striker gekas revives his career at improving frankfurt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gekas made the difference against wolfsburg theofanis gekas is anything but a complete player , but he knows how to do a striker 's main job - score goals .
and this year the crafty greek is reminding opponents just how uncannily efficient he can be . after eleven rounds of play , no one had more goals - 11 in total - than a 30-year-old many bundesliga fans would probably classify as a journeyman .
but ask the man himself and he 'll tell you that goal-getting is an innate ability that 's anything but the norm .
" i started playing football really young , and i was always a striker , " gekas said in interview with the german football league .
" i was born with my scoring ability .
it seems like a gift from god . "
his teammates had another potentially supernatural explanation after gekas scored a brace on saturday .
“ we asked ourselves in the dressing room if he 's sold his soul , ” defender marco russ told the bild newspaper .
“ even his badly taken penalty went in . ”
gekas came to the bundesliga in 2005 on a one-year loan from panathinaikos athens to bochum and promptly won the league scoring title .
his then coach described him as " our life-insurance policy . "
but bochum decided they could not afford the premiums and failed to exercise their right to purchase the greek goal-getter .
it was a bad decision .
bochum became a perennial relegation candidate and now play in the second division .
for his part , gekas moved on to leverkusen , where he never established himself .
although he scored a respectable 11 goals in his first season with his new club , he was often criticized as lacking in work ethic and was loaned out to hertha berlin at the beginning of 2010 .
with hertha also getting relegated , gekas formally returned to leverkusen , before promptly moving on to frankfurt .
his was hardly one of the high-profile signings of the off-season , but now he 's getting a chance to prove that his detractors , if not completely wrong , missed the point .
ice-cold killer bildunterschrift : in addition to his 11 league goals , gekas has scored 2 in the german cup gekas is neither a particularly great dribbler or passer , and he 's never been known to track back and help out on defense .
but he is one of the most prolific poachers the league has seen in recent years .
that 's just the way he described the role of a striker in a recent interview .
" the most important thing is that -lsb- a striker -rsb- has good teammates who are always looking to get him the ball , " gekas told the online portal of the eurosport television network .
" in addition , he needs the talent to get himself in the right position to score goals . "
on teams that fail to utilize his nose for goal , gekas is most conspicuous for the amount of times he 's caught offside .
but on teams that figure out how to employ his particular talent , he can be lethal .
indeed , a tarantino-esque tattoo on gekas ' arm reads " eiskalter vollstrecker , " -lrb- ice-cold killer -rrb- - the nickname he earned at bochum .
understatement , as you 've probably guessed by now , is n't gekas ' strong suit .
" the fact that i did n't score -lsb- for leverkusen and hertha -rsb- was because the people in positions of responsibility did n't trust me , " gekas told the bundesliga .
" but frankfurt coach michael skibbe , whom i know from my time in leverkusen , does have that trust .
that has a direct effect on my game and the number of goals i score . "
instinct and vision bildunterschrift : gekas has been doing all his talking on pitch this season seen negatively , gekas is one-dimensional .
seen positively , he does exactly what he 's supposed to do , hang around in dangerous positions and convert chances as they materialize .
wolfsburg were given a display of the latter qualities , as their trip to frankfurt on saturday ended in a 3-1 defeat .
the hosts ' first goal in that match was archetypal gekas .
the greek striker lurked on the edge of the penalty area , and when a low pass came his way , he took it directly and curled it into the bottom left-hand corner .
the goal was only possible because gekas did n't hesitate or try to control the ball , but rather reacted on instinct .
that 's a quality his coach appreciates .
" there are n't many strikers who can see a situation in advance as well as gekas , " michael skibbe told the bild newspaper earlier this season .
" in the build-up , he follows pass combinations very intensely and then instinctively runs where he expects the ball to be . "
gekas goals may often appear to be lucky , but the numbers argue for his basic quality .
in addition to his achievements in the bundesliga , the striker has scored 20 goals in 51 matches for the greek national team .
gekas officially retired from the greece squad in september , citing " special circumstances . "
few people , if indeed anyone other than the striker himself , knew what he was referring to .
that 's not uncommon with gekas , who , despite playing for years in the bundesliga , says he sees no need to learn german .
and this season , he 's drastically scaled back the number of interviews he 's prepared to give .
but if gekas can keep up anything near his early pace of a goal per game , no one is likely to care about his disinterest in communication .
as he himself might say , a striker 's job is not to make himself understood .
putting the ball in the net speaks louder than words .

the regulator said it did not view the circumstances of the downstream acquisition as " unacceptable . "
ulitmate goal : leighton the german and australian companies had asked the takeovers panel to intervene in acs ' 2.76 billion euro all-share takeover offer for hochtief on the grounds that leighton was the ultimate target .
hochtief 's stake in leighton is valued at almost as much as the whole of the essen-based construction company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees are concerned about their jobs under a new owner in its submission to the panel , leighton said it was concerned that if acs grabbed hochtief 's stake , minority shareholders in leighton would be disadvantaged and the company would lose the independence it had enjoyed under german stewardship .
but statements by acs to the contrary have prompted both the takeoves panel and leighton to embrace the deal .
acs has contacted leighton and indicated a willingness to enter into a written and binding governance agreement , according to leighton chairman david mortimer .
independence assurance " we are encouraged by the public statements from acs and their direct contact , and intend to actively pursue such an agreement to protect the interests of our minority shareholders , ” mortimer said in a statement .
“ leighton believes the existing governance arrangements , which have been in place for a long period with hochtief , have contributed substantially to the value created for all of leighton 's 67,000 shareholders .
we welcome the opportunity to put in place appropriate and similar governance arrangement with acs . "
in august , acs made a hostile all-share bid to raise its stake in hochtief from 29 percent to 50 percent .
the german construction company , which has been trying to block the takeover ever since , had appealed to the australian regulator in an attempt to force the spanish company into a cash bid for leighton .
hochtief is running out of options .
last week , german economics minister rainer bruederle said that although he would like to see the company 's headquarters remain on german turf , he was not willing to intervene in the market process .

they also repeated calls to free imprisoned opposition leader aung san suu kyi .
however , myanmar 's ally china refused to join the chorus of international disapproval .
the state-owned newspaper global times reported the government considered the controversial polls " a step forward . "
an official statement is still awaited .
statement by us , australia the us , eu , uk , australia and japan all condemned vote as being neither free nor fair . in a joint statement , the us and australia urged the regime 's leaders to ensure that " post-election institutions be transparent , accountable and responsive to their citizens ' aspirations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers say the election results were rigged us president barack obama , speaking on a visit to india on monday , went so far as to accuse the ruling myanmar military junta of stealing the election .
" it is unacceptable to steal an election , as the regime in burma has done again for all the world to see , " he said in a speech at the indian parliament , in which he referred to myanmar by its former name .
obama critiques those who fail to speak out he cited myanmar as an example of a country where a " bankrupt regime " imprisoned opponents and gunned down protesters .
and he shot a barb at his host country when he accused mumbai of failling to speak out sufficiently on the rights of the repressed .
" faced with such gross violations of human rights , it is the responsibility of the international community , especially leaders like the united states and india , to condemn it . "
obama said .
" if i can be frank , in international fora , india has often shied away from these issues , " he added .
ethnic violence erupts at border in the us , secretary of state hillary clinton said her country would uphold " rigorous sanctions " against myanmar 's regime as long as it abuses human rights and holds political prisoners .
independent burmese observers reported widespread allegations of voter intimidation and bribery in the elections , and most international observers had already written off the vote as a sham designed to further entrench miltiary rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy icon aung san suu kyi was sidelined in the election representatives of the military junta 's political arm , the union solidarity and development party -lrb- usdp -rrb- are alleged to have conducted widespread voter coercion , intimidation and vote-buying .
and concerns have been raised about votes being counted away from public or opposition party scrutiny .
meanwhile , as the ballots were counted on monday , violence erupted between government soldiers and ethnic minority karen rebels in the border town of myawaddy .
some 10,000 refugees fled across the border into thailand to escape the post-election fighting .
scales tipped for the military while myanmar officially ended half a century of direct army rule on sunday , a variety of restrictions accompanying the election made a pro-democracy upset virtually impossible .
for instance , 25 percent of parliamentary seats are reserved for the military .
and the government-crafted constitution and skewed election rules heavily favored the military government 's candidates .
that means that for now , myanmar 's military will uphold its power through affiliated parties .
candidates backed by the regime enjoyed substantial financial support and were also accused of intimidating opposing parties .
" for the people of burma , it will mean the return to power of a brutal regime that has pillaged the nation 's resources and overseen widespread human rights abuses , including arbitrary detentions , enforced disappearances , rape and torture , " britain 's foreign secretary william hague said in response to sunday 's election .
china is supportive of regime meanwhile , china 's global times reported the chinese government supported " myanmar 's plan to transform its political system , but knows it will not happen overnight . "
china has long helped economically-dysfunctional myanmar to keep afloat through trade ties , arms sales , and by shielding it from un sanctions over rights abuses as a veto-wielding member of the un security council .
in the first five months of this year , china has invested about $ 8 billion -lrb- 11 billion euros -rrb- in myanmar , which it sees as a strategic ally and important trading partner , especially for its energy-hungry western provinces .
it will likely be many days before official results are released , since the process of vote counting in myanmar is painstaking and slow .

the ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security . interior ministers of the european union 's 27 member states unanimously agreed on monday to eliminate visa requirements for citizens of albania and bosnia-herzegovina .
under the agreement , albanians and bosnians with biometric passports would be able to travel to the 25 eu nations in the border-free schengen zone , which excludes ireland and the united kingdom , for up to three months .
the decision came after france , germany and the netherlands expressed concerns that there could be an increase in unfounded asylum claims from the two countries .
the eu got rid of visa requirements for serbia , montenegro and macedonia late last year , apparently leading to an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia .
european commission could roll back decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has seen an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia the ministers stipulated that the european commission could " propose the suspension of visa-free travel " if it felt that citizens of the two countries were abusing the system .
" it is of the utmost importance that albania and bosnia-herzegovina continue to intensify their information campaign with the aim to properly explain to their citizens the meaning of short-term visa-free travel , " cecilia malmstrom , eu commissioner for home affairs , said in a statement .
" a visa-free regime also comes with responsibilities . "
malmstrom said the european parliament and the bloc 's member states must still approve the proposal , and that it could enter into force as early as mid-december .
it would leave kosovo , whose independence is not recognized by all eu states , as the only balkan country without visa-free travel in the eu .
both bosnia and albania hope to join the eu , but face years of tough democratic reforms before they will likely be able to do so .
stricter rules on cargo security eu interior ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security in the aftermath of a string of eu-bound parcel bombs originating from yemen and greece last week .
for instance , airports with inadequate security measures could appear on a blacklist . german interior minister thomas de maiziere said security concerns should trump fears over extra costs due to increased control procedures . " if this is going to be more expensive , then it might be a little more expensive .
there is no security for free " , de maiziere told reporters before presenting his five key points to his eu colleagues . according to de maiziere , the eu must focus on coordination before halting cargo shipments , agree on which countries are to be considered unsafe freight senders , improve security in those unsafe airports , tighten controls on suspect parcels and define responsibilities between commercial shippers and national authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there is no security for free , " says de maiziere the german proposal was welcomed by belgian interior minister annemie turtelboom who is in charge of chairing the eu meeting . " when we see everything that happened last week , we must really discuss how we can travel together , work together and how we can work together not only with the united states but also with some countries in africa , " she said . spanish interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba called measures on enhancing security coordination " an ever more pressing need " for eu countries . but siim kallas , eu transport commissioner , warned on friday that panic should not lead to an excessive increase of security measures . " the fight against terrorism is eternal , and aviation remains the most sensitive target for such attacks , but panic is not the remedy , " he said .
" we must find a proportionate and adequate response . " de maiziere wants to implement a working group which is due to get results by the end of this year .

under the agreement , albanians and bosnians with biometric passports would be able to travel to the 25 eu nations in the border-free schengen zone , which excludes ireland and the united kingdom , for up to three months .
the decision came after france , germany and the netherlands expressed concerns that there could be an increase in unfounded asylum claims from the two countries .
the eu got rid of visa requirements for serbia , montenegro and macedonia late last year , apparently leading to an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia .
european commission could roll back decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has seen an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia the ministers stipulated that the european commission could " propose the suspension of visa-free travel " if it felt that citizens of the two countries were abusing the system .
" it is of the utmost importance that albania and bosnia-herzegovina continue to intensify their information campaign with the aim to properly explain to their citizens the meaning of short-term visa-free travel , " cecilia malmstrom , eu commissioner for home affairs , said in a statement .
" a visa-free regime also comes with responsibilities . "
malmstrom said the european parliament and the bloc 's member states must still approve the proposal , and that it could enter into force as early as mid-december .
it would leave kosovo , whose independence is not recognized by all eu states , as the only balkan country without visa-free travel in the eu .
both bosnia and albania hope to join the eu , but face years of tough democratic reforms before they will likely be able to do so .
stricter rules on cargo security eu interior ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security in the aftermath of a string of eu-bound parcel bombs originating from yemen and greece last week .
for instance , airports with inadequate security measures could appear on a blacklist . german interior minister thomas de maiziere said security concerns should trump fears over extra costs due to increased control procedures . " if this is going to be more expensive , then it might be a little more expensive .
there is no security for free " , de maiziere told reporters before presenting his five key points to his eu colleagues . according to de maiziere , the eu must focus on coordination before halting cargo shipments , agree on which countries are to be considered unsafe freight senders , improve security in those unsafe airports , tighten controls on suspect parcels and define responsibilities between commercial shippers and national authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there is no security for free , " says de maiziere the german proposal was welcomed by belgian interior minister annemie turtelboom who is in charge of chairing the eu meeting . " when we see everything that happened last week , we must really discuss how we can travel together , work together and how we can work together not only with the united states but also with some countries in africa , " she said . spanish interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba called measures on enhancing security coordination " an ever more pressing need " for eu countries . but siim kallas , eu transport commissioner , warned on friday that panic should not lead to an excessive increase of security measures . " the fight against terrorism is eternal , and aviation remains the most sensitive target for such attacks , but panic is not the remedy , " he said .
" we must find a proportionate and adequate response . " de maiziere wants to implement a working group which is due to get results by the end of this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de exchange rates -pipe- 08.11.2010 world bank chief calls on g20 to reconsider gold standard großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gold underpinned exchange rates between 1946 and 1971 world bank president robert zoellick has called on bickering g20 nations to bring gold back into the global monetary system as an anchor to guide currency movements . in a commentary published in monday 's financial times , world bank president robert zoellick wrote that an updated gold standard could help retool the world economy amid tensions over currencies and the united states ' monetary policy .
looking ahead to this week 's meeting of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- nations in seoul , the former us trade representative said the world needed a new regime to succeed the bretton woods ii system of floating currencies , which has been in place since the fixed-rate currency system linked to gold broke down in 1971 .
although the gold standard helped guard against inflation , it was abandoned because it did not allow for the flexible monetary policy many economists believe is essential in counteracting economic shocks .
" although textbooks may view gold as the old money , markets are using gold as an alternative monetary asset today , " zoellick wrote .
the new system " is likely to need to involve the dollar , the euro , the yen , the pound and a renminbi -lrb- chinese yuan -rrb- that moves towards internationalization and then an open capital account , " he said .
" the system should also consider employing gold as an international reference point of market expectations about inflation , deflation and future currency values . "
currency war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick says the world needs to rethink currency exchange rates zoellick 's comments came amid fears of a so-called " currency war " that would see countries jostle for trade advantage by massaging their exchange rates lower .
the united states has led accusations that china cheats in world trade by artificially weakening its currency .
but china and germany , both major exporters , have complained that washington 's policy of quantitative easing - effectively printing money - is weakening the dollar and harming emerging markets ' competitiveness .
investors are pumping dollars into emerging markets in search of higher yields , and the potentially destabilizing impact of this , along with big current account deficits and china 's reluctance to let the yuan appreciate faster , are set to dominate the g20 summit on thursday and friday .
new structures france , which takes over the g20 chair after this week 's summit , says it plans to work on a new international monetary system to bring greater currency stability .
beijing 's central bank chief has suggested an alternative monetary system based on using the international monetary fund 's special drawing rights , a notional unit of value based on a basket of major currencies , instead of the dollar as the sole global reserve currency .
zoellick said a new monetary system would take time to develop and should be part of a package approach including possible changes in international monetary fund rules to review capital as well as current account policies , and linking imf monetary assessments to world trade organization obligations .
he also called on the g20 to forge structural reforms , including the promotion of domestic demand in china and the reduction of debt in the united states .

the ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security . interior ministers of the european union 's 27 member states unanimously agreed on monday to eliminate visa requirements for citizens of albania and bosnia-herzegovina .
under the agreement , albanians and bosnians with biometric passports would be able to travel to the 25 eu nations in the border-free schengen zone , which excludes ireland and the united kingdom , for up to three months .
the decision came after france , germany and the netherlands expressed concerns that there could be an increase in unfounded asylum claims from the two countries .
the eu got rid of visa requirements for serbia , montenegro and macedonia late last year , apparently leading to an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia .
european commission could roll back decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has seen an influx of asylum seekers from serbia and macedonia the ministers stipulated that the european commission could " propose the suspension of visa-free travel " if it felt that citizens of the two countries were abusing the system .
" it is of the utmost importance that albania and bosnia-herzegovina continue to intensify their information campaign with the aim to properly explain to their citizens the meaning of short-term visa-free travel , " cecilia malmstrom , eu commissioner for home affairs , said in a statement .
" a visa-free regime also comes with responsibilities . "
malmstrom said the european parliament and the bloc 's member states must still approve the proposal , and that it could enter into force as early as mid-december .
it would leave kosovo , whose independence is not recognized by all eu states , as the only balkan country without visa-free travel in the eu .
both bosnia and albania hope to join the eu , but face years of tough democratic reforms before they will likely be able to do so .
stricter rules on cargo security eu interior ministers also discussed plans to tighten air cargo security in the aftermath of a string of eu-bound parcel bombs originating from yemen and greece last week .
for instance , airports with inadequate security measures could appear on a blacklist . german interior minister thomas de maiziere said security concerns should trump fears over extra costs due to increased control procedures . " if this is going to be more expensive , then it might be a little more expensive .
there is no security for free " , de maiziere told reporters before presenting his five key points to his eu colleagues . according to de maiziere , the eu must focus on coordination before halting cargo shipments , agree on which countries are to be considered unsafe freight senders , improve security in those unsafe airports , tighten controls on suspect parcels and define responsibilities between commercial shippers and national authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there is no security for free , " says de maiziere the german proposal was welcomed by belgian interior minister annemie turtelboom who is in charge of chairing the eu meeting . " when we see everything that happened last week , we must really discuss how we can travel together , work together and how we can work together not only with the united states but also with some countries in africa , " she said . spanish interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba called measures on enhancing security coordination " an ever more pressing need " for eu countries . but siim kallas , eu transport commissioner , warned on friday that panic should not lead to an excessive increase of security measures . " the fight against terrorism is eternal , and aviation remains the most sensitive target for such attacks , but panic is not the remedy , " he said .
" we must find a proportionate and adequate response . " de maiziere wants to implement a working group which is due to get results by the end of this year .

looking ahead to this week 's meeting of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- nations in seoul , the former us trade representative said the world needed a new regime to succeed the bretton woods ii system of floating currencies , which has been in place since the fixed-rate currency system linked to gold broke down in 1971 .
although the gold standard helped guard against inflation , it was abandoned because it did not allow for the flexible monetary policy many economists believe is essential in counteracting economic shocks .
" although textbooks may view gold as the old money , markets are using gold as an alternative monetary asset today , " zoellick wrote .
the new system " is likely to need to involve the dollar , the euro , the yen , the pound and a renminbi -lrb- chinese yuan -rrb- that moves towards internationalization and then an open capital account , " he said .
" the system should also consider employing gold as an international reference point of market expectations about inflation , deflation and future currency values . "
currency war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoellick says the world needs to rethink currency exchange rates zoellick 's comments came amid fears of a so-called " currency war " that would see countries jostle for trade advantage by massaging their exchange rates lower .
the united states has led accusations that china cheats in world trade by artificially weakening its currency .
but china and germany , both major exporters , have complained that washington 's policy of quantitative easing - effectively printing money - is weakening the dollar and harming emerging markets ' competitiveness .
investors are pumping dollars into emerging markets in search of higher yields , and the potentially destabilizing impact of this , along with big current account deficits and china 's reluctance to let the yuan appreciate faster , are set to dominate the g20 summit on thursday and friday .
new structures france , which takes over the g20 chair after this week 's summit , says it plans to work on a new international monetary system to bring greater currency stability .
beijing 's central bank chief has suggested an alternative monetary system based on using the international monetary fund 's special drawing rights , a notional unit of value based on a basket of major currencies , instead of the dollar as the sole global reserve currency .
zoellick said a new monetary system would take time to develop and should be part of a package approach including possible changes in international monetary fund rules to review capital as well as current account policies , and linking imf monetary assessments to world trade organization obligations .
he also called on the g20 to forge structural reforms , including the promotion of domestic demand in china and the reduction of debt in the united states .

investors are pumping dollars into emerging markets in search of higher yields , and the potentially destabilizing impact of this , along with big current account deficits and china 's reluctance to let the yuan appreciate faster , are set to dominate the g20 summit on thursday and friday .
new structures france , which takes over the g20 chair after this week 's summit , says it plans to work on a new international monetary system to bring greater currency stability .
beijing 's central bank chief has suggested an alternative monetary system based on using the international monetary fund 's special drawing rights , a notional unit of value based on a basket of major currencies , instead of the dollar as the sole global reserve currency .
zoellick said a new monetary system would take time to develop and should be part of a package approach including possible changes in international monetary fund rules to review capital as well as current account policies , and linking imf monetary assessments to world trade organization obligations .
he also called on the g20 to forge structural reforms , including the promotion of domestic demand in china and the reduction of debt in the united states .

looking ahead to this week 's meeting of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- nations in seoul , the former us trade representative said the world needed a new regime to succeed the bretton woods ii system of floating currencies , which has been in place since the fixed-rate currency system linked to gold broke down in 1971 .
although the gold standard helped guard against inflation , it was abandoned because it did not allow for the flexible monetary policy many economists believe is essential in counteracting economic shocks .
" although textbooks may view gold as the old money , markets are using gold as an alternative monetary asset today , " zoellick wrote .
the new system " is likely to need to involve the dollar , the euro , the yen , the pound and a renminbi -lrb- chinese yuan -rrb- that moves towards internationalization and then an open capital account , " he said .
" the system should also consider employing gold as an international reference point of market expectations about inflation , deflation and future currency values . "

they also repeated calls to free imprisoned opposition leader aung san suu kyi .
however , myanmar 's ally china refused to join the chorus of international disapproval .
the state-owned newspaper global times reported the government considered the controversial polls " a step forward . "
an official statement is still awaited .
statement by us , australia the us , eu , uk , australia and japan all condemned vote as being neither free nor fair . in a joint statement , the us and australia urged the regime 's leaders to ensure that " post-election institutions be transparent , accountable and responsive to their citizens ' aspirations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : observers say the election results were rigged us president barack obama , speaking on a visit to india on monday , went so far as to accuse the ruling myanmar military junta of stealing the election .
" it is unacceptable to steal an election , as the regime in burma has done again for all the world to see , " he said in a speech at the indian parliament , in which he referred to myanmar by its former name .
obama critiques those who fail to speak out he cited myanmar as an example of a country where a " bankrupt regime " imprisoned opponents and gunned down protesters .
and he shot a barb at his host country when he accused mumbai of failling to speak out sufficiently on the rights of the repressed .
" faced with such gross violations of human rights , it is the responsibility of the international community , especially leaders like the united states and india , to condemn it . "
obama said .
" if i can be frank , in international fora , india has often shied away from these issues , " he added .
ethnic violence erupts at border in the us , secretary of state hillary clinton said her country would uphold " rigorous sanctions " against myanmar 's regime as long as it abuses human rights and holds political prisoners .
independent burmese observers reported widespread allegations of voter intimidation and bribery in the elections , and most international observers had already written off the vote as a sham designed to further entrench miltiary rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democracy icon aung san suu kyi was sidelined in the election representatives of the military junta 's political arm , the union solidarity and development party -lrb- usdp -rrb- are alleged to have conducted widespread voter coercion , intimidation and vote-buying .
and concerns have been raised about votes being counted away from public or opposition party scrutiny .
meanwhile , as the ballots were counted on monday , violence erupted between government soldiers and ethnic minority karen rebels in the border town of myawaddy .
some 10,000 refugees fled across the border into thailand to escape the post-election fighting .
scales tipped for the military while myanmar officially ended half a century of direct army rule on sunday , a variety of restrictions accompanying the election made a pro-democracy upset virtually impossible .
for instance , 25 percent of parliamentary seats are reserved for the military .
and the government-crafted constitution and skewed election rules heavily favored the military government 's candidates .
that means that for now , myanmar 's military will uphold its power through affiliated parties .

" for the people of burma , it will mean the return to power of a brutal regime that has pillaged the nation 's resources and overseen widespread human rights abuses , including arbitrary detentions , enforced disappearances , rape and torture , " britain 's foreign secretary william hague said in response to sunday 's election .
china is supportive of regime meanwhile , china 's global times reported the chinese government supported " myanmar 's plan to transform its political system , but knows it will not happen overnight . "
china has long helped economically-dysfunctional myanmar to keep afloat through trade ties , arms sales , and by shielding it from un sanctions over rights abuses as a veto-wielding member of the un security council .
in the first five months of this year , china has invested about $ 8 billion -lrb- 11 billion euros -rrb- in myanmar , which it sees as a strategic ally and important trading partner , especially for its energy-hungry western provinces .
it will likely be many days before official results are released , since the process of vote counting in myanmar is painstaking and slow .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 08.11.2010 author alfred grosser is controversial choice for kristallnacht speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grosser has been criticized for his views on israel every year on november 9 , st paul 's church in frankfurt commemorates the kristallnacht pogrom of 1938 .
deutsche welle spoke to the controversial writer alfred grosser who has been chosen to give the keynote speech . on november 9 the author alfred grosser is to give a speech in remembrance of the kristallnacht , or the night of broken glass , pogrom against jews in germany carried out under the nazis in 1938 .
the choice of speaker has caused controversy with historians and germany 's central council of jews questioning grosser 's credentials .
grosser comes from a jewish family and emigrated to france with them in 1933 .
the political academic and author of numerous books and essays is seen as an important pioneer in post-war franco-german understanding .
in recent years he has become increasingly interested in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
his 2009 book " von auschwitz nach jerusalem " -lrb- " from auschwitz to jerusalem " -rrb- caused controversy as he dealt with the question of how much it is permissible to question the policies of israel . germany 's central council of jews is not happy , and has written to the mayor of frankfurt to complain that grosser is an inappropriate choice of speaker .
deutsche welle : alfred grosser , you 're french with german and jewish roots .
you were born in 1925 in frankfurt and fled from there to france in 1933 .
now you are to give a speech in the place of your birth at the november 9 memorial .
regardless of the criticism , what were your thoughts and feelings about doing this ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of synagogues and businesses were attacked during kristallnacht alfred grosser : first of all , there is a need to remember this particular day .
since august 1944 in marseille , when i heard that part of my family had been transported to auschwitz , i have been sure that there is no collective german guilt and yet that i also share some responsibility for the future of liberal democracy in germany .
this was my starting point for the speech .
how exactly does one qualify to make such a speech ?
is it for instance through a certain behaviour or membership of some kind of official jewish organisation .
is only a " real " jew allowed to give such a speech ?
you have been accused of distancing yourself from judaism .
that is , at least , what the german historian michael wolffsohn asserts .
what does that have to do with my speech ?
a non-jew could also be chosen make the speech because the speech should also be for all german people .
there is an enormous volume published by raphael gross that documents all the terrible things that happened .
in contrast , there is also the fact that hundreds of non-jewish germans helped jewish germans .
that is something that is always downplayed .
i will also speak about this .
there is no collective guilt .
how , in 2010 , should november 9 be remembered ?
is there a way of doing it , so that it is not simply a ritual repeating the maxim " never again " ?
perhaps i was invited so that it would not become a pure ritual .
but it now seems that a lot of people in germany are upset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli author david grossman won the 2010 german book trade peace prize there are not that many people , let 's not exaggerate .
yes , the general secretary of the jewish organization - he was very upset .
but , david grossman , who this year won the peace prize of the german book trade is someone who constantly criticizes israeli policy and yet , he won that prize .
so , what 's the problem ?
the problem seems to be that you , it is said , have distanced yourself from judaism and have lived in france for a long time .
it is said that someone like grossman , who comes from israel is on more of a position to criticize , even if he does meet with criticism himself in israel for his opinions .
yes , but it is possible to speak freely in israel .
in germany the central council of jews would like it if there were only one single truth .
the american historian fritz stern and the former chancellor helmut schmidt both said that they are amazed that , from organizations here in germany you only hear a case of " right or wrong – my israel . "
during the german book trade presentation ceremony , i was very moved by what joachim gauck , correctly , said .
" my country right or wrong – if it is right , let it keep it right , if it is wrong , let it set it right . "
that means that we should judge each israeli policy accordingly .
you criticize the policies of israel – for example the policy of occupation and the separation wall between israelis and palestinians .
from a french point of view , why do you think such criticism always leads to such strong reactions from jewish organisations in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grosser praised comments made by joachim gauck -lrb- r . -rrb- at the german book prize it 's exactly the same in france .
one of the people i admire most , the former concentration camp inmate and french ambassador stephane estell - who also worked on the international declaration of human rights - has now travelled to gaza from egypt to see what the situation is like there .
immediately there were complaints , worse than i have had in germany – that he had not really been in the concentration camp , that he had in fact been a spy and so on ...
yes , we do have those reactions as well , at least from a few .
but it is a sensitive issue .
here in germany , of course , political correctness obviously plays a certain role .
i do n't know .
i would cite the former president koehler who in his speech to the israeli knesset - without referring to the palestinians - said that , as a result of its past , germany has the duty to defend human rights across the world .
that is something that is crucial for me and something that we should explain to young people who increasingly distance themselves and ask why they should bear any responsibility .
the responsibility is to learn from the past to defend so that we can defend human rights around the world , including germany .
what sort of reaction are you expecting on november 9 in frankfurt ?
it 's difficult to say .
i think that when i say the word israel , some of the listeners will listen more attentively while others will leave the room .
i have always found that it never comes to a debate .
i constantly try to debate the issues .
for example , at the launch of my last book " von auschwitz nach jerusalem " -lrb- “ from auschwitz to jerusalem ” -rrb- , about germany and israel , i insisted upon inviting jewish congregations in several german cities , but they did not come .
they do not want to debate because they do not want to have to always prove that they are right .

deutsche welle spoke to the controversial writer alfred grosser who has been chosen to give the keynote speech . on november 9 the author alfred grosser is to give a speech in remembrance of the kristallnacht , or the night of broken glass , pogrom against jews in germany carried out under the nazis in 1938 .
the choice of speaker has caused controversy with historians and germany 's central council of jews questioning grosser 's credentials .
grosser comes from a jewish family and emigrated to france with them in 1933 .
the political academic and author of numerous books and essays is seen as an important pioneer in post-war franco-german understanding .
in recent years he has become increasingly interested in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
his 2009 book " von auschwitz nach jerusalem " -lrb- " from auschwitz to jerusalem " -rrb- caused controversy as he dealt with the question of how much it is permissible to question the policies of israel . germany 's central council of jews is not happy , and has written to the mayor of frankfurt to complain that grosser is an inappropriate choice of speaker .
deutsche welle : alfred grosser , you 're french with german and jewish roots .
you were born in 1925 in frankfurt and fled from there to france in 1933 .
now you are to give a speech in the place of your birth at the november 9 memorial .
regardless of the criticism , what were your thoughts and feelings about doing this ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of synagogues and businesses were attacked during kristallnacht alfred grosser : first of all , there is a need to remember this particular day .
since august 1944 in marseille , when i heard that part of my family had been transported to auschwitz , i have been sure that there is no collective german guilt and yet that i also share some responsibility for the future of liberal democracy in germany .
this was my starting point for the speech .
how exactly does one qualify to make such a speech ?
is it for instance through a certain behaviour or membership of some kind of official jewish organisation .
is only a " real " jew allowed to give such a speech ?
you have been accused of distancing yourself from judaism .
that is , at least , what the german historian michael wolffsohn asserts .
what does that have to do with my speech ?
a non-jew could also be chosen make the speech because the speech should also be for all german people .
there is an enormous volume published by raphael gross that documents all the terrible things that happened .
in contrast , there is also the fact that hundreds of non-jewish germans helped jewish germans .
that is something that is always downplayed .
i will also speak about this .
there is no collective guilt .
how , in 2010 , should november 9 be remembered ?
is there a way of doing it , so that it is not simply a ritual repeating the maxim " never again " ?
perhaps i was invited so that it would not become a pure ritual .
but it now seems that a lot of people in germany are upset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli author david grossman won the 2010 german book trade peace prize there are not that many people , let 's not exaggerate .
yes , the general secretary of the jewish organization - he was very upset .
but , david grossman , who this year won the peace prize of the german book trade is someone who constantly criticizes israeli policy and yet , he won that prize .
so , what 's the problem ?
the problem seems to be that you , it is said , have distanced yourself from judaism and have lived in france for a long time .
it is said that someone like grossman , who comes from israel is on more of a position to criticize , even if he does meet with criticism himself in israel for his opinions .
yes , but it is possible to speak freely in israel .
in germany the central council of jews would like it if there were only one single truth .
the american historian fritz stern and the former chancellor helmut schmidt both said that they are amazed that , from organizations here in germany you only hear a case of " right or wrong – my israel . "
during the german book trade presentation ceremony , i was very moved by what joachim gauck , correctly , said .
" my country right or wrong – if it is right , let it keep it right , if it is wrong , let it set it right . "
that means that we should judge each israeli policy accordingly .
you criticize the policies of israel – for example the policy of occupation and the separation wall between israelis and palestinians .
from a french point of view , why do you think such criticism always leads to such strong reactions from jewish organisations in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grosser praised comments made by joachim gauck -lrb- r . -rrb- at the german book prize it 's exactly the same in france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 08.11.2010 author alfred grosser is controversial choice for kristallnacht speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grosser has been criticized for his views on israel every year on november 9 , st paul 's church in frankfurt commemorates the kristallnacht pogrom of 1938 .
deutsche welle spoke to the controversial writer alfred grosser who has been chosen to give the keynote speech . on november 9 the author alfred grosser is to give a speech in remembrance of the kristallnacht , or the night of broken glass , pogrom against jews in germany carried out under the nazis in 1938 .
the choice of speaker has caused controversy with historians and germany 's central council of jews questioning grosser 's credentials .
grosser comes from a jewish family and emigrated to france with them in 1933 .
the political academic and author of numerous books and essays is seen as an important pioneer in post-war franco-german understanding .
in recent years he has become increasingly interested in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
his 2009 book " von auschwitz nach jerusalem " -lrb- " from auschwitz to jerusalem " -rrb- caused controversy as he dealt with the question of how much it is permissible to question the policies of israel . germany 's central council of jews is not happy , and has written to the mayor of frankfurt to complain that grosser is an inappropriate choice of speaker .
deutsche welle : alfred grosser , you 're french with german and jewish roots .
you were born in 1925 in frankfurt and fled from there to france in 1933 .
now you are to give a speech in the place of your birth at the november 9 memorial .
regardless of the criticism , what were your thoughts and feelings about doing this ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of synagogues and businesses were attacked during kristallnacht alfred grosser : first of all , there is a need to remember this particular day .
since august 1944 in marseille , when i heard that part of my family had been transported to auschwitz , i have been sure that there is no collective german guilt and yet that i also share some responsibility for the future of liberal democracy in germany .
this was my starting point for the speech .
how exactly does one qualify to make such a speech ?
is it for instance through a certain behaviour or membership of some kind of official jewish organisation .
is only a " real " jew allowed to give such a speech ?
you have been accused of distancing yourself from judaism .
that is , at least , what the german historian michael wolffsohn asserts .
what does that have to do with my speech ?
a non-jew could also be chosen make the speech because the speech should also be for all german people .
there is an enormous volume published by raphael gross that documents all the terrible things that happened .
in contrast , there is also the fact that hundreds of non-jewish germans helped jewish germans .
that is something that is always downplayed .
i will also speak about this .
there is no collective guilt .
how , in 2010 , should november 9 be remembered ?
is there a way of doing it , so that it is not simply a ritual repeating the maxim " never again " ?
perhaps i was invited so that it would not become a pure ritual .
but it now seems that a lot of people in germany are upset .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli author david grossman won the 2010 german book trade peace prize there are not that many people , let 's not exaggerate .
yes , the general secretary of the jewish organization - he was very upset .
but , david grossman , who this year won the peace prize of the german book trade is someone who constantly criticizes israeli policy and yet , he won that prize .
so , what 's the problem ?
the problem seems to be that you , it is said , have distanced yourself from judaism and have lived in france for a long time .
it is said that someone like grossman , who comes from israel is on more of a position to criticize , even if he does meet with criticism himself in israel for his opinions .
yes , but it is possible to speak freely in israel .
in germany the central council of jews would like it if there were only one single truth .
the american historian fritz stern and the former chancellor helmut schmidt both said that they are amazed that , from organizations here in germany you only hear a case of " right or wrong – my israel . "
during the german book trade presentation ceremony , i was very moved by what joachim gauck , correctly , said .
" my country right or wrong – if it is right , let it keep it right , if it is wrong , let it set it right . "
that means that we should judge each israeli policy accordingly .
you criticize the policies of israel – for example the policy of occupation and the separation wall between israelis and palestinians .
from a french point of view , why do you think such criticism always leads to such strong reactions from jewish organisations in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grosser praised comments made by joachim gauck -lrb- r . -rrb- at the german book prize it 's exactly the same in france .
one of the people i admire most , the former concentration camp inmate and french ambassador stephane estell - who also worked on the international declaration of human rights - has now travelled to gaza from egypt to see what the situation is like there .
immediately there were complaints , worse than i have had in germany – that he had not really been in the concentration camp , that he had in fact been a spy and so on ...
yes , we do have those reactions as well , at least from a few .
but it is a sensitive issue .
here in germany , of course , political correctness obviously plays a certain role .
i do n't know .
i would cite the former president koehler who in his speech to the israeli knesset - without referring to the palestinians - said that , as a result of its past , germany has the duty to defend human rights across the world .
that is something that is crucial for me and something that we should explain to young people who increasingly distance themselves and ask why they should bear any responsibility .
the responsibility is to learn from the past to defend so that we can defend human rights around the world , including germany .
what sort of reaction are you expecting on november 9 in frankfurt ?
it 's difficult to say .
i think that when i say the word israel , some of the listeners will listen more attentively while others will leave the room .
i have always found that it never comes to a debate .
i constantly try to debate the issues .
for example , at the launch of my last book " von auschwitz nach jerusalem " -lrb- “ from auschwitz to jerusalem ” -rrb- , about germany and israel , i insisted upon inviting jewish congregations in several german cities , but they did not come .
they do not want to debate because they do not want to have to always prove that they are right .

papandreou had been seeking a mandate for his austerity drive . greek prime minister george papandreou has said he will not call a snap parliamentary election , claiming to have won sufficient support in local and regional polls to press ahead with austerity reforms .
papandreou made the announcement on sunday as his socialist party -lrb- pasok -rrb- appeared to have emerged narrowly ahead of rivals . the threat of a general election had rattled financial markets , with fears that the greek government would not be able to follow through on its unpopular budget drive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the budget measures come after an international rescue package was agreed in a televised address to the nation on sunday , papandreou - who only came to power last year - said he felt satisfied with a fresh mandate to press ahead with the program .
" making changes is not easy , " papandreou said .
" greek people brought us to power a year ago and today confirmed that they want this change .
we will continue with our task tomorrow , " estimates early on monday put pasok ahead in seven out of 13 regions .
the center-right new democracy party led in the remaining regions , although some races were so tight that they are likely to be contested again next sunday .
welcome news for markets risk premiums on greek government debt had risen in advance of the elections because of political uncertainty and the news was broadly welcomed by observers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the austerity drive has led to strikes and protests " it 's good news that papandreou can continue and that no political uncertainty enters the fray , " said andreas scheuerle , an economist at germany 's dekabank .
papandreou had at no stage indicated the criteria he would use to decide whether or not to call a fresh general election .
the government was forced to adopt a program of pay cuts , tax rises and a freeze in pensions - prompting strikes , riots and protests - after state finances were revealed to be far in a far worse state than expected earlier this year .
those reforms were agreed as part of 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 154.4 billion -rrb- bailout package from the international monetary fund and the european union in may .
the greek economy , which represents about 2.5 percent of that of the euro zone , is expected to shrink by 4 percent this year .

the last stretch is to be completed on tuesday by trucks , but activists have vowed to block the way . demonstrators , including farmers with tractors , blocked roads as authorities loaded the nuclear waste cargo on trucks for the 20-kilometer trip to the final storage facility at gorleben in northern germany . greenpeace activists used a vehicle concealed as a beer truck to block the semis from delivering their nuclear cargo to its final destination . the 123 tons of nuclear waste have been transported from northern france by rail to the city of dannenberg .
the last stretch to the gorleben site is to be completed by truck as soon as police manage to clear the demonstrators blocking the way . the train journey over the weekend had already been interrupted several times by massive protests along the way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another blockade awaits the nuclear waste in gorleben green party co-chair claudia roth , who took part in a sit-in blocking the streets over the weekend , defended the demonstrations and attacked chancellor angela merkel 's government for its new energy policy , which would extend the lifespan of germany 's 17 nuclear reactors by an average of 12 years . " the coalition government has torn apart a societal consensus , provoking the citizens to action , " she said .
while protests have occurred every time nuclear waste has been transported in germany , roth said it was new " that so many groups are now getting involved " in the protests . change of course in energy policy in an interview with public broadcaster ard on monday , green party parliamentary leader and former environment minister juergen trittin said the growth of the protests was a " clear answer " to the government 's lifespan extension of nuclear reactors , which he called a " multibillion euro present " to the nuclear energy industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trittin called merkel 's energy policy a ' present ' to nuclear energy companies as environment minister , trittin and the center-left government of gerhard schroeder enacted a plan to phase out nuclear energy in germany by 2021 . he also said at that time that green party members should not demonstrate against the transport of nuclear waste - a situation which he said has now changed . " we limited the lifespan of germany 's nuclear reactors , and thus limited the production of nuclear waste , " he said .
" now there will be additional waste produced .
that 's the difference , that 's what people are protesting on the streets - and they 're right to do so . " government strikes back christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- secretary general hermann groehe weighed into the debate monday , saying trittin 's reversal on calling on green members to renounce demonstrations back in 2001 was a clear example of double standards . " to call for discretion in government times , but then to add fuel to the fire in opposition is the height of hypocrisy , " groehe said in berlin on monday . alexander dobrindt , the secretary general of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , accused the greens of turning into the " political arm of the rioters , arsonists and stone throwers . " he added that green party leaders claudia roth and cem oezdemir were lending " moral support to the violation of the public peace . " green party on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezdemir and roth have won the greens support through their anti-nuclear platform nuclear energy is a highly contentious issue in germany , and recent polls suggest that the green party has benefitted from the rising anti-nuclear sentiment stoked by the government 's energy policy . a weekend survey by ard found that a record 22 percent of voters would support the green party if an election were held now . oezdemir wrote in an article published monday in the daily hamburger abendblatt that the massive mobilization should lead to a greater public engagement in organized politics . " i would really hope that as many as possible of these well-informed , educated and engaged people of all age groups and backgrounds are also looking toward the path of organizations , political parties and the government , " he said , referring also to the popular movement against the " stuttgart 21 " rail station renewal project . he added that the protestors were neither " naively idealist nor egotistical , nor radical .

whether it 's frivolous internet purchases , expansive cell phone bills , exorbitant shopping tours or excessive credit-card consumption , the temptation is huge – too huge for many teenagers and young adults to resist .

inge niebergall , a director of the banking association , does n't understand why general economics courses are n't part of the regular curriculum .
" last year we asked students if they wanted to learn more about economics in school , " niebergall said .
" some 78 percent of them responded positively .
more than 80 percent of the adults we surveyed approved of the idea as well because they see a real need . "
not only the banking federation but other industry associations and unions also complain about the insufficient economic education of young people .

" we need new ideas to systematically give students the armor they require to become ' responsible economic citizens . " '
what 's necessary is not only a curriculum reform but also changes to teachers ' training , retzmann added : " how should a teacher who has not studied economics and has never heard of economic education be able to teach basic economic principles ? "
in two expert reports , retzmann outlined what school students should know about economics by the end of their schooling and what that implies for teaching professionals among his recommendations : establish economics as a major for teachers in training .

in two expert reports , retzmann outlined what school students should know about economics by the end of their schooling and what that implies for teaching professionals among his recommendations : establish economics as a major for teachers in training .

inge niebergall , a director of the banking association , does n't understand why general economics courses are n't part of the regular curriculum .

" we need new ideas to systematically give students the armor they require to become ' responsible economic citizens . " '
what 's necessary is not only a curriculum reform but also changes to teachers ' training , retzmann added : " how should a teacher who has not studied economics and has never heard of economic education be able to teach basic economic principles ? "
in two expert reports , retzmann outlined what school students should know about economics by the end of their schooling and what that implies for teaching professionals among his recommendations : establish economics as a major for teachers in training .

some estimates put their numbers at more than one million .
as a result , demands for dedicated economics courses in schools are growing louder by the day . young and broke : more and more young people in germany are wracking up huge debt .
whether it 's frivolous internet purchases , expansive cell phone bills , exorbitant shopping tours or excessive credit-card consumption , the temptation is huge – too huge for many teenagers and young adults to resist .
industry associations partly blame schools for not offering a designated course devoted to general economics and personal finance .
focusing regularly on business there are exceptions .
once a month , a large german newspaper publishes a business page , which is both written and designed by school students .
" youth and business " is the name of the newspaper project .
it 's sponsored by the federal association of german banks , and requires students to focus regularly on the newspaper 's business pages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plenty of teenagers and young adults know how to spend and pile up debt , but not save the project exists only because it 's privately financed .
inge niebergall , a director of the banking association , does n't understand why general economics courses are n't part of the regular curriculum .
" last year we asked students if they wanted to learn more about economics in school , " niebergall said .
" some 78 percent of them responded positively .
more than 80 percent of the adults we surveyed approved of the idea as well because they see a real need . "
not only the banking federation but other industry associations and unions also complain about the insufficient economic education of young people .
thomas retzmann , a professor at the duisburg-essen university and chairman of the german society of economic studies , speaks of a desolate – and alarming – situation .
very few young people today , he complains , are familiar with terms like inflation and company pension funds .
" they need to have a basic understanding of economics to participate in daily life , " retzmann said .
" it begins with the news they see in the newspaper or on tv or in the other new media channels .
they need to have an idea of what 's happening to form an opinion . "
lack of a common economic course german schools are n't completely void of economics studies .
but education in germany is governed by the states .
so what students in schleswig-holstein learn is n't necessarily the same as what those in bavaria or north rhine-westphalia learn . the one thing that all states do have in common is the lack of a common economics curriculum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people need a basic understanding of economics " to participate in daily life " " today , schools often teach economics in a very fragmented way ; the subject is spread across very different course : calculating prices , for instance , is math , globalization is german , and economic geography is geography , " said otto kentzler , president of the confederation of german trades .
" we need new ideas to systematically give students the armor they require to become ' responsible economic citizens . " '
what 's necessary is not only a curriculum reform but also changes to teachers ' training , retzmann added : " how should a teacher who has not studied economics and has never heard of economic education be able to teach basic economic principles ? "
in two expert reports , retzmann outlined what school students should know about economics by the end of their schooling and what that implies for teaching professionals among his recommendations : establish economics as a major for teachers in training .
