program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 11.11.2010 german scientists discover new treatment for antibiotic-resistant bacteria großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mice can effectively battle bacteria with the newly-developed antibodies researchers have developed a process in mice to battle bacteria no longer treatable with prevalent antibiotics .
the findings could have significant implications for dealing with hospital-acquired bugs . every year , over four million hospital patients in europe develop an infection during their stay .
the culprit is most often a strain of the bacteria staphylococcus aureus , also known as mrsa , which has proven resistant to antibiotic treatment .
scientists from the university of wuerzburg and the helmholtz center for infection research -lrb- hzi -rrb- in braunschweig have now found an approach to treating such infections .
they have developed an antibody which specifically targets mrsa in mice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staphylococcus aureus can cause a range of illnesses " we have succeeded in activating a defense mechanism against staphylococcus pathogens in mice with the help of antibodies , " said dr. udo lorenz from the university of wuerzburg 's department of surgery .
together with dr. knut ohlsen from the institute for molecular infection biology , lorenz has spent the last few years pursuing the idea of combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria with antibodies .
" these antibodies attach themselves to a specific point on the bacterium , " lorenz told deutsche welle .
this in turn marks the bacterium , so that the body 's own scavenger cells can detect them and subsequently kill them .
dr. christian erck from hzi worked on actually developing the antibodies in mice .
" these antibodies help make the bacteria visible to the immune system , " he told deutsche welle .
" even when antibiotics can no longer kill multi-resistant bacterial strains , antibodies still have a good chance against them . "
in the experiments , the mice 's immune systems were able to kill 30 percent more pathogens with the aid of the antibodies than without .
" this is a very dramatic advantage , which can constitute the difference between death and survival , " lorenz said .
targeting immune weakness most people have staphylococcus bacteria on their skin and , if they 're healthy , it does n't cause any problems .
" but this is a very flexible bacteria and it can become extremely aggressive , " erck said .
if these pathogens make their way inside patients with weakened immune systems , they cause infections which are extremely difficult to cure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lorenz -lrb- left -rrb- and ohlsen developed this procedure lorenz said this would be the target group for treatment .
" these are patients who have just had surgery or are in intensive care , whose immune systems are not functioning in an optimal way , " he said .
mouse to man the next step now involves transferring the antibody from mice to humans .
this means the entire molecule will need to be " humanized " so that people do n't develop antibodies against the mice antibodies and reject them .
" we will take only the part of the antibody that docks to the bacterium and build the rest of the molecule artificially , so that it is suitable for people , " lorenz said .
if everything goes according to plan , lorenz said he expected the first clinical study to take place at the end of 2012 .
" then we can find out which sort of infections are suitable for this treatment , " he said .
the scientists have published their findings in the current issue of the journal antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy .

" we continue to support the goal of withdrawal , " westerwelle said during a parliamentary debate on thursday in berlin .
disarmament is going to be a " key issue " for germany at the lisbon meeting , the foreign minister said .
there are no official figures about the number of nuclear weapons stationed on german soil , but it is believed that perhaps 10 to 20 nuclear warheads from the us arsenal are stockpiled at the buechel air base in the state of rhineland-palatinate in southwestern germany .
russian cooperation government leaders and heads of state of the 28 nato member countries meet in the portuguese capital next week friday to discuss a major strategic overhaul of the military alliance .
a key element of nato 's new strategy to be decided upon in lisbon is a european missile-defense system .
in what westerwelle called an " historic gesture , " russia will be involved in the discussions .
" we do n't want a europe with areas of differing security levels , " westerwelle said .
" we want to improve our security alongside , not in confrontation with russia . "
westerwelle defends cabinet colleague the foreign minister used his address in parliament to also set straight a cornerstone of german military doctrine .
westerwelle rejected accusations that defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was revamping the german armed forces to fight what the opposition called " economic wars . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister called for nuclear exit and defended his colleague karl-theodor zu guttenberg " we will continue the culture of military restraint .
any other assumption is defamation that has nothing to do with reality , " the minister said .
westerwelle 's comments were viewed as indirect support for defense minister guttenberg , who recently made controversial remarks to the effect that germany should align its security policies with economic interests , like other countries do .
in response , the green party parliamentary leader , juergen trittin , accused guttenberg of pursuing " gunboat diplomacy . "
defending his position , guttenberg told parliament on thursday that the strategy was contained in a government white paper from 2006 when the opposition social democrats were still in a grand coalition with chancellor merkel 's christian democrats .
" there were no cries of outrage then , " guttenberg said , " but now comes the great wave of indignation . "
the issue of economic intervention is also expected to be on the agenda of the nato summit next week .

it 's match day twelve in the bundesliga and after the abject failure of trying to summon voodoo spirits to do their bidding last week , the dw soccer pundits have resorted to less ghoulish methods . dw 's soccer pundits have been forming a fidgety queue outside the bathroom this week after downing enough tea to fill a swimming pool .
as well as causing numerous pairs of legs to cross , the experiment has also produced enough bundesliga result-shaped tea leaf formations to come up with the predictions for match day twelve .
amuse yourselves with these forecasts while we dash once again to the little boys room ...
saturday , nov 13 bremen – frankfurt oh dear .
just what is going on with werder bremen ?
esteemed colleague jefferson chase nailed it in his commentary this week – whatever 's gone wrong at bremen , it 'll need huge changes to fix it .
while wondering what was going to happen next was initially an endearing game of roulette , as the season wears on , it looks like bremen are playing the russian variety .
no guesses who 'll get the bullet if their form continues to nosedive .
frankfurt very well could be the team to load the gun .
prediction : frankfurt 2-1 wolfsburg – schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke edged closer to safety thanks to raul 's goals go on then , but just whisper it … schalke may have turned a corner .
there – i said it … which means , of course , that wolfsburg 's up-and-down season will ascend again to the detriment of felix magath 's struggling side on saturday .
the royal blues may have fired three past st. pauli to put them one point from safety but the hamburg club are quickly becoming easy pickings as their confidence dwindles .
wolfsburg will be a sterner test .
perhaps the training ground punch-ups suggest the wolves have the fight to come out on top in this one .
prediction : wolfsburg 3-2 cologne – moenchengladbach wake us up when this derby is over .
the two sides who manage to make schalke look good come together in this basement clash with little daylight between them in terms of points and class .
gladbach at least shocked the life out of bayern last week - which always raises a smile in these parts - but with cologne struggling to find anything resembling flair in any of their games to date , these two could blunder and bump against each other for 90 minutes and still not score .
hopefully one will manage it but it 's a coin toss .
heads it 's gladbach .
prediction : gladbach 1-0 kaiserslautern – stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ciprian marica led the way in the thrashing of bremen stuttgart will be nicely rested after last weekend 's game so kaiserslautern should beware .
vfb stuck six past bremen and then must have retired to a dark room to lie down .
despite the green shoots of recovery growing over at the mercedes benz arena , few would have tipped jens keller 's team to thrash werder so comprehensively -lrb- i certainly did n't -rrb- .
but then kaiserslautern looked impressive last week , even though they evenutally lost against in-form leverkusen . this one could prove quite entertaining to watch .
prediction : 2-2 st. pauli – leverkusen pauli continue to slide and it 's already looking like an inevitable one towards what many people think is their rightful place in the relegation zone .
the neutral will hope they can arrest the decline but taking on leverkusen may not be the best place to start .
bayer have been quietly efficient in rising to third place and will be looking to make up ground on mainz in the place above them .
on form alone , it looks as though pauli will be deeper in the mire come saturday night .
prediction : leverkusen 3-1 mainz – hanover mainz in crisis !
two defeats on the bounce !
how easy it is to forget what an achievement this season has already been for mainz .
it is n't only their position which is impressive but the way they 've gotten there .
okay , so freiburg should never have beaten them last week – but only in the context of mainz 's amazing form to date .
last season , this would n't have been such a shock .
losing or drawing with hanover would n't have been either but on the evidence of this campaign alone , one would expect mainz to triumph .
prediction : mainz 2-0 sunday , nov 14 hoffenheim – freiburg despite winning last week , hoffenheim still dropped down the league , giving the illusion that their title charge has already petered out .
do n't be fooled .
the pendulum of form is swinging in the hoff 's direction and a win over freiburg will see them back in the mix .
freiburg had a great result against mainz and will have to be completely free of the hangover to cope with the hoff at home .
expecting the freiburgers to be well up for it as usual , this could be a tight affair .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 bayern – nuremberg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern lost their heads against gladbach last weekend they still have n't quite got it right , have they ?
louis van gaal tore his team a new one after letting the points slip against bottom club gladbach last week and you would expect a reaction from the german champions against nuremberg on sunday .
but how many times has the gruff dutchman got all red in the face only to see his team go pale on the pitch ?
nuremberg cantered to a win against cologne last week and of course bayern , however dire , are the polar opposite of the boys for köln .
however , the bavarians are increasingly hard to fathom so – who knows ?

they say they ’ re willing to go to the highest european court . tom freeman and katherine doyle are a heterosexual couple applying for a civil partnership – a form of legal union available only to same-sex couples .
they are one of four heterosexual couples and four same-sex couples trying to challenge the current uk legislation on marriage and civil partnerships .
" initially our aim was equality but increasingly as we look critically at marriage , we feel it is not relevant to us , " katherine doyle told deutsche welle .
" we really do want a civil partnership .
in our day-to-day lives we are more like partners . "
" the important question for us is : why should n't we have a civil partnership , " her partner tom added .
" the institution is being provided for by law so why should n't i have one ? "
gay couples in britain have been allowed to enter into civil partnerships since 2004 , which gives them all the same legal rights and responsibilities as a civil marriage . however they are denied a civil marriage certificate .
on the other hand heterosexual couples do not qualify to enter a civil partnership .
they can either get married or not .
a violation of human rights ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom freeman and katherine doyle are prepared to fight for years working alongside the gay rights group outrage , the eight couples argue that denying each group the legal rights of the other is discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation , something which is contrary to britain 's human rights act . yet tom and katherine 's application has been refused so far .
all they got was a short statement from the town hall , saying that " a civil partnership is a relationship between two people of the same sex . "
the eight couples are one by one each week applying to their local town halls for either a marriage certificate , or a civil partnership certificate , whichever is denied them by law .
at the end of two months , if all applications are turned down , as they are expected to be , the couples will begin a high court challenge . it is the first time that heterosexual couples have taken such an active role in a campaign which at first glance might appear to benefit gay couples wanting equality and a full marriage .
all the way to the european court of human rights the civil partnerships act of 2004 was introduced by the then labour government with wide support in parliament .
it gives same-sex couples the same legal rights and responsibilities as civil marriage .
there also is a formal process for dissolving partnerships which is akin to divorce , but gay rights activists still criticize that it does n't grant full marriage status to gay couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil partnerships exist in most eu member states " when all eight couples - gay and straight - have filed their applications and have been refused we 'll then consult with our legal advisers with a view to bringing the case to the courts , " peter tatchell of the group outrage , which is leading the equal love campaign , told deutsche welle .
" there ’ s a very strong argument that the twin bans on gay marriages and heterosexual civil partnerships are illegal under the human rights act , " he added .
tatchell says the group is prepared to take the case all the way to the european court of human rights if necessary . public opinion backs gay marriage in response to the campaign , the government has issued a statement saying that it is currently considering the next steps for civil partnerships . it said that earlier this year ministers met with people and organizations holding a range of views and that they are looking at the best way to take those views forward . the equal love campaign argues that public attitudes have shifted strongly in favor of allowing gay couples to marry , citing an opinion poll carried out by the group populus in june 2009 , which found that 61 percent of the public believe gay couples should be allowed to marry , while 33 percent disagreed . however , if there is a change in the law , it is not likely to come soon .
" it could take five to ten years to go through the courts , " said katherine doyle .
" but we really feel that we ca n't commit to marriage when it 's exclusive . "

the greek finance ministry has said it has narrowly missed its january-october target to reduce its budget deficit .
the unwelcome news comes as the eu said it would take action to support ireland , if needed . the greek public deficit has fallen sharply since the implementation of an eu-imf rescue package for the debt-stricken country , but efforts to reduce the shortfall have still fallen short of the targets set for this year .
greece , struggling with a huge public deficit , came close to default in may and had to be bailed out with a 110-billion-euro package arranged by the eu and international monetary fund .
through october , greek public finances showed a deficit of some 17.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 24 billion -rrb- , down 30 percent from the same period a year ago , but still less than the 32 percent target .
the government in athens has implemented a series of draconian reforms aimed at restoring its financial credibility .
it cut spending by 7 percent , or four billion euros , but tax revenues only grew 3.7 percent , well short of the 2010 target of 13.7 percent .
at the same time as this announcement , the european union moved to reassure financial markets on thursday that it was ready to support ireland as the eurozone country 's debt woes made waves at the g20 summit in south korea .
ireland has worst deficit in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu is poised to help ireland too , barroso said concern about ireland is growing after irish bond yields soared to a record level of 8.28 percent on wednesday . as a result , european commission president jose manuel barroso found himself compelled to announce that the eu stood ready to help ireland " in case of need . "
" what is important now is that we have all the necessary instruments in place , " barroso said in the south korean capital , seoul , ahead of the g20 meeting .
" we are monitoring the situation in ireland on a permanent basis , " he added .

they say they ’ re willing to go to the highest european court . tom freeman and katherine doyle are a heterosexual couple applying for a civil partnership – a form of legal union available only to same-sex couples .
they are one of four heterosexual couples and four same-sex couples trying to challenge the current uk legislation on marriage and civil partnerships .
" initially our aim was equality but increasingly as we look critically at marriage , we feel it is not relevant to us , " katherine doyle told deutsche welle .
" we really do want a civil partnership .
in our day-to-day lives we are more like partners . "
" the important question for us is : why should n't we have a civil partnership , " her partner tom added .
" the institution is being provided for by law so why should n't i have one ? "
gay couples in britain have been allowed to enter into civil partnerships since 2004 , which gives them all the same legal rights and responsibilities as a civil marriage . however they are denied a civil marriage certificate .
on the other hand heterosexual couples do not qualify to enter a civil partnership .
they can either get married or not .
a violation of human rights ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom freeman and katherine doyle are prepared to fight for years working alongside the gay rights group outrage , the eight couples argue that denying each group the legal rights of the other is discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation , something which is contrary to britain 's human rights act . yet tom and katherine 's application has been refused so far .
all they got was a short statement from the town hall , saying that " a civil partnership is a relationship between two people of the same sex . "
the eight couples are one by one each week applying to their local town halls for either a marriage certificate , or a civil partnership certificate , whichever is denied them by law .
at the end of two months , if all applications are turned down , as they are expected to be , the couples will begin a high court challenge . it is the first time that heterosexual couples have taken such an active role in a campaign which at first glance might appear to benefit gay couples wanting equality and a full marriage .
all the way to the european court of human rights the civil partnerships act of 2004 was introduced by the then labour government with wide support in parliament .
it gives same-sex couples the same legal rights and responsibilities as civil marriage .
there also is a formal process for dissolving partnerships which is akin to divorce , but gay rights activists still criticize that it does n't grant full marriage status to gay couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil partnerships exist in most eu member states " when all eight couples - gay and straight - have filed their applications and have been refused we 'll then consult with our legal advisers with a view to bringing the case to the courts , " peter tatchell of the group outrage , which is leading the equal love campaign , told deutsche welle .
" there ’ s a very strong argument that the twin bans on gay marriages and heterosexual civil partnerships are illegal under the human rights act , " he added .
tatchell says the group is prepared to take the case all the way to the european court of human rights if necessary . public opinion backs gay marriage in response to the campaign , the government has issued a statement saying that it is currently considering the next steps for civil partnerships . it said that earlier this year ministers met with people and organizations holding a range of views and that they are looking at the best way to take those views forward . the equal love campaign argues that public attitudes have shifted strongly in favor of allowing gay couples to marry , citing an opinion poll carried out by the group populus in june 2009 , which found that 61 percent of the public believe gay couples should be allowed to marry , while 33 percent disagreed . however , if there is a change in the law , it is not likely to come soon .
" it could take five to ten years to go through the courts , " said katherine doyle .
" but we really feel that we ca n't commit to marriage when it 's exclusive . "

it 's match day twelve in the bundesliga and after the abject failure of trying to summon voodoo spirits to do their bidding last week , the dw soccer pundits have resorted to less ghoulish methods . dw 's soccer pundits have been forming a fidgety queue outside the bathroom this week after downing enough tea to fill a swimming pool .
as well as causing numerous pairs of legs to cross , the experiment has also produced enough bundesliga result-shaped tea leaf formations to come up with the predictions for match day twelve .
amuse yourselves with these forecasts while we dash once again to the little boys room ...
saturday , nov 13 bremen – frankfurt oh dear .
just what is going on with werder bremen ?
esteemed colleague jefferson chase nailed it in his commentary this week – whatever 's gone wrong at bremen , it 'll need huge changes to fix it .
while wondering what was going to happen next was initially an endearing game of roulette , as the season wears on , it looks like bremen are playing the russian variety .
no guesses who 'll get the bullet if their form continues to nosedive .
frankfurt very well could be the team to load the gun .
prediction : frankfurt 2-1 wolfsburg – schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke edged closer to safety thanks to raul 's goals go on then , but just whisper it … schalke may have turned a corner .
there – i said it … which means , of course , that wolfsburg 's up-and-down season will ascend again to the detriment of felix magath 's struggling side on saturday .
the royal blues may have fired three past st. pauli to put them one point from safety but the hamburg club are quickly becoming easy pickings as their confidence dwindles .
wolfsburg will be a sterner test .
perhaps the training ground punch-ups suggest the wolves have the fight to come out on top in this one .
prediction : wolfsburg 3-2 cologne – moenchengladbach wake us up when this derby is over .
the two sides who manage to make schalke look good come together in this basement clash with little daylight between them in terms of points and class .
gladbach at least shocked the life out of bayern last week - which always raises a smile in these parts - but with cologne struggling to find anything resembling flair in any of their games to date , these two could blunder and bump against each other for 90 minutes and still not score .
hopefully one will manage it but it 's a coin toss .
heads it 's gladbach .
prediction : gladbach 1-0 kaiserslautern – stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ciprian marica led the way in the thrashing of bremen stuttgart will be nicely rested after last weekend 's game so kaiserslautern should beware .
vfb stuck six past bremen and then must have retired to a dark room to lie down .
despite the green shoots of recovery growing over at the mercedes benz arena , few would have tipped jens keller 's team to thrash werder so comprehensively -lrb- i certainly did n't -rrb- .
but then kaiserslautern looked impressive last week , even though they evenutally lost against in-form leverkusen . this one could prove quite entertaining to watch .
prediction : 2-2 st. pauli – leverkusen pauli continue to slide and it 's already looking like an inevitable one towards what many people think is their rightful place in the relegation zone .
the neutral will hope they can arrest the decline but taking on leverkusen may not be the best place to start .
bayer have been quietly efficient in rising to third place and will be looking to make up ground on mainz in the place above them .
on form alone , it looks as though pauli will be deeper in the mire come saturday night .
prediction : leverkusen 3-1 mainz – hanover mainz in crisis !
two defeats on the bounce !
how easy it is to forget what an achievement this season has already been for mainz .
it is n't only their position which is impressive but the way they 've gotten there .
okay , so freiburg should never have beaten them last week – but only in the context of mainz 's amazing form to date .
last season , this would n't have been such a shock .
losing or drawing with hanover would n't have been either but on the evidence of this campaign alone , one would expect mainz to triumph .
prediction : mainz 2-0 sunday , nov 14 hoffenheim – freiburg despite winning last week , hoffenheim still dropped down the league , giving the illusion that their title charge has already petered out .
do n't be fooled .
the pendulum of form is swinging in the hoff 's direction and a win over freiburg will see them back in the mix .
freiburg had a great result against mainz and will have to be completely free of the hangover to cope with the hoff at home .
expecting the freiburgers to be well up for it as usual , this could be a tight affair .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 bayern – nuremberg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern lost their heads against gladbach last weekend they still have n't quite got it right , have they ?

but how many times has the gruff dutchman got all red in the face only to see his team go pale on the pitch ?
nuremberg cantered to a win against cologne last week and of course bayern , however dire , are the polar opposite of the boys for köln .
however , the bavarians are increasingly hard to fathom so – who knows ?

it 's match day twelve in the bundesliga and after the abject failure of trying to summon voodoo spirits to do their bidding last week , the dw soccer pundits have resorted to less ghoulish methods . dw 's soccer pundits have been forming a fidgety queue outside the bathroom this week after downing enough tea to fill a swimming pool .
as well as causing numerous pairs of legs to cross , the experiment has also produced enough bundesliga result-shaped tea leaf formations to come up with the predictions for match day twelve .
amuse yourselves with these forecasts while we dash once again to the little boys room ...
saturday , nov 13 bremen – frankfurt oh dear .
just what is going on with werder bremen ?
esteemed colleague jefferson chase nailed it in his commentary this week – whatever 's gone wrong at bremen , it 'll need huge changes to fix it .
while wondering what was going to happen next was initially an endearing game of roulette , as the season wears on , it looks like bremen are playing the russian variety .
no guesses who 'll get the bullet if their form continues to nosedive .
frankfurt very well could be the team to load the gun .
prediction : frankfurt 2-1 wolfsburg – schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke edged closer to safety thanks to raul 's goals go on then , but just whisper it … schalke may have turned a corner .
there – i said it … which means , of course , that wolfsburg 's up-and-down season will ascend again to the detriment of felix magath 's struggling side on saturday .
the royal blues may have fired three past st. pauli to put them one point from safety but the hamburg club are quickly becoming easy pickings as their confidence dwindles .
wolfsburg will be a sterner test .
perhaps the training ground punch-ups suggest the wolves have the fight to come out on top in this one .
prediction : wolfsburg 3-2 cologne – moenchengladbach wake us up when this derby is over .
the two sides who manage to make schalke look good come together in this basement clash with little daylight between them in terms of points and class .
gladbach at least shocked the life out of bayern last week - which always raises a smile in these parts - but with cologne struggling to find anything resembling flair in any of their games to date , these two could blunder and bump against each other for 90 minutes and still not score .
hopefully one will manage it but it 's a coin toss .
heads it 's gladbach .
prediction : gladbach 1-0 kaiserslautern – stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ciprian marica led the way in the thrashing of bremen stuttgart will be nicely rested after last weekend 's game so kaiserslautern should beware .
vfb stuck six past bremen and then must have retired to a dark room to lie down .
despite the green shoots of recovery growing over at the mercedes benz arena , few would have tipped jens keller 's team to thrash werder so comprehensively -lrb- i certainly did n't -rrb- .
but then kaiserslautern looked impressive last week , even though they evenutally lost against in-form leverkusen . this one could prove quite entertaining to watch .
prediction : 2-2 st. pauli – leverkusen pauli continue to slide and it 's already looking like an inevitable one towards what many people think is their rightful place in the relegation zone .
the neutral will hope they can arrest the decline but taking on leverkusen may not be the best place to start .
bayer have been quietly efficient in rising to third place and will be looking to make up ground on mainz in the place above them .
on form alone , it looks as though pauli will be deeper in the mire come saturday night .
prediction : leverkusen 3-1 mainz – hanover mainz in crisis !
two defeats on the bounce !
how easy it is to forget what an achievement this season has already been for mainz .
it is n't only their position which is impressive but the way they 've gotten there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 11.11.2010 german scientists discover new treatment for antibiotic-resistant bacteria großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mice can effectively battle bacteria with the newly-developed antibodies researchers have developed a process in mice to battle bacteria no longer treatable with prevalent antibiotics .
the findings could have significant implications for dealing with hospital-acquired bugs . every year , over four million hospital patients in europe develop an infection during their stay .
the culprit is most often a strain of the bacteria staphylococcus aureus , also known as mrsa , which has proven resistant to antibiotic treatment .
scientists from the university of wuerzburg and the helmholtz center for infection research -lrb- hzi -rrb- in braunschweig have now found an approach to treating such infections .
they have developed an antibody which specifically targets mrsa in mice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staphylococcus aureus can cause a range of illnesses " we have succeeded in activating a defense mechanism against staphylococcus pathogens in mice with the help of antibodies , " said dr. udo lorenz from the university of wuerzburg 's department of surgery .
together with dr. knut ohlsen from the institute for molecular infection biology , lorenz has spent the last few years pursuing the idea of combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria with antibodies .
" these antibodies attach themselves to a specific point on the bacterium , " lorenz told deutsche welle .
this in turn marks the bacterium , so that the body 's own scavenger cells can detect them and subsequently kill them .
dr. christian erck from hzi worked on actually developing the antibodies in mice .
" these antibodies help make the bacteria visible to the immune system , " he told deutsche welle .
" even when antibiotics can no longer kill multi-resistant bacterial strains , antibodies still have a good chance against them . "
in the experiments , the mice 's immune systems were able to kill 30 percent more pathogens with the aid of the antibodies than without .
" this is a very dramatic advantage , which can constitute the difference between death and survival , " lorenz said .
targeting immune weakness most people have staphylococcus bacteria on their skin and , if they 're healthy , it does n't cause any problems .
" but this is a very flexible bacteria and it can become extremely aggressive , " erck said .
if these pathogens make their way inside patients with weakened immune systems , they cause infections which are extremely difficult to cure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lorenz -lrb- left -rrb- and ohlsen developed this procedure lorenz said this would be the target group for treatment .
" these are patients who have just had surgery or are in intensive care , whose immune systems are not functioning in an optimal way , " he said .
mouse to man the next step now involves transferring the antibody from mice to humans .
this means the entire molecule will need to be " humanized " so that people do n't develop antibodies against the mice antibodies and reject them .
" we will take only the part of the antibody that docks to the bacterium and build the rest of the molecule artificially , so that it is suitable for people , " lorenz said .
if everything goes according to plan , lorenz said he expected the first clinical study to take place at the end of 2012 .
" then we can find out which sort of infections are suitable for this treatment , " he said .
the scientists have published their findings in the current issue of the journal antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy .

the report says corruption both affected cost for business development but also crippled countries in efforts to ward off poverty as money used in corrupt payments was not being spent on job creation .
sri mulyani indrawati , world bank managing director said the consequences of corruption also go beyond simply the economic impact .
" over time it becomes a real barrier to development , innovation and business growth because sometimes the corruption is in the form of counterfeit drugs so better don ’ t get better or they die , " he said .
" sometime corruption is a building that collapses in the face of national disaster because the quality inspector took a payment from the construction contractor to falsify an inspection .
corruption can kill . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva says there is no " good corruption " no " good corruption " but sri mulyani , a former indonesian finance minister , in comments seen as targeting indonesian politicians who resisted reforms while she was minister said while progress had been made in curbing corruption in indonesia , there was still much to do .
" i see the transformation in my own country , " said sri mulyani . " it is true there is much to be done still .
corruption remains intertwined with politics and there are brazen attacks on those fighting corruption .
we are not alone in that regard .
nonetheless , corruption is an issue that no politician can ignore in indonesia . "
thailand ’ s prime minister abhisit vejjajiva , said despite efforts in thailand corruption remained endemic and was widely accepted within the community : " significantly , even today young people in my country tell me that they expect to see corruption everywhere .
an unbelievable percentage of people also say it is ok for politicians to be corrupt as long as they are capable of bringing economic prosperity .
rampant corruption can exist amid high economic growth .
citizens must be prudently aware that there is no such thing as ' good corruption ' . "
reports put the annual cost of corruption in thailand at around $ 3.0 billion a year .
in a local initiative , more than two dozen thai companies agreed to form a collective alliance to work against corruption .
the directors ’ institute says as many as 200 companies can be expected to join the alliance by next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian protesters demanded that the president should quit over two corruption scandals corruption contributes to inequality but for asian development bank president , haruhiko kuroda , the economic costs of corruption have a wider impact on the community .
" corruption is a tax on the poor , " he said . " corruption and weak governance in general undermine government revenues resulting in poor infrastructure and hinders the pace of poverty reduction .
it also contributes to inequalities in access to education , health , infrastructure and other productive assets .
and it is the poor and the vulnerable that inevitably bear the brunt . "
u.s. secretary of state hilary clinton , in a pre-recorded video statement , stressed the wider impact of corruption from business , politics , and democracy and as a factor in causing malnutrition .
but officials say while the issue of corruption was more openly discussed and legislation strengthened , enforcement remained a problem .
also for many countries where corruption remained rampant there was still some way to go to reduce its impact across societies .

they claimed that the power-sharing deal they had been presented with was not being honoured and that three of the party 's most senior members , barred for their alleged ties to saddam 's baath party , had not been reinstated as promised . as well as the annulment of the bans against the three iraqiya members , iraqiya had presented a further three conditions on which its participation in the power-sharing agreement would hinge : a bill forming the security body , a committee examining cases against political detainees , and codifying the power-sharing deal . iraqiya 's support for any government is seen a hugely important if iraq is not to descend into ethnic violence once more .
the sunni arab minority , which gave iraqiya a narrow victory in the contested march 7 poll , provided the heaviest resistance in the anti-us insurgency after the 2003 invasion .
its involvement in any coalition is imperative if peace is to be achieved . iraqiya 's apparent rejection of the deal highlights the fierce divides and rivalries which have paralysed the iraqi political system since the fall of saddam hussein regime .
the deal , clinched late wednesday night after three days of high-pressure talks between the rival factions , saw shiite prime minister al-maliki returning to office for a second term . talabani , a kurd , is expected to retain the presidency .
and a sunni mp was to be elected as speaker of parliament .
maliki now has 30 days to form his cabinet , and the next parliamentary meeting is scheduled for saturday .
the decision offered hope that the next government would include enough sunni representation to lower the chances of a return to the sectarian violence that killed tens of thousands of people after the 2003 , u.s.-led invasion that ousted sunni dictator saddam hussein .
iraqiya , who had held out for months to take the premiership from maliki after it narrowly won more seats in the march election , initially confirmed it had finally signed up to the deal .
us praises deal the obama administration called the development " a big step forward for iraq . " " all along we 've said the best result would be a government that reflects the results of the elections , includes all the major blocs representing iraq 's ethnic and sectarian groups , and that does not exclude or marginalize anyone .
that 's exactly what iraqis seem to have agreed to , " antony blinken , national security adviser to us vice president joe biden , said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi prime minister ayad allawi 's group finally agreed to the deal iraq has been without a new government since the vote , which gave iraqiya two more seats than maliki 's bloc .
neither had enough for a majority in parliament , leaving the factions to negotiate a government .
iraqiya initially joined a kurdish alliance in supporting maliki following months of contentious negotiations which raised tensions in iraq as the army and police try to cement security gains against a stubborn insurgency .

they claimed that the power-sharing deal they had been presented with was not being honoured and that three of the party 's most senior members , barred for their alleged ties to saddam 's baath party , had not been reinstated as promised . as well as the annulment of the bans against the three iraqiya members , iraqiya had presented a further three conditions on which its participation in the power-sharing agreement would hinge : a bill forming the security body , a committee examining cases against political detainees , and codifying the power-sharing deal . iraqiya 's support for any government is seen a hugely important if iraq is not to descend into ethnic violence once more .
the sunni arab minority , which gave iraqiya a narrow victory in the contested march 7 poll , provided the heaviest resistance in the anti-us insurgency after the 2003 invasion .
its involvement in any coalition is imperative if peace is to be achieved . iraqiya 's apparent rejection of the deal highlights the fierce divides and rivalries which have paralysed the iraqi political system since the fall of saddam hussein regime .
the deal , clinched late wednesday night after three days of high-pressure talks between the rival factions , saw shiite prime minister al-maliki returning to office for a second term . talabani , a kurd , is expected to retain the presidency .
and a sunni mp was to be elected as speaker of parliament .
maliki now has 30 days to form his cabinet , and the next parliamentary meeting is scheduled for saturday .
the decision offered hope that the next government would include enough sunni representation to lower the chances of a return to the sectarian violence that killed tens of thousands of people after the 2003 , u.s.-led invasion that ousted sunni dictator saddam hussein .
iraqiya , who had held out for months to take the premiership from maliki after it narrowly won more seats in the march election , initially confirmed it had finally signed up to the deal .
us praises deal the obama administration called the development " a big step forward for iraq . " " all along we 've said the best result would be a government that reflects the results of the elections , includes all the major blocs representing iraq 's ethnic and sectarian groups , and that does not exclude or marginalize anyone .
that 's exactly what iraqis seem to have agreed to , " antony blinken , national security adviser to us vice president joe biden , said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi prime minister ayad allawi 's group finally agreed to the deal iraq has been without a new government since the vote , which gave iraqiya two more seats than maliki 's bloc .
neither had enough for a majority in parliament , leaving the factions to negotiate a government .
iraqiya initially joined a kurdish alliance in supporting maliki following months of contentious negotiations which raised tensions in iraq as the army and police try to cement security gains against a stubborn insurgency .
last month , maliki toured capitals in the region - from iran and syria to turkey and egypt - to gain regional backing for his effort to stay in power .

the construction group acs handed in its offer to german financial supervisors bafin , which now has 15 days to deliberate . spain 's largest construction group acs presented its offer for german rival hochtief to germany 's financial supervisory authority bafin on thursday .
bafin now has 15 days to rule on the takeover bid , and hochtief shareholders then have a further four weeks to decide whether to accept the offer .
acs , which already holds just under 30 percent of hochtief , germany 's largest public works construction company , wants to take a controlling stake in the business .
it is seeking an all-share swap to create what would become one of the world 's leading construction firms .
however , acs has offered a price below hochtief 's current market value of around 4.3 billion euros -lrb- 5.9 billion dollars -rrb- , which hochtief sees as unfair .

another option is for essen-based hochtief to puts its subsidiary concessions on the stock market , even if it means separating itself from that part of its business . concessions ' main activity is the operation of airports and toll-roads .
at the same time the german firm is trying to force the spanish group to make a bid for hochtief 's australian subsidiary leighton , thereby increasing the price , and possibly discouraging acs .

however both reports warn about the increase in so-called legal highs . over five percent of germans say they have taken some kind of illegal drug during the previous 12 months , according to the german drugs monitoring body dbdd .
the survey was carried out in 2009 and shows an increase of just 0.1 percent over the figures in the previous survey , carried out in 2006 .
the annual reports of the dbdd and its european partner emcdda were published this week , and show similar patterns of drug use in germany and the eu as a whole .
they show that levels of illegal drug use are relatively stable .
in germany , 26.7 percent of people surveyed had taken some kind of illegal drug in their lifetime , but only 2.6 percent had taken something in the past month .
" we can say that this is a positive development , " said dr. stephanie floeter , a research associate at the dbdd .
" the consumption of many illegal drugs is going down and that has been the trend of the past few years . "
the appetite for cocaine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis is the most used drug in germany and europe the most popular drug is cannabis , with cocaine continuing to be the second most popular , both in europe and germany .
there are at least four million cocaine users in europe .
although cocaine and amphetamine use has increased slightly in germany since the last survey , the figure is no where near that of some other eu countries .
roland simon from the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- said that , in their pan-europe report , germany was not one of the biggest users .
" cocaine plays a really big role all over europe .
1.3 percent of the eu population uses it , " simon told deutsche welle .
" in germany it 's just 0.6 percent - so about half the eu average . "
simon added that big user countries like spain and the uk are pushing the eu average up .

these are drugs which it is legal to import and export , and which are often cut or mixed with other substances and sold on .

" they can earn the money without running the risk of selling illicit substances . "
the drugs flood the markets before the law has time to catch up .

the report says corruption both affected cost for business development but also crippled countries in efforts to ward off poverty as money used in corrupt payments was not being spent on job creation .
sri mulyani indrawati , world bank managing director said the consequences of corruption also go beyond simply the economic impact .
" over time it becomes a real barrier to development , innovation and business growth because sometimes the corruption is in the form of counterfeit drugs so better don ’ t get better or they die , " he said .

thailand ’ s prime minister abhisit vejjajiva , said despite efforts in thailand corruption remained endemic and was widely accepted within the community : " significantly , even today young people in my country tell me that they expect to see corruption everywhere .
an unbelievable percentage of people also say it is ok for politicians to be corrupt as long as they are capable of bringing economic prosperity .
rampant corruption can exist amid high economic growth .
citizens must be prudently aware that there is no such thing as ' good corruption ' . "
reports put the annual cost of corruption in thailand at around $ 3.0 billion a year .
in a local initiative , more than two dozen thai companies agreed to form a collective alliance to work against corruption .
the directors ’ institute says as many as 200 companies can be expected to join the alliance by next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian protesters demanded that the president should quit over two corruption scandals corruption contributes to inequality but for asian development bank president , haruhiko kuroda , the economic costs of corruption have a wider impact on the community .
" corruption is a tax on the poor , " he said . " corruption and weak governance in general undermine government revenues resulting in poor infrastructure and hinders the pace of poverty reduction .
it also contributes to inequalities in access to education , health , infrastructure and other productive assets .
and it is the poor and the vulnerable that inevitably bear the brunt . "
u.s. secretary of state hilary clinton , in a pre-recorded video statement , stressed the wider impact of corruption from business , politics , and democracy and as a factor in causing malnutrition .
but officials say while the issue of corruption was more openly discussed and legislation strengthened , enforcement remained a problem .
also for many countries where corruption remained rampant there was still some way to go to reduce its impact across societies .

the report says corruption both affected cost for business development but also crippled countries in efforts to ward off poverty as money used in corrupt payments was not being spent on job creation .
sri mulyani indrawati , world bank managing director said the consequences of corruption also go beyond simply the economic impact .
" over time it becomes a real barrier to development , innovation and business growth because sometimes the corruption is in the form of counterfeit drugs so better don ’ t get better or they die , " he said .
" sometime corruption is a building that collapses in the face of national disaster because the quality inspector took a payment from the construction contractor to falsify an inspection .

the findings could have significant implications for dealing with hospital-acquired bugs . every year , over four million hospital patients in europe develop an infection during their stay .
the culprit is most often a strain of the bacteria staphylococcus aureus , also known as mrsa , which has proven resistant to antibiotic treatment .
scientists from the university of wuerzburg and the helmholtz center for infection research -lrb- hzi -rrb- in braunschweig have now found an approach to treating such infections .
they have developed an antibody which specifically targets mrsa in mice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staphylococcus aureus can cause a range of illnesses " we have succeeded in activating a defense mechanism against staphylococcus pathogens in mice with the help of antibodies , " said dr. udo lorenz from the university of wuerzburg 's department of surgery .
together with dr. knut ohlsen from the institute for molecular infection biology , lorenz has spent the last few years pursuing the idea of combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria with antibodies .
" these antibodies attach themselves to a specific point on the bacterium , " lorenz told deutsche welle .
this in turn marks the bacterium , so that the body 's own scavenger cells can detect them and subsequently kill them .
dr. christian erck from hzi worked on actually developing the antibodies in mice .
" these antibodies help make the bacteria visible to the immune system , " he told deutsche welle .
" even when antibiotics can no longer kill multi-resistant bacterial strains , antibodies still have a good chance against them . "
in the experiments , the mice 's immune systems were able to kill 30 percent more pathogens with the aid of the antibodies than without .
" this is a very dramatic advantage , which can constitute the difference between death and survival , " lorenz said .
targeting immune weakness most people have staphylococcus bacteria on their skin and , if they 're healthy , it does n't cause any problems .
" but this is a very flexible bacteria and it can become extremely aggressive , " erck said .
if these pathogens make their way inside patients with weakened immune systems , they cause infections which are extremely difficult to cure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lorenz -lrb- left -rrb- and ohlsen developed this procedure lorenz said this would be the target group for treatment .
" these are patients who have just had surgery or are in intensive care , whose immune systems are not functioning in an optimal way , " he said .
mouse to man the next step now involves transferring the antibody from mice to humans .
this means the entire molecule will need to be " humanized " so that people do n't develop antibodies against the mice antibodies and reject them .
" we will take only the part of the antibody that docks to the bacterium and build the rest of the molecule artificially , so that it is suitable for people , " lorenz said .
if everything goes according to plan , lorenz said he expected the first clinical study to take place at the end of 2012 .
" then we can find out which sort of infections are suitable for this treatment , " he said .
the scientists have published their findings in the current issue of the journal antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy .

" we continue to support the goal of withdrawal , " westerwelle said during a parliamentary debate on thursday in berlin .
disarmament is going to be a " key issue " for germany at the lisbon meeting , the foreign minister said .
there are no official figures about the number of nuclear weapons stationed on german soil , but it is believed that perhaps 10 to 20 nuclear warheads from the us arsenal are stockpiled at the buechel air base in the state of rhineland-palatinate in southwestern germany .
russian cooperation government leaders and heads of state of the 28 nato member countries meet in the portuguese capital next week friday to discuss a major strategic overhaul of the military alliance .
a key element of nato 's new strategy to be decided upon in lisbon is a european missile-defense system .
in what westerwelle called an " historic gesture , " russia will be involved in the discussions .
" we do n't want a europe with areas of differing security levels , " westerwelle said .
" we want to improve our security alongside , not in confrontation with russia . "
westerwelle defends cabinet colleague the foreign minister used his address in parliament to also set straight a cornerstone of german military doctrine .
westerwelle rejected accusations that defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was revamping the german armed forces to fight what the opposition called " economic wars . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister called for nuclear exit and defended his colleague karl-theodor zu guttenberg " we will continue the culture of military restraint .
any other assumption is defamation that has nothing to do with reality , " the minister said .
westerwelle 's comments were viewed as indirect support for defense minister guttenberg , who recently made controversial remarks to the effect that germany should align its security policies with economic interests , like other countries do .
in response , the green party parliamentary leader , juergen trittin , accused guttenberg of pursuing " gunboat diplomacy . "

" we continue to support the goal of withdrawal , " westerwelle said during a parliamentary debate on thursday in berlin .
disarmament is going to be a " key issue " for germany at the lisbon meeting , the foreign minister said .
there are no official figures about the number of nuclear weapons stationed on german soil , but it is believed that perhaps 10 to 20 nuclear warheads from the us arsenal are stockpiled at the buechel air base in the state of rhineland-palatinate in southwestern germany .
russian cooperation government leaders and heads of state of the 28 nato member countries meet in the portuguese capital next week friday to discuss a major strategic overhaul of the military alliance .
a key element of nato 's new strategy to be decided upon in lisbon is a european missile-defense system .
in what westerwelle called an " historic gesture , " russia will be involved in the discussions .
" we do n't want a europe with areas of differing security levels , " westerwelle said .
" we want to improve our security alongside , not in confrontation with russia . "
westerwelle defends cabinet colleague the foreign minister used his address in parliament to also set straight a cornerstone of german military doctrine .
westerwelle rejected accusations that defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was revamping the german armed forces to fight what the opposition called " economic wars . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister called for nuclear exit and defended his colleague karl-theodor zu guttenberg " we will continue the culture of military restraint .
any other assumption is defamation that has nothing to do with reality , " the minister said .
westerwelle 's comments were viewed as indirect support for defense minister guttenberg , who recently made controversial remarks to the effect that germany should align its security policies with economic interests , like other countries do .
in response , the green party parliamentary leader , juergen trittin , accused guttenberg of pursuing " gunboat diplomacy . "
defending his position , guttenberg told parliament on thursday that the strategy was contained in a government white paper from 2006 when the opposition social democrats were still in a grand coalition with chancellor merkel 's christian democrats .

it 's match day twelve in the bundesliga and after the abject failure of trying to summon voodoo spirits to do their bidding last week , the dw soccer pundits have resorted to less ghoulish methods . dw 's soccer pundits have been forming a fidgety queue outside the bathroom this week after downing enough tea to fill a swimming pool .
as well as causing numerous pairs of legs to cross , the experiment has also produced enough bundesliga result-shaped tea leaf formations to come up with the predictions for match day twelve .
amuse yourselves with these forecasts while we dash once again to the little boys room ...
saturday , nov 13 bremen – frankfurt oh dear .
just what is going on with werder bremen ?
esteemed colleague jefferson chase nailed it in his commentary this week – whatever 's gone wrong at bremen , it 'll need huge changes to fix it .
while wondering what was going to happen next was initially an endearing game of roulette , as the season wears on , it looks like bremen are playing the russian variety .
no guesses who 'll get the bullet if their form continues to nosedive .
frankfurt very well could be the team to load the gun .
prediction : frankfurt 2-1 wolfsburg – schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke edged closer to safety thanks to raul 's goals go on then , but just whisper it … schalke may have turned a corner .
there – i said it … which means , of course , that wolfsburg 's up-and-down season will ascend again to the detriment of felix magath 's struggling side on saturday .
the royal blues may have fired three past st. pauli to put them one point from safety but the hamburg club are quickly becoming easy pickings as their confidence dwindles .
wolfsburg will be a sterner test .
perhaps the training ground punch-ups suggest the wolves have the fight to come out on top in this one .
prediction : wolfsburg 3-2 cologne – moenchengladbach wake us up when this derby is over .
the two sides who manage to make schalke look good come together in this basement clash with little daylight between them in terms of points and class .
gladbach at least shocked the life out of bayern last week - which always raises a smile in these parts - but with cologne struggling to find anything resembling flair in any of their games to date , these two could blunder and bump against each other for 90 minutes and still not score .
hopefully one will manage it but it 's a coin toss .
heads it 's gladbach .
prediction : gladbach 1-0 kaiserslautern – stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ciprian marica led the way in the thrashing of bremen stuttgart will be nicely rested after last weekend 's game so kaiserslautern should beware .
vfb stuck six past bremen and then must have retired to a dark room to lie down .
despite the green shoots of recovery growing over at the mercedes benz arena , few would have tipped jens keller 's team to thrash werder so comprehensively -lrb- i certainly did n't -rrb- .
but then kaiserslautern looked impressive last week , even though they evenutally lost against in-form leverkusen . this one could prove quite entertaining to watch .
prediction : 2-2 st. pauli – leverkusen pauli continue to slide and it 's already looking like an inevitable one towards what many people think is their rightful place in the relegation zone .
the neutral will hope they can arrest the decline but taking on leverkusen may not be the best place to start .
bayer have been quietly efficient in rising to third place and will be looking to make up ground on mainz in the place above them .
on form alone , it looks as though pauli will be deeper in the mire come saturday night .
prediction : leverkusen 3-1 mainz – hanover mainz in crisis !
two defeats on the bounce !
how easy it is to forget what an achievement this season has already been for mainz .
it is n't only their position which is impressive but the way they 've gotten there .
okay , so freiburg should never have beaten them last week – but only in the context of mainz 's amazing form to date .
last season , this would n't have been such a shock .
losing or drawing with hanover would n't have been either but on the evidence of this campaign alone , one would expect mainz to triumph .
prediction : mainz 2-0 sunday , nov 14 hoffenheim – freiburg despite winning last week , hoffenheim still dropped down the league , giving the illusion that their title charge has already petered out .
do n't be fooled .
the pendulum of form is swinging in the hoff 's direction and a win over freiburg will see them back in the mix .
freiburg had a great result against mainz and will have to be completely free of the hangover to cope with the hoff at home .
expecting the freiburgers to be well up for it as usual , this could be a tight affair .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 bayern – nuremberg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern lost their heads against gladbach last weekend they still have n't quite got it right , have they ?
louis van gaal tore his team a new one after letting the points slip against bottom club gladbach last week and you would expect a reaction from the german champions against nuremberg on sunday .
but how many times has the gruff dutchman got all red in the face only to see his team go pale on the pitch ?
nuremberg cantered to a win against cologne last week and of course bayern , however dire , are the polar opposite of the boys for köln .
however , the bavarians are increasingly hard to fathom so – who knows ?

it 's match day twelve in the bundesliga and after the abject failure of trying to summon voodoo spirits to do their bidding last week , the dw soccer pundits have resorted to less ghoulish methods . dw 's soccer pundits have been forming a fidgety queue outside the bathroom this week after downing enough tea to fill a swimming pool .
as well as causing numerous pairs of legs to cross , the experiment has also produced enough bundesliga result-shaped tea leaf formations to come up with the predictions for match day twelve .
amuse yourselves with these forecasts while we dash once again to the little boys room ...
saturday , nov 13 bremen – frankfurt oh dear .
just what is going on with werder bremen ?
esteemed colleague jefferson chase nailed it in his commentary this week – whatever 's gone wrong at bremen , it 'll need huge changes to fix it .
while wondering what was going to happen next was initially an endearing game of roulette , as the season wears on , it looks like bremen are playing the russian variety .
no guesses who 'll get the bullet if their form continues to nosedive .
frankfurt very well could be the team to load the gun .
prediction : frankfurt 2-1 wolfsburg – schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke edged closer to safety thanks to raul 's goals go on then , but just whisper it … schalke may have turned a corner .
there – i said it … which means , of course , that wolfsburg 's up-and-down season will ascend again to the detriment of felix magath 's struggling side on saturday .
the royal blues may have fired three past st. pauli to put them one point from safety but the hamburg club are quickly becoming easy pickings as their confidence dwindles .
wolfsburg will be a sterner test .
perhaps the training ground punch-ups suggest the wolves have the fight to come out on top in this one .
prediction : wolfsburg 3-2 cologne – moenchengladbach wake us up when this derby is over .
the two sides who manage to make schalke look good come together in this basement clash with little daylight between them in terms of points and class .
gladbach at least shocked the life out of bayern last week - which always raises a smile in these parts - but with cologne struggling to find anything resembling flair in any of their games to date , these two could blunder and bump against each other for 90 minutes and still not score .
hopefully one will manage it but it 's a coin toss .
heads it 's gladbach .
prediction : gladbach 1-0 kaiserslautern – stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ciprian marica led the way in the thrashing of bremen stuttgart will be nicely rested after last weekend 's game so kaiserslautern should beware .
vfb stuck six past bremen and then must have retired to a dark room to lie down .
despite the green shoots of recovery growing over at the mercedes benz arena , few would have tipped jens keller 's team to thrash werder so comprehensively -lrb- i certainly did n't -rrb- .
but then kaiserslautern looked impressive last week , even though they evenutally lost against in-form leverkusen . this one could prove quite entertaining to watch .
prediction : 2-2 st. pauli – leverkusen pauli continue to slide and it 's already looking like an inevitable one towards what many people think is their rightful place in the relegation zone .
the neutral will hope they can arrest the decline but taking on leverkusen may not be the best place to start .
bayer have been quietly efficient in rising to third place and will be looking to make up ground on mainz in the place above them .
on form alone , it looks as though pauli will be deeper in the mire come saturday night .
prediction : leverkusen 3-1 mainz – hanover mainz in crisis !
two defeats on the bounce !
how easy it is to forget what an achievement this season has already been for mainz .
it is n't only their position which is impressive but the way they 've gotten there .
okay , so freiburg should never have beaten them last week – but only in the context of mainz 's amazing form to date .
last season , this would n't have been such a shock .
losing or drawing with hanover would n't have been either but on the evidence of this campaign alone , one would expect mainz to triumph .
prediction : mainz 2-0 sunday , nov 14 hoffenheim – freiburg despite winning last week , hoffenheim still dropped down the league , giving the illusion that their title charge has already petered out .
do n't be fooled .
the pendulum of form is swinging in the hoff 's direction and a win over freiburg will see them back in the mix .
freiburg had a great result against mainz and will have to be completely free of the hangover to cope with the hoff at home .
expecting the freiburgers to be well up for it as usual , this could be a tight affair .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 bayern – nuremberg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern lost their heads against gladbach last weekend they still have n't quite got it right , have they ?
louis van gaal tore his team a new one after letting the points slip against bottom club gladbach last week and you would expect a reaction from the german champions against nuremberg on sunday .
but how many times has the gruff dutchman got all red in the face only to see his team go pale on the pitch ?
nuremberg cantered to a win against cologne last week and of course bayern , however dire , are the polar opposite of the boys for köln .
however , the bavarians are increasingly hard to fathom so – who knows ?

on two separate occasions the tabloid , which is in no way related to the us music magazine of the same name , has printed the identities and addresses of alleged homosexuals .
the campaign launched in october under the headline banner " 100 pictures of uganda 's top homos leak - hang them " has so far outed 29 people .
several of them have since been subjected to harassment and threats from members of the public .
transgender stosh mugisha is among the victims .
biologically a woman but living as a man , the 33-year old 's life has drastically changed since his photograph appeared in the rolling stone " men of shame " gallery .
“ i went to the shop where i usually buy cigarettes , " mugisha told deutsche welle .
" the woman told me ' i do n't sell cigarettes to faggots ' , so i left . "
on his way home passers-by threw verbal abuse and even stones at him .
although he was not physically hurt , he has since had to move away for fear of a more serious attack .
interim ruling in light of the controversial pictures and following a petition from the gay rights group , sexual minorities uganda , the high court ordered rolling stone , which is not yet in possession of a license , to cease publication .
judge vincent musoke kibuuka described the public outing as an invasion of the right to privacy of the individuals identified .
yet the ruling is only temporary and will be reviewed at a hearing later this month .

however both reports warn about the increase in so-called legal highs . over five percent of germans say they have taken some kind of illegal drug during the previous 12 months , according to the german drugs monitoring body dbdd .
the survey was carried out in 2009 and shows an increase of just 0.1 percent over the figures in the previous survey , carried out in 2006 .
the annual reports of the dbdd and its european partner emcdda were published this week , and show similar patterns of drug use in germany and the eu as a whole .
they show that levels of illegal drug use are relatively stable .
in germany , 26.7 percent of people surveyed had taken some kind of illegal drug in their lifetime , but only 2.6 percent had taken something in the past month .
" we can say that this is a positive development , " said dr. stephanie floeter , a research associate at the dbdd .
" the consumption of many illegal drugs is going down and that has been the trend of the past few years . "
the appetite for cocaine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis is the most used drug in germany and europe the most popular drug is cannabis , with cocaine continuing to be the second most popular , both in europe and germany .
there are at least four million cocaine users in europe .
although cocaine and amphetamine use has increased slightly in germany since the last survey , the figure is no where near that of some other eu countries .
roland simon from the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- said that , in their pan-europe report , germany was not one of the biggest users .
" cocaine plays a really big role all over europe .
1.3 percent of the eu population uses it , " simon told deutsche welle .
" in germany it 's just 0.6 percent - so about half the eu average . "
simon added that big user countries like spain and the uk are pushing the eu average up .
new legal highs both reports flagged up a need to be wary about new legal drugs that are becoming more common .
these are drugs which it is legal to import and export , and which are often cut or mixed with other substances and sold on .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amphetamine mephedrone is one of the more recent drugs to become illegal in germany " there are always new drugs , " said the dbdd 's floeter .
" new synthetic drugs , drugs made from herbs and plants like the drug spice , and ones that imitate ecstasy like pma . "
the pills containing pma , pmma or pcp are often indistinguishable from ecstasy and mdma .
the difference is that they are legal .
" it gives drug traffickers the opportunity for a bargain , " said simon .
" they can earn the money without running the risk of selling illicit substances . "
the drugs flood the markets before the law has time to catch up .
last year 24 new types of drug were identified , this year there were 31 .
" the particular danger is that these pills have a delayed effect , " said the government 's drugs commissioner mechthild dyckmans .
" people take one , then when there is no effect they take another .
this has serious health consequences . "

the construction group acs handed in its offer to german financial supervisors bafin , which now has 15 days to deliberate . spain 's largest construction group acs presented its offer for german rival hochtief to germany 's financial supervisory authority bafin on thursday .
bafin now has 15 days to rule on the takeover bid , and hochtief shareholders then have a further four weeks to decide whether to accept the offer .
acs , which already holds just under 30 percent of hochtief , germany 's largest public works construction company , wants to take a controlling stake in the business .
it is seeking an all-share swap to create what would become one of the world 's leading construction firms .
however , acs has offered a price below hochtief 's current market value of around 4.3 billion euros -lrb- 5.9 billion dollars -rrb- , which hochtief sees as unfair .
preventative strategies herbert luetkestratkoetter , head of hochtief , said the company considers the acs bid to be hostile and is " definitely " planning further strategic action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees protested against acs in october hochtief 's chief financial officer burkard lohr refused to rule out a capital increase or a convertible loan to refinance the company .
both measures would increase the number of hochtief shares and thus make a takeover bid more difficult .
another option is for essen-based hochtief to puts its subsidiary concessions on the stock market , even if it means separating itself from that part of its business . concessions ' main activity is the operation of airports and toll-roads .
at the same time the german firm is trying to force the spanish group to make a bid for hochtief 's australian subsidiary leighton , thereby increasing the price , and possibly discouraging acs .
acs could instead carry out a capital increase of 78.5 million euros -lrb- 107.6 million dollars -rrb- , which is to be approved during an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on november 19 .

let me introduce myself - i 'm ali .
ali almakhlafi .
i 'm a journalist from yemen . i live in germany .
i 'm 31 years old .
i 'm muslim .
and i 've never been to mecca in my entire life .
even though , when considered from distance , i was born and spent the first 19 years of my life " right next door . " yemen is the poorest country of the arabian peninsula and has a common border with saudi arabia – one of the richest countries of the region and guardian of islam 's holy sites .
from yemen 's capital , sana 'a , it 's about a 90-minute flight from there to mecca .
from germany it takes about six hours .
reporter , not a pilgrim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali 's journey takes him from bonn to mecca .
yet my journey to mecca starts here in germany , the country i live and work in .
and i 'm deliberately not traveling as a religious pilgrim , but as a neutral journalistic reporter .
my main goal is to provide non-muslim users with insights into the hajj pilgrimage - just as i was once introduced to easter , christmas , and other christian feasts .
as you may know , according to saudi arabia 's interpretation of islam , only muslims may visit the holy city of mecca .
however , it is allowed to let non-muslims know about it .
this is what i want to do as i tell you about my impressions , discoveries , and encounters with pilgrims from all over the world - and particularly from germany .
even many muslims know little more about the hajj than the pictures they get on television , which show religious rites and crowds pouring in .
i 'm sure that there 's a lot to find out about the hajj - so wo n't you join me on my journey of discovery ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : praying at the mosque in mecca would you like to know how , exactly , the religious rituals are performed ?
what safety measures are taken ?
whether men and women go on their pilgrimage together ?
or whether conflicts between moderate and radical political groups in the islamic world influence the festivities ?
honestly , i do n't know many of the answers to these questions myself .
but whatever you may want to learn , i 'll try to find it out for you !
please post your questions and suggestions on deutsche welle 's facebook page : http : / / www.facebook.com / deutschewelle even though i will visit mecca as a journalist , this is anything but a " typical " reporting assignement to me .
maybe it 's like a catholic-raised journalist reporting from the vatican : you 're keeping a distance and reporting neutrally , but somehow the subject moves you more than , say , a piece about the latest tax reform .
learning about prophets , and people so i ca n't keep all my childhood memories separated from my thoughts about , and preparation for , my first trip to mecca .
specifically , my religion class in taiz , the town i was born in , comes to my mind .
they taught us that god is in heaven watching us .
that jews and christians share a lot of prophets with muslims except the last prophet and messenger of god : muhammad .
that the citizens of mecca once chased muhammad out of the city .
and that muhammad returned to mecca eight years later and destroyed the statues of false gods that had been built .
as a little boy i was deeply impressed and shaped by these religious basics .
today they inextricably belong to my personal cultural heritage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : our reporter hails from taiz , in yemen of course , at school , i also learned about the five religious duties of every muslim , the so-called five pillars of islam .
the hajj is one of them - a spiritual journey that is to be performed by every muslim who is healthy enough and can afford to do so .
examining my picture of saudi arabia i also want to examine my personal picture of saudi arabia - which is closely linked to my yemeni descent .
there were times when yemenis were allowed to enter the country without a visa .
older men , such as my grandfather , used to go on business trips to the country next door and bring us back precious presents .
but there was also a time - when saudi arabia and yemen were at serious odds about the kuwait war - that saudi arabian leaders expelled hundreds of thousands of yemeni " guest workers " from the country .
during this period , unemployment and poverty increased dramatically in yemen , and the number of students in my class went from 20 to 120 .
that is when i realized that islamic virtues such as solidarity and brotherhood can vanish into thin air when politics come into play .
and that a common belief does n't prevent people from committing human-rights violations .
i wonder what kind of experiences i will have in mecca ?
maybe they 'll be very different from what i expect .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.11.2010 the german soldiers that history forgot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remains of soldiers are still found in flanders every year each year on november 11 , armistice day , ceremonies take place at commonwealth war cemeteries to commemorate the dead .
but only a few come to remember the german soldiers who died on flanders fields in wwi . a bugle sounded across flanders fields on thursday .
the " last post " used to mark the end of a day on the battlefields and still today it is played as a haunting reminder of the hundreds of thousands of men who laid down their lives along this stretch of the western front during world war i. wreaths of blood-red poppies will be laid at the foot of rows upon rows of white headstones in the commonwealth cemeteries .
but one war memorial will remain silent and empty on armistice day .
the langemark cemetery is the final resting place of 44,294 german soldiers .
more than half of them are buried in one mass grave , the kameraden grab , their names etched on large dark plaques running alongside the site .
" it 's a tragedy that hardly anyone comes here .
least of all the germans themselves , many of whom know very little about what happened , " andre de bruin , a world war i guide and founder of over the top tours , told deutsche welle .
two million german casualties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on some of the cemeteries , not even headstones were permitted andre points to rows of gravestones that lie flat on the ground , explaining : " belgium imposed very strict restrictions on german memorials .
headstones were not allowed to stand , not like those of the commonwealth soldiers and there were many other rules that applied only to germans . "
there were hundreds of burial sites of german soldiers after 1918 but in the 1950s , belgium ordered that the bodies be regrouped in no more than four sites , of which langemark is one .
" it was probably done out of hatred for what happened , especially during world war ii when belgium was occupied .
they even forbade the use of crosses above the headstones , " de bruin said .
germany lost nearly two million men in the first world war , the greatest number of casualties suffered by any nation .
yet for decades , this chapter of history was hardly taught at german schools .
today , the care of german memorials in western flanders , where some of the bloodiest battles took place , is carried out by a voluntary association , the german war graves commission , and its grounds are tended by students .
at the back of langemark , rain-sodden fields stretch ahead , the same ground that turned into a giant , water-clogged inferno of craters and trenches almost a century ago .
it is here that 3,000 german students were killed in 1914 .
" they had received just six weeks basic training before they were sent to the front to accompany german soldiers in what was meant to be a triumphant march to victory .
but they were all killed in the ensuing battles , " andre explained .
" these men died in the same horrific battles as everyone here and yet on armistice day they will lie mostly unremembered , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flanders saw some of wwi 's bloodiest battles only few visitors from germany only a tiny number of germans come to this part of belgium whereas thousands come to visit the commonwealth graves from as far away as australia .
a visitors ' book at langemark shows that most visitors are british school children , who visit the site as part of their trips around ypres .
" we always bring the children here as part of our tours of the world war i sites .
we feel that german families mourned their dead just as british or belgian families would have done , " leonie giles , a teacher at st nicholas school in north-west england , told deutsche welle .
a colleague added that " the aura here is very different , it 's very somber compared to the pristine white cemeteries where the british are buried , which are more like english gardens .
but we want our kids to realize that these soldiers were just like the british who died for king and country . "
simon , a thirteen-year old carrying a small wooden cross with a poppy , said : " it 's so vast , that mass grave .
and it 's such a sad place .
i feel very emotional . "
remains of soldiers are still found in this area every year , and these are added to the mass grave .
but these days , their burials are done with full military honors and are attended by officials from germany and belgium - a sign perhaps that , in time , more recognition will be given to these men who volunteered to lay down their lives .
" deutschland muss leben auch wenn wir sterben muessen , " reads the plaque above their graves .
germany must live even if we must die .

the construction group acs handed in its offer to german financial supervisors bafin , which now has 15 days to deliberate . spain 's largest construction group acs presented its offer for german rival hochtief to germany 's financial supervisory authority bafin on thursday .
bafin now has 15 days to rule on the takeover bid , and hochtief shareholders then have a further four weeks to decide whether to accept the offer .
acs , which already holds just under 30 percent of hochtief , germany 's largest public works construction company , wants to take a controlling stake in the business .
it is seeking an all-share swap to create what would become one of the world 's leading construction firms .
however , acs has offered a price below hochtief 's current market value of around 4.3 billion euros -lrb- 5.9 billion dollars -rrb- , which hochtief sees as unfair .
preventative strategies herbert luetkestratkoetter , head of hochtief , said the company considers the acs bid to be hostile and is " definitely " planning further strategic action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees protested against acs in october hochtief 's chief financial officer burkard lohr refused to rule out a capital increase or a convertible loan to refinance the company .
both measures would increase the number of hochtief shares and thus make a takeover bid more difficult .
another option is for essen-based hochtief to puts its subsidiary concessions on the stock market , even if it means separating itself from that part of its business . concessions ' main activity is the operation of airports and toll-roads .
at the same time the german firm is trying to force the spanish group to make a bid for hochtief 's australian subsidiary leighton , thereby increasing the price , and possibly discouraging acs .
acs could instead carry out a capital increase of 78.5 million euros -lrb- 107.6 million dollars -rrb- , which is to be approved during an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on november 19 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 11.11.2010 new ' legal highs ' worry drug watchdogs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legal highs are often mixed to look similar to ecstasy the number of people using illegal drugs in germany and europe has very slightly increased , according to two annual reports .
however both reports warn about the increase in so-called legal highs . over five percent of germans say they have taken some kind of illegal drug during the previous 12 months , according to the german drugs monitoring body dbdd .
the survey was carried out in 2009 and shows an increase of just 0.1 percent over the figures in the previous survey , carried out in 2006 .
the annual reports of the dbdd and its european partner emcdda were published this week , and show similar patterns of drug use in germany and the eu as a whole .
they show that levels of illegal drug use are relatively stable .
in germany , 26.7 percent of people surveyed had taken some kind of illegal drug in their lifetime , but only 2.6 percent had taken something in the past month .
" we can say that this is a positive development , " said dr. stephanie floeter , a research associate at the dbdd .
" the consumption of many illegal drugs is going down and that has been the trend of the past few years . "
the appetite for cocaine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis is the most used drug in germany and europe the most popular drug is cannabis , with cocaine continuing to be the second most popular , both in europe and germany .
there are at least four million cocaine users in europe .
although cocaine and amphetamine use has increased slightly in germany since the last survey , the figure is no where near that of some other eu countries .
roland simon from the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- said that , in their pan-europe report , germany was not one of the biggest users .
" cocaine plays a really big role all over europe .
1.3 percent of the eu population uses it , " simon told deutsche welle .
" in germany it 's just 0.6 percent - so about half the eu average . "
simon added that big user countries like spain and the uk are pushing the eu average up .
new legal highs both reports flagged up a need to be wary about new legal drugs that are becoming more common .
these are drugs which it is legal to import and export , and which are often cut or mixed with other substances and sold on .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amphetamine mephedrone is one of the more recent drugs to become illegal in germany " there are always new drugs , " said the dbdd 's floeter .
" new synthetic drugs , drugs made from herbs and plants like the drug spice , and ones that imitate ecstasy like pma . "
the pills containing pma , pmma or pcp are often indistinguishable from ecstasy and mdma .
the difference is that they are legal .
" it gives drug traffickers the opportunity for a bargain , " said simon .
" they can earn the money without running the risk of selling illicit substances . "
the drugs flood the markets before the law has time to catch up .
last year 24 new types of drug were identified , this year there were 31 .
" the particular danger is that these pills have a delayed effect , " said the government 's drugs commissioner mechthild dyckmans .
" people take one , then when there is no effect they take another .
this has serious health consequences . "

but he had a host of other issues in his luggage as he mets chinese president hu jintao on the sidelines of the summit . there was no shortage of issues awaiting us president barack obama even before the g20 summit began on thursday in seoul .
obama was scheduled to meet both chinese president hu jintao and south korean president lee myung-bak parallel to the summit .
for the latter , the most pressing agenda item was expected to be the ratification of a pending free trade deal that us and south korean diplomats from both sides have been hashing out over the past two days .
despite a number of sticking points , including disagreement on autos and beef trade , myung-bak and obama agreed in a telephone conversation last week to strive for agreement before the g20 .
on thursday morning , news broke that the two sides failed to reach an agreement on a free-trade accord , but said talks would continue after the g20 summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama faces a complex meeting with hu jintao yet the meeting was also be laden with symbolic value , as howard loewen , researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , said .
" i think they want to reaffirm the security alliance between the south korea and the us , for the protection of south korea , " loewen told deutsche welle ahead of the meeting on wednesday .
" which is of course a message for north korea and china . "
chinese tension the meeting with jintao is likely to be more general and possibly less conclusive , however .
apart from recent disagreements over currency issues and accusations of protectionism , the americans are consistently calling on china to take on more responsibility .
" if you 're a big country , you have the power to sit at the table in the biggest forums , but you have to be willing to take on responsibility , and i think that will be a subject of conversation , " says loewen .
for its part , china is wary of obama 's diplomacy drive in asia , particularly us attempts to assert a position in multilateral bodies .
next year the us will join the east asia summit , an annual forum of east asian countries , and loewen believes that obama is consciously going beyond the network of bilateral relations the us maintains with likes of japan , south korea , the philippines and thailand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will join the east asia summit next year " the us is showing more diplomatic initiatives in southeast asia than it did in the bush era , " said loewen .
" at the same time , the us wants to engage more in the multilateral regulation of problems .
you really ca n't say that the us is retreating in the region - on the contrary , it is pushing ahead more . "
" of course , the chinese are not keen on seeing the us engaging themselves more , " he added .
" because they fear that the us could rival their influence , which of course it does .
the chinese are getting nervous . "
multilateral vs. bilateral perhaps for this reason china has made one regional issue a taboo for multilateral talks .
pascal abb of the german institute of global and area studies , told deutsche welle , " china has made it clear that it does not want the territorial conflicts in the south china seas to be discussed multilaterally , but that is the central conflict in the region . "
the conflict is over a number of tiny islands in the south china seas – china , taiwan , vietnam , the philippines and malaysia all lay claim to the islands , mainly because of the rich natural resources in the area , as well as the trade routes that run through these waters .
but china 's refusal to allow the matter to be discussed multilaterally effectively scuppers any chance of progress .
" i do n't see how overlapping territorial conflicts can be solved bilaterally , " says abb , " simply because no third country is likely to accept an agreement that two other states have reached . "
political gamble but for obama , the recent mid-term elections mean that what some people call his " multilateral gamble " may be under more pressure .
while the new strength in the republican party does not extend to controlling the senate , which has more control over us foreign policy , some believe that if obama 's attempts to assert himself in asia do not bear economic fruit , he may hand the republicans extra ammunition in the 2012 presidential election .
but that is still a long term concern .
for now , the republicans are unlikely to gain much traction with such attacks .
" it could be that the republicans want to assert their foreign policies now , and may make demands like that , " says loewen .
" but i think it wo n't be that serious , because there are no multilateral commitments .
it is easier to go back on multilateral agreements , so i do n't think that will play a big role . "

the greek finance ministry has said it has narrowly missed its january-october target to reduce its budget deficit .
the unwelcome news comes as the eu said it would take action to support ireland , if needed . the greek public deficit has fallen sharply since the implementation of an eu-imf rescue package for the debt-stricken country , but efforts to reduce the shortfall have still fallen short of the targets set for this year .
greece , struggling with a huge public deficit , came close to default in may and had to be bailed out with a 110-billion-euro package arranged by the eu and international monetary fund .
through october , greek public finances showed a deficit of some 17.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 24 billion -rrb- , down 30 percent from the same period a year ago , but still less than the 32 percent target .
the government in athens has implemented a series of draconian reforms aimed at restoring its financial credibility .
it cut spending by 7 percent , or four billion euros , but tax revenues only grew 3.7 percent , well short of the 2010 target of 13.7 percent .
at the same time as this announcement , the european union moved to reassure financial markets on thursday that it was ready to support ireland as the eurozone country 's debt woes made waves at the g20 summit in south korea .
ireland has worst deficit in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu is poised to help ireland too , barroso said concern about ireland is growing after irish bond yields soared to a record level of 8.28 percent on wednesday . as a result , european commission president jose manuel barroso found himself compelled to announce that the eu stood ready to help ireland " in case of need . "
" what is important now is that we have all the necessary instruments in place , " barroso said in the south korean capital , seoul , ahead of the g20 meeting .
" we are monitoring the situation in ireland on a permanent basis , " he added .
the rise in irish bond yields has unsettled investors and put the entire european bond market under serious strain .
ireland is trying to tackle the worst budget deficit in the eu and convince markets that it does not need a greek-style bailout .

it 's match day twelve in the bundesliga and after the abject failure of trying to summon voodoo spirits to do their bidding last week , the dw soccer pundits have resorted to less ghoulish methods . dw 's soccer pundits have been forming a fidgety queue outside the bathroom this week after downing enough tea to fill a swimming pool .
as well as causing numerous pairs of legs to cross , the experiment has also produced enough bundesliga result-shaped tea leaf formations to come up with the predictions for match day twelve .

esteemed colleague jefferson chase nailed it in his commentary this week – whatever 's gone wrong at bremen , it 'll need huge changes to fix it .
while wondering what was going to happen next was initially an endearing game of roulette , as the season wears on , it looks like bremen are playing the russian variety .

frankfurt very well could be the team to load the gun .
prediction : frankfurt 2-1 wolfsburg – schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke edged closer to safety thanks to raul 's goals go on then , but just whisper it … schalke may have turned a corner .
there – i said it … which means , of course , that wolfsburg 's up-and-down season will ascend again to the detriment of felix magath 's struggling side on saturday .
the royal blues may have fired three past st. pauli to put them one point from safety but the hamburg club are quickly becoming easy pickings as their confidence dwindles .
wolfsburg will be a sterner test .
perhaps the training ground punch-ups suggest the wolves have the fight to come out on top in this one .
prediction : wolfsburg 3-2 cologne – moenchengladbach wake us up when this derby is over .
the two sides who manage to make schalke look good come together in this basement clash with little daylight between them in terms of points and class .
gladbach at least shocked the life out of bayern last week - which always raises a smile in these parts - but with cologne struggling to find anything resembling flair in any of their games to date , these two could blunder and bump against each other for 90 minutes and still not score .
hopefully one will manage it but it 's a coin toss .

but then kaiserslautern looked impressive last week , even though they evenutally lost against in-form leverkusen . this one could prove quite entertaining to watch .
prediction : 2-2 st. pauli – leverkusen pauli continue to slide and it 's already looking like an inevitable one towards what many people think is their rightful place in the relegation zone .
the neutral will hope they can arrest the decline but taking on leverkusen may not be the best place to start .
bayer have been quietly efficient in rising to third place and will be looking to make up ground on mainz in the place above them .
on form alone , it looks as though pauli will be deeper in the mire come saturday night .
prediction : leverkusen 3-1 mainz – hanover mainz in crisis !
two defeats on the bounce !
how easy it is to forget what an achievement this season has already been for mainz .
it is n't only their position which is impressive but the way they 've gotten there .
okay , so freiburg should never have beaten them last week – but only in the context of mainz 's amazing form to date .
last season , this would n't have been such a shock .
losing or drawing with hanover would n't have been either but on the evidence of this campaign alone , one would expect mainz to triumph .
prediction : mainz 2-0 sunday , nov 14 hoffenheim – freiburg despite winning last week , hoffenheim still dropped down the league , giving the illusion that their title charge has already petered out .
do n't be fooled .
the pendulum of form is swinging in the hoff 's direction and a win over freiburg will see them back in the mix .
freiburg had a great result against mainz and will have to be completely free of the hangover to cope with the hoff at home .
expecting the freiburgers to be well up for it as usual , this could be a tight affair .

the greek finance ministry has said it has narrowly missed its january-october target to reduce its budget deficit .
the unwelcome news comes as the eu said it would take action to support ireland , if needed . the greek public deficit has fallen sharply since the implementation of an eu-imf rescue package for the debt-stricken country , but efforts to reduce the shortfall have still fallen short of the targets set for this year .
greece , struggling with a huge public deficit , came close to default in may and had to be bailed out with a 110-billion-euro package arranged by the eu and international monetary fund .
through october , greek public finances showed a deficit of some 17.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 24 billion -rrb- , down 30 percent from the same period a year ago , but still less than the 32 percent target .
the government in athens has implemented a series of draconian reforms aimed at restoring its financial credibility .
it cut spending by 7 percent , or four billion euros , but tax revenues only grew 3.7 percent , well short of the 2010 target of 13.7 percent .
at the same time as this announcement , the european union moved to reassure financial markets on thursday that it was ready to support ireland as the eurozone country 's debt woes made waves at the g20 summit in south korea .
ireland has worst deficit in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu is poised to help ireland too , barroso said concern about ireland is growing after irish bond yields soared to a record level of 8.28 percent on wednesday . as a result , european commission president jose manuel barroso found himself compelled to announce that the eu stood ready to help ireland " in case of need . "
" what is important now is that we have all the necessary instruments in place , " barroso said in the south korean capital , seoul , ahead of the g20 meeting .
" we are monitoring the situation in ireland on a permanent basis , " he added .
the rise in irish bond yields has unsettled investors and put the entire european bond market under serious strain .
ireland is trying to tackle the worst budget deficit in the eu and convince markets that it does not need a greek-style bailout .

" we continue to support the goal of withdrawal , " westerwelle said during a parliamentary debate on thursday in berlin .
disarmament is going to be a " key issue " for germany at the lisbon meeting , the foreign minister said .
there are no official figures about the number of nuclear weapons stationed on german soil , but it is believed that perhaps 10 to 20 nuclear warheads from the us arsenal are stockpiled at the buechel air base in the state of rhineland-palatinate in southwestern germany .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister called for nuclear exit and defended his colleague karl-theodor zu guttenberg " we will continue the culture of military restraint .
any other assumption is defamation that has nothing to do with reality , " the minister said .
westerwelle 's comments were viewed as indirect support for defense minister guttenberg , who recently made controversial remarks to the effect that germany should align its security policies with economic interests , like other countries do .
in response , the green party parliamentary leader , juergen trittin , accused guttenberg of pursuing " gunboat diplomacy . "
defending his position , guttenberg told parliament on thursday that the strategy was contained in a government white paper from 2006 when the opposition social democrats were still in a grand coalition with chancellor merkel 's christian democrats .
" there were no cries of outrage then , " guttenberg said , " but now comes the great wave of indignation . "
the issue of economic intervention is also expected to be on the agenda of the nato summit next week .

any other assumption is defamation that has nothing to do with reality , " the minister said .
westerwelle 's comments were viewed as indirect support for defense minister guttenberg , who recently made controversial remarks to the effect that germany should align its security policies with economic interests , like other countries do .
in response , the green party parliamentary leader , juergen trittin , accused guttenberg of pursuing " gunboat diplomacy . "
defending his position , guttenberg told parliament on thursday that the strategy was contained in a government white paper from 2006 when the opposition social democrats were still in a grand coalition with chancellor merkel 's christian democrats .
" there were no cries of outrage then , " guttenberg said , " but now comes the great wave of indignation . "
the issue of economic intervention is also expected to be on the agenda of the nato summit next week .

saturday , nov 13 bremen – frankfurt oh dear .
just what is going on with werder bremen ?
esteemed colleague jefferson chase nailed it in his commentary this week – whatever 's gone wrong at bremen , it 'll need huge changes to fix it .
while wondering what was going to happen next was initially an endearing game of roulette , as the season wears on , it looks like bremen are playing the russian variety .
no guesses who 'll get the bullet if their form continues to nosedive .

there – i said it … which means , of course , that wolfsburg 's up-and-down season will ascend again to the detriment of felix magath 's struggling side on saturday .
the royal blues may have fired three past st. pauli to put them one point from safety but the hamburg club are quickly becoming easy pickings as their confidence dwindles .
wolfsburg will be a sterner test .
perhaps the training ground punch-ups suggest the wolves have the fight to come out on top in this one .
prediction : wolfsburg 3-2 cologne – moenchengladbach wake us up when this derby is over .
the two sides who manage to make schalke look good come together in this basement clash with little daylight between them in terms of points and class .
gladbach at least shocked the life out of bayern last week - which always raises a smile in these parts - but with cologne struggling to find anything resembling flair in any of their games to date , these two could blunder and bump against each other for 90 minutes and still not score .

prediction : 2-2 st. pauli – leverkusen pauli continue to slide and it 's already looking like an inevitable one towards what many people think is their rightful place in the relegation zone .
the neutral will hope they can arrest the decline but taking on leverkusen may not be the best place to start .
bayer have been quietly efficient in rising to third place and will be looking to make up ground on mainz in the place above them .

it is n't only their position which is impressive but the way they 've gotten there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : gay marriage in europe france upholds ban on homosexual marriage germany 's gay couples to receive equal inheritance tax rights german foreign minister ' marries ' gay partner portuguese president to ratify same-sex marriage law civil rights -pipe- 11.11.2010 straight couples in britain fight for gay marriage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay couples can enter civil partnerships , but not marriage in britain , eight couples – gay and straight – are campaigning to have both civil partnerships and marriage open for both straight and same-sex couples .
they say they ’ re willing to go to the highest european court . tom freeman and katherine doyle are a heterosexual couple applying for a civil partnership – a form of legal union available only to same-sex couples .
they are one of four heterosexual couples and four same-sex couples trying to challenge the current uk legislation on marriage and civil partnerships .
" initially our aim was equality but increasingly as we look critically at marriage , we feel it is not relevant to us , " katherine doyle told deutsche welle .
" we really do want a civil partnership .
in our day-to-day lives we are more like partners . "
" the important question for us is : why should n't we have a civil partnership , " her partner tom added .
" the institution is being provided for by law so why should n't i have one ? "
gay couples in britain have been allowed to enter into civil partnerships since 2004 , which gives them all the same legal rights and responsibilities as a civil marriage . however they are denied a civil marriage certificate .
on the other hand heterosexual couples do not qualify to enter a civil partnership .
they can either get married or not .
a violation of human rights ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom freeman and katherine doyle are prepared to fight for years working alongside the gay rights group outrage , the eight couples argue that denying each group the legal rights of the other is discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation , something which is contrary to britain 's human rights act . yet tom and katherine 's application has been refused so far .
all they got was a short statement from the town hall , saying that " a civil partnership is a relationship between two people of the same sex . "
the eight couples are one by one each week applying to their local town halls for either a marriage certificate , or a civil partnership certificate , whichever is denied them by law .
at the end of two months , if all applications are turned down , as they are expected to be , the couples will begin a high court challenge . it is the first time that heterosexual couples have taken such an active role in a campaign which at first glance might appear to benefit gay couples wanting equality and a full marriage .
all the way to the european court of human rights the civil partnerships act of 2004 was introduced by the then labour government with wide support in parliament .
it gives same-sex couples the same legal rights and responsibilities as civil marriage .
there also is a formal process for dissolving partnerships which is akin to divorce , but gay rights activists still criticize that it does n't grant full marriage status to gay couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil partnerships exist in most eu member states " when all eight couples - gay and straight - have filed their applications and have been refused we 'll then consult with our legal advisers with a view to bringing the case to the courts , " peter tatchell of the group outrage , which is leading the equal love campaign , told deutsche welle .
" there ’ s a very strong argument that the twin bans on gay marriages and heterosexual civil partnerships are illegal under the human rights act , " he added .
tatchell says the group is prepared to take the case all the way to the european court of human rights if necessary . public opinion backs gay marriage in response to the campaign , the government has issued a statement saying that it is currently considering the next steps for civil partnerships . it said that earlier this year ministers met with people and organizations holding a range of views and that they are looking at the best way to take those views forward . the equal love campaign argues that public attitudes have shifted strongly in favor of allowing gay couples to marry , citing an opinion poll carried out by the group populus in june 2009 , which found that 61 percent of the public believe gay couples should be allowed to marry , while 33 percent disagreed . however , if there is a change in the law , it is not likely to come soon .
" it could take five to ten years to go through the courts , " said katherine doyle .
" but we really feel that we ca n't commit to marriage when it 's exclusive . "

but he had a host of other issues in his luggage as he mets chinese president hu jintao on the sidelines of the summit . there was no shortage of issues awaiting us president barack obama even before the g20 summit began on thursday in seoul .
obama was scheduled to meet both chinese president hu jintao and south korean president lee myung-bak parallel to the summit .
for the latter , the most pressing agenda item was expected to be the ratification of a pending free trade deal that us and south korean diplomats from both sides have been hashing out over the past two days .
despite a number of sticking points , including disagreement on autos and beef trade , myung-bak and obama agreed in a telephone conversation last week to strive for agreement before the g20 .
on thursday morning , news broke that the two sides failed to reach an agreement on a free-trade accord , but said talks would continue after the g20 summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama faces a complex meeting with hu jintao yet the meeting was also be laden with symbolic value , as howard loewen , researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , said .
" i think they want to reaffirm the security alliance between the south korea and the us , for the protection of south korea , " loewen told deutsche welle ahead of the meeting on wednesday .
" which is of course a message for north korea and china . "
chinese tension the meeting with jintao is likely to be more general and possibly less conclusive , however .
apart from recent disagreements over currency issues and accusations of protectionism , the americans are consistently calling on china to take on more responsibility .
" if you 're a big country , you have the power to sit at the table in the biggest forums , but you have to be willing to take on responsibility , and i think that will be a subject of conversation , " says loewen .
for its part , china is wary of obama 's diplomacy drive in asia , particularly us attempts to assert a position in multilateral bodies .
next year the us will join the east asia summit , an annual forum of east asian countries , and loewen believes that obama is consciously going beyond the network of bilateral relations the us maintains with likes of japan , south korea , the philippines and thailand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will join the east asia summit next year " the us is showing more diplomatic initiatives in southeast asia than it did in the bush era , " said loewen .
" at the same time , the us wants to engage more in the multilateral regulation of problems .
you really ca n't say that the us is retreating in the region - on the contrary , it is pushing ahead more . "
" of course , the chinese are not keen on seeing the us engaging themselves more , " he added .
" because they fear that the us could rival their influence , which of course it does .
the chinese are getting nervous . "
multilateral vs. bilateral perhaps for this reason china has made one regional issue a taboo for multilateral talks .
pascal abb of the german institute of global and area studies , told deutsche welle , " china has made it clear that it does not want the territorial conflicts in the south china seas to be discussed multilaterally , but that is the central conflict in the region . "
the conflict is over a number of tiny islands in the south china seas – china , taiwan , vietnam , the philippines and malaysia all lay claim to the islands , mainly because of the rich natural resources in the area , as well as the trade routes that run through these waters .
but china 's refusal to allow the matter to be discussed multilaterally effectively scuppers any chance of progress .
" i do n't see how overlapping territorial conflicts can be solved bilaterally , " says abb , " simply because no third country is likely to accept an agreement that two other states have reached . "
political gamble but for obama , the recent mid-term elections mean that what some people call his " multilateral gamble " may be under more pressure .
while the new strength in the republican party does not extend to controlling the senate , which has more control over us foreign policy , some believe that if obama 's attempts to assert himself in asia do not bear economic fruit , he may hand the republicans extra ammunition in the 2012 presidential election .
but that is still a long term concern .
for now , the republicans are unlikely to gain much traction with such attacks .
" it could be that the republicans want to assert their foreign policies now , and may make demands like that , " says loewen .
" but i think it wo n't be that serious , because there are no multilateral commitments .
it is easier to go back on multilateral agreements , so i do n't think that will play a big role . "

the construction group acs handed in its offer to german financial supervisors bafin , which now has 15 days to deliberate . spain 's largest construction group acs presented its offer for german rival hochtief to germany 's financial supervisory authority bafin on thursday .
bafin now has 15 days to rule on the takeover bid , and hochtief shareholders then have a further four weeks to decide whether to accept the offer .
acs , which already holds just under 30 percent of hochtief , germany 's largest public works construction company , wants to take a controlling stake in the business .
it is seeking an all-share swap to create what would become one of the world 's leading construction firms .
however , acs has offered a price below hochtief 's current market value of around 4.3 billion euros -lrb- 5.9 billion dollars -rrb- , which hochtief sees as unfair .
preventative strategies herbert luetkestratkoetter , head of hochtief , said the company considers the acs bid to be hostile and is " definitely " planning further strategic action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees protested against acs in october hochtief 's chief financial officer burkard lohr refused to rule out a capital increase or a convertible loan to refinance the company .
both measures would increase the number of hochtief shares and thus make a takeover bid more difficult .
another option is for essen-based hochtief to puts its subsidiary concessions on the stock market , even if it means separating itself from that part of its business . concessions ' main activity is the operation of airports and toll-roads .
at the same time the german firm is trying to force the spanish group to make a bid for hochtief 's australian subsidiary leighton , thereby increasing the price , and possibly discouraging acs .
acs could instead carry out a capital increase of 78.5 million euros -lrb- 107.6 million dollars -rrb- , which is to be approved during an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on november 19 .

the findings could have significant implications for dealing with hospital-acquired bugs . every year , over four million hospital patients in europe develop an infection during their stay .
the culprit is most often a strain of the bacteria staphylococcus aureus , also known as mrsa , which has proven resistant to antibiotic treatment .
scientists from the university of wuerzburg and the helmholtz center for infection research -lrb- hzi -rrb- in braunschweig have now found an approach to treating such infections .
they have developed an antibody which specifically targets mrsa in mice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staphylococcus aureus can cause a range of illnesses " we have succeeded in activating a defense mechanism against staphylococcus pathogens in mice with the help of antibodies , " said dr. udo lorenz from the university of wuerzburg 's department of surgery .
together with dr. knut ohlsen from the institute for molecular infection biology , lorenz has spent the last few years pursuing the idea of combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria with antibodies .
" these antibodies attach themselves to a specific point on the bacterium , " lorenz told deutsche welle .
this in turn marks the bacterium , so that the body 's own scavenger cells can detect them and subsequently kill them .
dr. christian erck from hzi worked on actually developing the antibodies in mice .
" these antibodies help make the bacteria visible to the immune system , " he told deutsche welle .
" even when antibiotics can no longer kill multi-resistant bacterial strains , antibodies still have a good chance against them . "
in the experiments , the mice 's immune systems were able to kill 30 percent more pathogens with the aid of the antibodies than without .
" this is a very dramatic advantage , which can constitute the difference between death and survival , " lorenz said .
targeting immune weakness most people have staphylococcus bacteria on their skin and , if they 're healthy , it does n't cause any problems .
" but this is a very flexible bacteria and it can become extremely aggressive , " erck said .
if these pathogens make their way inside patients with weakened immune systems , they cause infections which are extremely difficult to cure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lorenz -lrb- left -rrb- and ohlsen developed this procedure lorenz said this would be the target group for treatment .
" these are patients who have just had surgery or are in intensive care , whose immune systems are not functioning in an optimal way , " he said .
mouse to man the next step now involves transferring the antibody from mice to humans .
this means the entire molecule will need to be " humanized " so that people do n't develop antibodies against the mice antibodies and reject them .
" we will take only the part of the antibody that docks to the bacterium and build the rest of the molecule artificially , so that it is suitable for people , " lorenz said .
if everything goes according to plan , lorenz said he expected the first clinical study to take place at the end of 2012 .
" then we can find out which sort of infections are suitable for this treatment , " he said .
the scientists have published their findings in the current issue of the journal antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy .

the report says corruption both affected cost for business development but also crippled countries in efforts to ward off poverty as money used in corrupt payments was not being spent on job creation .
sri mulyani indrawati , world bank managing director said the consequences of corruption also go beyond simply the economic impact .
" over time it becomes a real barrier to development , innovation and business growth because sometimes the corruption is in the form of counterfeit drugs so better don ’ t get better or they die , " he said .
" sometime corruption is a building that collapses in the face of national disaster because the quality inspector took a payment from the construction contractor to falsify an inspection .
corruption can kill . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva says there is no " good corruption " no " good corruption " but sri mulyani , a former indonesian finance minister , in comments seen as targeting indonesian politicians who resisted reforms while she was minister said while progress had been made in curbing corruption in indonesia , there was still much to do .
" i see the transformation in my own country , " said sri mulyani . " it is true there is much to be done still .
corruption remains intertwined with politics and there are brazen attacks on those fighting corruption .
we are not alone in that regard .
nonetheless , corruption is an issue that no politician can ignore in indonesia . "
thailand ’ s prime minister abhisit vejjajiva , said despite efforts in thailand corruption remained endemic and was widely accepted within the community : " significantly , even today young people in my country tell me that they expect to see corruption everywhere .
an unbelievable percentage of people also say it is ok for politicians to be corrupt as long as they are capable of bringing economic prosperity .
rampant corruption can exist amid high economic growth .
citizens must be prudently aware that there is no such thing as ' good corruption ' . "
reports put the annual cost of corruption in thailand at around $ 3.0 billion a year .
in a local initiative , more than two dozen thai companies agreed to form a collective alliance to work against corruption .
the directors ’ institute says as many as 200 companies can be expected to join the alliance by next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian protesters demanded that the president should quit over two corruption scandals corruption contributes to inequality but for asian development bank president , haruhiko kuroda , the economic costs of corruption have a wider impact on the community .
" corruption is a tax on the poor , " he said . " corruption and weak governance in general undermine government revenues resulting in poor infrastructure and hinders the pace of poverty reduction .
it also contributes to inequalities in access to education , health , infrastructure and other productive assets .
and it is the poor and the vulnerable that inevitably bear the brunt . "
u.s. secretary of state hilary clinton , in a pre-recorded video statement , stressed the wider impact of corruption from business , politics , and democracy and as a factor in causing malnutrition .
but officials say while the issue of corruption was more openly discussed and legislation strengthened , enforcement remained a problem .
also for many countries where corruption remained rampant there was still some way to go to reduce its impact across societies .

the greek finance ministry has said it has narrowly missed its january-october target to reduce its budget deficit .
the unwelcome news comes as the eu said it would take action to support ireland , if needed . the greek public deficit has fallen sharply since the implementation of an eu-imf rescue package for the debt-stricken country , but efforts to reduce the shortfall have still fallen short of the targets set for this year .
greece , struggling with a huge public deficit , came close to default in may and had to be bailed out with a 110-billion-euro package arranged by the eu and international monetary fund .

but only a few come to remember the german soldiers who died on flanders fields in wwi . a bugle sounded across flanders fields on thursday .
the " last post " used to mark the end of a day on the battlefields and still today it is played as a haunting reminder of the hundreds of thousands of men who laid down their lives along this stretch of the western front during world war i. wreaths of blood-red poppies will be laid at the foot of rows upon rows of white headstones in the commonwealth cemeteries .
but one war memorial will remain silent and empty on armistice day .
the langemark cemetery is the final resting place of 44,294 german soldiers .
more than half of them are buried in one mass grave , the kameraden grab , their names etched on large dark plaques running alongside the site .
" it 's a tragedy that hardly anyone comes here .
least of all the germans themselves , many of whom know very little about what happened , " andre de bruin , a world war i guide and founder of over the top tours , told deutsche welle .
two million german casualties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on some of the cemeteries , not even headstones were permitted andre points to rows of gravestones that lie flat on the ground , explaining : " belgium imposed very strict restrictions on german memorials .
headstones were not allowed to stand , not like those of the commonwealth soldiers and there were many other rules that applied only to germans . "
there were hundreds of burial sites of german soldiers after 1918 but in the 1950s , belgium ordered that the bodies be regrouped in no more than four sites , of which langemark is one .
" it was probably done out of hatred for what happened , especially during world war ii when belgium was occupied .
they even forbade the use of crosses above the headstones , " de bruin said .
germany lost nearly two million men in the first world war , the greatest number of casualties suffered by any nation .
yet for decades , this chapter of history was hardly taught at german schools .
today , the care of german memorials in western flanders , where some of the bloodiest battles took place , is carried out by a voluntary association , the german war graves commission , and its grounds are tended by students .
at the back of langemark , rain-sodden fields stretch ahead , the same ground that turned into a giant , water-clogged inferno of craters and trenches almost a century ago .
it is here that 3,000 german students were killed in 1914 .
" they had received just six weeks basic training before they were sent to the front to accompany german soldiers in what was meant to be a triumphant march to victory .
but they were all killed in the ensuing battles , " andre explained .
" these men died in the same horrific battles as everyone here and yet on armistice day they will lie mostly unremembered , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flanders saw some of wwi 's bloodiest battles only few visitors from germany only a tiny number of germans come to this part of belgium whereas thousands come to visit the commonwealth graves from as far away as australia .
a visitors ' book at langemark shows that most visitors are british school children , who visit the site as part of their trips around ypres .
" we always bring the children here as part of our tours of the world war i sites .
we feel that german families mourned their dead just as british or belgian families would have done , " leonie giles , a teacher at st nicholas school in north-west england , told deutsche welle .
a colleague added that " the aura here is very different , it 's very somber compared to the pristine white cemeteries where the british are buried , which are more like english gardens .
but we want our kids to realize that these soldiers were just like the british who died for king and country . "
simon , a thirteen-year old carrying a small wooden cross with a poppy , said : " it 's so vast , that mass grave .
and it 's such a sad place .
i feel very emotional . "
remains of soldiers are still found in this area every year , and these are added to the mass grave .
but these days , their burials are done with full military honors and are attended by officials from germany and belgium - a sign perhaps that , in time , more recognition will be given to these men who volunteered to lay down their lives .
" deutschland muss leben auch wenn wir sterben muessen , " reads the plaque above their graves .
germany must live even if we must die .

the report says corruption both affected cost for business development but also crippled countries in efforts to ward off poverty as money used in corrupt payments was not being spent on job creation .
sri mulyani indrawati , world bank managing director said the consequences of corruption also go beyond simply the economic impact .
" over time it becomes a real barrier to development , innovation and business growth because sometimes the corruption is in the form of counterfeit drugs so better don ’ t get better or they die , " he said .
" sometime corruption is a building that collapses in the face of national disaster because the quality inspector took a payment from the construction contractor to falsify an inspection .
corruption can kill . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva says there is no " good corruption " no " good corruption " but sri mulyani , a former indonesian finance minister , in comments seen as targeting indonesian politicians who resisted reforms while she was minister said while progress had been made in curbing corruption in indonesia , there was still much to do .
" i see the transformation in my own country , " said sri mulyani . " it is true there is much to be done still .
corruption remains intertwined with politics and there are brazen attacks on those fighting corruption .
we are not alone in that regard .
nonetheless , corruption is an issue that no politician can ignore in indonesia . "
thailand ’ s prime minister abhisit vejjajiva , said despite efforts in thailand corruption remained endemic and was widely accepted within the community : " significantly , even today young people in my country tell me that they expect to see corruption everywhere .
an unbelievable percentage of people also say it is ok for politicians to be corrupt as long as they are capable of bringing economic prosperity .
rampant corruption can exist amid high economic growth .
citizens must be prudently aware that there is no such thing as ' good corruption ' . "
reports put the annual cost of corruption in thailand at around $ 3.0 billion a year .
in a local initiative , more than two dozen thai companies agreed to form a collective alliance to work against corruption .
the directors ’ institute says as many as 200 companies can be expected to join the alliance by next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian protesters demanded that the president should quit over two corruption scandals corruption contributes to inequality but for asian development bank president , haruhiko kuroda , the economic costs of corruption have a wider impact on the community .
" corruption is a tax on the poor , " he said . " corruption and weak governance in general undermine government revenues resulting in poor infrastructure and hinders the pace of poverty reduction .
it also contributes to inequalities in access to education , health , infrastructure and other productive assets .
and it is the poor and the vulnerable that inevitably bear the brunt . "
u.s. secretary of state hilary clinton , in a pre-recorded video statement , stressed the wider impact of corruption from business , politics , and democracy and as a factor in causing malnutrition .
but officials say while the issue of corruption was more openly discussed and legislation strengthened , enforcement remained a problem .
also for many countries where corruption remained rampant there was still some way to go to reduce its impact across societies .

at the back of langemark , rain-sodden fields stretch ahead , the same ground that turned into a giant , water-clogged inferno of craters and trenches almost a century ago .
it is here that 3,000 german students were killed in 1914 .
" they had received just six weeks basic training before they were sent to the front to accompany german soldiers in what was meant to be a triumphant march to victory .
but they were all killed in the ensuing battles , " andre explained .
" these men died in the same horrific battles as everyone here and yet on armistice day they will lie mostly unremembered , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flanders saw some of wwi 's bloodiest battles only few visitors from germany only a tiny number of germans come to this part of belgium whereas thousands come to visit the commonwealth graves from as far away as australia .
a visitors ' book at langemark shows that most visitors are british school children , who visit the site as part of their trips around ypres .
" we always bring the children here as part of our tours of the world war i sites .
we feel that german families mourned their dead just as british or belgian families would have done , " leonie giles , a teacher at st nicholas school in north-west england , told deutsche welle .
a colleague added that " the aura here is very different , it 's very somber compared to the pristine white cemeteries where the british are buried , which are more like english gardens .
but we want our kids to realize that these soldiers were just like the british who died for king and country . "
simon , a thirteen-year old carrying a small wooden cross with a poppy , said : " it 's so vast , that mass grave .
and it 's such a sad place .
i feel very emotional . "
remains of soldiers are still found in this area every year , and these are added to the mass grave .
but these days , their burials are done with full military honors and are attended by officials from germany and belgium - a sign perhaps that , in time , more recognition will be given to these men who volunteered to lay down their lives .
" deutschland muss leben auch wenn wir sterben muessen , " reads the plaque above their graves .
germany must live even if we must die .

but only a few come to remember the german soldiers who died on flanders fields in wwi . a bugle sounded across flanders fields on thursday .
the " last post " used to mark the end of a day on the battlefields and still today it is played as a haunting reminder of the hundreds of thousands of men who laid down their lives along this stretch of the western front during world war i. wreaths of blood-red poppies will be laid at the foot of rows upon rows of white headstones in the commonwealth cemeteries .
but one war memorial will remain silent and empty on armistice day .
the langemark cemetery is the final resting place of 44,294 german soldiers .
more than half of them are buried in one mass grave , the kameraden grab , their names etched on large dark plaques running alongside the site .
" it 's a tragedy that hardly anyone comes here .
least of all the germans themselves , many of whom know very little about what happened , " andre de bruin , a world war i guide and founder of over the top tours , told deutsche welle .
two million german casualties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on some of the cemeteries , not even headstones were permitted andre points to rows of gravestones that lie flat on the ground , explaining : " belgium imposed very strict restrictions on german memorials .
headstones were not allowed to stand , not like those of the commonwealth soldiers and there were many other rules that applied only to germans . "
there were hundreds of burial sites of german soldiers after 1918 but in the 1950s , belgium ordered that the bodies be regrouped in no more than four sites , of which langemark is one .
" it was probably done out of hatred for what happened , especially during world war ii when belgium was occupied .
they even forbade the use of crosses above the headstones , " de bruin said .
germany lost nearly two million men in the first world war , the greatest number of casualties suffered by any nation .
yet for decades , this chapter of history was hardly taught at german schools .
today , the care of german memorials in western flanders , where some of the bloodiest battles took place , is carried out by a voluntary association , the german war graves commission , and its grounds are tended by students .
at the back of langemark , rain-sodden fields stretch ahead , the same ground that turned into a giant , water-clogged inferno of craters and trenches almost a century ago .
it is here that 3,000 german students were killed in 1914 .
" they had received just six weeks basic training before they were sent to the front to accompany german soldiers in what was meant to be a triumphant march to victory .
but they were all killed in the ensuing battles , " andre explained .
" these men died in the same horrific battles as everyone here and yet on armistice day they will lie mostly unremembered , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flanders saw some of wwi 's bloodiest battles only few visitors from germany only a tiny number of germans come to this part of belgium whereas thousands come to visit the commonwealth graves from as far away as australia .

" we always bring the children here as part of our tours of the world war i sites .

but only a few come to remember the german soldiers who died on flanders fields in wwi . a bugle sounded across flanders fields on thursday .
the " last post " used to mark the end of a day on the battlefields and still today it is played as a haunting reminder of the hundreds of thousands of men who laid down their lives along this stretch of the western front during world war i. wreaths of blood-red poppies will be laid at the foot of rows upon rows of white headstones in the commonwealth cemeteries .
but one war memorial will remain silent and empty on armistice day .
the langemark cemetery is the final resting place of 44,294 german soldiers .
more than half of them are buried in one mass grave , the kameraden grab , their names etched on large dark plaques running alongside the site .
" it 's a tragedy that hardly anyone comes here .
least of all the germans themselves , many of whom know very little about what happened , " andre de bruin , a world war i guide and founder of over the top tours , told deutsche welle .
two million german casualties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on some of the cemeteries , not even headstones were permitted andre points to rows of gravestones that lie flat on the ground , explaining : " belgium imposed very strict restrictions on german memorials .
headstones were not allowed to stand , not like those of the commonwealth soldiers and there were many other rules that applied only to germans . "
there were hundreds of burial sites of german soldiers after 1918 but in the 1950s , belgium ordered that the bodies be regrouped in no more than four sites , of which langemark is one .
" it was probably done out of hatred for what happened , especially during world war ii when belgium was occupied .
they even forbade the use of crosses above the headstones , " de bruin said .
germany lost nearly two million men in the first world war , the greatest number of casualties suffered by any nation .
yet for decades , this chapter of history was hardly taught at german schools .
today , the care of german memorials in western flanders , where some of the bloodiest battles took place , is carried out by a voluntary association , the german war graves commission , and its grounds are tended by students .
at the back of langemark , rain-sodden fields stretch ahead , the same ground that turned into a giant , water-clogged inferno of craters and trenches almost a century ago .
it is here that 3,000 german students were killed in 1914 .
" they had received just six weeks basic training before they were sent to the front to accompany german soldiers in what was meant to be a triumphant march to victory .
but they were all killed in the ensuing battles , " andre explained .
" these men died in the same horrific battles as everyone here and yet on armistice day they will lie mostly unremembered , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flanders saw some of wwi 's bloodiest battles only few visitors from germany only a tiny number of germans come to this part of belgium whereas thousands come to visit the commonwealth graves from as far away as australia .
a visitors ' book at langemark shows that most visitors are british school children , who visit the site as part of their trips around ypres .
" we always bring the children here as part of our tours of the world war i sites .
we feel that german families mourned their dead just as british or belgian families would have done , " leonie giles , a teacher at st nicholas school in north-west england , told deutsche welle .
a colleague added that " the aura here is very different , it 's very somber compared to the pristine white cemeteries where the british are buried , which are more like english gardens .
but we want our kids to realize that these soldiers were just like the british who died for king and country . "
simon , a thirteen-year old carrying a small wooden cross with a poppy , said : " it 's so vast , that mass grave .
and it 's such a sad place .
i feel very emotional . "
remains of soldiers are still found in this area every year , and these are added to the mass grave .
but these days , their burials are done with full military honors and are attended by officials from germany and belgium - a sign perhaps that , in time , more recognition will be given to these men who volunteered to lay down their lives .
" deutschland muss leben auch wenn wir sterben muessen , " reads the plaque above their graves .
germany must live even if we must die .

they say they ’ re willing to go to the highest european court . tom freeman and katherine doyle are a heterosexual couple applying for a civil partnership – a form of legal union available only to same-sex couples .
they are one of four heterosexual couples and four same-sex couples trying to challenge the current uk legislation on marriage and civil partnerships .
" initially our aim was equality but increasingly as we look critically at marriage , we feel it is not relevant to us , " katherine doyle told deutsche welle .
" we really do want a civil partnership .
in our day-to-day lives we are more like partners . "
" the important question for us is : why should n't we have a civil partnership , " her partner tom added .
" the institution is being provided for by law so why should n't i have one ? "
gay couples in britain have been allowed to enter into civil partnerships since 2004 , which gives them all the same legal rights and responsibilities as a civil marriage . however they are denied a civil marriage certificate .
on the other hand heterosexual couples do not qualify to enter a civil partnership .
they can either get married or not .
a violation of human rights ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom freeman and katherine doyle are prepared to fight for years working alongside the gay rights group outrage , the eight couples argue that denying each group the legal rights of the other is discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation , something which is contrary to britain 's human rights act . yet tom and katherine 's application has been refused so far .
all they got was a short statement from the town hall , saying that " a civil partnership is a relationship between two people of the same sex . "
the eight couples are one by one each week applying to their local town halls for either a marriage certificate , or a civil partnership certificate , whichever is denied them by law .
at the end of two months , if all applications are turned down , as they are expected to be , the couples will begin a high court challenge . it is the first time that heterosexual couples have taken such an active role in a campaign which at first glance might appear to benefit gay couples wanting equality and a full marriage .
all the way to the european court of human rights the civil partnerships act of 2004 was introduced by the then labour government with wide support in parliament .
it gives same-sex couples the same legal rights and responsibilities as civil marriage .
there also is a formal process for dissolving partnerships which is akin to divorce , but gay rights activists still criticize that it does n't grant full marriage status to gay couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil partnerships exist in most eu member states " when all eight couples - gay and straight - have filed their applications and have been refused we 'll then consult with our legal advisers with a view to bringing the case to the courts , " peter tatchell of the group outrage , which is leading the equal love campaign , told deutsche welle .
" there ’ s a very strong argument that the twin bans on gay marriages and heterosexual civil partnerships are illegal under the human rights act , " he added .
tatchell says the group is prepared to take the case all the way to the european court of human rights if necessary . public opinion backs gay marriage in response to the campaign , the government has issued a statement saying that it is currently considering the next steps for civil partnerships . it said that earlier this year ministers met with people and organizations holding a range of views and that they are looking at the best way to take those views forward . the equal love campaign argues that public attitudes have shifted strongly in favor of allowing gay couples to marry , citing an opinion poll carried out by the group populus in june 2009 , which found that 61 percent of the public believe gay couples should be allowed to marry , while 33 percent disagreed . however , if there is a change in the law , it is not likely to come soon .
" it could take five to ten years to go through the courts , " said katherine doyle .
" but we really feel that we ca n't commit to marriage when it 's exclusive . "

let me introduce myself - i 'm ali .
ali almakhlafi .
i 'm a journalist from yemen . i live in germany .
i 'm 31 years old .
i 'm muslim .
and i 've never been to mecca in my entire life .
even though , when considered from distance , i was born and spent the first 19 years of my life " right next door . " yemen is the poorest country of the arabian peninsula and has a common border with saudi arabia – one of the richest countries of the region and guardian of islam 's holy sites .
from yemen 's capital , sana 'a , it 's about a 90-minute flight from there to mecca .
from germany it takes about six hours .
reporter , not a pilgrim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali 's journey takes him from bonn to mecca .
yet my journey to mecca starts here in germany , the country i live and work in .
and i 'm deliberately not traveling as a religious pilgrim , but as a neutral journalistic reporter .
my main goal is to provide non-muslim users with insights into the hajj pilgrimage - just as i was once introduced to easter , christmas , and other christian feasts .
as you may know , according to saudi arabia 's interpretation of islam , only muslims may visit the holy city of mecca .
however , it is allowed to let non-muslims know about it .
this is what i want to do as i tell you about my impressions , discoveries , and encounters with pilgrims from all over the world - and particularly from germany .
even many muslims know little more about the hajj than the pictures they get on television , which show religious rites and crowds pouring in .
i 'm sure that there 's a lot to find out about the hajj - so wo n't you join me on my journey of discovery ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : praying at the mosque in mecca would you like to know how , exactly , the religious rituals are performed ?
what safety measures are taken ?
whether men and women go on their pilgrimage together ?
or whether conflicts between moderate and radical political groups in the islamic world influence the festivities ?
honestly , i do n't know many of the answers to these questions myself .
but whatever you may want to learn , i 'll try to find it out for you !
please post your questions and suggestions on deutsche welle 's facebook page : http : / / www.facebook.com / deutschewelle even though i will visit mecca as a journalist , this is anything but a " typical " reporting assignement to me .
maybe it 's like a catholic-raised journalist reporting from the vatican : you 're keeping a distance and reporting neutrally , but somehow the subject moves you more than , say , a piece about the latest tax reform .
learning about prophets , and people so i ca n't keep all my childhood memories separated from my thoughts about , and preparation for , my first trip to mecca .
specifically , my religion class in taiz , the town i was born in , comes to my mind .
they taught us that god is in heaven watching us .
that jews and christians share a lot of prophets with muslims except the last prophet and messenger of god : muhammad .
that the citizens of mecca once chased muhammad out of the city .
and that muhammad returned to mecca eight years later and destroyed the statues of false gods that had been built .
as a little boy i was deeply impressed and shaped by these religious basics .
today they inextricably belong to my personal cultural heritage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : our reporter hails from taiz , in yemen of course , at school , i also learned about the five religious duties of every muslim , the so-called five pillars of islam .
the hajj is one of them - a spiritual journey that is to be performed by every muslim who is healthy enough and can afford to do so .
examining my picture of saudi arabia i also want to examine my personal picture of saudi arabia - which is closely linked to my yemeni descent .
there were times when yemenis were allowed to enter the country without a visa .
older men , such as my grandfather , used to go on business trips to the country next door and bring us back precious presents .
but there was also a time - when saudi arabia and yemen were at serious odds about the kuwait war - that saudi arabian leaders expelled hundreds of thousands of yemeni " guest workers " from the country .
during this period , unemployment and poverty increased dramatically in yemen , and the number of students in my class went from 20 to 120 .
that is when i realized that islamic virtues such as solidarity and brotherhood can vanish into thin air when politics come into play .
and that a common belief does n't prevent people from committing human-rights violations .
i wonder what kind of experiences i will have in mecca ?
maybe they 'll be very different from what i expect .

the construction group acs handed in its offer to german financial supervisors bafin , which now has 15 days to deliberate . spain 's largest construction group acs presented its offer for german rival hochtief to germany 's financial supervisory authority bafin on thursday .
bafin now has 15 days to rule on the takeover bid , and hochtief shareholders then have a further four weeks to decide whether to accept the offer .
acs , which already holds just under 30 percent of hochtief , germany 's largest public works construction company , wants to take a controlling stake in the business .
it is seeking an all-share swap to create what would become one of the world 's leading construction firms .
however , acs has offered a price below hochtief 's current market value of around 4.3 billion euros -lrb- 5.9 billion dollars -rrb- , which hochtief sees as unfair .
preventative strategies herbert luetkestratkoetter , head of hochtief , said the company considers the acs bid to be hostile and is " definitely " planning further strategic action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees protested against acs in october hochtief 's chief financial officer burkard lohr refused to rule out a capital increase or a convertible loan to refinance the company .
both measures would increase the number of hochtief shares and thus make a takeover bid more difficult .
another option is for essen-based hochtief to puts its subsidiary concessions on the stock market , even if it means separating itself from that part of its business . concessions ' main activity is the operation of airports and toll-roads .
at the same time the german firm is trying to force the spanish group to make a bid for hochtief 's australian subsidiary leighton , thereby increasing the price , and possibly discouraging acs .
acs could instead carry out a capital increase of 78.5 million euros -lrb- 107.6 million dollars -rrb- , which is to be approved during an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on november 19 .

the construction group acs handed in its offer to german financial supervisors bafin , which now has 15 days to deliberate . spain 's largest construction group acs presented its offer for german rival hochtief to germany 's financial supervisory authority bafin on thursday .
bafin now has 15 days to rule on the takeover bid , and hochtief shareholders then have a further four weeks to decide whether to accept the offer .
acs , which already holds just under 30 percent of hochtief , germany 's largest public works construction company , wants to take a controlling stake in the business .
it is seeking an all-share swap to create what would become one of the world 's leading construction firms .
however , acs has offered a price below hochtief 's current market value of around 4.3 billion euros -lrb- 5.9 billion dollars -rrb- , which hochtief sees as unfair .

at the same time the german firm is trying to force the spanish group to make a bid for hochtief 's australian subsidiary leighton , thereby increasing the price , and possibly discouraging acs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 11.11.2010 new ' legal highs ' worry drug watchdogs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legal highs are often mixed to look similar to ecstasy the number of people using illegal drugs in germany and europe has very slightly increased , according to two annual reports .
however both reports warn about the increase in so-called legal highs . over five percent of germans say they have taken some kind of illegal drug during the previous 12 months , according to the german drugs monitoring body dbdd .
the survey was carried out in 2009 and shows an increase of just 0.1 percent over the figures in the previous survey , carried out in 2006 .
the annual reports of the dbdd and its european partner emcdda were published this week , and show similar patterns of drug use in germany and the eu as a whole .
they show that levels of illegal drug use are relatively stable .
in germany , 26.7 percent of people surveyed had taken some kind of illegal drug in their lifetime , but only 2.6 percent had taken something in the past month .
" we can say that this is a positive development , " said dr. stephanie floeter , a research associate at the dbdd .
" the consumption of many illegal drugs is going down and that has been the trend of the past few years . "
the appetite for cocaine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis is the most used drug in germany and europe the most popular drug is cannabis , with cocaine continuing to be the second most popular , both in europe and germany .
there are at least four million cocaine users in europe .
although cocaine and amphetamine use has increased slightly in germany since the last survey , the figure is no where near that of some other eu countries .
roland simon from the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- said that , in their pan-europe report , germany was not one of the biggest users .
" cocaine plays a really big role all over europe .
1.3 percent of the eu population uses it , " simon told deutsche welle .
" in germany it 's just 0.6 percent - so about half the eu average . "
simon added that big user countries like spain and the uk are pushing the eu average up .
new legal highs both reports flagged up a need to be wary about new legal drugs that are becoming more common .
these are drugs which it is legal to import and export , and which are often cut or mixed with other substances and sold on .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amphetamine mephedrone is one of the more recent drugs to become illegal in germany " there are always new drugs , " said the dbdd 's floeter .
" new synthetic drugs , drugs made from herbs and plants like the drug spice , and ones that imitate ecstasy like pma . "
the pills containing pma , pmma or pcp are often indistinguishable from ecstasy and mdma .
the difference is that they are legal .
" it gives drug traffickers the opportunity for a bargain , " said simon .
" they can earn the money without running the risk of selling illicit substances . "
the drugs flood the markets before the law has time to catch up .
last year 24 new types of drug were identified , this year there were 31 .
" the particular danger is that these pills have a delayed effect , " said the government 's drugs commissioner mechthild dyckmans .
" people take one , then when there is no effect they take another .
this has serious health consequences . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 11.11.2010 gay outing case highlights ethics questions facing ugandan press großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attention-grabbing headline has caused a lot of upset when a new and unlicensed newspaper published photos of members of uganda 's gay community , it not only put them at risk of harassment but highlighted the lack of freedom in the country 's media . uganda 's rolling stone newspaper has only been in circulation since august , but the rag has already caused a splash both within and outside its national borders .
on two separate occasions the tabloid , which is in no way related to the us music magazine of the same name , has printed the identities and addresses of alleged homosexuals .
the campaign launched in october under the headline banner " 100 pictures of uganda 's top homos leak - hang them " has so far outed 29 people .
several of them have since been subjected to harassment and threats from members of the public .
transgender stosh mugisha is among the victims .
biologically a woman but living as a man , the 33-year old 's life has drastically changed since his photograph appeared in the rolling stone " men of shame " gallery .
“ i went to the shop where i usually buy cigarettes , " mugisha told deutsche welle .
" the woman told me ' i do n't sell cigarettes to faggots ' , so i left . "
on his way home passers-by threw verbal abuse and even stones at him .
although he was not physically hurt , he has since had to move away for fear of a more serious attack .
interim ruling in light of the controversial pictures and following a petition from the gay rights group , sexual minorities uganda , the high court ordered rolling stone , which is not yet in possession of a license , to cease publication .
judge vincent musoke kibuuka described the public outing as an invasion of the right to privacy of the individuals identified .
yet the ruling is only temporary and will be reviewed at a hearing later this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the colors of gay pride are not visible on the streets of kampala the newspaper 's managing editor , giles muhame , is confident that he will be able to resume what he says is his duty to expose evils in society before the month is out .
" the main case comes up on november 23 , we shall challenge it , we shall defeat them , the interim order will be quashed , " he said .
in an editor 's note written to accompany the publication of his " men of shame part ii , " muhame cited his motivation for printing the pictures as an attempt to stop a " cross-section of heartless homosexuals " from recruiting and brainwashing unsuspecting kids into gay circles .
it is this allegation in particular that stosh mugisha found hurtful and distasteful .
" how do you recruit someone into something they do not want ? , " he asked . " homosexuality is inborn , you can not start it by going into schools , it 's not like you are looking for votes . ”
ethical issues but the editor begs to differ , and has said he will not quit his printing spree until members of the gay community " stop enrolling minors in their circles . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' most ugandans do n't support gay rights , ' one official said .
where the situation goes from here will depend at least to some extent on whether or not the country 's media council , tasked with promoting responsible and ethical journalism , decides to issue rolling stone with a license .
peter mwesige , executive director of the african center for media excellence , said the council would have to be seriously outraged not to .
but given the debate in the country last year over the introduction of the death penalty for some homosexual acts , that outrage might be hard to come by .
" most people in the society we live in do not support the idea that homosexuals deserve any rights , " mwesige told deutsche welle .
although the council , which freedom house notes " has been criticized for its lack of independence , " has a code of ethics on issues such as invasion of privacy , the guidelines are regularly flouted and many a blind eye is turned .
just so long as there are no officials involved .
" the government does n't pay attention to ethics , " mwesige said .
" but when the stories are politically sensitive , it cares . "
spotlight on human rights that became blatantly obvious last year when the government , under president yoweri museveni , closed four radio stations on the grounds that they were inciting racial hatred .
besides curtailing press freedom , the " write-anything-about-anyone-but-nothing-about-me " modus operandi also highlights another problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the might of the government geoffrey wokulira ssebaggala , programs co-coordinator at human rights network for journalists in uganda , says one of the biggest challenges facing the country 's media today is the establishment of a culture of professionalism .
" people write about anything , and they do n't mind if it infringes on others ' rights , " ssebaggala told deutsche welle .
" those managing media in uganda have no knowledge of human rights . "
he says it is crucial to change the status quo , but that doing so will require a complete rethink on the parts of publishers , broadcasters , proprietors and most of all the government .
" there 's a lot that needs to be done , " he said .
" but as long as we 're not challenging power it is not seen as a threat . "

it 's match day twelve in the bundesliga and after the abject failure of trying to summon voodoo spirits to do their bidding last week , the dw soccer pundits have resorted to less ghoulish methods . dw 's soccer pundits have been forming a fidgety queue outside the bathroom this week after downing enough tea to fill a swimming pool .
as well as causing numerous pairs of legs to cross , the experiment has also produced enough bundesliga result-shaped tea leaf formations to come up with the predictions for match day twelve .
amuse yourselves with these forecasts while we dash once again to the little boys room ...
saturday , nov 13 bremen – frankfurt oh dear .
just what is going on with werder bremen ?
esteemed colleague jefferson chase nailed it in his commentary this week – whatever 's gone wrong at bremen , it 'll need huge changes to fix it .
while wondering what was going to happen next was initially an endearing game of roulette , as the season wears on , it looks like bremen are playing the russian variety .
no guesses who 'll get the bullet if their form continues to nosedive .
frankfurt very well could be the team to load the gun .
prediction : frankfurt 2-1 wolfsburg – schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke edged closer to safety thanks to raul 's goals go on then , but just whisper it … schalke may have turned a corner .
there – i said it … which means , of course , that wolfsburg 's up-and-down season will ascend again to the detriment of felix magath 's struggling side on saturday .
the royal blues may have fired three past st. pauli to put them one point from safety but the hamburg club are quickly becoming easy pickings as their confidence dwindles .
wolfsburg will be a sterner test .
perhaps the training ground punch-ups suggest the wolves have the fight to come out on top in this one .
prediction : wolfsburg 3-2 cologne – moenchengladbach wake us up when this derby is over .
the two sides who manage to make schalke look good come together in this basement clash with little daylight between them in terms of points and class .
gladbach at least shocked the life out of bayern last week - which always raises a smile in these parts - but with cologne struggling to find anything resembling flair in any of their games to date , these two could blunder and bump against each other for 90 minutes and still not score .
hopefully one will manage it but it 's a coin toss .
heads it 's gladbach .
prediction : gladbach 1-0 kaiserslautern – stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ciprian marica led the way in the thrashing of bremen stuttgart will be nicely rested after last weekend 's game so kaiserslautern should beware .
vfb stuck six past bremen and then must have retired to a dark room to lie down .
despite the green shoots of recovery growing over at the mercedes benz arena , few would have tipped jens keller 's team to thrash werder so comprehensively -lrb- i certainly did n't -rrb- .
but then kaiserslautern looked impressive last week , even though they evenutally lost against in-form leverkusen . this one could prove quite entertaining to watch .
prediction : 2-2 st. pauli – leverkusen pauli continue to slide and it 's already looking like an inevitable one towards what many people think is their rightful place in the relegation zone .
the neutral will hope they can arrest the decline but taking on leverkusen may not be the best place to start .
bayer have been quietly efficient in rising to third place and will be looking to make up ground on mainz in the place above them .
on form alone , it looks as though pauli will be deeper in the mire come saturday night .
prediction : leverkusen 3-1 mainz – hanover mainz in crisis !
two defeats on the bounce !
how easy it is to forget what an achievement this season has already been for mainz .
it is n't only their position which is impressive but the way they 've gotten there .
okay , so freiburg should never have beaten them last week – but only in the context of mainz 's amazing form to date .
last season , this would n't have been such a shock .
losing or drawing with hanover would n't have been either but on the evidence of this campaign alone , one would expect mainz to triumph .
prediction : mainz 2-0 sunday , nov 14 hoffenheim – freiburg despite winning last week , hoffenheim still dropped down the league , giving the illusion that their title charge has already petered out .
do n't be fooled .
the pendulum of form is swinging in the hoff 's direction and a win over freiburg will see them back in the mix .
freiburg had a great result against mainz and will have to be completely free of the hangover to cope with the hoff at home .
expecting the freiburgers to be well up for it as usual , this could be a tight affair .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 bayern – nuremberg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern lost their heads against gladbach last weekend they still have n't quite got it right , have they ?
louis van gaal tore his team a new one after letting the points slip against bottom club gladbach last week and you would expect a reaction from the german champions against nuremberg on sunday .
but how many times has the gruff dutchman got all red in the face only to see his team go pale on the pitch ?
nuremberg cantered to a win against cologne last week and of course bayern , however dire , are the polar opposite of the boys for köln .
however , the bavarians are increasingly hard to fathom so – who knows ?

it 's match day twelve in the bundesliga and after the abject failure of trying to summon voodoo spirits to do their bidding last week , the dw soccer pundits have resorted to less ghoulish methods . dw 's soccer pundits have been forming a fidgety queue outside the bathroom this week after downing enough tea to fill a swimming pool .
as well as causing numerous pairs of legs to cross , the experiment has also produced enough bundesliga result-shaped tea leaf formations to come up with the predictions for match day twelve .
amuse yourselves with these forecasts while we dash once again to the little boys room ...
saturday , nov 13 bremen – frankfurt oh dear .
just what is going on with werder bremen ?
esteemed colleague jefferson chase nailed it in his commentary this week – whatever 's gone wrong at bremen , it 'll need huge changes to fix it .
while wondering what was going to happen next was initially an endearing game of roulette , as the season wears on , it looks like bremen are playing the russian variety .
no guesses who 'll get the bullet if their form continues to nosedive .
frankfurt very well could be the team to load the gun .
prediction : frankfurt 2-1 wolfsburg – schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke edged closer to safety thanks to raul 's goals go on then , but just whisper it … schalke may have turned a corner .
there – i said it … which means , of course , that wolfsburg 's up-and-down season will ascend again to the detriment of felix magath 's struggling side on saturday .
the royal blues may have fired three past st. pauli to put them one point from safety but the hamburg club are quickly becoming easy pickings as their confidence dwindles .
wolfsburg will be a sterner test .
perhaps the training ground punch-ups suggest the wolves have the fight to come out on top in this one .
prediction : wolfsburg 3-2 cologne – moenchengladbach wake us up when this derby is over .
the two sides who manage to make schalke look good come together in this basement clash with little daylight between them in terms of points and class .
gladbach at least shocked the life out of bayern last week - which always raises a smile in these parts - but with cologne struggling to find anything resembling flair in any of their games to date , these two could blunder and bump against each other for 90 minutes and still not score .
hopefully one will manage it but it 's a coin toss .
heads it 's gladbach .
prediction : gladbach 1-0 kaiserslautern – stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ciprian marica led the way in the thrashing of bremen stuttgart will be nicely rested after last weekend 's game so kaiserslautern should beware .
vfb stuck six past bremen and then must have retired to a dark room to lie down .
despite the green shoots of recovery growing over at the mercedes benz arena , few would have tipped jens keller 's team to thrash werder so comprehensively -lrb- i certainly did n't -rrb- .
but then kaiserslautern looked impressive last week , even though they evenutally lost against in-form leverkusen . this one could prove quite entertaining to watch .
prediction : 2-2 st. pauli – leverkusen pauli continue to slide and it 's already looking like an inevitable one towards what many people think is their rightful place in the relegation zone .
the neutral will hope they can arrest the decline but taking on leverkusen may not be the best place to start .
bayer have been quietly efficient in rising to third place and will be looking to make up ground on mainz in the place above them .
on form alone , it looks as though pauli will be deeper in the mire come saturday night .
prediction : leverkusen 3-1 mainz – hanover mainz in crisis !
two defeats on the bounce !
how easy it is to forget what an achievement this season has already been for mainz .
it is n't only their position which is impressive but the way they 've gotten there .
okay , so freiburg should never have beaten them last week – but only in the context of mainz 's amazing form to date .
last season , this would n't have been such a shock .
losing or drawing with hanover would n't have been either but on the evidence of this campaign alone , one would expect mainz to triumph .
prediction : mainz 2-0 sunday , nov 14 hoffenheim – freiburg despite winning last week , hoffenheim still dropped down the league , giving the illusion that their title charge has already petered out .
do n't be fooled .
the pendulum of form is swinging in the hoff 's direction and a win over freiburg will see them back in the mix .
freiburg had a great result against mainz and will have to be completely free of the hangover to cope with the hoff at home .
expecting the freiburgers to be well up for it as usual , this could be a tight affair .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 bayern – nuremberg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern lost their heads against gladbach last weekend they still have n't quite got it right , have they ?
louis van gaal tore his team a new one after letting the points slip against bottom club gladbach last week and you would expect a reaction from the german champions against nuremberg on sunday .
but how many times has the gruff dutchman got all red in the face only to see his team go pale on the pitch ?
nuremberg cantered to a win against cologne last week and of course bayern , however dire , are the polar opposite of the boys for köln .
however , the bavarians are increasingly hard to fathom so – who knows ?

" we continue to support the goal of withdrawal , " westerwelle said during a parliamentary debate on thursday in berlin .
disarmament is going to be a " key issue " for germany at the lisbon meeting , the foreign minister said .
there are no official figures about the number of nuclear weapons stationed on german soil , but it is believed that perhaps 10 to 20 nuclear warheads from the us arsenal are stockpiled at the buechel air base in the state of rhineland-palatinate in southwestern germany .
russian cooperation government leaders and heads of state of the 28 nato member countries meet in the portuguese capital next week friday to discuss a major strategic overhaul of the military alliance .
a key element of nato 's new strategy to be decided upon in lisbon is a european missile-defense system .
in what westerwelle called an " historic gesture , " russia will be involved in the discussions .
" we do n't want a europe with areas of differing security levels , " westerwelle said .
" we want to improve our security alongside , not in confrontation with russia . "
westerwelle defends cabinet colleague the foreign minister used his address in parliament to also set straight a cornerstone of german military doctrine .
westerwelle rejected accusations that defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was revamping the german armed forces to fight what the opposition called " economic wars . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister called for nuclear exit and defended his colleague karl-theodor zu guttenberg " we will continue the culture of military restraint .
any other assumption is defamation that has nothing to do with reality , " the minister said .
westerwelle 's comments were viewed as indirect support for defense minister guttenberg , who recently made controversial remarks to the effect that germany should align its security policies with economic interests , like other countries do .
in response , the green party parliamentary leader , juergen trittin , accused guttenberg of pursuing " gunboat diplomacy . "
defending his position , guttenberg told parliament on thursday that the strategy was contained in a government white paper from 2006 when the opposition social democrats were still in a grand coalition with chancellor merkel 's christian democrats .
" there were no cries of outrage then , " guttenberg said , " but now comes the great wave of indignation . "
the issue of economic intervention is also expected to be on the agenda of the nato summit next week .

the findings could have significant implications for dealing with hospital-acquired bugs . every year , over four million hospital patients in europe develop an infection during their stay .
the culprit is most often a strain of the bacteria staphylococcus aureus , also known as mrsa , which has proven resistant to antibiotic treatment .
scientists from the university of wuerzburg and the helmholtz center for infection research -lrb- hzi -rrb- in braunschweig have now found an approach to treating such infections .
they have developed an antibody which specifically targets mrsa in mice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staphylococcus aureus can cause a range of illnesses " we have succeeded in activating a defense mechanism against staphylococcus pathogens in mice with the help of antibodies , " said dr. udo lorenz from the university of wuerzburg 's department of surgery .
together with dr. knut ohlsen from the institute for molecular infection biology , lorenz has spent the last few years pursuing the idea of combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria with antibodies .
" these antibodies attach themselves to a specific point on the bacterium , " lorenz told deutsche welle .
this in turn marks the bacterium , so that the body 's own scavenger cells can detect them and subsequently kill them .
dr. christian erck from hzi worked on actually developing the antibodies in mice .
" these antibodies help make the bacteria visible to the immune system , " he told deutsche welle .
" even when antibiotics can no longer kill multi-resistant bacterial strains , antibodies still have a good chance against them . "
in the experiments , the mice 's immune systems were able to kill 30 percent more pathogens with the aid of the antibodies than without .
" this is a very dramatic advantage , which can constitute the difference between death and survival , " lorenz said .
targeting immune weakness most people have staphylococcus bacteria on their skin and , if they 're healthy , it does n't cause any problems .
" but this is a very flexible bacteria and it can become extremely aggressive , " erck said .
if these pathogens make their way inside patients with weakened immune systems , they cause infections which are extremely difficult to cure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lorenz -lrb- left -rrb- and ohlsen developed this procedure lorenz said this would be the target group for treatment .
" these are patients who have just had surgery or are in intensive care , whose immune systems are not functioning in an optimal way , " he said .
mouse to man the next step now involves transferring the antibody from mice to humans .
this means the entire molecule will need to be " humanized " so that people do n't develop antibodies against the mice antibodies and reject them .
" we will take only the part of the antibody that docks to the bacterium and build the rest of the molecule artificially , so that it is suitable for people , " lorenz said .
if everything goes according to plan , lorenz said he expected the first clinical study to take place at the end of 2012 .
" then we can find out which sort of infections are suitable for this treatment , " he said .
the scientists have published their findings in the current issue of the journal antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 11.11.2010 corruption in asia : a tax on the poor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters wear traditional costumes during an anti-corruption protest in jakarta , indonesia the more than thousand delegates attending the 14th international anti-corruption conference are being reminded of corruption ’ s wider cost to society , both to business and to communities . the world bank in a report released to coincide with the latest international anti-corruption conference says the cost of corruption each year worldwide is more than one trillion dollars .
the report says corruption both affected cost for business development but also crippled countries in efforts to ward off poverty as money used in corrupt payments was not being spent on job creation .
sri mulyani indrawati , world bank managing director said the consequences of corruption also go beyond simply the economic impact .
" over time it becomes a real barrier to development , innovation and business growth because sometimes the corruption is in the form of counterfeit drugs so better don ’ t get better or they die , " he said .
" sometime corruption is a building that collapses in the face of national disaster because the quality inspector took a payment from the construction contractor to falsify an inspection .
corruption can kill . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva says there is no " good corruption " no " good corruption " but sri mulyani , a former indonesian finance minister , in comments seen as targeting indonesian politicians who resisted reforms while she was minister said while progress had been made in curbing corruption in indonesia , there was still much to do .
" i see the transformation in my own country , " said sri mulyani . " it is true there is much to be done still .
corruption remains intertwined with politics and there are brazen attacks on those fighting corruption .
we are not alone in that regard .
nonetheless , corruption is an issue that no politician can ignore in indonesia . "
thailand ’ s prime minister abhisit vejjajiva , said despite efforts in thailand corruption remained endemic and was widely accepted within the community : " significantly , even today young people in my country tell me that they expect to see corruption everywhere .
an unbelievable percentage of people also say it is ok for politicians to be corrupt as long as they are capable of bringing economic prosperity .
rampant corruption can exist amid high economic growth .
citizens must be prudently aware that there is no such thing as ' good corruption ' . "
reports put the annual cost of corruption in thailand at around $ 3.0 billion a year .
in a local initiative , more than two dozen thai companies agreed to form a collective alliance to work against corruption .
the directors ’ institute says as many as 200 companies can be expected to join the alliance by next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian protesters demanded that the president should quit over two corruption scandals corruption contributes to inequality but for asian development bank president , haruhiko kuroda , the economic costs of corruption have a wider impact on the community .
" corruption is a tax on the poor , " he said . " corruption and weak governance in general undermine government revenues resulting in poor infrastructure and hinders the pace of poverty reduction .
it also contributes to inequalities in access to education , health , infrastructure and other productive assets .
and it is the poor and the vulnerable that inevitably bear the brunt . "
u.s. secretary of state hilary clinton , in a pre-recorded video statement , stressed the wider impact of corruption from business , politics , and democracy and as a factor in causing malnutrition .
but officials say while the issue of corruption was more openly discussed and legislation strengthened , enforcement remained a problem .
also for many countries where corruption remained rampant there was still some way to go to reduce its impact across societies .

they claimed that the power-sharing deal they had been presented with was not being honoured and that three of the party 's most senior members , barred for their alleged ties to saddam 's baath party , had not been reinstated as promised . as well as the annulment of the bans against the three iraqiya members , iraqiya had presented a further three conditions on which its participation in the power-sharing agreement would hinge : a bill forming the security body , a committee examining cases against political detainees , and codifying the power-sharing deal . iraqiya 's support for any government is seen a hugely important if iraq is not to descend into ethnic violence once more .
the sunni arab minority , which gave iraqiya a narrow victory in the contested march 7 poll , provided the heaviest resistance in the anti-us insurgency after the 2003 invasion .
its involvement in any coalition is imperative if peace is to be achieved . iraqiya 's apparent rejection of the deal highlights the fierce divides and rivalries which have paralysed the iraqi political system since the fall of saddam hussein regime .
the deal , clinched late wednesday night after three days of high-pressure talks between the rival factions , saw shiite prime minister al-maliki returning to office for a second term . talabani , a kurd , is expected to retain the presidency .
and a sunni mp was to be elected as speaker of parliament .
maliki now has 30 days to form his cabinet , and the next parliamentary meeting is scheduled for saturday .
the decision offered hope that the next government would include enough sunni representation to lower the chances of a return to the sectarian violence that killed tens of thousands of people after the 2003 , u.s.-led invasion that ousted sunni dictator saddam hussein .
iraqiya , who had held out for months to take the premiership from maliki after it narrowly won more seats in the march election , initially confirmed it had finally signed up to the deal .
us praises deal the obama administration called the development " a big step forward for iraq . " " all along we 've said the best result would be a government that reflects the results of the elections , includes all the major blocs representing iraq 's ethnic and sectarian groups , and that does not exclude or marginalize anyone .
that 's exactly what iraqis seem to have agreed to , " antony blinken , national security adviser to us vice president joe biden , said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi prime minister ayad allawi 's group finally agreed to the deal iraq has been without a new government since the vote , which gave iraqiya two more seats than maliki 's bloc .
neither had enough for a majority in parliament , leaving the factions to negotiate a government .
iraqiya initially joined a kurdish alliance in supporting maliki following months of contentious negotiations which raised tensions in iraq as the army and police try to cement security gains against a stubborn insurgency .
last month , maliki toured capitals in the region - from iran and syria to turkey and egypt - to gain regional backing for his effort to stay in power .
he offered arab nations investment deals in iraq in exchange for nudging iraqiya toward a compromise , political sources said .
court pressure paid off over the past months , iraqiya repeatedly rejected another maliki term and demanded the right to form the government as the top vote winner in the election .
parliament met briefly in june but lawmakers said they needed more time to decide who would hold the highest offices .
last month , iraq 's high court ordered parliament to resume its sessions , putting pressure on politicians to expedite a deal .
the long deadlock has fueled tension even though the sectarian carnage unleashed after the 2003 invasion is receding while u.s. forces prepare to withdraw in 2011 .
a series of attacks on christian targets across baghdad on wednesday stirred renewed fear in the minority community .
the bomb and mortar blasts occurred just 10 days after a bloody siege at a catholic cathedral that killed 52 .

they claimed that the power-sharing deal they had been presented with was not being honoured and that three of the party 's most senior members , barred for their alleged ties to saddam 's baath party , had not been reinstated as promised . as well as the annulment of the bans against the three iraqiya members , iraqiya had presented a further three conditions on which its participation in the power-sharing agreement would hinge : a bill forming the security body , a committee examining cases against political detainees , and codifying the power-sharing deal . iraqiya 's support for any government is seen a hugely important if iraq is not to descend into ethnic violence once more .
the sunni arab minority , which gave iraqiya a narrow victory in the contested march 7 poll , provided the heaviest resistance in the anti-us insurgency after the 2003 invasion .
its involvement in any coalition is imperative if peace is to be achieved . iraqiya 's apparent rejection of the deal highlights the fierce divides and rivalries which have paralysed the iraqi political system since the fall of saddam hussein regime .
the deal , clinched late wednesday night after three days of high-pressure talks between the rival factions , saw shiite prime minister al-maliki returning to office for a second term . talabani , a kurd , is expected to retain the presidency .
and a sunni mp was to be elected as speaker of parliament .
maliki now has 30 days to form his cabinet , and the next parliamentary meeting is scheduled for saturday .
the decision offered hope that the next government would include enough sunni representation to lower the chances of a return to the sectarian violence that killed tens of thousands of people after the 2003 , u.s.-led invasion that ousted sunni dictator saddam hussein .
iraqiya , who had held out for months to take the premiership from maliki after it narrowly won more seats in the march election , initially confirmed it had finally signed up to the deal .
us praises deal the obama administration called the development " a big step forward for iraq . " " all along we 've said the best result would be a government that reflects the results of the elections , includes all the major blocs representing iraq 's ethnic and sectarian groups , and that does not exclude or marginalize anyone .
that 's exactly what iraqis seem to have agreed to , " antony blinken , national security adviser to us vice president joe biden , said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi prime minister ayad allawi 's group finally agreed to the deal iraq has been without a new government since the vote , which gave iraqiya two more seats than maliki 's bloc .
neither had enough for a majority in parliament , leaving the factions to negotiate a government .
iraqiya initially joined a kurdish alliance in supporting maliki following months of contentious negotiations which raised tensions in iraq as the army and police try to cement security gains against a stubborn insurgency .
last month , maliki toured capitals in the region - from iran and syria to turkey and egypt - to gain regional backing for his effort to stay in power .
he offered arab nations investment deals in iraq in exchange for nudging iraqiya toward a compromise , political sources said .
court pressure paid off over the past months , iraqiya repeatedly rejected another maliki term and demanded the right to form the government as the top vote winner in the election .
parliament met briefly in june but lawmakers said they needed more time to decide who would hold the highest offices .
last month , iraq 's high court ordered parliament to resume its sessions , putting pressure on politicians to expedite a deal .
the long deadlock has fueled tension even though the sectarian carnage unleashed after the 2003 invasion is receding while u.s. forces prepare to withdraw in 2011 .
a series of attacks on christian targets across baghdad on wednesday stirred renewed fear in the minority community .
the bomb and mortar blasts occurred just 10 days after a bloody siege at a catholic cathedral that killed 52 .

the greek finance ministry has said it has narrowly missed its january-october target to reduce its budget deficit .
the unwelcome news comes as the eu said it would take action to support ireland , if needed . the greek public deficit has fallen sharply since the implementation of an eu-imf rescue package for the debt-stricken country , but efforts to reduce the shortfall have still fallen short of the targets set for this year .
greece , struggling with a huge public deficit , came close to default in may and had to be bailed out with a 110-billion-euro package arranged by the eu and international monetary fund .
through october , greek public finances showed a deficit of some 17.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 24 billion -rrb- , down 30 percent from the same period a year ago , but still less than the 32 percent target .
the government in athens has implemented a series of draconian reforms aimed at restoring its financial credibility .
it cut spending by 7 percent , or four billion euros , but tax revenues only grew 3.7 percent , well short of the 2010 target of 13.7 percent .
at the same time as this announcement , the european union moved to reassure financial markets on thursday that it was ready to support ireland as the eurozone country 's debt woes made waves at the g20 summit in south korea .
ireland has worst deficit in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu is poised to help ireland too , barroso said concern about ireland is growing after irish bond yields soared to a record level of 8.28 percent on wednesday . as a result , european commission president jose manuel barroso found himself compelled to announce that the eu stood ready to help ireland " in case of need . "
" what is important now is that we have all the necessary instruments in place , " barroso said in the south korean capital , seoul , ahead of the g20 meeting .
" we are monitoring the situation in ireland on a permanent basis , " he added .
the rise in irish bond yields has unsettled investors and put the entire european bond market under serious strain .
ireland is trying to tackle the worst budget deficit in the eu and convince markets that it does not need a greek-style bailout .

it is designed to help children who might be struggling in school , as well as stretch high-achievers . nick treloar , a 15-year-old student at the french lycée in london , used to have a tutor come to the house .
but he finds the online tuition a more flexible alternative . " it 's a whenever-you-want system , " nick said .
" you can book the session for any time of day .
it 's you that says ' i want this hour to this hour . '
it 's your choice , so whenever you have a free period during the day , or you finish an hour earlier , then you can come home , and sit down and do this session . " nick 's tutor nathan is based thousands of miles away , in ludhiana , india .
nick has never even seen what his tutor looks like .
but he can hear him , as he guides nick through math problems on a white board that they can both see and write on - a more effective method than simply chatting with a camera on skype . a manageable structure nathan speaks fluent american english from having tutored us students online .
he is 31 years old , and has a five-year-old daughter .
he earns about eight euros -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- an hour , which he says is more than double what many people his age are earning in other professions in india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nathan carries out his work from punjab for him , tutoring is not just about the money , though , but the love of mentoring students and shaping their future .
nathan holds a master 's degree in mathematics and he has been handpicked and trained for the job .
he had already been tutoring american school kids via the web for three years before joining brightspark .
he said he was impressed with british students . " it 's a much better level with uk students , and often with some subjects , they start them much younger , " nathan said . the time difference between the uk and india is four-and-a-half hours , which nathan said is manageable .
he said if a british student books the latest session available , at 9 pm in the uk , it is 1:30 am in ludhiana . nathan is currently part of a team of 30 tutors .
but the company expects to grow to 100 tutors - all working out of small office booths with laptops and skype headsets . lack of specialists british demand for online math tutorials is growing , according to brightspark education chief tom hooper .
he saw an acute need in britain for specialized math tuition for struggling school kids , and introduced indian online tutors after seeing the project work in the us . one british primary school is already using the online tutorials in class to support the teacher - and there are more schools in the pipeline .
hooper is also working with charities in deprived areas and housing estates by introducing the online tutorials to drop-in centers , where mothers can drop their kids off , for an hour 's session at a computer terminal . he says there is a shocking lack of specialist math teachers in britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tutors are virtual at brightspark " only 11 percent of teachers have a degree in the subject they teach , and only eight percent have any training , " hooper said .
" we thought by going to india , we could bring in a level of academic talent that is 100 percent related to math and a 100 percent trained .
that 's why we are seeing a benefit for our students . " hooper also said it 's not just british children who need help . " there are distinct problems among elements of the adult population who have very low numeracy skills , which creates problems socially , but also for unemployed people who want to re-engage with the workforce , " he said . the tutoring industry in britain is completely unregulated , according to hooper .
the company therefore introduced its own strict standards for data protection , assuring their clients their data are closely guarded .
students often get a different tutor with every new session , and the tutors know nothing about them , except their name . with plans to expand the online tutoring business to other subjects , hooper rejects the accusation that indians are somehow taking away british teaching jobs . " i strongly reject that allegation , " he said .
" we are not outsourcing british jobs ; we are in-sourcing specialist skills . " progress is visible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nick likes the flexibility of online tutoring for nick 's father phil , the online tutoring helps him monitor his son 's progress .
he can see how many sessions nick is booking , because he pays for them - and he can see tangible results in nick 's math scores . " we are able to see his progress , and it makes him much more open to be able to tell us which areas he is dropping back in and needs help , " phil said . an online tutor from india costs clients on average of 13 euros an hour .
a tutor in person can cost up to 46 euros - three times as much .
with that price difference , and specialist math tutors on offer , the company said they expect more students like nick to sign up . author : nina-maria potts / sms editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is designed to help children who might be struggling in school , as well as stretch high-achievers . nick treloar , a 15-year-old student at the french lycée in london , used to have a tutor come to the house .
but he finds the online tuition a more flexible alternative . " it 's a whenever-you-want system , " nick said .
" you can book the session for any time of day .
it 's you that says ' i want this hour to this hour . '
it 's your choice , so whenever you have a free period during the day , or you finish an hour earlier , then you can come home , and sit down and do this session . " nick 's tutor nathan is based thousands of miles away , in ludhiana , india .
nick has never even seen what his tutor looks like .
but he can hear him , as he guides nick through math problems on a white board that they can both see and write on - a more effective method than simply chatting with a camera on skype . a manageable structure nathan speaks fluent american english from having tutored us students online .
he is 31 years old , and has a five-year-old daughter .
he earns about eight euros -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- an hour , which he says is more than double what many people his age are earning in other professions in india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nathan carries out his work from punjab for him , tutoring is not just about the money , though , but the love of mentoring students and shaping their future .
nathan holds a master 's degree in mathematics and he has been handpicked and trained for the job .
he had already been tutoring american school kids via the web for three years before joining brightspark .
he said he was impressed with british students . " it 's a much better level with uk students , and often with some subjects , they start them much younger , " nathan said . the time difference between the uk and india is four-and-a-half hours , which nathan said is manageable .

let me introduce myself - i 'm ali .
ali almakhlafi .
i 'm a journalist from yemen . i live in germany .
i 'm 31 years old .
i 'm muslim .
and i 've never been to mecca in my entire life .
even though , when considered from distance , i was born and spent the first 19 years of my life " right next door . " yemen is the poorest country of the arabian peninsula and has a common border with saudi arabia – one of the richest countries of the region and guardian of islam 's holy sites .
from yemen 's capital , sana 'a , it 's about a 90-minute flight from there to mecca .
from germany it takes about six hours .
reporter , not a pilgrim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali 's journey takes him from bonn to mecca .
yet my journey to mecca starts here in germany , the country i live and work in .
and i 'm deliberately not traveling as a religious pilgrim , but as a neutral journalistic reporter .
my main goal is to provide non-muslim users with insights into the hajj pilgrimage - just as i was once introduced to easter , christmas , and other christian feasts .
as you may know , according to saudi arabia 's interpretation of islam , only muslims may visit the holy city of mecca .
however , it is allowed to let non-muslims know about it .
this is what i want to do as i tell you about my impressions , discoveries , and encounters with pilgrims from all over the world - and particularly from germany .
even many muslims know little more about the hajj than the pictures they get on television , which show religious rites and crowds pouring in .
i 'm sure that there 's a lot to find out about the hajj - so wo n't you join me on my journey of discovery ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : praying at the mosque in mecca would you like to know how , exactly , the religious rituals are performed ?
what safety measures are taken ?
whether men and women go on their pilgrimage together ?
or whether conflicts between moderate and radical political groups in the islamic world influence the festivities ?
honestly , i do n't know many of the answers to these questions myself .
but whatever you may want to learn , i 'll try to find it out for you !
please post your questions and suggestions on deutsche welle 's facebook page : http : / / www.facebook.com / deutschewelle even though i will visit mecca as a journalist , this is anything but a " typical " reporting assignement to me .
maybe it 's like a catholic-raised journalist reporting from the vatican : you 're keeping a distance and reporting neutrally , but somehow the subject moves you more than , say , a piece about the latest tax reform .
learning about prophets , and people so i ca n't keep all my childhood memories separated from my thoughts about , and preparation for , my first trip to mecca .
specifically , my religion class in taiz , the town i was born in , comes to my mind .
they taught us that god is in heaven watching us .
that jews and christians share a lot of prophets with muslims except the last prophet and messenger of god : muhammad .
that the citizens of mecca once chased muhammad out of the city .
and that muhammad returned to mecca eight years later and destroyed the statues of false gods that had been built .
as a little boy i was deeply impressed and shaped by these religious basics .
today they inextricably belong to my personal cultural heritage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : our reporter hails from taiz , in yemen of course , at school , i also learned about the five religious duties of every muslim , the so-called five pillars of islam .
the hajj is one of them - a spiritual journey that is to be performed by every muslim who is healthy enough and can afford to do so .
examining my picture of saudi arabia i also want to examine my personal picture of saudi arabia - which is closely linked to my yemeni descent .
there were times when yemenis were allowed to enter the country without a visa .
older men , such as my grandfather , used to go on business trips to the country next door and bring us back precious presents .
but there was also a time - when saudi arabia and yemen were at serious odds about the kuwait war - that saudi arabian leaders expelled hundreds of thousands of yemeni " guest workers " from the country .
during this period , unemployment and poverty increased dramatically in yemen , and the number of students in my class went from 20 to 120 .
that is when i realized that islamic virtues such as solidarity and brotherhood can vanish into thin air when politics come into play .
and that a common belief does n't prevent people from committing human-rights violations .
i wonder what kind of experiences i will have in mecca ?
maybe they 'll be very different from what i expect .

the greek finance ministry has said it has narrowly missed its january-october target to reduce its budget deficit .
the unwelcome news comes as the eu said it would take action to support ireland , if needed . the greek public deficit has fallen sharply since the implementation of an eu-imf rescue package for the debt-stricken country , but efforts to reduce the shortfall have still fallen short of the targets set for this year .
greece , struggling with a huge public deficit , came close to default in may and had to be bailed out with a 110-billion-euro package arranged by the eu and international monetary fund .
through october , greek public finances showed a deficit of some 17.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 24 billion -rrb- , down 30 percent from the same period a year ago , but still less than the 32 percent target .
the government in athens has implemented a series of draconian reforms aimed at restoring its financial credibility .
it cut spending by 7 percent , or four billion euros , but tax revenues only grew 3.7 percent , well short of the 2010 target of 13.7 percent .
at the same time as this announcement , the european union moved to reassure financial markets on thursday that it was ready to support ireland as the eurozone country 's debt woes made waves at the g20 summit in south korea .
ireland has worst deficit in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu is poised to help ireland too , barroso said concern about ireland is growing after irish bond yields soared to a record level of 8.28 percent on wednesday . as a result , european commission president jose manuel barroso found himself compelled to announce that the eu stood ready to help ireland " in case of need . "
" what is important now is that we have all the necessary instruments in place , " barroso said in the south korean capital , seoul , ahead of the g20 meeting .
" we are monitoring the situation in ireland on a permanent basis , " he added .
the rise in irish bond yields has unsettled investors and put the entire european bond market under serious strain .
ireland is trying to tackle the worst budget deficit in the eu and convince markets that it does not need a greek-style bailout .

but only a few come to remember the german soldiers who died on flanders fields in wwi . a bugle sounded across flanders fields on thursday .
the " last post " used to mark the end of a day on the battlefields and still today it is played as a haunting reminder of the hundreds of thousands of men who laid down their lives along this stretch of the western front during world war i. wreaths of blood-red poppies will be laid at the foot of rows upon rows of white headstones in the commonwealth cemeteries .
but one war memorial will remain silent and empty on armistice day .
the langemark cemetery is the final resting place of 44,294 german soldiers .
more than half of them are buried in one mass grave , the kameraden grab , their names etched on large dark plaques running alongside the site .
" it 's a tragedy that hardly anyone comes here .
least of all the germans themselves , many of whom know very little about what happened , " andre de bruin , a world war i guide and founder of over the top tours , told deutsche welle .
two million german casualties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on some of the cemeteries , not even headstones were permitted andre points to rows of gravestones that lie flat on the ground , explaining : " belgium imposed very strict restrictions on german memorials .
headstones were not allowed to stand , not like those of the commonwealth soldiers and there were many other rules that applied only to germans . "
there were hundreds of burial sites of german soldiers after 1918 but in the 1950s , belgium ordered that the bodies be regrouped in no more than four sites , of which langemark is one .
" it was probably done out of hatred for what happened , especially during world war ii when belgium was occupied .
they even forbade the use of crosses above the headstones , " de bruin said .
germany lost nearly two million men in the first world war , the greatest number of casualties suffered by any nation .
yet for decades , this chapter of history was hardly taught at german schools .
today , the care of german memorials in western flanders , where some of the bloodiest battles took place , is carried out by a voluntary association , the german war graves commission , and its grounds are tended by students .
at the back of langemark , rain-sodden fields stretch ahead , the same ground that turned into a giant , water-clogged inferno of craters and trenches almost a century ago .
it is here that 3,000 german students were killed in 1914 .
" they had received just six weeks basic training before they were sent to the front to accompany german soldiers in what was meant to be a triumphant march to victory .
but they were all killed in the ensuing battles , " andre explained .
" these men died in the same horrific battles as everyone here and yet on armistice day they will lie mostly unremembered , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flanders saw some of wwi 's bloodiest battles only few visitors from germany only a tiny number of germans come to this part of belgium whereas thousands come to visit the commonwealth graves from as far away as australia .
a visitors ' book at langemark shows that most visitors are british school children , who visit the site as part of their trips around ypres .
" we always bring the children here as part of our tours of the world war i sites .
we feel that german families mourned their dead just as british or belgian families would have done , " leonie giles , a teacher at st nicholas school in north-west england , told deutsche welle .
a colleague added that " the aura here is very different , it 's very somber compared to the pristine white cemeteries where the british are buried , which are more like english gardens .
but we want our kids to realize that these soldiers were just like the british who died for king and country . "
simon , a thirteen-year old carrying a small wooden cross with a poppy , said : " it 's so vast , that mass grave .
and it 's such a sad place .
i feel very emotional . "
remains of soldiers are still found in this area every year , and these are added to the mass grave .
but these days , their burials are done with full military honors and are attended by officials from germany and belgium - a sign perhaps that , in time , more recognition will be given to these men who volunteered to lay down their lives .
" deutschland muss leben auch wenn wir sterben muessen , " reads the plaque above their graves .
germany must live even if we must die .

the report says corruption both affected cost for business development but also crippled countries in efforts to ward off poverty as money used in corrupt payments was not being spent on job creation .
sri mulyani indrawati , world bank managing director said the consequences of corruption also go beyond simply the economic impact .
" over time it becomes a real barrier to development , innovation and business growth because sometimes the corruption is in the form of counterfeit drugs so better don ’ t get better or they die , " he said .
" sometime corruption is a building that collapses in the face of national disaster because the quality inspector took a payment from the construction contractor to falsify an inspection .
corruption can kill . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva says there is no " good corruption " no " good corruption " but sri mulyani , a former indonesian finance minister , in comments seen as targeting indonesian politicians who resisted reforms while she was minister said while progress had been made in curbing corruption in indonesia , there was still much to do .
" i see the transformation in my own country , " said sri mulyani . " it is true there is much to be done still .
corruption remains intertwined with politics and there are brazen attacks on those fighting corruption .
we are not alone in that regard .
nonetheless , corruption is an issue that no politician can ignore in indonesia . "
thailand ’ s prime minister abhisit vejjajiva , said despite efforts in thailand corruption remained endemic and was widely accepted within the community : " significantly , even today young people in my country tell me that they expect to see corruption everywhere .
an unbelievable percentage of people also say it is ok for politicians to be corrupt as long as they are capable of bringing economic prosperity .
rampant corruption can exist amid high economic growth .
citizens must be prudently aware that there is no such thing as ' good corruption ' . "
reports put the annual cost of corruption in thailand at around $ 3.0 billion a year .
in a local initiative , more than two dozen thai companies agreed to form a collective alliance to work against corruption .
the directors ’ institute says as many as 200 companies can be expected to join the alliance by next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian protesters demanded that the president should quit over two corruption scandals corruption contributes to inequality but for asian development bank president , haruhiko kuroda , the economic costs of corruption have a wider impact on the community .
" corruption is a tax on the poor , " he said . " corruption and weak governance in general undermine government revenues resulting in poor infrastructure and hinders the pace of poverty reduction .
it also contributes to inequalities in access to education , health , infrastructure and other productive assets .
and it is the poor and the vulnerable that inevitably bear the brunt . "
u.s. secretary of state hilary clinton , in a pre-recorded video statement , stressed the wider impact of corruption from business , politics , and democracy and as a factor in causing malnutrition .
but officials say while the issue of corruption was more openly discussed and legislation strengthened , enforcement remained a problem .
also for many countries where corruption remained rampant there was still some way to go to reduce its impact across societies .

the construction group acs handed in its offer to german financial supervisors bafin , which now has 15 days to deliberate . spain 's largest construction group acs presented its offer for german rival hochtief to germany 's financial supervisory authority bafin on thursday .
bafin now has 15 days to rule on the takeover bid , and hochtief shareholders then have a further four weeks to decide whether to accept the offer .
acs , which already holds just under 30 percent of hochtief , germany 's largest public works construction company , wants to take a controlling stake in the business .
it is seeking an all-share swap to create what would become one of the world 's leading construction firms .
however , acs has offered a price below hochtief 's current market value of around 4.3 billion euros -lrb- 5.9 billion dollars -rrb- , which hochtief sees as unfair .
preventative strategies herbert luetkestratkoetter , head of hochtief , said the company considers the acs bid to be hostile and is " definitely " planning further strategic action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees protested against acs in october hochtief 's chief financial officer burkard lohr refused to rule out a capital increase or a convertible loan to refinance the company .
both measures would increase the number of hochtief shares and thus make a takeover bid more difficult .
another option is for essen-based hochtief to puts its subsidiary concessions on the stock market , even if it means separating itself from that part of its business . concessions ' main activity is the operation of airports and toll-roads .
at the same time the german firm is trying to force the spanish group to make a bid for hochtief 's australian subsidiary leighton , thereby increasing the price , and possibly discouraging acs .
acs could instead carry out a capital increase of 78.5 million euros -lrb- 107.6 million dollars -rrb- , which is to be approved during an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on november 19 .

they claimed that the power-sharing deal they had been presented with was not being honoured and that three of the party 's most senior members , barred for their alleged ties to saddam 's baath party , had not been reinstated as promised . as well as the annulment of the bans against the three iraqiya members , iraqiya had presented a further three conditions on which its participation in the power-sharing agreement would hinge : a bill forming the security body , a committee examining cases against political detainees , and codifying the power-sharing deal . iraqiya 's support for any government is seen a hugely important if iraq is not to descend into ethnic violence once more .
the sunni arab minority , which gave iraqiya a narrow victory in the contested march 7 poll , provided the heaviest resistance in the anti-us insurgency after the 2003 invasion .
its involvement in any coalition is imperative if peace is to be achieved . iraqiya 's apparent rejection of the deal highlights the fierce divides and rivalries which have paralysed the iraqi political system since the fall of saddam hussein regime .
the deal , clinched late wednesday night after three days of high-pressure talks between the rival factions , saw shiite prime minister al-maliki returning to office for a second term . talabani , a kurd , is expected to retain the presidency .
and a sunni mp was to be elected as speaker of parliament .
maliki now has 30 days to form his cabinet , and the next parliamentary meeting is scheduled for saturday .
the decision offered hope that the next government would include enough sunni representation to lower the chances of a return to the sectarian violence that killed tens of thousands of people after the 2003 , u.s.-led invasion that ousted sunni dictator saddam hussein .
iraqiya , who had held out for months to take the premiership from maliki after it narrowly won more seats in the march election , initially confirmed it had finally signed up to the deal .
us praises deal the obama administration called the development " a big step forward for iraq . " " all along we 've said the best result would be a government that reflects the results of the elections , includes all the major blocs representing iraq 's ethnic and sectarian groups , and that does not exclude or marginalize anyone .
that 's exactly what iraqis seem to have agreed to , " antony blinken , national security adviser to us vice president joe biden , said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi prime minister ayad allawi 's group finally agreed to the deal iraq has been without a new government since the vote , which gave iraqiya two more seats than maliki 's bloc .
neither had enough for a majority in parliament , leaving the factions to negotiate a government .
iraqiya initially joined a kurdish alliance in supporting maliki following months of contentious negotiations which raised tensions in iraq as the army and police try to cement security gains against a stubborn insurgency .
last month , maliki toured capitals in the region - from iran and syria to turkey and egypt - to gain regional backing for his effort to stay in power .
he offered arab nations investment deals in iraq in exchange for nudging iraqiya toward a compromise , political sources said .
court pressure paid off over the past months , iraqiya repeatedly rejected another maliki term and demanded the right to form the government as the top vote winner in the election .
parliament met briefly in june but lawmakers said they needed more time to decide who would hold the highest offices .
last month , iraq 's high court ordered parliament to resume its sessions , putting pressure on politicians to expedite a deal .
the long deadlock has fueled tension even though the sectarian carnage unleashed after the 2003 invasion is receding while u.s. forces prepare to withdraw in 2011 .
a series of attacks on christian targets across baghdad on wednesday stirred renewed fear in the minority community .
the bomb and mortar blasts occurred just 10 days after a bloody siege at a catholic cathedral that killed 52 .

mongolia as part of its brand can say , ' we will honor our contracts and not violate the wto by embargoing exports ' . "
and it is not only rare earths that make mongolia attractive .
a little over a year ago , the mongolian government signed a four billion mining deal with a canadian-based company and its anglo-australian partner .
the companies will jointly develop a project in a location thought to hold one of the world 's largest copper and gold reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gold mine in mongolia the us as " a third neighbor " the us , green says , can play a critical role in helping mongolia 's security and economy by being a " third neighbor " – in addition to china and russia – that helps to " galvanize broader relationships for mongolia throughout the world " .
one reason is democracy .
as recently as 20 years ago , mongolia achieved its independence from the ussr through a peaceful democratic revolution .
" mongolia sits in a belt of poor governance and democracy , stretching from beijing to russia - where despite what was said about some economic success , let 's face it : russian democracy is going backwards – to central asia , to belarus , " explains michael green .
" you really have to go thousands and thousands of miles from ulan bator in some directions before you find a functioning democracy that is as successful , despite challenges , as mongolia .
and that is an example that should be important to the us and the west . "
batchimeg migeddorj , national security advisor to the president of mongolia , attributes it to the special circumstances that mongolia was able to develop a democracy .
he says : " exactly during that time , in the nineties , our two neighbors , china and russia , were concentrating more on internal affairs .
that provided mongolias politicians and political parties with more room to work internally to stabilize institutions . "

mongolia has sent troops to iraq that have been very effective , according to green , " taking risks a lot of nato countries are n't willing to take in terms of being in the line of fire " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us president bush on a visit to mongolia " today , mongolia has about a platoon , helping with perimeter security for the germans in afghanistan , " says green .
he argues that mongolia has more credibility in demanding transparency from china 's military .
at the same time , he says , the us can not compete with russia and china , so the americans have a strong interest that mongolia develops strong ties with other democratic countries like japan ; korea , the eu , india .
colonel munch-ochir dorjjugder , who served as the director for international cooperation of the mongolian ministry of defense and is now a fellow at the brookings institution , rejects the negative assessment that mongolia is " torn " between russia and china .
nevertheless , he observes mongolia 's " identity dilemma " between northeast-asia and eurasia but comes to the conclusion : " we can promote both agendas as our regional identity .
our culture and our background compels us to do so , our current geographic location compels us to do so , as does our good neighborly relations with russia and china and our interest in seeking third neighbors elsewhere . "
seeking options besides china but mongolia is trying to seek more independence from china .
despite the fact that most of the country 's mineral resources are close to the chinese border , the mongolian government decided to develop a railway infrastructure within the country and towards the russian border rather than towards china .
80 percent of imported goods already come through china , dorjjugder says , and since china occasionally closes its borders or restricts exports , the decision will keep alternatives open .

"
at the same time , she says , mongolians are looking at the central asian states and on to iran and turkey as well as to the fast rising india .
they could play an alternative role in balancing both china and russia .
and in 2010 , iranian delegations have been buying mongolian meat and animal byproducts .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gold mine in mongolia the us as " a third neighbor " the us , green says , can play a critical role in helping mongolia 's security and economy by being a " third neighbor " – in addition to china and russia – that helps to " galvanize broader relationships for mongolia throughout the world " .
one reason is democracy .
as recently as 20 years ago , mongolia achieved its independence from the ussr through a peaceful democratic revolution .
" mongolia sits in a belt of poor governance and democracy , stretching from beijing to russia - where despite what was said about some economic success , let 's face it : russian democracy is going backwards – to central asia , to belarus , " explains michael green .
" you really have to go thousands and thousands of miles from ulan bator in some directions before you find a functioning democracy that is as successful , despite challenges , as mongolia .
and that is an example that should be important to the us and the west . "
batchimeg migeddorj , national security advisor to the president of mongolia , attributes it to the special circumstances that mongolia was able to develop a democracy .
he says : " exactly during that time , in the nineties , our two neighbors , china and russia , were concentrating more on internal affairs .
that provided mongolias politicians and political parties with more room to work internally to stabilize institutions . "
sending troops to afghanistan but besides being a model democracy , there is more .
mongolia has sent troops to iraq that have been very effective , according to green , " taking risks a lot of nato countries are n't willing to take in terms of being in the line of fire " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us president bush on a visit to mongolia " today , mongolia has about a platoon , helping with perimeter security for the germans in afghanistan , " says green .
he argues that mongolia has more credibility in demanding transparency from china 's military .
at the same time , he says , the us can not compete with russia and china , so the americans have a strong interest that mongolia develops strong ties with other democratic countries like japan ; korea , the eu , india .
colonel munch-ochir dorjjugder , who served as the director for international cooperation of the mongolian ministry of defense and is now a fellow at the brookings institution , rejects the negative assessment that mongolia is " torn " between russia and china .
nevertheless , he observes mongolia 's " identity dilemma " between northeast-asia and eurasia but comes to the conclusion : " we can promote both agendas as our regional identity .
our culture and our background compels us to do so , our current geographic location compels us to do so , as does our good neighborly relations with russia and china and our interest in seeking third neighbors elsewhere . "
seeking options besides china but mongolia is trying to seek more independence from china .
despite the fact that most of the country 's mineral resources are close to the chinese border , the mongolian government decided to develop a railway infrastructure within the country and towards the russian border rather than towards china .
80 percent of imported goods already come through china , dorjjugder says , and since china occasionally closes its borders or restricts exports , the decision will keep alternatives open .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out after the parliamentary election in 2008 mongolia 's new security concept is also a reaction to china 's challenge , says dr. alicia campi , president of the us-mongolia advisory group .
" while certainly mongolia does not want to lose its vigorous democracy and free market , and return to cold war era satellite status , policy makers increasingly are thinking that inviting much more sizable russian fdi -lrb- foreign direct investment -rrb- and military assistance are not bad ideas at all since western nations have so far proven slow to act and disappointing . "
at the same time , she says , mongolians are looking at the central asian states and on to iran and turkey as well as to the fast rising india .
they could play an alternative role in balancing both china and russia .
and in 2010 , iranian delegations have been buying mongolian meat and animal byproducts .
nobody should be surprised , says campi , if the iranians are examining options for investing in mongolia 's mineral sector .
this would give the us another reason to strengthen their ties with mongolia .

extraction would be expensive , but there is interest in the us as well as in japan in working with mongolia to extract these resources , says dr. michael j. green .
he served as senior director for asian affairs at the national security council under president george w. bush .
speaking at an event of the jamestown foundation in washington dc , green says : " this is an opportunity for mongolia to refocus .
around this can be built some bilateral or multilateral investment guarantees , things that china does n't do .
mongolia as part of its brand can say , ' we will honor our contracts and not violate the wto by embargoing exports ' . "
and it is not only rare earths that make mongolia attractive .

each year , november 11 marks the kick-off of carnival in cologne . november tends to be dreary in germany 's rhineland region , but the city of cologne looks forward to one bright spot in the month each year .
on november 11 - at exactly 11:11 a.m. - carnival begins !
on the mid-november day , it 's perfectly normal to leave the house in the morning and run across people in all sorts of costumes along the way .
they 're often heading downtown , loaded up with beer and liquor and ready to meet up with other revelers to get the festival started .
carnival is more than just a tradition in the city ; it 's part of cologne 's cultural identity .
bildunterschrift : clown costumes are a favorite , but everything from witches to cows to politicians also hits the streets carnival has its origins in a number of different eras .
ancient greeks and romans honored the god dionysos with a festival featuring " women , wine and song . "
germanic tribes also celebrated the shift to winter as a way of driving away wicked winter demons .
christianity took on the custom later in order to usher in lent .
the latin root , " carne vale , " of the german term " karneval " roughly translates to " farewell to meat . "
rose monday these days , the festival in cologne is organized and hosted by over 100 local carnival associations .
the associations host events during the year 's so-called " fifth season " featuring all sorts of entertainment , from music and dancing to witty political commentary .
in february each year , the world-famous rose monday parade rounds out the carnival season .
hundreds of thousands of visitors head to cologne to party for days and participate in the parades .
november 11 is when the fun gets started , but - except for the members of the carnival associations - the festival remains largely out of sight through the holiday season .

the greek finance ministry has said it has narrowly missed its january-october target to reduce its budget deficit .
the unwelcome news comes as the eu said it would take action to support ireland , if needed . the greek public deficit has fallen sharply since the implementation of an eu-imf rescue package for the debt-stricken country , but efforts to reduce the shortfall have still fallen short of the targets set for this year .
greece , struggling with a huge public deficit , came close to default in may and had to be bailed out with a 110-billion-euro package arranged by the eu and international monetary fund .
through october , greek public finances showed a deficit of some 17.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 24 billion -rrb- , down 30 percent from the same period a year ago , but still less than the 32 percent target .
the government in athens has implemented a series of draconian reforms aimed at restoring its financial credibility .
it cut spending by 7 percent , or four billion euros , but tax revenues only grew 3.7 percent , well short of the 2010 target of 13.7 percent .
at the same time as this announcement , the european union moved to reassure financial markets on thursday that it was ready to support ireland as the eurozone country 's debt woes made waves at the g20 summit in south korea .

but only a few come to remember the german soldiers who died on flanders fields in wwi . a bugle sounded across flanders fields on thursday .
the " last post " used to mark the end of a day on the battlefields and still today it is played as a haunting reminder of the hundreds of thousands of men who laid down their lives along this stretch of the western front during world war i. wreaths of blood-red poppies will be laid at the foot of rows upon rows of white headstones in the commonwealth cemeteries .
but one war memorial will remain silent and empty on armistice day .
the langemark cemetery is the final resting place of 44,294 german soldiers .
more than half of them are buried in one mass grave , the kameraden grab , their names etched on large dark plaques running alongside the site .
" it 's a tragedy that hardly anyone comes here .
least of all the germans themselves , many of whom know very little about what happened , " andre de bruin , a world war i guide and founder of over the top tours , told deutsche welle .
two million german casualties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on some of the cemeteries , not even headstones were permitted andre points to rows of gravestones that lie flat on the ground , explaining : " belgium imposed very strict restrictions on german memorials .
headstones were not allowed to stand , not like those of the commonwealth soldiers and there were many other rules that applied only to germans . "
there were hundreds of burial sites of german soldiers after 1918 but in the 1950s , belgium ordered that the bodies be regrouped in no more than four sites , of which langemark is one .
" it was probably done out of hatred for what happened , especially during world war ii when belgium was occupied .
they even forbade the use of crosses above the headstones , " de bruin said .
germany lost nearly two million men in the first world war , the greatest number of casualties suffered by any nation .
yet for decades , this chapter of history was hardly taught at german schools .
today , the care of german memorials in western flanders , where some of the bloodiest battles took place , is carried out by a voluntary association , the german war graves commission , and its grounds are tended by students .
at the back of langemark , rain-sodden fields stretch ahead , the same ground that turned into a giant , water-clogged inferno of craters and trenches almost a century ago .
it is here that 3,000 german students were killed in 1914 .
" they had received just six weeks basic training before they were sent to the front to accompany german soldiers in what was meant to be a triumphant march to victory .
but they were all killed in the ensuing battles , " andre explained .
" these men died in the same horrific battles as everyone here and yet on armistice day they will lie mostly unremembered , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flanders saw some of wwi 's bloodiest battles only few visitors from germany only a tiny number of germans come to this part of belgium whereas thousands come to visit the commonwealth graves from as far away as australia .
a visitors ' book at langemark shows that most visitors are british school children , who visit the site as part of their trips around ypres .
" we always bring the children here as part of our tours of the world war i sites .
we feel that german families mourned their dead just as british or belgian families would have done , " leonie giles , a teacher at st nicholas school in north-west england , told deutsche welle .
a colleague added that " the aura here is very different , it 's very somber compared to the pristine white cemeteries where the british are buried , which are more like english gardens .
but we want our kids to realize that these soldiers were just like the british who died for king and country . "
simon , a thirteen-year old carrying a small wooden cross with a poppy , said : " it 's so vast , that mass grave .
and it 's such a sad place .
i feel very emotional . "
remains of soldiers are still found in this area every year , and these are added to the mass grave .

they say they ’ re willing to go to the highest european court . tom freeman and katherine doyle are a heterosexual couple applying for a civil partnership – a form of legal union available only to same-sex couples .
they are one of four heterosexual couples and four same-sex couples trying to challenge the current uk legislation on marriage and civil partnerships .
" initially our aim was equality but increasingly as we look critically at marriage , we feel it is not relevant to us , " katherine doyle told deutsche welle .
" we really do want a civil partnership .
in our day-to-day lives we are more like partners . "
" the important question for us is : why should n't we have a civil partnership , " her partner tom added .
" the institution is being provided for by law so why should n't i have one ? "
gay couples in britain have been allowed to enter into civil partnerships since 2004 , which gives them all the same legal rights and responsibilities as a civil marriage . however they are denied a civil marriage certificate .
on the other hand heterosexual couples do not qualify to enter a civil partnership .
they can either get married or not .
a violation of human rights ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom freeman and katherine doyle are prepared to fight for years working alongside the gay rights group outrage , the eight couples argue that denying each group the legal rights of the other is discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation , something which is contrary to britain 's human rights act . yet tom and katherine 's application has been refused so far .
all they got was a short statement from the town hall , saying that " a civil partnership is a relationship between two people of the same sex . "
the eight couples are one by one each week applying to their local town halls for either a marriage certificate , or a civil partnership certificate , whichever is denied them by law .
at the end of two months , if all applications are turned down , as they are expected to be , the couples will begin a high court challenge . it is the first time that heterosexual couples have taken such an active role in a campaign which at first glance might appear to benefit gay couples wanting equality and a full marriage .
all the way to the european court of human rights the civil partnerships act of 2004 was introduced by the then labour government with wide support in parliament .
it gives same-sex couples the same legal rights and responsibilities as civil marriage .
there also is a formal process for dissolving partnerships which is akin to divorce , but gay rights activists still criticize that it does n't grant full marriage status to gay couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil partnerships exist in most eu member states " when all eight couples - gay and straight - have filed their applications and have been refused we 'll then consult with our legal advisers with a view to bringing the case to the courts , " peter tatchell of the group outrage , which is leading the equal love campaign , told deutsche welle .
" there ’ s a very strong argument that the twin bans on gay marriages and heterosexual civil partnerships are illegal under the human rights act , " he added .
tatchell says the group is prepared to take the case all the way to the european court of human rights if necessary . public opinion backs gay marriage in response to the campaign , the government has issued a statement saying that it is currently considering the next steps for civil partnerships . it said that earlier this year ministers met with people and organizations holding a range of views and that they are looking at the best way to take those views forward . the equal love campaign argues that public attitudes have shifted strongly in favor of allowing gay couples to marry , citing an opinion poll carried out by the group populus in june 2009 , which found that 61 percent of the public believe gay couples should be allowed to marry , while 33 percent disagreed . however , if there is a change in the law , it is not likely to come soon .
" it could take five to ten years to go through the courts , " said katherine doyle .
" but we really feel that we ca n't commit to marriage when it 's exclusive . "

let me introduce myself - i 'm ali .
ali almakhlafi .
i 'm a journalist from yemen . i live in germany .
i 'm 31 years old .
i 'm muslim .
and i 've never been to mecca in my entire life .
even though , when considered from distance , i was born and spent the first 19 years of my life " right next door . " yemen is the poorest country of the arabian peninsula and has a common border with saudi arabia – one of the richest countries of the region and guardian of islam 's holy sites .
from yemen 's capital , sana 'a , it 's about a 90-minute flight from there to mecca .
from germany it takes about six hours .
reporter , not a pilgrim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali 's journey takes him from bonn to mecca .
yet my journey to mecca starts here in germany , the country i live and work in .
and i 'm deliberately not traveling as a religious pilgrim , but as a neutral journalistic reporter .
my main goal is to provide non-muslim users with insights into the hajj pilgrimage - just as i was once introduced to easter , christmas , and other christian feasts .
as you may know , according to saudi arabia 's interpretation of islam , only muslims may visit the holy city of mecca .
however , it is allowed to let non-muslims know about it .
this is what i want to do as i tell you about my impressions , discoveries , and encounters with pilgrims from all over the world - and particularly from germany .
even many muslims know little more about the hajj than the pictures they get on television , which show religious rites and crowds pouring in .
i 'm sure that there 's a lot to find out about the hajj - so wo n't you join me on my journey of discovery ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : praying at the mosque in mecca would you like to know how , exactly , the religious rituals are performed ?
what safety measures are taken ?
whether men and women go on their pilgrimage together ?
or whether conflicts between moderate and radical political groups in the islamic world influence the festivities ?
honestly , i do n't know many of the answers to these questions myself .
but whatever you may want to learn , i 'll try to find it out for you !
please post your questions and suggestions on deutsche welle 's facebook page : http : / / www.facebook.com / deutschewelle even though i will visit mecca as a journalist , this is anything but a " typical " reporting assignement to me .
maybe it 's like a catholic-raised journalist reporting from the vatican : you 're keeping a distance and reporting neutrally , but somehow the subject moves you more than , say , a piece about the latest tax reform .
learning about prophets , and people so i ca n't keep all my childhood memories separated from my thoughts about , and preparation for , my first trip to mecca .
specifically , my religion class in taiz , the town i was born in , comes to my mind .
they taught us that god is in heaven watching us .
that jews and christians share a lot of prophets with muslims except the last prophet and messenger of god : muhammad .
that the citizens of mecca once chased muhammad out of the city .
and that muhammad returned to mecca eight years later and destroyed the statues of false gods that had been built .
as a little boy i was deeply impressed and shaped by these religious basics .
today they inextricably belong to my personal cultural heritage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : our reporter hails from taiz , in yemen of course , at school , i also learned about the five religious duties of every muslim , the so-called five pillars of islam .
the hajj is one of them - a spiritual journey that is to be performed by every muslim who is healthy enough and can afford to do so .
examining my picture of saudi arabia i also want to examine my personal picture of saudi arabia - which is closely linked to my yemeni descent .
there were times when yemenis were allowed to enter the country without a visa .

let me introduce myself - i 'm ali .
ali almakhlafi .
i 'm a journalist from yemen . i live in germany .
i 'm 31 years old .
i 'm muslim .
and i 've never been to mecca in my entire life .
even though , when considered from distance , i was born and spent the first 19 years of my life " right next door . " yemen is the poorest country of the arabian peninsula and has a common border with saudi arabia – one of the richest countries of the region and guardian of islam 's holy sites .
from yemen 's capital , sana 'a , it 's about a 90-minute flight from there to mecca .
from germany it takes about six hours .
reporter , not a pilgrim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali 's journey takes him from bonn to mecca .
yet my journey to mecca starts here in germany , the country i live and work in .
and i 'm deliberately not traveling as a religious pilgrim , but as a neutral journalistic reporter .
my main goal is to provide non-muslim users with insights into the hajj pilgrimage - just as i was once introduced to easter , christmas , and other christian feasts .
as you may know , according to saudi arabia 's interpretation of islam , only muslims may visit the holy city of mecca .
however , it is allowed to let non-muslims know about it .
this is what i want to do as i tell you about my impressions , discoveries , and encounters with pilgrims from all over the world - and particularly from germany .
even many muslims know little more about the hajj than the pictures they get on television , which show religious rites and crowds pouring in .
i 'm sure that there 's a lot to find out about the hajj - so wo n't you join me on my journey of discovery ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : praying at the mosque in mecca would you like to know how , exactly , the religious rituals are performed ?
what safety measures are taken ?
whether men and women go on their pilgrimage together ?
or whether conflicts between moderate and radical political groups in the islamic world influence the festivities ?
honestly , i do n't know many of the answers to these questions myself .
but whatever you may want to learn , i 'll try to find it out for you !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 11.11.2010 private tutoring goes global großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students and their tutors communicate via an online blackboard a uk company has started outsourcing math tuition for pupils aged seven to 16 to graduates recruited and trained in india - and british primary schools are beginning to sign up for the online offer in increasing numbers . brightspark offers the one-to-one tuition via skype .
it is designed to help children who might be struggling in school , as well as stretch high-achievers . nick treloar , a 15-year-old student at the french lycée in london , used to have a tutor come to the house .
but he finds the online tuition a more flexible alternative . " it 's a whenever-you-want system , " nick said .
" you can book the session for any time of day .
it 's you that says ' i want this hour to this hour . '
it 's your choice , so whenever you have a free period during the day , or you finish an hour earlier , then you can come home , and sit down and do this session . " nick 's tutor nathan is based thousands of miles away , in ludhiana , india .
nick has never even seen what his tutor looks like .
but he can hear him , as he guides nick through math problems on a white board that they can both see and write on - a more effective method than simply chatting with a camera on skype . a manageable structure nathan speaks fluent american english from having tutored us students online .
he is 31 years old , and has a five-year-old daughter .
he earns about eight euros -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- an hour , which he says is more than double what many people his age are earning in other professions in india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nathan carries out his work from punjab for him , tutoring is not just about the money , though , but the love of mentoring students and shaping their future .
nathan holds a master 's degree in mathematics and he has been handpicked and trained for the job .
he had already been tutoring american school kids via the web for three years before joining brightspark .
he said he was impressed with british students . " it 's a much better level with uk students , and often with some subjects , they start them much younger , " nathan said . the time difference between the uk and india is four-and-a-half hours , which nathan said is manageable .
he said if a british student books the latest session available , at 9 pm in the uk , it is 1:30 am in ludhiana . nathan is currently part of a team of 30 tutors .
but the company expects to grow to 100 tutors - all working out of small office booths with laptops and skype headsets . lack of specialists british demand for online math tutorials is growing , according to brightspark education chief tom hooper .
he saw an acute need in britain for specialized math tuition for struggling school kids , and introduced indian online tutors after seeing the project work in the us . one british primary school is already using the online tutorials in class to support the teacher - and there are more schools in the pipeline .
hooper is also working with charities in deprived areas and housing estates by introducing the online tutorials to drop-in centers , where mothers can drop their kids off , for an hour 's session at a computer terminal . he says there is a shocking lack of specialist math teachers in britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tutors are virtual at brightspark " only 11 percent of teachers have a degree in the subject they teach , and only eight percent have any training , " hooper said .
" we thought by going to india , we could bring in a level of academic talent that is 100 percent related to math and a 100 percent trained .
that 's why we are seeing a benefit for our students . " hooper also said it 's not just british children who need help . " there are distinct problems among elements of the adult population who have very low numeracy skills , which creates problems socially , but also for unemployed people who want to re-engage with the workforce , " he said . the tutoring industry in britain is completely unregulated , according to hooper .
the company therefore introduced its own strict standards for data protection , assuring their clients their data are closely guarded .
students often get a different tutor with every new session , and the tutors know nothing about them , except their name . with plans to expand the online tutoring business to other subjects , hooper rejects the accusation that indians are somehow taking away british teaching jobs . " i strongly reject that allegation , " he said .
" we are not outsourcing british jobs ; we are in-sourcing specialist skills . " progress is visible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nick likes the flexibility of online tutoring for nick 's father phil , the online tutoring helps him monitor his son 's progress .
he can see how many sessions nick is booking , because he pays for them - and he can see tangible results in nick 's math scores . " we are able to see his progress , and it makes him much more open to be able to tell us which areas he is dropping back in and needs help , " phil said . an online tutor from india costs clients on average of 13 euros an hour .
a tutor in person can cost up to 46 euros - three times as much .
with that price difference , and specialist math tutors on offer , the company said they expect more students like nick to sign up . author : nina-maria potts / sms editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on two separate occasions the tabloid , which is in no way related to the us music magazine of the same name , has printed the identities and addresses of alleged homosexuals .
the campaign launched in october under the headline banner " 100 pictures of uganda 's top homos leak - hang them " has so far outed 29 people .
several of them have since been subjected to harassment and threats from members of the public .
transgender stosh mugisha is among the victims .
biologically a woman but living as a man , the 33-year old 's life has drastically changed since his photograph appeared in the rolling stone " men of shame " gallery .
“ i went to the shop where i usually buy cigarettes , " mugisha told deutsche welle .
" the woman told me ' i do n't sell cigarettes to faggots ' , so i left . "
on his way home passers-by threw verbal abuse and even stones at him .
although he was not physically hurt , he has since had to move away for fear of a more serious attack .

" the main case comes up on november 23 , we shall challenge it , we shall defeat them , the interim order will be quashed , " he said .
in an editor 's note written to accompany the publication of his " men of shame part ii , " muhame cited his motivation for printing the pictures as an attempt to stop a " cross-section of heartless homosexuals " from recruiting and brainwashing unsuspecting kids into gay circles .
it is this allegation in particular that stosh mugisha found hurtful and distasteful .
" how do you recruit someone into something they do not want ? , " he asked . " homosexuality is inborn , you can not start it by going into schools , it 's not like you are looking for votes . ”
ethical issues but the editor begs to differ , and has said he will not quit his printing spree until members of the gay community " stop enrolling minors in their circles . "

where the situation goes from here will depend at least to some extent on whether or not the country 's media council , tasked with promoting responsible and ethical journalism , decides to issue rolling stone with a license .
peter mwesige , executive director of the african center for media excellence , said the council would have to be seriously outraged not to .
but given the debate in the country last year over the introduction of the death penalty for some homosexual acts , that outrage might be hard to come by .
" most people in the society we live in do not support the idea that homosexuals deserve any rights , " mwesige told deutsche welle .
although the council , which freedom house notes " has been criticized for its lack of independence , " has a code of ethics on issues such as invasion of privacy , the guidelines are regularly flouted and many a blind eye is turned .
just so long as there are no officials involved .
" the government does n't pay attention to ethics , " mwesige said .
" but when the stories are politically sensitive , it cares . "
spotlight on human rights that became blatantly obvious last year when the government , under president yoweri museveni , closed four radio stations on the grounds that they were inciting racial hatred .
besides curtailing press freedom , the " write-anything-about-anyone-but-nothing-about-me " modus operandi also highlights another problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the might of the government geoffrey wokulira ssebaggala , programs co-coordinator at human rights network for journalists in uganda , says one of the biggest challenges facing the country 's media today is the establishment of a culture of professionalism .
" people write about anything , and they do n't mind if it infringes on others ' rights , " ssebaggala told deutsche welle .
" those managing media in uganda have no knowledge of human rights . "
he says it is crucial to change the status quo , but that doing so will require a complete rethink on the parts of publishers , broadcasters , proprietors and most of all the government .
" there 's a lot that needs to be done , " he said .

it 's match day twelve in the bundesliga and after the abject failure of trying to summon voodoo spirits to do their bidding last week , the dw soccer pundits have resorted to less ghoulish methods . dw 's soccer pundits have been forming a fidgety queue outside the bathroom this week after downing enough tea to fill a swimming pool .
as well as causing numerous pairs of legs to cross , the experiment has also produced enough bundesliga result-shaped tea leaf formations to come up with the predictions for match day twelve .
amuse yourselves with these forecasts while we dash once again to the little boys room ...
saturday , nov 13 bremen – frankfurt oh dear .
just what is going on with werder bremen ?
esteemed colleague jefferson chase nailed it in his commentary this week – whatever 's gone wrong at bremen , it 'll need huge changes to fix it .
while wondering what was going to happen next was initially an endearing game of roulette , as the season wears on , it looks like bremen are playing the russian variety .
no guesses who 'll get the bullet if their form continues to nosedive .
frankfurt very well could be the team to load the gun .
prediction : frankfurt 2-1 wolfsburg – schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke edged closer to safety thanks to raul 's goals go on then , but just whisper it … schalke may have turned a corner .
there – i said it … which means , of course , that wolfsburg 's up-and-down season will ascend again to the detriment of felix magath 's struggling side on saturday .
the royal blues may have fired three past st. pauli to put them one point from safety but the hamburg club are quickly becoming easy pickings as their confidence dwindles .
wolfsburg will be a sterner test .
perhaps the training ground punch-ups suggest the wolves have the fight to come out on top in this one .
prediction : wolfsburg 3-2 cologne – moenchengladbach wake us up when this derby is over .
the two sides who manage to make schalke look good come together in this basement clash with little daylight between them in terms of points and class .
gladbach at least shocked the life out of bayern last week - which always raises a smile in these parts - but with cologne struggling to find anything resembling flair in any of their games to date , these two could blunder and bump against each other for 90 minutes and still not score .
hopefully one will manage it but it 's a coin toss .
heads it 's gladbach .
prediction : gladbach 1-0 kaiserslautern – stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ciprian marica led the way in the thrashing of bremen stuttgart will be nicely rested after last weekend 's game so kaiserslautern should beware .
vfb stuck six past bremen and then must have retired to a dark room to lie down .
despite the green shoots of recovery growing over at the mercedes benz arena , few would have tipped jens keller 's team to thrash werder so comprehensively -lrb- i certainly did n't -rrb- .
but then kaiserslautern looked impressive last week , even though they evenutally lost against in-form leverkusen . this one could prove quite entertaining to watch .
prediction : 2-2 st. pauli – leverkusen pauli continue to slide and it 's already looking like an inevitable one towards what many people think is their rightful place in the relegation zone .
the neutral will hope they can arrest the decline but taking on leverkusen may not be the best place to start .
bayer have been quietly efficient in rising to third place and will be looking to make up ground on mainz in the place above them .
on form alone , it looks as though pauli will be deeper in the mire come saturday night .
prediction : leverkusen 3-1 mainz – hanover mainz in crisis !
two defeats on the bounce !
how easy it is to forget what an achievement this season has already been for mainz .
it is n't only their position which is impressive but the way they 've gotten there .
okay , so freiburg should never have beaten them last week – but only in the context of mainz 's amazing form to date .
last season , this would n't have been such a shock .
losing or drawing with hanover would n't have been either but on the evidence of this campaign alone , one would expect mainz to triumph .
prediction : mainz 2-0 sunday , nov 14 hoffenheim – freiburg despite winning last week , hoffenheim still dropped down the league , giving the illusion that their title charge has already petered out .
do n't be fooled .
the pendulum of form is swinging in the hoff 's direction and a win over freiburg will see them back in the mix .
freiburg had a great result against mainz and will have to be completely free of the hangover to cope with the hoff at home .
expecting the freiburgers to be well up for it as usual , this could be a tight affair .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 bayern – nuremberg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern lost their heads against gladbach last weekend they still have n't quite got it right , have they ?
louis van gaal tore his team a new one after letting the points slip against bottom club gladbach last week and you would expect a reaction from the german champions against nuremberg on sunday .
but how many times has the gruff dutchman got all red in the face only to see his team go pale on the pitch ?
nuremberg cantered to a win against cologne last week and of course bayern , however dire , are the polar opposite of the boys for köln .
however , the bavarians are increasingly hard to fathom so – who knows ?

" we continue to support the goal of withdrawal , " westerwelle said during a parliamentary debate on thursday in berlin .
disarmament is going to be a " key issue " for germany at the lisbon meeting , the foreign minister said .
there are no official figures about the number of nuclear weapons stationed on german soil , but it is believed that perhaps 10 to 20 nuclear warheads from the us arsenal are stockpiled at the buechel air base in the state of rhineland-palatinate in southwestern germany .
russian cooperation government leaders and heads of state of the 28 nato member countries meet in the portuguese capital next week friday to discuss a major strategic overhaul of the military alliance .
a key element of nato 's new strategy to be decided upon in lisbon is a european missile-defense system .
in what westerwelle called an " historic gesture , " russia will be involved in the discussions .

" we want to improve our security alongside , not in confrontation with russia . "

westerwelle 's comments were viewed as indirect support for defense minister guttenberg , who recently made controversial remarks to the effect that germany should align its security policies with economic interests , like other countries do .
in response , the green party parliamentary leader , juergen trittin , accused guttenberg of pursuing " gunboat diplomacy . "
defending his position , guttenberg told parliament on thursday that the strategy was contained in a government white paper from 2006 when the opposition social democrats were still in a grand coalition with chancellor merkel 's christian democrats .
" there were no cries of outrage then , " guttenberg said , " but now comes the great wave of indignation . "
the issue of economic intervention is also expected to be on the agenda of the nato summit next week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 11.11.2010 new ' legal highs ' worry drug watchdogs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legal highs are often mixed to look similar to ecstasy the number of people using illegal drugs in germany and europe has very slightly increased , according to two annual reports .
however both reports warn about the increase in so-called legal highs . over five percent of germans say they have taken some kind of illegal drug during the previous 12 months , according to the german drugs monitoring body dbdd .
the survey was carried out in 2009 and shows an increase of just 0.1 percent over the figures in the previous survey , carried out in 2006 .
the annual reports of the dbdd and its european partner emcdda were published this week , and show similar patterns of drug use in germany and the eu as a whole .
they show that levels of illegal drug use are relatively stable .
in germany , 26.7 percent of people surveyed had taken some kind of illegal drug in their lifetime , but only 2.6 percent had taken something in the past month .
" we can say that this is a positive development , " said dr. stephanie floeter , a research associate at the dbdd .
" the consumption of many illegal drugs is going down and that has been the trend of the past few years . "
the appetite for cocaine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cannabis is the most used drug in germany and europe the most popular drug is cannabis , with cocaine continuing to be the second most popular , both in europe and germany .
there are at least four million cocaine users in europe .
although cocaine and amphetamine use has increased slightly in germany since the last survey , the figure is no where near that of some other eu countries .
roland simon from the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- said that , in their pan-europe report , germany was not one of the biggest users .
" cocaine plays a really big role all over europe .
1.3 percent of the eu population uses it , " simon told deutsche welle .
" in germany it 's just 0.6 percent - so about half the eu average . "
simon added that big user countries like spain and the uk are pushing the eu average up .
new legal highs both reports flagged up a need to be wary about new legal drugs that are becoming more common .
these are drugs which it is legal to import and export , and which are often cut or mixed with other substances and sold on .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amphetamine mephedrone is one of the more recent drugs to become illegal in germany " there are always new drugs , " said the dbdd 's floeter .
" new synthetic drugs , drugs made from herbs and plants like the drug spice , and ones that imitate ecstasy like pma . "
the pills containing pma , pmma or pcp are often indistinguishable from ecstasy and mdma .
the difference is that they are legal .
" it gives drug traffickers the opportunity for a bargain , " said simon .
" they can earn the money without running the risk of selling illicit substances . "
the drugs flood the markets before the law has time to catch up .
last year 24 new types of drug were identified , this year there were 31 .
" the particular danger is that these pills have a delayed effect , " said the government 's drugs commissioner mechthild dyckmans .
" people take one , then when there is no effect they take another .
this has serious health consequences . "

the findings could have significant implications for dealing with hospital-acquired bugs . every year , over four million hospital patients in europe develop an infection during their stay .
the culprit is most often a strain of the bacteria staphylococcus aureus , also known as mrsa , which has proven resistant to antibiotic treatment .
scientists from the university of wuerzburg and the helmholtz center for infection research -lrb- hzi -rrb- in braunschweig have now found an approach to treating such infections .
they have developed an antibody which specifically targets mrsa in mice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staphylococcus aureus can cause a range of illnesses " we have succeeded in activating a defense mechanism against staphylococcus pathogens in mice with the help of antibodies , " said dr. udo lorenz from the university of wuerzburg 's department of surgery .
together with dr. knut ohlsen from the institute for molecular infection biology , lorenz has spent the last few years pursuing the idea of combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria with antibodies .
" these antibodies attach themselves to a specific point on the bacterium , " lorenz told deutsche welle .
this in turn marks the bacterium , so that the body 's own scavenger cells can detect them and subsequently kill them .
dr. christian erck from hzi worked on actually developing the antibodies in mice .
" these antibodies help make the bacteria visible to the immune system , " he told deutsche welle .
" even when antibiotics can no longer kill multi-resistant bacterial strains , antibodies still have a good chance against them . "
in the experiments , the mice 's immune systems were able to kill 30 percent more pathogens with the aid of the antibodies than without .
" this is a very dramatic advantage , which can constitute the difference between death and survival , " lorenz said .
targeting immune weakness most people have staphylococcus bacteria on their skin and , if they 're healthy , it does n't cause any problems .
" but this is a very flexible bacteria and it can become extremely aggressive , " erck said .
if these pathogens make their way inside patients with weakened immune systems , they cause infections which are extremely difficult to cure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lorenz -lrb- left -rrb- and ohlsen developed this procedure lorenz said this would be the target group for treatment .
" these are patients who have just had surgery or are in intensive care , whose immune systems are not functioning in an optimal way , " he said .
mouse to man the next step now involves transferring the antibody from mice to humans .
this means the entire molecule will need to be " humanized " so that people do n't develop antibodies against the mice antibodies and reject them .
" we will take only the part of the antibody that docks to the bacterium and build the rest of the molecule artificially , so that it is suitable for people , " lorenz said .
if everything goes according to plan , lorenz said he expected the first clinical study to take place at the end of 2012 .
" then we can find out which sort of infections are suitable for this treatment , " he said .
the scientists have published their findings in the current issue of the journal antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy .

the findings could have significant implications for dealing with hospital-acquired bugs . every year , over four million hospital patients in europe develop an infection during their stay .
the culprit is most often a strain of the bacteria staphylococcus aureus , also known as mrsa , which has proven resistant to antibiotic treatment .
scientists from the university of wuerzburg and the helmholtz center for infection research -lrb- hzi -rrb- in braunschweig have now found an approach to treating such infections .
they have developed an antibody which specifically targets mrsa in mice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staphylococcus aureus can cause a range of illnesses " we have succeeded in activating a defense mechanism against staphylococcus pathogens in mice with the help of antibodies , " said dr. udo lorenz from the university of wuerzburg 's department of surgery .
together with dr. knut ohlsen from the institute for molecular infection biology , lorenz has spent the last few years pursuing the idea of combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria with antibodies .
" these antibodies attach themselves to a specific point on the bacterium , " lorenz told deutsche welle .
this in turn marks the bacterium , so that the body 's own scavenger cells can detect them and subsequently kill them .
dr. christian erck from hzi worked on actually developing the antibodies in mice .
" these antibodies help make the bacteria visible to the immune system , " he told deutsche welle .
" even when antibiotics can no longer kill multi-resistant bacterial strains , antibodies still have a good chance against them . "
in the experiments , the mice 's immune systems were able to kill 30 percent more pathogens with the aid of the antibodies than without .
" this is a very dramatic advantage , which can constitute the difference between death and survival , " lorenz said .
targeting immune weakness most people have staphylococcus bacteria on their skin and , if they 're healthy , it does n't cause any problems .
" but this is a very flexible bacteria and it can become extremely aggressive , " erck said .
if these pathogens make their way inside patients with weakened immune systems , they cause infections which are extremely difficult to cure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lorenz -lrb- left -rrb- and ohlsen developed this procedure lorenz said this would be the target group for treatment .

but officials say while the issue of corruption was more openly discussed and legislation strengthened , enforcement remained a problem .
also for many countries where corruption remained rampant there was still some way to go to reduce its impact across societies .

the construction group acs handed in its offer to german financial supervisors bafin , which now has 15 days to deliberate . spain 's largest construction group acs presented its offer for german rival hochtief to germany 's financial supervisory authority bafin on thursday .
bafin now has 15 days to rule on the takeover bid , and hochtief shareholders then have a further four weeks to decide whether to accept the offer .
acs , which already holds just under 30 percent of hochtief , germany 's largest public works construction company , wants to take a controlling stake in the business .
it is seeking an all-share swap to create what would become one of the world 's leading construction firms .
however , acs has offered a price below hochtief 's current market value of around 4.3 billion euros -lrb- 5.9 billion dollars -rrb- , which hochtief sees as unfair .
preventative strategies herbert luetkestratkoetter , head of hochtief , said the company considers the acs bid to be hostile and is " definitely " planning further strategic action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees protested against acs in october hochtief 's chief financial officer burkard lohr refused to rule out a capital increase or a convertible loan to refinance the company .
both measures would increase the number of hochtief shares and thus make a takeover bid more difficult .
another option is for essen-based hochtief to puts its subsidiary concessions on the stock market , even if it means separating itself from that part of its business . concessions ' main activity is the operation of airports and toll-roads .
at the same time the german firm is trying to force the spanish group to make a bid for hochtief 's australian subsidiary leighton , thereby increasing the price , and possibly discouraging acs .
acs could instead carry out a capital increase of 78.5 million euros -lrb- 107.6 million dollars -rrb- , which is to be approved during an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on november 19 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 11.11.2010 private tutoring goes global großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students and their tutors communicate via an online blackboard a uk company has started outsourcing math tuition for pupils aged seven to 16 to graduates recruited and trained in india - and british primary schools are beginning to sign up for the online offer in increasing numbers . brightspark offers the one-to-one tuition via skype .
it is designed to help children who might be struggling in school , as well as stretch high-achievers . nick treloar , a 15-year-old student at the french lycée in london , used to have a tutor come to the house .
but he finds the online tuition a more flexible alternative . " it 's a whenever-you-want system , " nick said .
" you can book the session for any time of day .
it 's you that says ' i want this hour to this hour . '
it 's your choice , so whenever you have a free period during the day , or you finish an hour earlier , then you can come home , and sit down and do this session . " nick 's tutor nathan is based thousands of miles away , in ludhiana , india .
nick has never even seen what his tutor looks like .
but he can hear him , as he guides nick through math problems on a white board that they can both see and write on - a more effective method than simply chatting with a camera on skype . a manageable structure nathan speaks fluent american english from having tutored us students online .
he is 31 years old , and has a five-year-old daughter .
he earns about eight euros -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- an hour , which he says is more than double what many people his age are earning in other professions in india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nathan carries out his work from punjab for him , tutoring is not just about the money , though , but the love of mentoring students and shaping their future .
nathan holds a master 's degree in mathematics and he has been handpicked and trained for the job .
he had already been tutoring american school kids via the web for three years before joining brightspark .
he said he was impressed with british students . " it 's a much better level with uk students , and often with some subjects , they start them much younger , " nathan said . the time difference between the uk and india is four-and-a-half hours , which nathan said is manageable .
he said if a british student books the latest session available , at 9 pm in the uk , it is 1:30 am in ludhiana . nathan is currently part of a team of 30 tutors .
but the company expects to grow to 100 tutors - all working out of small office booths with laptops and skype headsets . lack of specialists british demand for online math tutorials is growing , according to brightspark education chief tom hooper .
he saw an acute need in britain for specialized math tuition for struggling school kids , and introduced indian online tutors after seeing the project work in the us . one british primary school is already using the online tutorials in class to support the teacher - and there are more schools in the pipeline .
hooper is also working with charities in deprived areas and housing estates by introducing the online tutorials to drop-in centers , where mothers can drop their kids off , for an hour 's session at a computer terminal . he says there is a shocking lack of specialist math teachers in britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tutors are virtual at brightspark " only 11 percent of teachers have a degree in the subject they teach , and only eight percent have any training , " hooper said .
" we thought by going to india , we could bring in a level of academic talent that is 100 percent related to math and a 100 percent trained .
that 's why we are seeing a benefit for our students . " hooper also said it 's not just british children who need help . " there are distinct problems among elements of the adult population who have very low numeracy skills , which creates problems socially , but also for unemployed people who want to re-engage with the workforce , " he said . the tutoring industry in britain is completely unregulated , according to hooper .
the company therefore introduced its own strict standards for data protection , assuring their clients their data are closely guarded .
students often get a different tutor with every new session , and the tutors know nothing about them , except their name . with plans to expand the online tutoring business to other subjects , hooper rejects the accusation that indians are somehow taking away british teaching jobs . " i strongly reject that allegation , " he said .
" we are not outsourcing british jobs ; we are in-sourcing specialist skills . " progress is visible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nick likes the flexibility of online tutoring for nick 's father phil , the online tutoring helps him monitor his son 's progress .
he can see how many sessions nick is booking , because he pays for them - and he can see tangible results in nick 's math scores . " we are able to see his progress , and it makes him much more open to be able to tell us which areas he is dropping back in and needs help , " phil said . an online tutor from india costs clients on average of 13 euros an hour .
a tutor in person can cost up to 46 euros - three times as much .
with that price difference , and specialist math tutors on offer , the company said they expect more students like nick to sign up . author : nina-maria potts / sms editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they claimed that the power-sharing deal they had been presented with was not being honoured and that three of the party 's most senior members , barred for their alleged ties to saddam 's baath party , had not been reinstated as promised . as well as the annulment of the bans against the three iraqiya members , iraqiya had presented a further three conditions on which its participation in the power-sharing agreement would hinge : a bill forming the security body , a committee examining cases against political detainees , and codifying the power-sharing deal . iraqiya 's support for any government is seen a hugely important if iraq is not to descend into ethnic violence once more .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.11.2010 the german soldiers that history forgot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remains of soldiers are still found in flanders every year each year on november 11 , armistice day , ceremonies take place at commonwealth war cemeteries to commemorate the dead .
but only a few come to remember the german soldiers who died on flanders fields in wwi . a bugle sounded across flanders fields on thursday .
the " last post " used to mark the end of a day on the battlefields and still today it is played as a haunting reminder of the hundreds of thousands of men who laid down their lives along this stretch of the western front during world war i. wreaths of blood-red poppies will be laid at the foot of rows upon rows of white headstones in the commonwealth cemeteries .
but one war memorial will remain silent and empty on armistice day .
the langemark cemetery is the final resting place of 44,294 german soldiers .
more than half of them are buried in one mass grave , the kameraden grab , their names etched on large dark plaques running alongside the site .
" it 's a tragedy that hardly anyone comes here .
least of all the germans themselves , many of whom know very little about what happened , " andre de bruin , a world war i guide and founder of over the top tours , told deutsche welle .
two million german casualties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on some of the cemeteries , not even headstones were permitted andre points to rows of gravestones that lie flat on the ground , explaining : " belgium imposed very strict restrictions on german memorials .
headstones were not allowed to stand , not like those of the commonwealth soldiers and there were many other rules that applied only to germans . "
there were hundreds of burial sites of german soldiers after 1918 but in the 1950s , belgium ordered that the bodies be regrouped in no more than four sites , of which langemark is one .
" it was probably done out of hatred for what happened , especially during world war ii when belgium was occupied .
they even forbade the use of crosses above the headstones , " de bruin said .
germany lost nearly two million men in the first world war , the greatest number of casualties suffered by any nation .
yet for decades , this chapter of history was hardly taught at german schools .
today , the care of german memorials in western flanders , where some of the bloodiest battles took place , is carried out by a voluntary association , the german war graves commission , and its grounds are tended by students .
at the back of langemark , rain-sodden fields stretch ahead , the same ground that turned into a giant , water-clogged inferno of craters and trenches almost a century ago .
it is here that 3,000 german students were killed in 1914 .
" they had received just six weeks basic training before they were sent to the front to accompany german soldiers in what was meant to be a triumphant march to victory .
but they were all killed in the ensuing battles , " andre explained .
" these men died in the same horrific battles as everyone here and yet on armistice day they will lie mostly unremembered , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flanders saw some of wwi 's bloodiest battles only few visitors from germany only a tiny number of germans come to this part of belgium whereas thousands come to visit the commonwealth graves from as far away as australia .
a visitors ' book at langemark shows that most visitors are british school children , who visit the site as part of their trips around ypres .
" we always bring the children here as part of our tours of the world war i sites .
we feel that german families mourned their dead just as british or belgian families would have done , " leonie giles , a teacher at st nicholas school in north-west england , told deutsche welle .
a colleague added that " the aura here is very different , it 's very somber compared to the pristine white cemeteries where the british are buried , which are more like english gardens .
but we want our kids to realize that these soldiers were just like the british who died for king and country . "
simon , a thirteen-year old carrying a small wooden cross with a poppy , said : " it 's so vast , that mass grave .
and it 's such a sad place .
i feel very emotional . "
remains of soldiers are still found in this area every year , and these are added to the mass grave .
but these days , their burials are done with full military honors and are attended by officials from germany and belgium - a sign perhaps that , in time , more recognition will be given to these men who volunteered to lay down their lives .
" deutschland muss leben auch wenn wir sterben muessen , " reads the plaque above their graves .
germany must live even if we must die .

the construction group acs handed in its offer to german financial supervisors bafin , which now has 15 days to deliberate . spain 's largest construction group acs presented its offer for german rival hochtief to germany 's financial supervisory authority bafin on thursday .
bafin now has 15 days to rule on the takeover bid , and hochtief shareholders then have a further four weeks to decide whether to accept the offer .
acs , which already holds just under 30 percent of hochtief , germany 's largest public works construction company , wants to take a controlling stake in the business .
it is seeking an all-share swap to create what would become one of the world 's leading construction firms .
however , acs has offered a price below hochtief 's current market value of around 4.3 billion euros -lrb- 5.9 billion dollars -rrb- , which hochtief sees as unfair .
preventative strategies herbert luetkestratkoetter , head of hochtief , said the company considers the acs bid to be hostile and is " definitely " planning further strategic action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees protested against acs in october hochtief 's chief financial officer burkard lohr refused to rule out a capital increase or a convertible loan to refinance the company .
both measures would increase the number of hochtief shares and thus make a takeover bid more difficult .
another option is for essen-based hochtief to puts its subsidiary concessions on the stock market , even if it means separating itself from that part of its business . concessions ' main activity is the operation of airports and toll-roads .
at the same time the german firm is trying to force the spanish group to make a bid for hochtief 's australian subsidiary leighton , thereby increasing the price , and possibly discouraging acs .
acs could instead carry out a capital increase of 78.5 million euros -lrb- 107.6 million dollars -rrb- , which is to be approved during an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on november 19 .

they claimed that the power-sharing deal they had been presented with was not being honoured and that three of the party 's most senior members , barred for their alleged ties to saddam 's baath party , had not been reinstated as promised . as well as the annulment of the bans against the three iraqiya members , iraqiya had presented a further three conditions on which its participation in the power-sharing agreement would hinge : a bill forming the security body , a committee examining cases against political detainees , and codifying the power-sharing deal . iraqiya 's support for any government is seen a hugely important if iraq is not to descend into ethnic violence once more .
the sunni arab minority , which gave iraqiya a narrow victory in the contested march 7 poll , provided the heaviest resistance in the anti-us insurgency after the 2003 invasion .
its involvement in any coalition is imperative if peace is to be achieved . iraqiya 's apparent rejection of the deal highlights the fierce divides and rivalries which have paralysed the iraqi political system since the fall of saddam hussein regime .
the deal , clinched late wednesday night after three days of high-pressure talks between the rival factions , saw shiite prime minister al-maliki returning to office for a second term . talabani , a kurd , is expected to retain the presidency .
and a sunni mp was to be elected as speaker of parliament .
maliki now has 30 days to form his cabinet , and the next parliamentary meeting is scheduled for saturday .
the decision offered hope that the next government would include enough sunni representation to lower the chances of a return to the sectarian violence that killed tens of thousands of people after the 2003 , u.s.-led invasion that ousted sunni dictator saddam hussein .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi prime minister ayad allawi 's group finally agreed to the deal iraq has been without a new government since the vote , which gave iraqiya two more seats than maliki 's bloc .

iraqiya initially joined a kurdish alliance in supporting maliki following months of contentious negotiations which raised tensions in iraq as the army and police try to cement security gains against a stubborn insurgency .
last month , maliki toured capitals in the region - from iran and syria to turkey and egypt - to gain regional backing for his effort to stay in power .
he offered arab nations investment deals in iraq in exchange for nudging iraqiya toward a compromise , political sources said .
court pressure paid off over the past months , iraqiya repeatedly rejected another maliki term and demanded the right to form the government as the top vote winner in the election .

they claimed that the power-sharing deal they had been presented with was not being honoured and that three of the party 's most senior members , barred for their alleged ties to saddam 's baath party , had not been reinstated as promised . as well as the annulment of the bans against the three iraqiya members , iraqiya had presented a further three conditions on which its participation in the power-sharing agreement would hinge : a bill forming the security body , a committee examining cases against political detainees , and codifying the power-sharing deal . iraqiya 's support for any government is seen a hugely important if iraq is not to descend into ethnic violence once more .
the sunni arab minority , which gave iraqiya a narrow victory in the contested march 7 poll , provided the heaviest resistance in the anti-us insurgency after the 2003 invasion .
its involvement in any coalition is imperative if peace is to be achieved . iraqiya 's apparent rejection of the deal highlights the fierce divides and rivalries which have paralysed the iraqi political system since the fall of saddam hussein regime .
the deal , clinched late wednesday night after three days of high-pressure talks between the rival factions , saw shiite prime minister al-maliki returning to office for a second term . talabani , a kurd , is expected to retain the presidency .
and a sunni mp was to be elected as speaker of parliament .
maliki now has 30 days to form his cabinet , and the next parliamentary meeting is scheduled for saturday .
the decision offered hope that the next government would include enough sunni representation to lower the chances of a return to the sectarian violence that killed tens of thousands of people after the 2003 , u.s.-led invasion that ousted sunni dictator saddam hussein .
iraqiya , who had held out for months to take the premiership from maliki after it narrowly won more seats in the march election , initially confirmed it had finally signed up to the deal .
us praises deal the obama administration called the development " a big step forward for iraq . " " all along we 've said the best result would be a government that reflects the results of the elections , includes all the major blocs representing iraq 's ethnic and sectarian groups , and that does not exclude or marginalize anyone .
that 's exactly what iraqis seem to have agreed to , " antony blinken , national security adviser to us vice president joe biden , said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi prime minister ayad allawi 's group finally agreed to the deal iraq has been without a new government since the vote , which gave iraqiya two more seats than maliki 's bloc .
neither had enough for a majority in parliament , leaving the factions to negotiate a government .
iraqiya initially joined a kurdish alliance in supporting maliki following months of contentious negotiations which raised tensions in iraq as the army and police try to cement security gains against a stubborn insurgency .
last month , maliki toured capitals in the region - from iran and syria to turkey and egypt - to gain regional backing for his effort to stay in power .
he offered arab nations investment deals in iraq in exchange for nudging iraqiya toward a compromise , political sources said .
court pressure paid off over the past months , iraqiya repeatedly rejected another maliki term and demanded the right to form the government as the top vote winner in the election .

last month , iraq 's high court ordered parliament to resume its sessions , putting pressure on politicians to expedite a deal .

but only a few come to remember the german soldiers who died on flanders fields in wwi . a bugle sounded across flanders fields on thursday .
the " last post " used to mark the end of a day on the battlefields and still today it is played as a haunting reminder of the hundreds of thousands of men who laid down their lives along this stretch of the western front during world war i. wreaths of blood-red poppies will be laid at the foot of rows upon rows of white headstones in the commonwealth cemeteries .
but one war memorial will remain silent and empty on armistice day .
the langemark cemetery is the final resting place of 44,294 german soldiers .
more than half of them are buried in one mass grave , the kameraden grab , their names etched on large dark plaques running alongside the site .
" it 's a tragedy that hardly anyone comes here .
least of all the germans themselves , many of whom know very little about what happened , " andre de bruin , a world war i guide and founder of over the top tours , told deutsche welle .
two million german casualties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on some of the cemeteries , not even headstones were permitted andre points to rows of gravestones that lie flat on the ground , explaining : " belgium imposed very strict restrictions on german memorials .
headstones were not allowed to stand , not like those of the commonwealth soldiers and there were many other rules that applied only to germans . "
there were hundreds of burial sites of german soldiers after 1918 but in the 1950s , belgium ordered that the bodies be regrouped in no more than four sites , of which langemark is one .
" it was probably done out of hatred for what happened , especially during world war ii when belgium was occupied .
they even forbade the use of crosses above the headstones , " de bruin said .
germany lost nearly two million men in the first world war , the greatest number of casualties suffered by any nation .
yet for decades , this chapter of history was hardly taught at german schools .
today , the care of german memorials in western flanders , where some of the bloodiest battles took place , is carried out by a voluntary association , the german war graves commission , and its grounds are tended by students .
at the back of langemark , rain-sodden fields stretch ahead , the same ground that turned into a giant , water-clogged inferno of craters and trenches almost a century ago .
it is here that 3,000 german students were killed in 1914 .
" they had received just six weeks basic training before they were sent to the front to accompany german soldiers in what was meant to be a triumphant march to victory .
but they were all killed in the ensuing battles , " andre explained .
" these men died in the same horrific battles as everyone here and yet on armistice day they will lie mostly unremembered , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flanders saw some of wwi 's bloodiest battles only few visitors from germany only a tiny number of germans come to this part of belgium whereas thousands come to visit the commonwealth graves from as far away as australia .
a visitors ' book at langemark shows that most visitors are british school children , who visit the site as part of their trips around ypres .
" we always bring the children here as part of our tours of the world war i sites .
we feel that german families mourned their dead just as british or belgian families would have done , " leonie giles , a teacher at st nicholas school in north-west england , told deutsche welle .
a colleague added that " the aura here is very different , it 's very somber compared to the pristine white cemeteries where the british are buried , which are more like english gardens .
but we want our kids to realize that these soldiers were just like the british who died for king and country . "
simon , a thirteen-year old carrying a small wooden cross with a poppy , said : " it 's so vast , that mass grave .
and it 's such a sad place .
i feel very emotional . "
remains of soldiers are still found in this area every year , and these are added to the mass grave .
but these days , their burials are done with full military honors and are attended by officials from germany and belgium - a sign perhaps that , in time , more recognition will be given to these men who volunteered to lay down their lives .
" deutschland muss leben auch wenn wir sterben muessen , " reads the plaque above their graves .
germany must live even if we must die .

" we continue to support the goal of withdrawal , " westerwelle said during a parliamentary debate on thursday in berlin .
disarmament is going to be a " key issue " for germany at the lisbon meeting , the foreign minister said .
there are no official figures about the number of nuclear weapons stationed on german soil , but it is believed that perhaps 10 to 20 nuclear warheads from the us arsenal are stockpiled at the buechel air base in the state of rhineland-palatinate in southwestern germany .
russian cooperation government leaders and heads of state of the 28 nato member countries meet in the portuguese capital next week friday to discuss a major strategic overhaul of the military alliance .
a key element of nato 's new strategy to be decided upon in lisbon is a european missile-defense system .
in what westerwelle called an " historic gesture , " russia will be involved in the discussions .
" we do n't want a europe with areas of differing security levels , " westerwelle said .
" we want to improve our security alongside , not in confrontation with russia . "
westerwelle defends cabinet colleague the foreign minister used his address in parliament to also set straight a cornerstone of german military doctrine .
westerwelle rejected accusations that defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was revamping the german armed forces to fight what the opposition called " economic wars . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister called for nuclear exit and defended his colleague karl-theodor zu guttenberg " we will continue the culture of military restraint .
any other assumption is defamation that has nothing to do with reality , " the minister said .
westerwelle 's comments were viewed as indirect support for defense minister guttenberg , who recently made controversial remarks to the effect that germany should align its security policies with economic interests , like other countries do .
in response , the green party parliamentary leader , juergen trittin , accused guttenberg of pursuing " gunboat diplomacy . "
defending his position , guttenberg told parliament on thursday that the strategy was contained in a government white paper from 2006 when the opposition social democrats were still in a grand coalition with chancellor merkel 's christian democrats .
" there were no cries of outrage then , " guttenberg said , " but now comes the great wave of indignation . "
the issue of economic intervention is also expected to be on the agenda of the nato summit next week .

let me introduce myself - i 'm ali .
ali almakhlafi .
i 'm a journalist from yemen . i live in germany .
i 'm 31 years old .
i 'm muslim .
and i 've never been to mecca in my entire life .
even though , when considered from distance , i was born and spent the first 19 years of my life " right next door . " yemen is the poorest country of the arabian peninsula and has a common border with saudi arabia – one of the richest countries of the region and guardian of islam 's holy sites .
from yemen 's capital , sana 'a , it 's about a 90-minute flight from there to mecca .
from germany it takes about six hours .
reporter , not a pilgrim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali 's journey takes him from bonn to mecca .
yet my journey to mecca starts here in germany , the country i live and work in .
and i 'm deliberately not traveling as a religious pilgrim , but as a neutral journalistic reporter .
my main goal is to provide non-muslim users with insights into the hajj pilgrimage - just as i was once introduced to easter , christmas , and other christian feasts .
as you may know , according to saudi arabia 's interpretation of islam , only muslims may visit the holy city of mecca .
however , it is allowed to let non-muslims know about it .
this is what i want to do as i tell you about my impressions , discoveries , and encounters with pilgrims from all over the world - and particularly from germany .
even many muslims know little more about the hajj than the pictures they get on television , which show religious rites and crowds pouring in .
i 'm sure that there 's a lot to find out about the hajj - so wo n't you join me on my journey of discovery ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : praying at the mosque in mecca would you like to know how , exactly , the religious rituals are performed ?
what safety measures are taken ?
whether men and women go on their pilgrimage together ?
or whether conflicts between moderate and radical political groups in the islamic world influence the festivities ?
honestly , i do n't know many of the answers to these questions myself .
but whatever you may want to learn , i 'll try to find it out for you !
please post your questions and suggestions on deutsche welle 's facebook page : http : / / www.facebook.com / deutschewelle even though i will visit mecca as a journalist , this is anything but a " typical " reporting assignement to me .
maybe it 's like a catholic-raised journalist reporting from the vatican : you 're keeping a distance and reporting neutrally , but somehow the subject moves you more than , say , a piece about the latest tax reform .
learning about prophets , and people so i ca n't keep all my childhood memories separated from my thoughts about , and preparation for , my first trip to mecca .
specifically , my religion class in taiz , the town i was born in , comes to my mind .
they taught us that god is in heaven watching us .
that jews and christians share a lot of prophets with muslims except the last prophet and messenger of god : muhammad .
that the citizens of mecca once chased muhammad out of the city .
and that muhammad returned to mecca eight years later and destroyed the statues of false gods that had been built .
as a little boy i was deeply impressed and shaped by these religious basics .
today they inextricably belong to my personal cultural heritage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : our reporter hails from taiz , in yemen of course , at school , i also learned about the five religious duties of every muslim , the so-called five pillars of islam .
the hajj is one of them - a spiritual journey that is to be performed by every muslim who is healthy enough and can afford to do so .
examining my picture of saudi arabia i also want to examine my personal picture of saudi arabia - which is closely linked to my yemeni descent .
there were times when yemenis were allowed to enter the country without a visa .
older men , such as my grandfather , used to go on business trips to the country next door and bring us back precious presents .
but there was also a time - when saudi arabia and yemen were at serious odds about the kuwait war - that saudi arabian leaders expelled hundreds of thousands of yemeni " guest workers " from the country .
during this period , unemployment and poverty increased dramatically in yemen , and the number of students in my class went from 20 to 120 .
that is when i realized that islamic virtues such as solidarity and brotherhood can vanish into thin air when politics come into play .
and that a common belief does n't prevent people from committing human-rights violations .
i wonder what kind of experiences i will have in mecca ?
maybe they 'll be very different from what i expect .

reporter , not a pilgrim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali 's journey takes him from bonn to mecca .
yet my journey to mecca starts here in germany , the country i live and work in .
and i 'm deliberately not traveling as a religious pilgrim , but as a neutral journalistic reporter .
my main goal is to provide non-muslim users with insights into the hajj pilgrimage - just as i was once introduced to easter , christmas , and other christian feasts .
as you may know , according to saudi arabia 's interpretation of islam , only muslims may visit the holy city of mecca .
however , it is allowed to let non-muslims know about it .
this is what i want to do as i tell you about my impressions , discoveries , and encounters with pilgrims from all over the world - and particularly from germany .
even many muslims know little more about the hajj than the pictures they get on television , which show religious rites and crowds pouring in .
i 'm sure that there 's a lot to find out about the hajj - so wo n't you join me on my journey of discovery ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : praying at the mosque in mecca would you like to know how , exactly , the religious rituals are performed ?
what safety measures are taken ?
whether men and women go on their pilgrimage together ?
or whether conflicts between moderate and radical political groups in the islamic world influence the festivities ?
honestly , i do n't know many of the answers to these questions myself .
but whatever you may want to learn , i 'll try to find it out for you !
please post your questions and suggestions on deutsche welle 's facebook page : http : / / www.facebook.com / deutschewelle even though i will visit mecca as a journalist , this is anything but a " typical " reporting assignement to me .
maybe it 's like a catholic-raised journalist reporting from the vatican : you 're keeping a distance and reporting neutrally , but somehow the subject moves you more than , say , a piece about the latest tax reform .
learning about prophets , and people so i ca n't keep all my childhood memories separated from my thoughts about , and preparation for , my first trip to mecca .
specifically , my religion class in taiz , the town i was born in , comes to my mind .
they taught us that god is in heaven watching us .
that jews and christians share a lot of prophets with muslims except the last prophet and messenger of god : muhammad .
that the citizens of mecca once chased muhammad out of the city .
and that muhammad returned to mecca eight years later and destroyed the statues of false gods that had been built .
as a little boy i was deeply impressed and shaped by these religious basics .
today they inextricably belong to my personal cultural heritage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : our reporter hails from taiz , in yemen of course , at school , i also learned about the five religious duties of every muslim , the so-called five pillars of islam .
the hajj is one of them - a spiritual journey that is to be performed by every muslim who is healthy enough and can afford to do so .
examining my picture of saudi arabia i also want to examine my personal picture of saudi arabia - which is closely linked to my yemeni descent .
there were times when yemenis were allowed to enter the country without a visa .
older men , such as my grandfather , used to go on business trips to the country next door and bring us back precious presents .
but there was also a time - when saudi arabia and yemen were at serious odds about the kuwait war - that saudi arabian leaders expelled hundreds of thousands of yemeni " guest workers " from the country .
during this period , unemployment and poverty increased dramatically in yemen , and the number of students in my class went from 20 to 120 .
that is when i realized that islamic virtues such as solidarity and brotherhood can vanish into thin air when politics come into play .
and that a common belief does n't prevent people from committing human-rights violations .

" we continue to support the goal of withdrawal , " westerwelle said during a parliamentary debate on thursday in berlin .
disarmament is going to be a " key issue " for germany at the lisbon meeting , the foreign minister said .
there are no official figures about the number of nuclear weapons stationed on german soil , but it is believed that perhaps 10 to 20 nuclear warheads from the us arsenal are stockpiled at the buechel air base in the state of rhineland-palatinate in southwestern germany .
russian cooperation government leaders and heads of state of the 28 nato member countries meet in the portuguese capital next week friday to discuss a major strategic overhaul of the military alliance .
a key element of nato 's new strategy to be decided upon in lisbon is a european missile-defense system .
in what westerwelle called an " historic gesture , " russia will be involved in the discussions .
" we do n't want a europe with areas of differing security levels , " westerwelle said .
" we want to improve our security alongside , not in confrontation with russia . "
westerwelle defends cabinet colleague the foreign minister used his address in parliament to also set straight a cornerstone of german military doctrine .
westerwelle rejected accusations that defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was revamping the german armed forces to fight what the opposition called " economic wars . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister called for nuclear exit and defended his colleague karl-theodor zu guttenberg " we will continue the culture of military restraint .
any other assumption is defamation that has nothing to do with reality , " the minister said .
westerwelle 's comments were viewed as indirect support for defense minister guttenberg , who recently made controversial remarks to the effect that germany should align its security policies with economic interests , like other countries do .
in response , the green party parliamentary leader , juergen trittin , accused guttenberg of pursuing " gunboat diplomacy . "
defending his position , guttenberg told parliament on thursday that the strategy was contained in a government white paper from 2006 when the opposition social democrats were still in a grand coalition with chancellor merkel 's christian democrats .
" there were no cries of outrage then , " guttenberg said , " but now comes the great wave of indignation . "
the issue of economic intervention is also expected to be on the agenda of the nato summit next week .

on two separate occasions the tabloid , which is in no way related to the us music magazine of the same name , has printed the identities and addresses of alleged homosexuals .
the campaign launched in october under the headline banner " 100 pictures of uganda 's top homos leak - hang them " has so far outed 29 people .
several of them have since been subjected to harassment and threats from members of the public .
transgender stosh mugisha is among the victims .
biologically a woman but living as a man , the 33-year old 's life has drastically changed since his photograph appeared in the rolling stone " men of shame " gallery .
“ i went to the shop where i usually buy cigarettes , " mugisha told deutsche welle .
" the woman told me ' i do n't sell cigarettes to faggots ' , so i left . "
on his way home passers-by threw verbal abuse and even stones at him .
although he was not physically hurt , he has since had to move away for fear of a more serious attack .
interim ruling in light of the controversial pictures and following a petition from the gay rights group , sexual minorities uganda , the high court ordered rolling stone , which is not yet in possession of a license , to cease publication .
judge vincent musoke kibuuka described the public outing as an invasion of the right to privacy of the individuals identified .
yet the ruling is only temporary and will be reviewed at a hearing later this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the colors of gay pride are not visible on the streets of kampala the newspaper 's managing editor , giles muhame , is confident that he will be able to resume what he says is his duty to expose evils in society before the month is out .

in an editor 's note written to accompany the publication of his " men of shame part ii , " muhame cited his motivation for printing the pictures as an attempt to stop a " cross-section of heartless homosexuals " from recruiting and brainwashing unsuspecting kids into gay circles .
it is this allegation in particular that stosh mugisha found hurtful and distasteful .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' most ugandans do n't support gay rights , ' one official said .
where the situation goes from here will depend at least to some extent on whether or not the country 's media council , tasked with promoting responsible and ethical journalism , decides to issue rolling stone with a license .
peter mwesige , executive director of the african center for media excellence , said the council would have to be seriously outraged not to .
but given the debate in the country last year over the introduction of the death penalty for some homosexual acts , that outrage might be hard to come by .
" most people in the society we live in do not support the idea that homosexuals deserve any rights , " mwesige told deutsche welle .
although the council , which freedom house notes " has been criticized for its lack of independence , " has a code of ethics on issues such as invasion of privacy , the guidelines are regularly flouted and many a blind eye is turned .
just so long as there are no officials involved .
" the government does n't pay attention to ethics , " mwesige said .
" but when the stories are politically sensitive , it cares . "
spotlight on human rights that became blatantly obvious last year when the government , under president yoweri museveni , closed four radio stations on the grounds that they were inciting racial hatred .
besides curtailing press freedom , the " write-anything-about-anyone-but-nothing-about-me " modus operandi also highlights another problem .

" those managing media in uganda have no knowledge of human rights . "
he says it is crucial to change the status quo , but that doing so will require a complete rethink on the parts of publishers , broadcasters , proprietors and most of all the government .

" but as long as we 're not challenging power it is not seen as a threat . "

it 's match day twelve in the bundesliga and after the abject failure of trying to summon voodoo spirits to do their bidding last week , the dw soccer pundits have resorted to less ghoulish methods . dw 's soccer pundits have been forming a fidgety queue outside the bathroom this week after downing enough tea to fill a swimming pool .
as well as causing numerous pairs of legs to cross , the experiment has also produced enough bundesliga result-shaped tea leaf formations to come up with the predictions for match day twelve .
amuse yourselves with these forecasts while we dash once again to the little boys room ...
saturday , nov 13 bremen – frankfurt oh dear .
just what is going on with werder bremen ?
esteemed colleague jefferson chase nailed it in his commentary this week – whatever 's gone wrong at bremen , it 'll need huge changes to fix it .
while wondering what was going to happen next was initially an endearing game of roulette , as the season wears on , it looks like bremen are playing the russian variety .
no guesses who 'll get the bullet if their form continues to nosedive .
frankfurt very well could be the team to load the gun .
prediction : frankfurt 2-1 wolfsburg – schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke edged closer to safety thanks to raul 's goals go on then , but just whisper it … schalke may have turned a corner .
there – i said it … which means , of course , that wolfsburg 's up-and-down season will ascend again to the detriment of felix magath 's struggling side on saturday .
the royal blues may have fired three past st. pauli to put them one point from safety but the hamburg club are quickly becoming easy pickings as their confidence dwindles .
wolfsburg will be a sterner test .
perhaps the training ground punch-ups suggest the wolves have the fight to come out on top in this one .
prediction : wolfsburg 3-2 cologne – moenchengladbach wake us up when this derby is over .
the two sides who manage to make schalke look good come together in this basement clash with little daylight between them in terms of points and class .
gladbach at least shocked the life out of bayern last week - which always raises a smile in these parts - but with cologne struggling to find anything resembling flair in any of their games to date , these two could blunder and bump against each other for 90 minutes and still not score .
hopefully one will manage it but it 's a coin toss .
heads it 's gladbach .
prediction : gladbach 1-0 kaiserslautern – stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ciprian marica led the way in the thrashing of bremen stuttgart will be nicely rested after last weekend 's game so kaiserslautern should beware .
vfb stuck six past bremen and then must have retired to a dark room to lie down .
despite the green shoots of recovery growing over at the mercedes benz arena , few would have tipped jens keller 's team to thrash werder so comprehensively -lrb- i certainly did n't -rrb- .
but then kaiserslautern looked impressive last week , even though they evenutally lost against in-form leverkusen . this one could prove quite entertaining to watch .
prediction : 2-2 st. pauli – leverkusen pauli continue to slide and it 's already looking like an inevitable one towards what many people think is their rightful place in the relegation zone .
the neutral will hope they can arrest the decline but taking on leverkusen may not be the best place to start .
bayer have been quietly efficient in rising to third place and will be looking to make up ground on mainz in the place above them .
on form alone , it looks as though pauli will be deeper in the mire come saturday night .
prediction : leverkusen 3-1 mainz – hanover mainz in crisis !
two defeats on the bounce !
how easy it is to forget what an achievement this season has already been for mainz .
it is n't only their position which is impressive but the way they 've gotten there .
okay , so freiburg should never have beaten them last week – but only in the context of mainz 's amazing form to date .
last season , this would n't have been such a shock .
losing or drawing with hanover would n't have been either but on the evidence of this campaign alone , one would expect mainz to triumph .
prediction : mainz 2-0 sunday , nov 14 hoffenheim – freiburg despite winning last week , hoffenheim still dropped down the league , giving the illusion that their title charge has already petered out .
do n't be fooled .
the pendulum of form is swinging in the hoff 's direction and a win over freiburg will see them back in the mix .
freiburg had a great result against mainz and will have to be completely free of the hangover to cope with the hoff at home .
expecting the freiburgers to be well up for it as usual , this could be a tight affair .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 bayern – nuremberg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern lost their heads against gladbach last weekend they still have n't quite got it right , have they ?
louis van gaal tore his team a new one after letting the points slip against bottom club gladbach last week and you would expect a reaction from the german champions against nuremberg on sunday .
but how many times has the gruff dutchman got all red in the face only to see his team go pale on the pitch ?
nuremberg cantered to a win against cologne last week and of course bayern , however dire , are the polar opposite of the boys for köln .
however , the bavarians are increasingly hard to fathom so – who knows ?

on two separate occasions the tabloid , which is in no way related to the us music magazine of the same name , has printed the identities and addresses of alleged homosexuals .
the campaign launched in october under the headline banner " 100 pictures of uganda 's top homos leak - hang them " has so far outed 29 people .
several of them have since been subjected to harassment and threats from members of the public .
transgender stosh mugisha is among the victims .
biologically a woman but living as a man , the 33-year old 's life has drastically changed since his photograph appeared in the rolling stone " men of shame " gallery .
“ i went to the shop where i usually buy cigarettes , " mugisha told deutsche welle .
" the woman told me ' i do n't sell cigarettes to faggots ' , so i left . "
on his way home passers-by threw verbal abuse and even stones at him .
although he was not physically hurt , he has since had to move away for fear of a more serious attack .
interim ruling in light of the controversial pictures and following a petition from the gay rights group , sexual minorities uganda , the high court ordered rolling stone , which is not yet in possession of a license , to cease publication .
judge vincent musoke kibuuka described the public outing as an invasion of the right to privacy of the individuals identified .
yet the ruling is only temporary and will be reviewed at a hearing later this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the colors of gay pride are not visible on the streets of kampala the newspaper 's managing editor , giles muhame , is confident that he will be able to resume what he says is his duty to expose evils in society before the month is out .
" the main case comes up on november 23 , we shall challenge it , we shall defeat them , the interim order will be quashed , " he said .
in an editor 's note written to accompany the publication of his " men of shame part ii , " muhame cited his motivation for printing the pictures as an attempt to stop a " cross-section of heartless homosexuals " from recruiting and brainwashing unsuspecting kids into gay circles .
it is this allegation in particular that stosh mugisha found hurtful and distasteful .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 11.11.2010 obama , seoul , and multilateral ambitions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants to reaffirm ties with south korea , but has other concerns barack obama traveled to south korea ahead of this week 's g20 summit .
but he had a host of other issues in his luggage as he mets chinese president hu jintao on the sidelines of the summit . there was no shortage of issues awaiting us president barack obama even before the g20 summit began on thursday in seoul .
obama was scheduled to meet both chinese president hu jintao and south korean president lee myung-bak parallel to the summit .
for the latter , the most pressing agenda item was expected to be the ratification of a pending free trade deal that us and south korean diplomats from both sides have been hashing out over the past two days .
despite a number of sticking points , including disagreement on autos and beef trade , myung-bak and obama agreed in a telephone conversation last week to strive for agreement before the g20 .
on thursday morning , news broke that the two sides failed to reach an agreement on a free-trade accord , but said talks would continue after the g20 summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama faces a complex meeting with hu jintao yet the meeting was also be laden with symbolic value , as howard loewen , researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , said .
" i think they want to reaffirm the security alliance between the south korea and the us , for the protection of south korea , " loewen told deutsche welle ahead of the meeting on wednesday .
" which is of course a message for north korea and china . "
chinese tension the meeting with jintao is likely to be more general and possibly less conclusive , however .
apart from recent disagreements over currency issues and accusations of protectionism , the americans are consistently calling on china to take on more responsibility .
" if you 're a big country , you have the power to sit at the table in the biggest forums , but you have to be willing to take on responsibility , and i think that will be a subject of conversation , " says loewen .
for its part , china is wary of obama 's diplomacy drive in asia , particularly us attempts to assert a position in multilateral bodies .
next year the us will join the east asia summit , an annual forum of east asian countries , and loewen believes that obama is consciously going beyond the network of bilateral relations the us maintains with likes of japan , south korea , the philippines and thailand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will join the east asia summit next year " the us is showing more diplomatic initiatives in southeast asia than it did in the bush era , " said loewen .
" at the same time , the us wants to engage more in the multilateral regulation of problems .
you really ca n't say that the us is retreating in the region - on the contrary , it is pushing ahead more . "
" of course , the chinese are not keen on seeing the us engaging themselves more , " he added .
" because they fear that the us could rival their influence , which of course it does .
the chinese are getting nervous . "
multilateral vs. bilateral perhaps for this reason china has made one regional issue a taboo for multilateral talks .
pascal abb of the german institute of global and area studies , told deutsche welle , " china has made it clear that it does not want the territorial conflicts in the south china seas to be discussed multilaterally , but that is the central conflict in the region . "
the conflict is over a number of tiny islands in the south china seas – china , taiwan , vietnam , the philippines and malaysia all lay claim to the islands , mainly because of the rich natural resources in the area , as well as the trade routes that run through these waters .
but china 's refusal to allow the matter to be discussed multilaterally effectively scuppers any chance of progress .
" i do n't see how overlapping territorial conflicts can be solved bilaterally , " says abb , " simply because no third country is likely to accept an agreement that two other states have reached . "
political gamble but for obama , the recent mid-term elections mean that what some people call his " multilateral gamble " may be under more pressure .
while the new strength in the republican party does not extend to controlling the senate , which has more control over us foreign policy , some believe that if obama 's attempts to assert himself in asia do not bear economic fruit , he may hand the republicans extra ammunition in the 2012 presidential election .
but that is still a long term concern .
for now , the republicans are unlikely to gain much traction with such attacks .
" it could be that the republicans want to assert their foreign policies now , and may make demands like that , " says loewen .
" but i think it wo n't be that serious , because there are no multilateral commitments .
it is easier to go back on multilateral agreements , so i do n't think that will play a big role . "

on two separate occasions the tabloid , which is in no way related to the us music magazine of the same name , has printed the identities and addresses of alleged homosexuals .
the campaign launched in october under the headline banner " 100 pictures of uganda 's top homos leak - hang them " has so far outed 29 people .
several of them have since been subjected to harassment and threats from members of the public .
transgender stosh mugisha is among the victims .
biologically a woman but living as a man , the 33-year old 's life has drastically changed since his photograph appeared in the rolling stone " men of shame " gallery .
“ i went to the shop where i usually buy cigarettes , " mugisha told deutsche welle .
" the woman told me ' i do n't sell cigarettes to faggots ' , so i left . "
on his way home passers-by threw verbal abuse and even stones at him .
although he was not physically hurt , he has since had to move away for fear of a more serious attack .
interim ruling in light of the controversial pictures and following a petition from the gay rights group , sexual minorities uganda , the high court ordered rolling stone , which is not yet in possession of a license , to cease publication .
judge vincent musoke kibuuka described the public outing as an invasion of the right to privacy of the individuals identified .
yet the ruling is only temporary and will be reviewed at a hearing later this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the colors of gay pride are not visible on the streets of kampala the newspaper 's managing editor , giles muhame , is confident that he will be able to resume what he says is his duty to expose evils in society before the month is out .
" the main case comes up on november 23 , we shall challenge it , we shall defeat them , the interim order will be quashed , " he said .
in an editor 's note written to accompany the publication of his " men of shame part ii , " muhame cited his motivation for printing the pictures as an attempt to stop a " cross-section of heartless homosexuals " from recruiting and brainwashing unsuspecting kids into gay circles .
it is this allegation in particular that stosh mugisha found hurtful and distasteful .
" how do you recruit someone into something they do not want ? , " he asked . " homosexuality is inborn , you can not start it by going into schools , it 's not like you are looking for votes . ”
ethical issues but the editor begs to differ , and has said he will not quit his printing spree until members of the gay community " stop enrolling minors in their circles . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' most ugandans do n't support gay rights , ' one official said .
where the situation goes from here will depend at least to some extent on whether or not the country 's media council , tasked with promoting responsible and ethical journalism , decides to issue rolling stone with a license .
peter mwesige , executive director of the african center for media excellence , said the council would have to be seriously outraged not to .
but given the debate in the country last year over the introduction of the death penalty for some homosexual acts , that outrage might be hard to come by .
" most people in the society we live in do not support the idea that homosexuals deserve any rights , " mwesige told deutsche welle .
although the council , which freedom house notes " has been criticized for its lack of independence , " has a code of ethics on issues such as invasion of privacy , the guidelines are regularly flouted and many a blind eye is turned .
just so long as there are no officials involved .
" the government does n't pay attention to ethics , " mwesige said .
" but when the stories are politically sensitive , it cares . "
spotlight on human rights that became blatantly obvious last year when the government , under president yoweri museveni , closed four radio stations on the grounds that they were inciting racial hatred .
besides curtailing press freedom , the " write-anything-about-anyone-but-nothing-about-me " modus operandi also highlights another problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the might of the government geoffrey wokulira ssebaggala , programs co-coordinator at human rights network for journalists in uganda , says one of the biggest challenges facing the country 's media today is the establishment of a culture of professionalism .
" people write about anything , and they do n't mind if it infringes on others ' rights , " ssebaggala told deutsche welle .
" those managing media in uganda have no knowledge of human rights . "
he says it is crucial to change the status quo , but that doing so will require a complete rethink on the parts of publishers , broadcasters , proprietors and most of all the government .
" there 's a lot that needs to be done , " he said .
" but as long as we 're not challenging power it is not seen as a threat . "

it 's match day twelve in the bundesliga and after the abject failure of trying to summon voodoo spirits to do their bidding last week , the dw soccer pundits have resorted to less ghoulish methods . dw 's soccer pundits have been forming a fidgety queue outside the bathroom this week after downing enough tea to fill a swimming pool .
as well as causing numerous pairs of legs to cross , the experiment has also produced enough bundesliga result-shaped tea leaf formations to come up with the predictions for match day twelve .
amuse yourselves with these forecasts while we dash once again to the little boys room ...
saturday , nov 13 bremen – frankfurt oh dear .
just what is going on with werder bremen ?
esteemed colleague jefferson chase nailed it in his commentary this week – whatever 's gone wrong at bremen , it 'll need huge changes to fix it .
while wondering what was going to happen next was initially an endearing game of roulette , as the season wears on , it looks like bremen are playing the russian variety .
no guesses who 'll get the bullet if their form continues to nosedive .
frankfurt very well could be the team to load the gun .
prediction : frankfurt 2-1 wolfsburg – schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke edged closer to safety thanks to raul 's goals go on then , but just whisper it … schalke may have turned a corner .
there – i said it … which means , of course , that wolfsburg 's up-and-down season will ascend again to the detriment of felix magath 's struggling side on saturday .
the royal blues may have fired three past st. pauli to put them one point from safety but the hamburg club are quickly becoming easy pickings as their confidence dwindles .
wolfsburg will be a sterner test .
perhaps the training ground punch-ups suggest the wolves have the fight to come out on top in this one .
prediction : wolfsburg 3-2 cologne – moenchengladbach wake us up when this derby is over .
the two sides who manage to make schalke look good come together in this basement clash with little daylight between them in terms of points and class .
gladbach at least shocked the life out of bayern last week - which always raises a smile in these parts - but with cologne struggling to find anything resembling flair in any of their games to date , these two could blunder and bump against each other for 90 minutes and still not score .
hopefully one will manage it but it 's a coin toss .
heads it 's gladbach .
prediction : gladbach 1-0 kaiserslautern – stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ciprian marica led the way in the thrashing of bremen stuttgart will be nicely rested after last weekend 's game so kaiserslautern should beware .

despite the green shoots of recovery growing over at the mercedes benz arena , few would have tipped jens keller 's team to thrash werder so comprehensively -lrb- i certainly did n't -rrb- .
but then kaiserslautern looked impressive last week , even though they evenutally lost against in-form leverkusen . this one could prove quite entertaining to watch .
prediction : 2-2 st. pauli – leverkusen pauli continue to slide and it 's already looking like an inevitable one towards what many people think is their rightful place in the relegation zone .
the neutral will hope they can arrest the decline but taking on leverkusen may not be the best place to start .
bayer have been quietly efficient in rising to third place and will be looking to make up ground on mainz in the place above them .
on form alone , it looks as though pauli will be deeper in the mire come saturday night .
prediction : leverkusen 3-1 mainz – hanover mainz in crisis !
two defeats on the bounce !
how easy it is to forget what an achievement this season has already been for mainz .
it is n't only their position which is impressive but the way they 've gotten there .
okay , so freiburg should never have beaten them last week – but only in the context of mainz 's amazing form to date .
last season , this would n't have been such a shock .
losing or drawing with hanover would n't have been either but on the evidence of this campaign alone , one would expect mainz to triumph .
prediction : mainz 2-0 sunday , nov 14 hoffenheim – freiburg despite winning last week , hoffenheim still dropped down the league , giving the illusion that their title charge has already petered out .
do n't be fooled .
the pendulum of form is swinging in the hoff 's direction and a win over freiburg will see them back in the mix .
freiburg had a great result against mainz and will have to be completely free of the hangover to cope with the hoff at home .
expecting the freiburgers to be well up for it as usual , this could be a tight affair .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 11.11.2010 gay outing case highlights ethics questions facing ugandan press großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attention-grabbing headline has caused a lot of upset when a new and unlicensed newspaper published photos of members of uganda 's gay community , it not only put them at risk of harassment but highlighted the lack of freedom in the country 's media . uganda 's rolling stone newspaper has only been in circulation since august , but the rag has already caused a splash both within and outside its national borders .
on two separate occasions the tabloid , which is in no way related to the us music magazine of the same name , has printed the identities and addresses of alleged homosexuals .
the campaign launched in october under the headline banner " 100 pictures of uganda 's top homos leak - hang them " has so far outed 29 people .
several of them have since been subjected to harassment and threats from members of the public .
transgender stosh mugisha is among the victims .
biologically a woman but living as a man , the 33-year old 's life has drastically changed since his photograph appeared in the rolling stone " men of shame " gallery .
“ i went to the shop where i usually buy cigarettes , " mugisha told deutsche welle .
" the woman told me ' i do n't sell cigarettes to faggots ' , so i left . "
on his way home passers-by threw verbal abuse and even stones at him .
although he was not physically hurt , he has since had to move away for fear of a more serious attack .
interim ruling in light of the controversial pictures and following a petition from the gay rights group , sexual minorities uganda , the high court ordered rolling stone , which is not yet in possession of a license , to cease publication .
judge vincent musoke kibuuka described the public outing as an invasion of the right to privacy of the individuals identified .
yet the ruling is only temporary and will be reviewed at a hearing later this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the colors of gay pride are not visible on the streets of kampala the newspaper 's managing editor , giles muhame , is confident that he will be able to resume what he says is his duty to expose evils in society before the month is out .
" the main case comes up on november 23 , we shall challenge it , we shall defeat them , the interim order will be quashed , " he said .
in an editor 's note written to accompany the publication of his " men of shame part ii , " muhame cited his motivation for printing the pictures as an attempt to stop a " cross-section of heartless homosexuals " from recruiting and brainwashing unsuspecting kids into gay circles .
it is this allegation in particular that stosh mugisha found hurtful and distasteful .
" how do you recruit someone into something they do not want ? , " he asked . " homosexuality is inborn , you can not start it by going into schools , it 's not like you are looking for votes . ”
ethical issues but the editor begs to differ , and has said he will not quit his printing spree until members of the gay community " stop enrolling minors in their circles . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' most ugandans do n't support gay rights , ' one official said .
where the situation goes from here will depend at least to some extent on whether or not the country 's media council , tasked with promoting responsible and ethical journalism , decides to issue rolling stone with a license .
peter mwesige , executive director of the african center for media excellence , said the council would have to be seriously outraged not to .
but given the debate in the country last year over the introduction of the death penalty for some homosexual acts , that outrage might be hard to come by .
" most people in the society we live in do not support the idea that homosexuals deserve any rights , " mwesige told deutsche welle .
although the council , which freedom house notes " has been criticized for its lack of independence , " has a code of ethics on issues such as invasion of privacy , the guidelines are regularly flouted and many a blind eye is turned .
just so long as there are no officials involved .
" the government does n't pay attention to ethics , " mwesige said .
" but when the stories are politically sensitive , it cares . "
spotlight on human rights that became blatantly obvious last year when the government , under president yoweri museveni , closed four radio stations on the grounds that they were inciting racial hatred .
besides curtailing press freedom , the " write-anything-about-anyone-but-nothing-about-me " modus operandi also highlights another problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the might of the government geoffrey wokulira ssebaggala , programs co-coordinator at human rights network for journalists in uganda , says one of the biggest challenges facing the country 's media today is the establishment of a culture of professionalism .
" people write about anything , and they do n't mind if it infringes on others ' rights , " ssebaggala told deutsche welle .
" those managing media in uganda have no knowledge of human rights . "
he says it is crucial to change the status quo , but that doing so will require a complete rethink on the parts of publishers , broadcasters , proprietors and most of all the government .
" there 's a lot that needs to be done , " he said .
" but as long as we 're not challenging power it is not seen as a threat . "

the greek finance ministry has said it has narrowly missed its january-october target to reduce its budget deficit .
the unwelcome news comes as the eu said it would take action to support ireland , if needed . the greek public deficit has fallen sharply since the implementation of an eu-imf rescue package for the debt-stricken country , but efforts to reduce the shortfall have still fallen short of the targets set for this year .
greece , struggling with a huge public deficit , came close to default in may and had to be bailed out with a 110-billion-euro package arranged by the eu and international monetary fund .
through october , greek public finances showed a deficit of some 17.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 24 billion -rrb- , down 30 percent from the same period a year ago , but still less than the 32 percent target .
the government in athens has implemented a series of draconian reforms aimed at restoring its financial credibility .
it cut spending by 7 percent , or four billion euros , but tax revenues only grew 3.7 percent , well short of the 2010 target of 13.7 percent .
at the same time as this announcement , the european union moved to reassure financial markets on thursday that it was ready to support ireland as the eurozone country 's debt woes made waves at the g20 summit in south korea .
ireland has worst deficit in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu is poised to help ireland too , barroso said concern about ireland is growing after irish bond yields soared to a record level of 8.28 percent on wednesday . as a result , european commission president jose manuel barroso found himself compelled to announce that the eu stood ready to help ireland " in case of need . "
" what is important now is that we have all the necessary instruments in place , " barroso said in the south korean capital , seoul , ahead of the g20 meeting .
" we are monitoring the situation in ireland on a permanent basis , " he added .
the rise in irish bond yields has unsettled investors and put the entire european bond market under serious strain .
ireland is trying to tackle the worst budget deficit in the eu and convince markets that it does not need a greek-style bailout .

the construction group acs handed in its offer to german financial supervisors bafin , which now has 15 days to deliberate . spain 's largest construction group acs presented its offer for german rival hochtief to germany 's financial supervisory authority bafin on thursday .
bafin now has 15 days to rule on the takeover bid , and hochtief shareholders then have a further four weeks to decide whether to accept the offer .
acs , which already holds just under 30 percent of hochtief , germany 's largest public works construction company , wants to take a controlling stake in the business .
it is seeking an all-share swap to create what would become one of the world 's leading construction firms .
however , acs has offered a price below hochtief 's current market value of around 4.3 billion euros -lrb- 5.9 billion dollars -rrb- , which hochtief sees as unfair .
preventative strategies herbert luetkestratkoetter , head of hochtief , said the company considers the acs bid to be hostile and is " definitely " planning further strategic action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees protested against acs in october hochtief 's chief financial officer burkard lohr refused to rule out a capital increase or a convertible loan to refinance the company .
both measures would increase the number of hochtief shares and thus make a takeover bid more difficult .
another option is for essen-based hochtief to puts its subsidiary concessions on the stock market , even if it means separating itself from that part of its business . concessions ' main activity is the operation of airports and toll-roads .
at the same time the german firm is trying to force the spanish group to make a bid for hochtief 's australian subsidiary leighton , thereby increasing the price , and possibly discouraging acs .
acs could instead carry out a capital increase of 78.5 million euros -lrb- 107.6 million dollars -rrb- , which is to be approved during an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on november 19 .

the report says corruption both affected cost for business development but also crippled countries in efforts to ward off poverty as money used in corrupt payments was not being spent on job creation .
sri mulyani indrawati , world bank managing director said the consequences of corruption also go beyond simply the economic impact .
" over time it becomes a real barrier to development , innovation and business growth because sometimes the corruption is in the form of counterfeit drugs so better don ’ t get better or they die , " he said .
" sometime corruption is a building that collapses in the face of national disaster because the quality inspector took a payment from the construction contractor to falsify an inspection .
corruption can kill . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva says there is no " good corruption " no " good corruption " but sri mulyani , a former indonesian finance minister , in comments seen as targeting indonesian politicians who resisted reforms while she was minister said while progress had been made in curbing corruption in indonesia , there was still much to do .
" i see the transformation in my own country , " said sri mulyani . " it is true there is much to be done still .
corruption remains intertwined with politics and there are brazen attacks on those fighting corruption .
we are not alone in that regard .
nonetheless , corruption is an issue that no politician can ignore in indonesia . "
thailand ’ s prime minister abhisit vejjajiva , said despite efforts in thailand corruption remained endemic and was widely accepted within the community : " significantly , even today young people in my country tell me that they expect to see corruption everywhere .
an unbelievable percentage of people also say it is ok for politicians to be corrupt as long as they are capable of bringing economic prosperity .
rampant corruption can exist amid high economic growth .
citizens must be prudently aware that there is no such thing as ' good corruption ' . "
reports put the annual cost of corruption in thailand at around $ 3.0 billion a year .
in a local initiative , more than two dozen thai companies agreed to form a collective alliance to work against corruption .
the directors ’ institute says as many as 200 companies can be expected to join the alliance by next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian protesters demanded that the president should quit over two corruption scandals corruption contributes to inequality but for asian development bank president , haruhiko kuroda , the economic costs of corruption have a wider impact on the community .
" corruption is a tax on the poor , " he said . " corruption and weak governance in general undermine government revenues resulting in poor infrastructure and hinders the pace of poverty reduction .
it also contributes to inequalities in access to education , health , infrastructure and other productive assets .
and it is the poor and the vulnerable that inevitably bear the brunt . "
u.s. secretary of state hilary clinton , in a pre-recorded video statement , stressed the wider impact of corruption from business , politics , and democracy and as a factor in causing malnutrition .
but officials say while the issue of corruption was more openly discussed and legislation strengthened , enforcement remained a problem .
also for many countries where corruption remained rampant there was still some way to go to reduce its impact across societies .

but he had a host of other issues in his luggage as he mets chinese president hu jintao on the sidelines of the summit . there was no shortage of issues awaiting us president barack obama even before the g20 summit began on thursday in seoul .
obama was scheduled to meet both chinese president hu jintao and south korean president lee myung-bak parallel to the summit .
for the latter , the most pressing agenda item was expected to be the ratification of a pending free trade deal that us and south korean diplomats from both sides have been hashing out over the past two days .
despite a number of sticking points , including disagreement on autos and beef trade , myung-bak and obama agreed in a telephone conversation last week to strive for agreement before the g20 .
on thursday morning , news broke that the two sides failed to reach an agreement on a free-trade accord , but said talks would continue after the g20 summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama faces a complex meeting with hu jintao yet the meeting was also be laden with symbolic value , as howard loewen , researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , said .
" i think they want to reaffirm the security alliance between the south korea and the us , for the protection of south korea , " loewen told deutsche welle ahead of the meeting on wednesday .
" which is of course a message for north korea and china . "
chinese tension the meeting with jintao is likely to be more general and possibly less conclusive , however .
apart from recent disagreements over currency issues and accusations of protectionism , the americans are consistently calling on china to take on more responsibility .
" if you 're a big country , you have the power to sit at the table in the biggest forums , but you have to be willing to take on responsibility , and i think that will be a subject of conversation , " says loewen .
for its part , china is wary of obama 's diplomacy drive in asia , particularly us attempts to assert a position in multilateral bodies .
next year the us will join the east asia summit , an annual forum of east asian countries , and loewen believes that obama is consciously going beyond the network of bilateral relations the us maintains with likes of japan , south korea , the philippines and thailand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will join the east asia summit next year " the us is showing more diplomatic initiatives in southeast asia than it did in the bush era , " said loewen .
" at the same time , the us wants to engage more in the multilateral regulation of problems .
you really ca n't say that the us is retreating in the region - on the contrary , it is pushing ahead more . "
" of course , the chinese are not keen on seeing the us engaging themselves more , " he added .
" because they fear that the us could rival their influence , which of course it does .
the chinese are getting nervous . "
multilateral vs. bilateral perhaps for this reason china has made one regional issue a taboo for multilateral talks .
pascal abb of the german institute of global and area studies , told deutsche welle , " china has made it clear that it does not want the territorial conflicts in the south china seas to be discussed multilaterally , but that is the central conflict in the region . "
the conflict is over a number of tiny islands in the south china seas – china , taiwan , vietnam , the philippines and malaysia all lay claim to the islands , mainly because of the rich natural resources in the area , as well as the trade routes that run through these waters .
but china 's refusal to allow the matter to be discussed multilaterally effectively scuppers any chance of progress .
" i do n't see how overlapping territorial conflicts can be solved bilaterally , " says abb , " simply because no third country is likely to accept an agreement that two other states have reached . "
political gamble but for obama , the recent mid-term elections mean that what some people call his " multilateral gamble " may be under more pressure .
while the new strength in the republican party does not extend to controlling the senate , which has more control over us foreign policy , some believe that if obama 's attempts to assert himself in asia do not bear economic fruit , he may hand the republicans extra ammunition in the 2012 presidential election .
but that is still a long term concern .
for now , the republicans are unlikely to gain much traction with such attacks .
" it could be that the republicans want to assert their foreign policies now , and may make demands like that , " says loewen .
" but i think it wo n't be that serious , because there are no multilateral commitments .
it is easier to go back on multilateral agreements , so i do n't think that will play a big role . "

but only a few come to remember the german soldiers who died on flanders fields in wwi . a bugle sounded across flanders fields on thursday .
the " last post " used to mark the end of a day on the battlefields and still today it is played as a haunting reminder of the hundreds of thousands of men who laid down their lives along this stretch of the western front during world war i. wreaths of blood-red poppies will be laid at the foot of rows upon rows of white headstones in the commonwealth cemeteries .
but one war memorial will remain silent and empty on armistice day .
the langemark cemetery is the final resting place of 44,294 german soldiers .
more than half of them are buried in one mass grave , the kameraden grab , their names etched on large dark plaques running alongside the site .
" it 's a tragedy that hardly anyone comes here .
least of all the germans themselves , many of whom know very little about what happened , " andre de bruin , a world war i guide and founder of over the top tours , told deutsche welle .
two million german casualties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on some of the cemeteries , not even headstones were permitted andre points to rows of gravestones that lie flat on the ground , explaining : " belgium imposed very strict restrictions on german memorials .
headstones were not allowed to stand , not like those of the commonwealth soldiers and there were many other rules that applied only to germans . "
there were hundreds of burial sites of german soldiers after 1918 but in the 1950s , belgium ordered that the bodies be regrouped in no more than four sites , of which langemark is one .
" it was probably done out of hatred for what happened , especially during world war ii when belgium was occupied .
they even forbade the use of crosses above the headstones , " de bruin said .
germany lost nearly two million men in the first world war , the greatest number of casualties suffered by any nation .
yet for decades , this chapter of history was hardly taught at german schools .
today , the care of german memorials in western flanders , where some of the bloodiest battles took place , is carried out by a voluntary association , the german war graves commission , and its grounds are tended by students .
at the back of langemark , rain-sodden fields stretch ahead , the same ground that turned into a giant , water-clogged inferno of craters and trenches almost a century ago .
it is here that 3,000 german students were killed in 1914 .
" they had received just six weeks basic training before they were sent to the front to accompany german soldiers in what was meant to be a triumphant march to victory .
but they were all killed in the ensuing battles , " andre explained .
" these men died in the same horrific battles as everyone here and yet on armistice day they will lie mostly unremembered , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flanders saw some of wwi 's bloodiest battles only few visitors from germany only a tiny number of germans come to this part of belgium whereas thousands come to visit the commonwealth graves from as far away as australia .
a visitors ' book at langemark shows that most visitors are british school children , who visit the site as part of their trips around ypres .
" we always bring the children here as part of our tours of the world war i sites .
we feel that german families mourned their dead just as british or belgian families would have done , " leonie giles , a teacher at st nicholas school in north-west england , told deutsche welle .
a colleague added that " the aura here is very different , it 's very somber compared to the pristine white cemeteries where the british are buried , which are more like english gardens .
but we want our kids to realize that these soldiers were just like the british who died for king and country . "
simon , a thirteen-year old carrying a small wooden cross with a poppy , said : " it 's so vast , that mass grave .
and it 's such a sad place .
i feel very emotional . "
remains of soldiers are still found in this area every year , and these are added to the mass grave .
but these days , their burials are done with full military honors and are attended by officials from germany and belgium - a sign perhaps that , in time , more recognition will be given to these men who volunteered to lay down their lives .
" deutschland muss leben auch wenn wir sterben muessen , " reads the plaque above their graves .
germany must live even if we must die .

the greek finance ministry has said it has narrowly missed its january-october target to reduce its budget deficit .
the unwelcome news comes as the eu said it would take action to support ireland , if needed . the greek public deficit has fallen sharply since the implementation of an eu-imf rescue package for the debt-stricken country , but efforts to reduce the shortfall have still fallen short of the targets set for this year .
greece , struggling with a huge public deficit , came close to default in may and had to be bailed out with a 110-billion-euro package arranged by the eu and international monetary fund .
through october , greek public finances showed a deficit of some 17.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 24 billion -rrb- , down 30 percent from the same period a year ago , but still less than the 32 percent target .
the government in athens has implemented a series of draconian reforms aimed at restoring its financial credibility .
it cut spending by 7 percent , or four billion euros , but tax revenues only grew 3.7 percent , well short of the 2010 target of 13.7 percent .
at the same time as this announcement , the european union moved to reassure financial markets on thursday that it was ready to support ireland as the eurozone country 's debt woes made waves at the g20 summit in south korea .
ireland has worst deficit in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu is poised to help ireland too , barroso said concern about ireland is growing after irish bond yields soared to a record level of 8.28 percent on wednesday . as a result , european commission president jose manuel barroso found himself compelled to announce that the eu stood ready to help ireland " in case of need . "
" what is important now is that we have all the necessary instruments in place , " barroso said in the south korean capital , seoul , ahead of the g20 meeting .
" we are monitoring the situation in ireland on a permanent basis , " he added .
the rise in irish bond yields has unsettled investors and put the entire european bond market under serious strain .
ireland is trying to tackle the worst budget deficit in the eu and convince markets that it does not need a greek-style bailout .

each year , november 11 marks the kick-off of carnival in cologne . november tends to be dreary in germany 's rhineland region , but the city of cologne looks forward to one bright spot in the month each year .
on november 11 - at exactly 11:11 a.m. - carnival begins !
on the mid-november day , it 's perfectly normal to leave the house in the morning and run across people in all sorts of costumes along the way .
they 're often heading downtown , loaded up with beer and liquor and ready to meet up with other revelers to get the festival started .
carnival is more than just a tradition in the city ; it 's part of cologne 's cultural identity .
bildunterschrift : clown costumes are a favorite , but everything from witches to cows to politicians also hits the streets carnival has its origins in a number of different eras .
ancient greeks and romans honored the god dionysos with a festival featuring " women , wine and song . "
germanic tribes also celebrated the shift to winter as a way of driving away wicked winter demons .
christianity took on the custom later in order to usher in lent .
the latin root , " carne vale , " of the german term " karneval " roughly translates to " farewell to meat . "
rose monday these days , the festival in cologne is organized and hosted by over 100 local carnival associations .
the associations host events during the year 's so-called " fifth season " featuring all sorts of entertainment , from music and dancing to witty political commentary .
in february each year , the world-famous rose monday parade rounds out the carnival season .
hundreds of thousands of visitors head to cologne to party for days and participate in the parades .
november 11 is when the fun gets started , but - except for the members of the carnival associations - the festival remains largely out of sight through the holiday season .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 11.11.2010 mongolia 's role in eurasia is on the up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mongolia is rich in resources when china restricted its export of rare earth materials earlier this year , the european union , japan and the us may want to look to mongolia . the small country between russia and china has less then three million people – but is one of the few countries in the world that is believed to have large resources of rare earths .
extraction would be expensive , but there is interest in the us as well as in japan in working with mongolia to extract these resources , says dr. michael j. green .
he served as senior director for asian affairs at the national security council under president george w. bush .
speaking at an event of the jamestown foundation in washington dc , green says : " this is an opportunity for mongolia to refocus .
around this can be built some bilateral or multilateral investment guarantees , things that china does n't do .
mongolia as part of its brand can say , ' we will honor our contracts and not violate the wto by embargoing exports ' . "
and it is not only rare earths that make mongolia attractive .
a little over a year ago , the mongolian government signed a four billion mining deal with a canadian-based company and its anglo-australian partner .
the companies will jointly develop a project in a location thought to hold one of the world 's largest copper and gold reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gold mine in mongolia the us as " a third neighbor " the us , green says , can play a critical role in helping mongolia 's security and economy by being a " third neighbor " – in addition to china and russia – that helps to " galvanize broader relationships for mongolia throughout the world " .
one reason is democracy .
as recently as 20 years ago , mongolia achieved its independence from the ussr through a peaceful democratic revolution .
" mongolia sits in a belt of poor governance and democracy , stretching from beijing to russia - where despite what was said about some economic success , let 's face it : russian democracy is going backwards – to central asia , to belarus , " explains michael green .
" you really have to go thousands and thousands of miles from ulan bator in some directions before you find a functioning democracy that is as successful , despite challenges , as mongolia .
and that is an example that should be important to the us and the west . "
batchimeg migeddorj , national security advisor to the president of mongolia , attributes it to the special circumstances that mongolia was able to develop a democracy .
he says : " exactly during that time , in the nineties , our two neighbors , china and russia , were concentrating more on internal affairs .
that provided mongolias politicians and political parties with more room to work internally to stabilize institutions . "
sending troops to afghanistan but besides being a model democracy , there is more .
mongolia has sent troops to iraq that have been very effective , according to green , " taking risks a lot of nato countries are n't willing to take in terms of being in the line of fire " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us president bush on a visit to mongolia " today , mongolia has about a platoon , helping with perimeter security for the germans in afghanistan , " says green .
he argues that mongolia has more credibility in demanding transparency from china 's military .
at the same time , he says , the us can not compete with russia and china , so the americans have a strong interest that mongolia develops strong ties with other democratic countries like japan ; korea , the eu , india .
colonel munch-ochir dorjjugder , who served as the director for international cooperation of the mongolian ministry of defense and is now a fellow at the brookings institution , rejects the negative assessment that mongolia is " torn " between russia and china .
nevertheless , he observes mongolia 's " identity dilemma " between northeast-asia and eurasia but comes to the conclusion : " we can promote both agendas as our regional identity .
our culture and our background compels us to do so , our current geographic location compels us to do so , as does our good neighborly relations with russia and china and our interest in seeking third neighbors elsewhere . "

despite the fact that most of the country 's mineral resources are close to the chinese border , the mongolian government decided to develop a railway infrastructure within the country and towards the russian border rather than towards china .

extraction would be expensive , but there is interest in the us as well as in japan in working with mongolia to extract these resources , says dr. michael j. green .
he served as senior director for asian affairs at the national security council under president george w. bush .
speaking at an event of the jamestown foundation in washington dc , green says : " this is an opportunity for mongolia to refocus .
around this can be built some bilateral or multilateral investment guarantees , things that china does n't do .
mongolia as part of its brand can say , ' we will honor our contracts and not violate the wto by embargoing exports ' . "
and it is not only rare earths that make mongolia attractive .
a little over a year ago , the mongolian government signed a four billion mining deal with a canadian-based company and its anglo-australian partner .
the companies will jointly develop a project in a location thought to hold one of the world 's largest copper and gold reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gold mine in mongolia the us as " a third neighbor " the us , green says , can play a critical role in helping mongolia 's security and economy by being a " third neighbor " – in addition to china and russia – that helps to " galvanize broader relationships for mongolia throughout the world " .
one reason is democracy .
as recently as 20 years ago , mongolia achieved its independence from the ussr through a peaceful democratic revolution .
" mongolia sits in a belt of poor governance and democracy , stretching from beijing to russia - where despite what was said about some economic success , let 's face it : russian democracy is going backwards – to central asia , to belarus , " explains michael green .
" you really have to go thousands and thousands of miles from ulan bator in some directions before you find a functioning democracy that is as successful , despite challenges , as mongolia .
and that is an example that should be important to the us and the west . "
batchimeg migeddorj , national security advisor to the president of mongolia , attributes it to the special circumstances that mongolia was able to develop a democracy .
he says : " exactly during that time , in the nineties , our two neighbors , china and russia , were concentrating more on internal affairs .
that provided mongolias politicians and political parties with more room to work internally to stabilize institutions . "
sending troops to afghanistan but besides being a model democracy , there is more .
mongolia has sent troops to iraq that have been very effective , according to green , " taking risks a lot of nato countries are n't willing to take in terms of being in the line of fire " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us president bush on a visit to mongolia " today , mongolia has about a platoon , helping with perimeter security for the germans in afghanistan , " says green .
he argues that mongolia has more credibility in demanding transparency from china 's military .
at the same time , he says , the us can not compete with russia and china , so the americans have a strong interest that mongolia develops strong ties with other democratic countries like japan ; korea , the eu , india .
colonel munch-ochir dorjjugder , who served as the director for international cooperation of the mongolian ministry of defense and is now a fellow at the brookings institution , rejects the negative assessment that mongolia is " torn " between russia and china .
nevertheless , he observes mongolia 's " identity dilemma " between northeast-asia and eurasia but comes to the conclusion : " we can promote both agendas as our regional identity .
our culture and our background compels us to do so , our current geographic location compels us to do so , as does our good neighborly relations with russia and china and our interest in seeking third neighbors elsewhere . "

they say they ’ re willing to go to the highest european court . tom freeman and katherine doyle are a heterosexual couple applying for a civil partnership – a form of legal union available only to same-sex couples .
they are one of four heterosexual couples and four same-sex couples trying to challenge the current uk legislation on marriage and civil partnerships .
" initially our aim was equality but increasingly as we look critically at marriage , we feel it is not relevant to us , " katherine doyle told deutsche welle .
" we really do want a civil partnership .
in our day-to-day lives we are more like partners . "
" the important question for us is : why should n't we have a civil partnership , " her partner tom added .
" the institution is being provided for by law so why should n't i have one ? "
gay couples in britain have been allowed to enter into civil partnerships since 2004 , which gives them all the same legal rights and responsibilities as a civil marriage . however they are denied a civil marriage certificate .
on the other hand heterosexual couples do not qualify to enter a civil partnership .
they can either get married or not .
a violation of human rights ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom freeman and katherine doyle are prepared to fight for years working alongside the gay rights group outrage , the eight couples argue that denying each group the legal rights of the other is discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation , something which is contrary to britain 's human rights act . yet tom and katherine 's application has been refused so far .
all they got was a short statement from the town hall , saying that " a civil partnership is a relationship between two people of the same sex . "
the eight couples are one by one each week applying to their local town halls for either a marriage certificate , or a civil partnership certificate , whichever is denied them by law .
at the end of two months , if all applications are turned down , as they are expected to be , the couples will begin a high court challenge . it is the first time that heterosexual couples have taken such an active role in a campaign which at first glance might appear to benefit gay couples wanting equality and a full marriage .
all the way to the european court of human rights the civil partnerships act of 2004 was introduced by the then labour government with wide support in parliament .
it gives same-sex couples the same legal rights and responsibilities as civil marriage .
there also is a formal process for dissolving partnerships which is akin to divorce , but gay rights activists still criticize that it does n't grant full marriage status to gay couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil partnerships exist in most eu member states " when all eight couples - gay and straight - have filed their applications and have been refused we 'll then consult with our legal advisers with a view to bringing the case to the courts , " peter tatchell of the group outrage , which is leading the equal love campaign , told deutsche welle .
" there ’ s a very strong argument that the twin bans on gay marriages and heterosexual civil partnerships are illegal under the human rights act , " he added .
tatchell says the group is prepared to take the case all the way to the european court of human rights if necessary . public opinion backs gay marriage in response to the campaign , the government has issued a statement saying that it is currently considering the next steps for civil partnerships . it said that earlier this year ministers met with people and organizations holding a range of views and that they are looking at the best way to take those views forward . the equal love campaign argues that public attitudes have shifted strongly in favor of allowing gay couples to marry , citing an opinion poll carried out by the group populus in june 2009 , which found that 61 percent of the public believe gay couples should be allowed to marry , while 33 percent disagreed . however , if there is a change in the law , it is not likely to come soon .
" it could take five to ten years to go through the courts , " said katherine doyle .
" but we really feel that we ca n't commit to marriage when it 's exclusive . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 11.11.2010 obama , seoul , and multilateral ambitions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants to reaffirm ties with south korea , but has other concerns barack obama traveled to south korea ahead of this week 's g20 summit .
but he had a host of other issues in his luggage as he mets chinese president hu jintao on the sidelines of the summit . there was no shortage of issues awaiting us president barack obama even before the g20 summit began on thursday in seoul .
obama was scheduled to meet both chinese president hu jintao and south korean president lee myung-bak parallel to the summit .
for the latter , the most pressing agenda item was expected to be the ratification of a pending free trade deal that us and south korean diplomats from both sides have been hashing out over the past two days .
despite a number of sticking points , including disagreement on autos and beef trade , myung-bak and obama agreed in a telephone conversation last week to strive for agreement before the g20 .
on thursday morning , news broke that the two sides failed to reach an agreement on a free-trade accord , but said talks would continue after the g20 summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama faces a complex meeting with hu jintao yet the meeting was also be laden with symbolic value , as howard loewen , researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , said .
" i think they want to reaffirm the security alliance between the south korea and the us , for the protection of south korea , " loewen told deutsche welle ahead of the meeting on wednesday .
" which is of course a message for north korea and china . "
chinese tension the meeting with jintao is likely to be more general and possibly less conclusive , however .
apart from recent disagreements over currency issues and accusations of protectionism , the americans are consistently calling on china to take on more responsibility .
" if you 're a big country , you have the power to sit at the table in the biggest forums , but you have to be willing to take on responsibility , and i think that will be a subject of conversation , " says loewen .
for its part , china is wary of obama 's diplomacy drive in asia , particularly us attempts to assert a position in multilateral bodies .
next year the us will join the east asia summit , an annual forum of east asian countries , and loewen believes that obama is consciously going beyond the network of bilateral relations the us maintains with likes of japan , south korea , the philippines and thailand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will join the east asia summit next year " the us is showing more diplomatic initiatives in southeast asia than it did in the bush era , " said loewen .
" at the same time , the us wants to engage more in the multilateral regulation of problems .
you really ca n't say that the us is retreating in the region - on the contrary , it is pushing ahead more . "
" of course , the chinese are not keen on seeing the us engaging themselves more , " he added .
" because they fear that the us could rival their influence , which of course it does .
the chinese are getting nervous . "
multilateral vs. bilateral perhaps for this reason china has made one regional issue a taboo for multilateral talks .
pascal abb of the german institute of global and area studies , told deutsche welle , " china has made it clear that it does not want the territorial conflicts in the south china seas to be discussed multilaterally , but that is the central conflict in the region . "
the conflict is over a number of tiny islands in the south china seas – china , taiwan , vietnam , the philippines and malaysia all lay claim to the islands , mainly because of the rich natural resources in the area , as well as the trade routes that run through these waters .
but china 's refusal to allow the matter to be discussed multilaterally effectively scuppers any chance of progress .
" i do n't see how overlapping territorial conflicts can be solved bilaterally , " says abb , " simply because no third country is likely to accept an agreement that two other states have reached . "
political gamble but for obama , the recent mid-term elections mean that what some people call his " multilateral gamble " may be under more pressure .
while the new strength in the republican party does not extend to controlling the senate , which has more control over us foreign policy , some believe that if obama 's attempts to assert himself in asia do not bear economic fruit , he may hand the republicans extra ammunition in the 2012 presidential election .
but that is still a long term concern .
for now , the republicans are unlikely to gain much traction with such attacks .
" it could be that the republicans want to assert their foreign policies now , and may make demands like that , " says loewen .
" but i think it wo n't be that serious , because there are no multilateral commitments .
it is easier to go back on multilateral agreements , so i do n't think that will play a big role . "

it is designed to help children who might be struggling in school , as well as stretch high-achievers . nick treloar , a 15-year-old student at the french lycée in london , used to have a tutor come to the house .
but he finds the online tuition a more flexible alternative . " it 's a whenever-you-want system , " nick said .
" you can book the session for any time of day .
it 's you that says ' i want this hour to this hour . '
it 's your choice , so whenever you have a free period during the day , or you finish an hour earlier , then you can come home , and sit down and do this session . " nick 's tutor nathan is based thousands of miles away , in ludhiana , india .
nick has never even seen what his tutor looks like .
but he can hear him , as he guides nick through math problems on a white board that they can both see and write on - a more effective method than simply chatting with a camera on skype . a manageable structure nathan speaks fluent american english from having tutored us students online .
he is 31 years old , and has a five-year-old daughter .
he earns about eight euros -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- an hour , which he says is more than double what many people his age are earning in other professions in india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nathan carries out his work from punjab for him , tutoring is not just about the money , though , but the love of mentoring students and shaping their future .
nathan holds a master 's degree in mathematics and he has been handpicked and trained for the job .
he had already been tutoring american school kids via the web for three years before joining brightspark .
he said he was impressed with british students . " it 's a much better level with uk students , and often with some subjects , they start them much younger , " nathan said . the time difference between the uk and india is four-and-a-half hours , which nathan said is manageable .
he said if a british student books the latest session available , at 9 pm in the uk , it is 1:30 am in ludhiana . nathan is currently part of a team of 30 tutors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 11.11.2010 mongolia 's role in eurasia is on the up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mongolia is rich in resources when china restricted its export of rare earth materials earlier this year , the european union , japan and the us may want to look to mongolia . the small country between russia and china has less then three million people – but is one of the few countries in the world that is believed to have large resources of rare earths .
extraction would be expensive , but there is interest in the us as well as in japan in working with mongolia to extract these resources , says dr. michael j. green .
he served as senior director for asian affairs at the national security council under president george w. bush .
speaking at an event of the jamestown foundation in washington dc , green says : " this is an opportunity for mongolia to refocus .
around this can be built some bilateral or multilateral investment guarantees , things that china does n't do .
mongolia as part of its brand can say , ' we will honor our contracts and not violate the wto by embargoing exports ' . "
and it is not only rare earths that make mongolia attractive .
a little over a year ago , the mongolian government signed a four billion mining deal with a canadian-based company and its anglo-australian partner .
the companies will jointly develop a project in a location thought to hold one of the world 's largest copper and gold reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gold mine in mongolia the us as " a third neighbor " the us , green says , can play a critical role in helping mongolia 's security and economy by being a " third neighbor " – in addition to china and russia – that helps to " galvanize broader relationships for mongolia throughout the world " .
one reason is democracy .
as recently as 20 years ago , mongolia achieved its independence from the ussr through a peaceful democratic revolution .
" mongolia sits in a belt of poor governance and democracy , stretching from beijing to russia - where despite what was said about some economic success , let 's face it : russian democracy is going backwards – to central asia , to belarus , " explains michael green .
" you really have to go thousands and thousands of miles from ulan bator in some directions before you find a functioning democracy that is as successful , despite challenges , as mongolia .
and that is an example that should be important to the us and the west . "
batchimeg migeddorj , national security advisor to the president of mongolia , attributes it to the special circumstances that mongolia was able to develop a democracy .
he says : " exactly during that time , in the nineties , our two neighbors , china and russia , were concentrating more on internal affairs .
that provided mongolias politicians and political parties with more room to work internally to stabilize institutions . "
sending troops to afghanistan but besides being a model democracy , there is more .
mongolia has sent troops to iraq that have been very effective , according to green , " taking risks a lot of nato countries are n't willing to take in terms of being in the line of fire " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us president bush on a visit to mongolia " today , mongolia has about a platoon , helping with perimeter security for the germans in afghanistan , " says green .
he argues that mongolia has more credibility in demanding transparency from china 's military .
at the same time , he says , the us can not compete with russia and china , so the americans have a strong interest that mongolia develops strong ties with other democratic countries like japan ; korea , the eu , india .
colonel munch-ochir dorjjugder , who served as the director for international cooperation of the mongolian ministry of defense and is now a fellow at the brookings institution , rejects the negative assessment that mongolia is " torn " between russia and china .
nevertheless , he observes mongolia 's " identity dilemma " between northeast-asia and eurasia but comes to the conclusion : " we can promote both agendas as our regional identity .
our culture and our background compels us to do so , our current geographic location compels us to do so , as does our good neighborly relations with russia and china and our interest in seeking third neighbors elsewhere . "
seeking options besides china but mongolia is trying to seek more independence from china .
despite the fact that most of the country 's mineral resources are close to the chinese border , the mongolian government decided to develop a railway infrastructure within the country and towards the russian border rather than towards china .
80 percent of imported goods already come through china , dorjjugder says , and since china occasionally closes its borders or restricts exports , the decision will keep alternatives open .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out after the parliamentary election in 2008 mongolia 's new security concept is also a reaction to china 's challenge , says dr. alicia campi , president of the us-mongolia advisory group .
" while certainly mongolia does not want to lose its vigorous democracy and free market , and return to cold war era satellite status , policy makers increasingly are thinking that inviting much more sizable russian fdi -lrb- foreign direct investment -rrb- and military assistance are not bad ideas at all since western nations have so far proven slow to act and disappointing . "
at the same time , she says , mongolians are looking at the central asian states and on to iran and turkey as well as to the fast rising india .
they could play an alternative role in balancing both china and russia .
and in 2010 , iranian delegations have been buying mongolian meat and animal byproducts .
nobody should be surprised , says campi , if the iranians are examining options for investing in mongolia 's mineral sector .
this would give the us another reason to strengthen their ties with mongolia .

they claimed that the power-sharing deal they had been presented with was not being honoured and that three of the party 's most senior members , barred for their alleged ties to saddam 's baath party , had not been reinstated as promised . as well as the annulment of the bans against the three iraqiya members , iraqiya had presented a further three conditions on which its participation in the power-sharing agreement would hinge : a bill forming the security body , a committee examining cases against political detainees , and codifying the power-sharing deal . iraqiya 's support for any government is seen a hugely important if iraq is not to descend into ethnic violence once more .
the sunni arab minority , which gave iraqiya a narrow victory in the contested march 7 poll , provided the heaviest resistance in the anti-us insurgency after the 2003 invasion .
its involvement in any coalition is imperative if peace is to be achieved . iraqiya 's apparent rejection of the deal highlights the fierce divides and rivalries which have paralysed the iraqi political system since the fall of saddam hussein regime .
the deal , clinched late wednesday night after three days of high-pressure talks between the rival factions , saw shiite prime minister al-maliki returning to office for a second term . talabani , a kurd , is expected to retain the presidency .
and a sunni mp was to be elected as speaker of parliament .
maliki now has 30 days to form his cabinet , and the next parliamentary meeting is scheduled for saturday .
the decision offered hope that the next government would include enough sunni representation to lower the chances of a return to the sectarian violence that killed tens of thousands of people after the 2003 , u.s.-led invasion that ousted sunni dictator saddam hussein .
iraqiya , who had held out for months to take the premiership from maliki after it narrowly won more seats in the march election , initially confirmed it had finally signed up to the deal .
us praises deal the obama administration called the development " a big step forward for iraq . " " all along we 've said the best result would be a government that reflects the results of the elections , includes all the major blocs representing iraq 's ethnic and sectarian groups , and that does not exclude or marginalize anyone .
that 's exactly what iraqis seem to have agreed to , " antony blinken , national security adviser to us vice president joe biden , said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi prime minister ayad allawi 's group finally agreed to the deal iraq has been without a new government since the vote , which gave iraqiya two more seats than maliki 's bloc .
neither had enough for a majority in parliament , leaving the factions to negotiate a government .
iraqiya initially joined a kurdish alliance in supporting maliki following months of contentious negotiations which raised tensions in iraq as the army and police try to cement security gains against a stubborn insurgency .
last month , maliki toured capitals in the region - from iran and syria to turkey and egypt - to gain regional backing for his effort to stay in power .
he offered arab nations investment deals in iraq in exchange for nudging iraqiya toward a compromise , political sources said .
court pressure paid off over the past months , iraqiya repeatedly rejected another maliki term and demanded the right to form the government as the top vote winner in the election .
parliament met briefly in june but lawmakers said they needed more time to decide who would hold the highest offices .
last month , iraq 's high court ordered parliament to resume its sessions , putting pressure on politicians to expedite a deal .
the long deadlock has fueled tension even though the sectarian carnage unleashed after the 2003 invasion is receding while u.s. forces prepare to withdraw in 2011 .
a series of attacks on christian targets across baghdad on wednesday stirred renewed fear in the minority community .
the bomb and mortar blasts occurred just 10 days after a bloody siege at a catholic cathedral that killed 52 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 11.11.2010 obama , seoul , and multilateral ambitions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants to reaffirm ties with south korea , but has other concerns barack obama traveled to south korea ahead of this week 's g20 summit .
but he had a host of other issues in his luggage as he mets chinese president hu jintao on the sidelines of the summit . there was no shortage of issues awaiting us president barack obama even before the g20 summit began on thursday in seoul .
obama was scheduled to meet both chinese president hu jintao and south korean president lee myung-bak parallel to the summit .
for the latter , the most pressing agenda item was expected to be the ratification of a pending free trade deal that us and south korean diplomats from both sides have been hashing out over the past two days .
despite a number of sticking points , including disagreement on autos and beef trade , myung-bak and obama agreed in a telephone conversation last week to strive for agreement before the g20 .
on thursday morning , news broke that the two sides failed to reach an agreement on a free-trade accord , but said talks would continue after the g20 summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama faces a complex meeting with hu jintao yet the meeting was also be laden with symbolic value , as howard loewen , researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , said .
" i think they want to reaffirm the security alliance between the south korea and the us , for the protection of south korea , " loewen told deutsche welle ahead of the meeting on wednesday .
" which is of course a message for north korea and china . "
chinese tension the meeting with jintao is likely to be more general and possibly less conclusive , however .
apart from recent disagreements over currency issues and accusations of protectionism , the americans are consistently calling on china to take on more responsibility .
" if you 're a big country , you have the power to sit at the table in the biggest forums , but you have to be willing to take on responsibility , and i think that will be a subject of conversation , " says loewen .
for its part , china is wary of obama 's diplomacy drive in asia , particularly us attempts to assert a position in multilateral bodies .
next year the us will join the east asia summit , an annual forum of east asian countries , and loewen believes that obama is consciously going beyond the network of bilateral relations the us maintains with likes of japan , south korea , the philippines and thailand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will join the east asia summit next year " the us is showing more diplomatic initiatives in southeast asia than it did in the bush era , " said loewen .
" at the same time , the us wants to engage more in the multilateral regulation of problems .
you really ca n't say that the us is retreating in the region - on the contrary , it is pushing ahead more . "
" of course , the chinese are not keen on seeing the us engaging themselves more , " he added .
" because they fear that the us could rival their influence , which of course it does .
the chinese are getting nervous . "
multilateral vs. bilateral perhaps for this reason china has made one regional issue a taboo for multilateral talks .
pascal abb of the german institute of global and area studies , told deutsche welle , " china has made it clear that it does not want the territorial conflicts in the south china seas to be discussed multilaterally , but that is the central conflict in the region . "
the conflict is over a number of tiny islands in the south china seas – china , taiwan , vietnam , the philippines and malaysia all lay claim to the islands , mainly because of the rich natural resources in the area , as well as the trade routes that run through these waters .
but china 's refusal to allow the matter to be discussed multilaterally effectively scuppers any chance of progress .
" i do n't see how overlapping territorial conflicts can be solved bilaterally , " says abb , " simply because no third country is likely to accept an agreement that two other states have reached . "
political gamble but for obama , the recent mid-term elections mean that what some people call his " multilateral gamble " may be under more pressure .
while the new strength in the republican party does not extend to controlling the senate , which has more control over us foreign policy , some believe that if obama 's attempts to assert himself in asia do not bear economic fruit , he may hand the republicans extra ammunition in the 2012 presidential election .
but that is still a long term concern .
for now , the republicans are unlikely to gain much traction with such attacks .
" it could be that the republicans want to assert their foreign policies now , and may make demands like that , " says loewen .
" but i think it wo n't be that serious , because there are no multilateral commitments .
it is easier to go back on multilateral agreements , so i do n't think that will play a big role . "

i 'm a journalist from yemen . i live in germany .

i 'm muslim .

from germany it takes about six hours .

yet my journey to mecca starts here in germany , the country i live and work in .
and i 'm deliberately not traveling as a religious pilgrim , but as a neutral journalistic reporter .
my main goal is to provide non-muslim users with insights into the hajj pilgrimage - just as i was once introduced to easter , christmas , and other christian feasts .
as you may know , according to saudi arabia 's interpretation of islam , only muslims may visit the holy city of mecca .
however , it is allowed to let non-muslims know about it .
this is what i want to do as i tell you about my impressions , discoveries , and encounters with pilgrims from all over the world - and particularly from germany .
even many muslims know little more about the hajj than the pictures they get on television , which show religious rites and crowds pouring in .
i 'm sure that there 's a lot to find out about the hajj - so wo n't you join me on my journey of discovery ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : praying at the mosque in mecca would you like to know how , exactly , the religious rituals are performed ?

that the citizens of mecca once chased muhammad out of the city .

the hajj is one of them - a spiritual journey that is to be performed by every muslim who is healthy enough and can afford to do so .
examining my picture of saudi arabia i also want to examine my personal picture of saudi arabia - which is closely linked to my yemeni descent .
there were times when yemenis were allowed to enter the country without a visa .
older men , such as my grandfather , used to go on business trips to the country next door and bring us back precious presents .
but there was also a time - when saudi arabia and yemen were at serious odds about the kuwait war - that saudi arabian leaders expelled hundreds of thousands of yemeni " guest workers " from the country .
during this period , unemployment and poverty increased dramatically in yemen , and the number of students in my class went from 20 to 120 .
that is when i realized that islamic virtues such as solidarity and brotherhood can vanish into thin air when politics come into play .
and that a common belief does n't prevent people from committing human-rights violations .
i wonder what kind of experiences i will have in mecca ?
maybe they 'll be very different from what i expect .

even though , when considered from distance , i was born and spent the first 19 years of my life " right next door . " yemen is the poorest country of the arabian peninsula and has a common border with saudi arabia – one of the richest countries of the region and guardian of islam 's holy sites .
from yemen 's capital , sana 'a , it 's about a 90-minute flight from there to mecca .
from germany it takes about six hours .
reporter , not a pilgrim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali 's journey takes him from bonn to mecca .
yet my journey to mecca starts here in germany , the country i live and work in .
and i 'm deliberately not traveling as a religious pilgrim , but as a neutral journalistic reporter .
my main goal is to provide non-muslim users with insights into the hajj pilgrimage - just as i was once introduced to easter , christmas , and other christian feasts .
as you may know , according to saudi arabia 's interpretation of islam , only muslims may visit the holy city of mecca .
however , it is allowed to let non-muslims know about it .
this is what i want to do as i tell you about my impressions , discoveries , and encounters with pilgrims from all over the world - and particularly from germany .
even many muslims know little more about the hajj than the pictures they get on television , which show religious rites and crowds pouring in .
i 'm sure that there 's a lot to find out about the hajj - so wo n't you join me on my journey of discovery ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : praying at the mosque in mecca would you like to know how , exactly , the religious rituals are performed ?
what safety measures are taken ?
whether men and women go on their pilgrimage together ?
or whether conflicts between moderate and radical political groups in the islamic world influence the festivities ?
honestly , i do n't know many of the answers to these questions myself .
but whatever you may want to learn , i 'll try to find it out for you !
please post your questions and suggestions on deutsche welle 's facebook page : http : / / www.facebook.com / deutschewelle even though i will visit mecca as a journalist , this is anything but a " typical " reporting assignement to me .
maybe it 's like a catholic-raised journalist reporting from the vatican : you 're keeping a distance and reporting neutrally , but somehow the subject moves you more than , say , a piece about the latest tax reform .
learning about prophets , and people so i ca n't keep all my childhood memories separated from my thoughts about , and preparation for , my first trip to mecca .
specifically , my religion class in taiz , the town i was born in , comes to my mind .
they taught us that god is in heaven watching us .
that jews and christians share a lot of prophets with muslims except the last prophet and messenger of god : muhammad .
that the citizens of mecca once chased muhammad out of the city .
and that muhammad returned to mecca eight years later and destroyed the statues of false gods that had been built .
as a little boy i was deeply impressed and shaped by these religious basics .
today they inextricably belong to my personal cultural heritage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : our reporter hails from taiz , in yemen of course , at school , i also learned about the five religious duties of every muslim , the so-called five pillars of islam .
the hajj is one of them - a spiritual journey that is to be performed by every muslim who is healthy enough and can afford to do so .
examining my picture of saudi arabia i also want to examine my personal picture of saudi arabia - which is closely linked to my yemeni descent .
there were times when yemenis were allowed to enter the country without a visa .
older men , such as my grandfather , used to go on business trips to the country next door and bring us back precious presents .
but there was also a time - when saudi arabia and yemen were at serious odds about the kuwait war - that saudi arabian leaders expelled hundreds of thousands of yemeni " guest workers " from the country .
during this period , unemployment and poverty increased dramatically in yemen , and the number of students in my class went from 20 to 120 .
that is when i realized that islamic virtues such as solidarity and brotherhood can vanish into thin air when politics come into play .
and that a common belief does n't prevent people from committing human-rights violations .
i wonder what kind of experiences i will have in mecca ?
maybe they 'll be very different from what i expect .

but he had a host of other issues in his luggage as he mets chinese president hu jintao on the sidelines of the summit . there was no shortage of issues awaiting us president barack obama even before the g20 summit began on thursday in seoul .
obama was scheduled to meet both chinese president hu jintao and south korean president lee myung-bak parallel to the summit .
for the latter , the most pressing agenda item was expected to be the ratification of a pending free trade deal that us and south korean diplomats from both sides have been hashing out over the past two days .
despite a number of sticking points , including disagreement on autos and beef trade , myung-bak and obama agreed in a telephone conversation last week to strive for agreement before the g20 .
on thursday morning , news broke that the two sides failed to reach an agreement on a free-trade accord , but said talks would continue after the g20 summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama faces a complex meeting with hu jintao yet the meeting was also be laden with symbolic value , as howard loewen , researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , said .
" i think they want to reaffirm the security alliance between the south korea and the us , for the protection of south korea , " loewen told deutsche welle ahead of the meeting on wednesday .
" which is of course a message for north korea and china . "
chinese tension the meeting with jintao is likely to be more general and possibly less conclusive , however .
apart from recent disagreements over currency issues and accusations of protectionism , the americans are consistently calling on china to take on more responsibility .
" if you 're a big country , you have the power to sit at the table in the biggest forums , but you have to be willing to take on responsibility , and i think that will be a subject of conversation , " says loewen .
for its part , china is wary of obama 's diplomacy drive in asia , particularly us attempts to assert a position in multilateral bodies .
next year the us will join the east asia summit , an annual forum of east asian countries , and loewen believes that obama is consciously going beyond the network of bilateral relations the us maintains with likes of japan , south korea , the philippines and thailand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will join the east asia summit next year " the us is showing more diplomatic initiatives in southeast asia than it did in the bush era , " said loewen .
" at the same time , the us wants to engage more in the multilateral regulation of problems .
you really ca n't say that the us is retreating in the region - on the contrary , it is pushing ahead more . "
" of course , the chinese are not keen on seeing the us engaging themselves more , " he added .
" because they fear that the us could rival their influence , which of course it does .
the chinese are getting nervous . "
multilateral vs. bilateral perhaps for this reason china has made one regional issue a taboo for multilateral talks .
pascal abb of the german institute of global and area studies , told deutsche welle , " china has made it clear that it does not want the territorial conflicts in the south china seas to be discussed multilaterally , but that is the central conflict in the region . "
the conflict is over a number of tiny islands in the south china seas – china , taiwan , vietnam , the philippines and malaysia all lay claim to the islands , mainly because of the rich natural resources in the area , as well as the trade routes that run through these waters .
but china 's refusal to allow the matter to be discussed multilaterally effectively scuppers any chance of progress .
" i do n't see how overlapping territorial conflicts can be solved bilaterally , " says abb , " simply because no third country is likely to accept an agreement that two other states have reached . "
political gamble but for obama , the recent mid-term elections mean that what some people call his " multilateral gamble " may be under more pressure .
while the new strength in the republican party does not extend to controlling the senate , which has more control over us foreign policy , some believe that if obama 's attempts to assert himself in asia do not bear economic fruit , he may hand the republicans extra ammunition in the 2012 presidential election .
but that is still a long term concern .
for now , the republicans are unlikely to gain much traction with such attacks .
" it could be that the republicans want to assert their foreign policies now , and may make demands like that , " says loewen .
" but i think it wo n't be that serious , because there are no multilateral commitments .
it is easier to go back on multilateral agreements , so i do n't think that will play a big role . "

the greek finance ministry has said it has narrowly missed its january-october target to reduce its budget deficit .
the unwelcome news comes as the eu said it would take action to support ireland , if needed . the greek public deficit has fallen sharply since the implementation of an eu-imf rescue package for the debt-stricken country , but efforts to reduce the shortfall have still fallen short of the targets set for this year .
greece , struggling with a huge public deficit , came close to default in may and had to be bailed out with a 110-billion-euro package arranged by the eu and international monetary fund .
through october , greek public finances showed a deficit of some 17.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 24 billion -rrb- , down 30 percent from the same period a year ago , but still less than the 32 percent target .
the government in athens has implemented a series of draconian reforms aimed at restoring its financial credibility .
it cut spending by 7 percent , or four billion euros , but tax revenues only grew 3.7 percent , well short of the 2010 target of 13.7 percent .
at the same time as this announcement , the european union moved to reassure financial markets on thursday that it was ready to support ireland as the eurozone country 's debt woes made waves at the g20 summit in south korea .
ireland has worst deficit in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu is poised to help ireland too , barroso said concern about ireland is growing after irish bond yields soared to a record level of 8.28 percent on wednesday . as a result , european commission president jose manuel barroso found himself compelled to announce that the eu stood ready to help ireland " in case of need . "
" what is important now is that we have all the necessary instruments in place , " barroso said in the south korean capital , seoul , ahead of the g20 meeting .
" we are monitoring the situation in ireland on a permanent basis , " he added .
the rise in irish bond yields has unsettled investors and put the entire european bond market under serious strain .
ireland is trying to tackle the worst budget deficit in the eu and convince markets that it does not need a greek-style bailout .

extraction would be expensive , but there is interest in the us as well as in japan in working with mongolia to extract these resources , says dr. michael j. green .
he served as senior director for asian affairs at the national security council under president george w. bush .
speaking at an event of the jamestown foundation in washington dc , green says : " this is an opportunity for mongolia to refocus .
around this can be built some bilateral or multilateral investment guarantees , things that china does n't do .
mongolia as part of its brand can say , ' we will honor our contracts and not violate the wto by embargoing exports ' . "
and it is not only rare earths that make mongolia attractive .
a little over a year ago , the mongolian government signed a four billion mining deal with a canadian-based company and its anglo-australian partner .
the companies will jointly develop a project in a location thought to hold one of the world 's largest copper and gold reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gold mine in mongolia the us as " a third neighbor " the us , green says , can play a critical role in helping mongolia 's security and economy by being a " third neighbor " – in addition to china and russia – that helps to " galvanize broader relationships for mongolia throughout the world " .
one reason is democracy .
as recently as 20 years ago , mongolia achieved its independence from the ussr through a peaceful democratic revolution .
" mongolia sits in a belt of poor governance and democracy , stretching from beijing to russia - where despite what was said about some economic success , let 's face it : russian democracy is going backwards – to central asia , to belarus , " explains michael green .
" you really have to go thousands and thousands of miles from ulan bator in some directions before you find a functioning democracy that is as successful , despite challenges , as mongolia .
and that is an example that should be important to the us and the west . "
batchimeg migeddorj , national security advisor to the president of mongolia , attributes it to the special circumstances that mongolia was able to develop a democracy .
he says : " exactly during that time , in the nineties , our two neighbors , china and russia , were concentrating more on internal affairs .
that provided mongolias politicians and political parties with more room to work internally to stabilize institutions . "
sending troops to afghanistan but besides being a model democracy , there is more .
mongolia has sent troops to iraq that have been very effective , according to green , " taking risks a lot of nato countries are n't willing to take in terms of being in the line of fire " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us president bush on a visit to mongolia " today , mongolia has about a platoon , helping with perimeter security for the germans in afghanistan , " says green .
he argues that mongolia has more credibility in demanding transparency from china 's military .
at the same time , he says , the us can not compete with russia and china , so the americans have a strong interest that mongolia develops strong ties with other democratic countries like japan ; korea , the eu , india .
colonel munch-ochir dorjjugder , who served as the director for international cooperation of the mongolian ministry of defense and is now a fellow at the brookings institution , rejects the negative assessment that mongolia is " torn " between russia and china .
nevertheless , he observes mongolia 's " identity dilemma " between northeast-asia and eurasia but comes to the conclusion : " we can promote both agendas as our regional identity .
our culture and our background compels us to do so , our current geographic location compels us to do so , as does our good neighborly relations with russia and china and our interest in seeking third neighbors elsewhere . "
seeking options besides china but mongolia is trying to seek more independence from china .
despite the fact that most of the country 's mineral resources are close to the chinese border , the mongolian government decided to develop a railway infrastructure within the country and towards the russian border rather than towards china .
80 percent of imported goods already come through china , dorjjugder says , and since china occasionally closes its borders or restricts exports , the decision will keep alternatives open .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out after the parliamentary election in 2008 mongolia 's new security concept is also a reaction to china 's challenge , says dr. alicia campi , president of the us-mongolia advisory group .
" while certainly mongolia does not want to lose its vigorous democracy and free market , and return to cold war era satellite status , policy makers increasingly are thinking that inviting much more sizable russian fdi -lrb- foreign direct investment -rrb- and military assistance are not bad ideas at all since western nations have so far proven slow to act and disappointing . "
at the same time , she says , mongolians are looking at the central asian states and on to iran and turkey as well as to the fast rising india .
they could play an alternative role in balancing both china and russia .
and in 2010 , iranian delegations have been buying mongolian meat and animal byproducts .
nobody should be surprised , says campi , if the iranians are examining options for investing in mongolia 's mineral sector .
this would give the us another reason to strengthen their ties with mongolia .

extraction would be expensive , but there is interest in the us as well as in japan in working with mongolia to extract these resources , says dr. michael j. green .
he served as senior director for asian affairs at the national security council under president george w. bush .
speaking at an event of the jamestown foundation in washington dc , green says : " this is an opportunity for mongolia to refocus .
around this can be built some bilateral or multilateral investment guarantees , things that china does n't do .
mongolia as part of its brand can say , ' we will honor our contracts and not violate the wto by embargoing exports ' . "
and it is not only rare earths that make mongolia attractive .
a little over a year ago , the mongolian government signed a four billion mining deal with a canadian-based company and its anglo-australian partner .
the companies will jointly develop a project in a location thought to hold one of the world 's largest copper and gold reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gold mine in mongolia the us as " a third neighbor " the us , green says , can play a critical role in helping mongolia 's security and economy by being a " third neighbor " – in addition to china and russia – that helps to " galvanize broader relationships for mongolia throughout the world " .
one reason is democracy .
as recently as 20 years ago , mongolia achieved its independence from the ussr through a peaceful democratic revolution .
" mongolia sits in a belt of poor governance and democracy , stretching from beijing to russia - where despite what was said about some economic success , let 's face it : russian democracy is going backwards – to central asia , to belarus , " explains michael green .
" you really have to go thousands and thousands of miles from ulan bator in some directions before you find a functioning democracy that is as successful , despite challenges , as mongolia .
and that is an example that should be important to the us and the west . "
batchimeg migeddorj , national security advisor to the president of mongolia , attributes it to the special circumstances that mongolia was able to develop a democracy .
he says : " exactly during that time , in the nineties , our two neighbors , china and russia , were concentrating more on internal affairs .
that provided mongolias politicians and political parties with more room to work internally to stabilize institutions . "
sending troops to afghanistan but besides being a model democracy , there is more .
mongolia has sent troops to iraq that have been very effective , according to green , " taking risks a lot of nato countries are n't willing to take in terms of being in the line of fire " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us president bush on a visit to mongolia " today , mongolia has about a platoon , helping with perimeter security for the germans in afghanistan , " says green .
he argues that mongolia has more credibility in demanding transparency from china 's military .
at the same time , he says , the us can not compete with russia and china , so the americans have a strong interest that mongolia develops strong ties with other democratic countries like japan ; korea , the eu , india .
colonel munch-ochir dorjjugder , who served as the director for international cooperation of the mongolian ministry of defense and is now a fellow at the brookings institution , rejects the negative assessment that mongolia is " torn " between russia and china .
nevertheless , he observes mongolia 's " identity dilemma " between northeast-asia and eurasia but comes to the conclusion : " we can promote both agendas as our regional identity .
our culture and our background compels us to do so , our current geographic location compels us to do so , as does our good neighborly relations with russia and china and our interest in seeking third neighbors elsewhere . "
seeking options besides china but mongolia is trying to seek more independence from china .
despite the fact that most of the country 's mineral resources are close to the chinese border , the mongolian government decided to develop a railway infrastructure within the country and towards the russian border rather than towards china .
80 percent of imported goods already come through china , dorjjugder says , and since china occasionally closes its borders or restricts exports , the decision will keep alternatives open .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out after the parliamentary election in 2008 mongolia 's new security concept is also a reaction to china 's challenge , says dr. alicia campi , president of the us-mongolia advisory group .
" while certainly mongolia does not want to lose its vigorous democracy and free market , and return to cold war era satellite status , policy makers increasingly are thinking that inviting much more sizable russian fdi -lrb- foreign direct investment -rrb- and military assistance are not bad ideas at all since western nations have so far proven slow to act and disappointing . "
at the same time , she says , mongolians are looking at the central asian states and on to iran and turkey as well as to the fast rising india .
they could play an alternative role in balancing both china and russia .
and in 2010 , iranian delegations have been buying mongolian meat and animal byproducts .
nobody should be surprised , says campi , if the iranians are examining options for investing in mongolia 's mineral sector .
this would give the us another reason to strengthen their ties with mongolia .

let me introduce myself - i 'm ali .
ali almakhlafi .
i 'm a journalist from yemen . i live in germany .
i 'm 31 years old .
i 'm muslim .
and i 've never been to mecca in my entire life .
even though , when considered from distance , i was born and spent the first 19 years of my life " right next door . " yemen is the poorest country of the arabian peninsula and has a common border with saudi arabia – one of the richest countries of the region and guardian of islam 's holy sites .
from yemen 's capital , sana 'a , it 's about a 90-minute flight from there to mecca .
from germany it takes about six hours .
reporter , not a pilgrim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali 's journey takes him from bonn to mecca .
yet my journey to mecca starts here in germany , the country i live and work in .
and i 'm deliberately not traveling as a religious pilgrim , but as a neutral journalistic reporter .
my main goal is to provide non-muslim users with insights into the hajj pilgrimage - just as i was once introduced to easter , christmas , and other christian feasts .
as you may know , according to saudi arabia 's interpretation of islam , only muslims may visit the holy city of mecca .
however , it is allowed to let non-muslims know about it .
this is what i want to do as i tell you about my impressions , discoveries , and encounters with pilgrims from all over the world - and particularly from germany .
even many muslims know little more about the hajj than the pictures they get on television , which show religious rites and crowds pouring in .
i 'm sure that there 's a lot to find out about the hajj - so wo n't you join me on my journey of discovery ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : praying at the mosque in mecca would you like to know how , exactly , the religious rituals are performed ?
what safety measures are taken ?
whether men and women go on their pilgrimage together ?
or whether conflicts between moderate and radical political groups in the islamic world influence the festivities ?
honestly , i do n't know many of the answers to these questions myself .
but whatever you may want to learn , i 'll try to find it out for you !
please post your questions and suggestions on deutsche welle 's facebook page : http : / / www.facebook.com / deutschewelle even though i will visit mecca as a journalist , this is anything but a " typical " reporting assignement to me .
maybe it 's like a catholic-raised journalist reporting from the vatican : you 're keeping a distance and reporting neutrally , but somehow the subject moves you more than , say , a piece about the latest tax reform .
learning about prophets , and people so i ca n't keep all my childhood memories separated from my thoughts about , and preparation for , my first trip to mecca .
specifically , my religion class in taiz , the town i was born in , comes to my mind .
they taught us that god is in heaven watching us .
that jews and christians share a lot of prophets with muslims except the last prophet and messenger of god : muhammad .
that the citizens of mecca once chased muhammad out of the city .
and that muhammad returned to mecca eight years later and destroyed the statues of false gods that had been built .
as a little boy i was deeply impressed and shaped by these religious basics .
today they inextricably belong to my personal cultural heritage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : our reporter hails from taiz , in yemen of course , at school , i also learned about the five religious duties of every muslim , the so-called five pillars of islam .
the hajj is one of them - a spiritual journey that is to be performed by every muslim who is healthy enough and can afford to do so .
examining my picture of saudi arabia i also want to examine my personal picture of saudi arabia - which is closely linked to my yemeni descent .
there were times when yemenis were allowed to enter the country without a visa .
older men , such as my grandfather , used to go on business trips to the country next door and bring us back precious presents .
but there was also a time - when saudi arabia and yemen were at serious odds about the kuwait war - that saudi arabian leaders expelled hundreds of thousands of yemeni " guest workers " from the country .
during this period , unemployment and poverty increased dramatically in yemen , and the number of students in my class went from 20 to 120 .
that is when i realized that islamic virtues such as solidarity and brotherhood can vanish into thin air when politics come into play .
and that a common belief does n't prevent people from committing human-rights violations .
i wonder what kind of experiences i will have in mecca ?
maybe they 'll be very different from what i expect .

let me introduce myself - i 'm ali .
ali almakhlafi .
i 'm a journalist from yemen . i live in germany .
i 'm 31 years old .
i 'm muslim .
and i 've never been to mecca in my entire life .
even though , when considered from distance , i was born and spent the first 19 years of my life " right next door . " yemen is the poorest country of the arabian peninsula and has a common border with saudi arabia – one of the richest countries of the region and guardian of islam 's holy sites .
from yemen 's capital , sana 'a , it 's about a 90-minute flight from there to mecca .
from germany it takes about six hours .
reporter , not a pilgrim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali 's journey takes him from bonn to mecca .
yet my journey to mecca starts here in germany , the country i live and work in .
and i 'm deliberately not traveling as a religious pilgrim , but as a neutral journalistic reporter .
my main goal is to provide non-muslim users with insights into the hajj pilgrimage - just as i was once introduced to easter , christmas , and other christian feasts .
as you may know , according to saudi arabia 's interpretation of islam , only muslims may visit the holy city of mecca .
however , it is allowed to let non-muslims know about it .
this is what i want to do as i tell you about my impressions , discoveries , and encounters with pilgrims from all over the world - and particularly from germany .
even many muslims know little more about the hajj than the pictures they get on television , which show religious rites and crowds pouring in .
i 'm sure that there 's a lot to find out about the hajj - so wo n't you join me on my journey of discovery ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : praying at the mosque in mecca would you like to know how , exactly , the religious rituals are performed ?
what safety measures are taken ?
whether men and women go on their pilgrimage together ?
or whether conflicts between moderate and radical political groups in the islamic world influence the festivities ?
honestly , i do n't know many of the answers to these questions myself .
but whatever you may want to learn , i 'll try to find it out for you !
please post your questions and suggestions on deutsche welle 's facebook page : http : / / www.facebook.com / deutschewelle even though i will visit mecca as a journalist , this is anything but a " typical " reporting assignement to me .
maybe it 's like a catholic-raised journalist reporting from the vatican : you 're keeping a distance and reporting neutrally , but somehow the subject moves you more than , say , a piece about the latest tax reform .
learning about prophets , and people so i ca n't keep all my childhood memories separated from my thoughts about , and preparation for , my first trip to mecca .
specifically , my religion class in taiz , the town i was born in , comes to my mind .
they taught us that god is in heaven watching us .
that jews and christians share a lot of prophets with muslims except the last prophet and messenger of god : muhammad .
that the citizens of mecca once chased muhammad out of the city .
and that muhammad returned to mecca eight years later and destroyed the statues of false gods that had been built .
as a little boy i was deeply impressed and shaped by these religious basics .
today they inextricably belong to my personal cultural heritage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : our reporter hails from taiz , in yemen of course , at school , i also learned about the five religious duties of every muslim , the so-called five pillars of islam .
the hajj is one of them - a spiritual journey that is to be performed by every muslim who is healthy enough and can afford to do so .
examining my picture of saudi arabia i also want to examine my personal picture of saudi arabia - which is closely linked to my yemeni descent .
there were times when yemenis were allowed to enter the country without a visa .
older men , such as my grandfather , used to go on business trips to the country next door and bring us back precious presents .
but there was also a time - when saudi arabia and yemen were at serious odds about the kuwait war - that saudi arabian leaders expelled hundreds of thousands of yemeni " guest workers " from the country .
during this period , unemployment and poverty increased dramatically in yemen , and the number of students in my class went from 20 to 120 .
that is when i realized that islamic virtues such as solidarity and brotherhood can vanish into thin air when politics come into play .
and that a common belief does n't prevent people from committing human-rights violations .
i wonder what kind of experiences i will have in mecca ?
maybe they 'll be very different from what i expect .

it is designed to help children who might be struggling in school , as well as stretch high-achievers . nick treloar , a 15-year-old student at the french lycée in london , used to have a tutor come to the house .
but he finds the online tuition a more flexible alternative . " it 's a whenever-you-want system , " nick said .
" you can book the session for any time of day .
it 's you that says ' i want this hour to this hour . '
it 's your choice , so whenever you have a free period during the day , or you finish an hour earlier , then you can come home , and sit down and do this session . " nick 's tutor nathan is based thousands of miles away , in ludhiana , india .
nick has never even seen what his tutor looks like .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 11.11.2010 private tutoring goes global großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students and their tutors communicate via an online blackboard a uk company has started outsourcing math tuition for pupils aged seven to 16 to graduates recruited and trained in india - and british primary schools are beginning to sign up for the online offer in increasing numbers . brightspark offers the one-to-one tuition via skype .
it is designed to help children who might be struggling in school , as well as stretch high-achievers . nick treloar , a 15-year-old student at the french lycée in london , used to have a tutor come to the house .
but he finds the online tuition a more flexible alternative . " it 's a whenever-you-want system , " nick said .
" you can book the session for any time of day .
it 's you that says ' i want this hour to this hour . '
it 's your choice , so whenever you have a free period during the day , or you finish an hour earlier , then you can come home , and sit down and do this session . " nick 's tutor nathan is based thousands of miles away , in ludhiana , india .
nick has never even seen what his tutor looks like .
but he can hear him , as he guides nick through math problems on a white board that they can both see and write on - a more effective method than simply chatting with a camera on skype . a manageable structure nathan speaks fluent american english from having tutored us students online .
he is 31 years old , and has a five-year-old daughter .
he earns about eight euros -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- an hour , which he says is more than double what many people his age are earning in other professions in india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nathan carries out his work from punjab for him , tutoring is not just about the money , though , but the love of mentoring students and shaping their future .
nathan holds a master 's degree in mathematics and he has been handpicked and trained for the job .
he had already been tutoring american school kids via the web for three years before joining brightspark .
he said he was impressed with british students . " it 's a much better level with uk students , and often with some subjects , they start them much younger , " nathan said . the time difference between the uk and india is four-and-a-half hours , which nathan said is manageable .
he said if a british student books the latest session available , at 9 pm in the uk , it is 1:30 am in ludhiana . nathan is currently part of a team of 30 tutors .
but the company expects to grow to 100 tutors - all working out of small office booths with laptops and skype headsets . lack of specialists british demand for online math tutorials is growing , according to brightspark education chief tom hooper .
he saw an acute need in britain for specialized math tuition for struggling school kids , and introduced indian online tutors after seeing the project work in the us . one british primary school is already using the online tutorials in class to support the teacher - and there are more schools in the pipeline .
hooper is also working with charities in deprived areas and housing estates by introducing the online tutorials to drop-in centers , where mothers can drop their kids off , for an hour 's session at a computer terminal . he says there is a shocking lack of specialist math teachers in britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tutors are virtual at brightspark " only 11 percent of teachers have a degree in the subject they teach , and only eight percent have any training , " hooper said .
" we thought by going to india , we could bring in a level of academic talent that is 100 percent related to math and a 100 percent trained .
that 's why we are seeing a benefit for our students . " hooper also said it 's not just british children who need help . " there are distinct problems among elements of the adult population who have very low numeracy skills , which creates problems socially , but also for unemployed people who want to re-engage with the workforce , " he said . the tutoring industry in britain is completely unregulated , according to hooper .
the company therefore introduced its own strict standards for data protection , assuring their clients their data are closely guarded .
students often get a different tutor with every new session , and the tutors know nothing about them , except their name . with plans to expand the online tutoring business to other subjects , hooper rejects the accusation that indians are somehow taking away british teaching jobs . " i strongly reject that allegation , " he said .
" we are not outsourcing british jobs ; we are in-sourcing specialist skills . " progress is visible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nick likes the flexibility of online tutoring for nick 's father phil , the online tutoring helps him monitor his son 's progress .
he can see how many sessions nick is booking , because he pays for them - and he can see tangible results in nick 's math scores . " we are able to see his progress , and it makes him much more open to be able to tell us which areas he is dropping back in and needs help , " phil said . an online tutor from india costs clients on average of 13 euros an hour .
a tutor in person can cost up to 46 euros - three times as much .
with that price difference , and specialist math tutors on offer , the company said they expect more students like nick to sign up . author : nina-maria potts / sms editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the greek finance ministry has said it has narrowly missed its january-october target to reduce its budget deficit .
the unwelcome news comes as the eu said it would take action to support ireland , if needed . the greek public deficit has fallen sharply since the implementation of an eu-imf rescue package for the debt-stricken country , but efforts to reduce the shortfall have still fallen short of the targets set for this year .
greece , struggling with a huge public deficit , came close to default in may and had to be bailed out with a 110-billion-euro package arranged by the eu and international monetary fund .
through october , greek public finances showed a deficit of some 17.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 24 billion -rrb- , down 30 percent from the same period a year ago , but still less than the 32 percent target .
the government in athens has implemented a series of draconian reforms aimed at restoring its financial credibility .
it cut spending by 7 percent , or four billion euros , but tax revenues only grew 3.7 percent , well short of the 2010 target of 13.7 percent .
at the same time as this announcement , the european union moved to reassure financial markets on thursday that it was ready to support ireland as the eurozone country 's debt woes made waves at the g20 summit in south korea .
ireland has worst deficit in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu is poised to help ireland too , barroso said concern about ireland is growing after irish bond yields soared to a record level of 8.28 percent on wednesday . as a result , european commission president jose manuel barroso found himself compelled to announce that the eu stood ready to help ireland " in case of need . "
" what is important now is that we have all the necessary instruments in place , " barroso said in the south korean capital , seoul , ahead of the g20 meeting .
" we are monitoring the situation in ireland on a permanent basis , " he added .
the rise in irish bond yields has unsettled investors and put the entire european bond market under serious strain .
ireland is trying to tackle the worst budget deficit in the eu and convince markets that it does not need a greek-style bailout .

the greek finance ministry has said it has narrowly missed its january-october target to reduce its budget deficit .
the unwelcome news comes as the eu said it would take action to support ireland , if needed . the greek public deficit has fallen sharply since the implementation of an eu-imf rescue package for the debt-stricken country , but efforts to reduce the shortfall have still fallen short of the targets set for this year .
greece , struggling with a huge public deficit , came close to default in may and had to be bailed out with a 110-billion-euro package arranged by the eu and international monetary fund .
through october , greek public finances showed a deficit of some 17.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 24 billion -rrb- , down 30 percent from the same period a year ago , but still less than the 32 percent target .
the government in athens has implemented a series of draconian reforms aimed at restoring its financial credibility .
it cut spending by 7 percent , or four billion euros , but tax revenues only grew 3.7 percent , well short of the 2010 target of 13.7 percent .
at the same time as this announcement , the european union moved to reassure financial markets on thursday that it was ready to support ireland as the eurozone country 's debt woes made waves at the g20 summit in south korea .
ireland has worst deficit in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu is poised to help ireland too , barroso said concern about ireland is growing after irish bond yields soared to a record level of 8.28 percent on wednesday . as a result , european commission president jose manuel barroso found himself compelled to announce that the eu stood ready to help ireland " in case of need . "
" what is important now is that we have all the necessary instruments in place , " barroso said in the south korean capital , seoul , ahead of the g20 meeting .
" we are monitoring the situation in ireland on a permanent basis , " he added .
the rise in irish bond yields has unsettled investors and put the entire european bond market under serious strain .
ireland is trying to tackle the worst budget deficit in the eu and convince markets that it does not need a greek-style bailout .

but one war memorial will remain silent and empty on armistice day .
the langemark cemetery is the final resting place of 44,294 german soldiers .
more than half of them are buried in one mass grave , the kameraden grab , their names etched on large dark plaques running alongside the site .

at the back of langemark , rain-sodden fields stretch ahead , the same ground that turned into a giant , water-clogged inferno of craters and trenches almost a century ago .
it is here that 3,000 german students were killed in 1914 .
" they had received just six weeks basic training before they were sent to the front to accompany german soldiers in what was meant to be a triumphant march to victory .

they say they ’ re willing to go to the highest european court . tom freeman and katherine doyle are a heterosexual couple applying for a civil partnership – a form of legal union available only to same-sex couples .
they are one of four heterosexual couples and four same-sex couples trying to challenge the current uk legislation on marriage and civil partnerships .
" initially our aim was equality but increasingly as we look critically at marriage , we feel it is not relevant to us , " katherine doyle told deutsche welle .
" we really do want a civil partnership .
in our day-to-day lives we are more like partners . "
" the important question for us is : why should n't we have a civil partnership , " her partner tom added .
" the institution is being provided for by law so why should n't i have one ? "
gay couples in britain have been allowed to enter into civil partnerships since 2004 , which gives them all the same legal rights and responsibilities as a civil marriage . however they are denied a civil marriage certificate .
on the other hand heterosexual couples do not qualify to enter a civil partnership .
they can either get married or not .
a violation of human rights ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom freeman and katherine doyle are prepared to fight for years working alongside the gay rights group outrage , the eight couples argue that denying each group the legal rights of the other is discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation , something which is contrary to britain 's human rights act . yet tom and katherine 's application has been refused so far .
all they got was a short statement from the town hall , saying that " a civil partnership is a relationship between two people of the same sex . "
the eight couples are one by one each week applying to their local town halls for either a marriage certificate , or a civil partnership certificate , whichever is denied them by law .
at the end of two months , if all applications are turned down , as they are expected to be , the couples will begin a high court challenge . it is the first time that heterosexual couples have taken such an active role in a campaign which at first glance might appear to benefit gay couples wanting equality and a full marriage .
all the way to the european court of human rights the civil partnerships act of 2004 was introduced by the then labour government with wide support in parliament .
it gives same-sex couples the same legal rights and responsibilities as civil marriage .
there also is a formal process for dissolving partnerships which is akin to divorce , but gay rights activists still criticize that it does n't grant full marriage status to gay couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil partnerships exist in most eu member states " when all eight couples - gay and straight - have filed their applications and have been refused we 'll then consult with our legal advisers with a view to bringing the case to the courts , " peter tatchell of the group outrage , which is leading the equal love campaign , told deutsche welle .
" there ’ s a very strong argument that the twin bans on gay marriages and heterosexual civil partnerships are illegal under the human rights act , " he added .
tatchell says the group is prepared to take the case all the way to the european court of human rights if necessary . public opinion backs gay marriage in response to the campaign , the government has issued a statement saying that it is currently considering the next steps for civil partnerships . it said that earlier this year ministers met with people and organizations holding a range of views and that they are looking at the best way to take those views forward . the equal love campaign argues that public attitudes have shifted strongly in favor of allowing gay couples to marry , citing an opinion poll carried out by the group populus in june 2009 , which found that 61 percent of the public believe gay couples should be allowed to marry , while 33 percent disagreed . however , if there is a change in the law , it is not likely to come soon .
" it could take five to ten years to go through the courts , " said katherine doyle .
" but we really feel that we ca n't commit to marriage when it 's exclusive . "

gay couples in britain have been allowed to enter into civil partnerships since 2004 , which gives them all the same legal rights and responsibilities as a civil marriage . however they are denied a civil marriage certificate .
on the other hand heterosexual couples do not qualify to enter a civil partnership .
they can either get married or not .
a violation of human rights ?

all they got was a short statement from the town hall , saying that " a civil partnership is a relationship between two people of the same sex . "
the eight couples are one by one each week applying to their local town halls for either a marriage certificate , or a civil partnership certificate , whichever is denied them by law .
at the end of two months , if all applications are turned down , as they are expected to be , the couples will begin a high court challenge . it is the first time that heterosexual couples have taken such an active role in a campaign which at first glance might appear to benefit gay couples wanting equality and a full marriage .

it is designed to help children who might be struggling in school , as well as stretch high-achievers . nick treloar , a 15-year-old student at the french lycée in london , used to have a tutor come to the house .
but he finds the online tuition a more flexible alternative . " it 's a whenever-you-want system , " nick said .
" you can book the session for any time of day .
it 's you that says ' i want this hour to this hour . '
it 's your choice , so whenever you have a free period during the day , or you finish an hour earlier , then you can come home , and sit down and do this session . " nick 's tutor nathan is based thousands of miles away , in ludhiana , india .
nick has never even seen what his tutor looks like .
but he can hear him , as he guides nick through math problems on a white board that they can both see and write on - a more effective method than simply chatting with a camera on skype . a manageable structure nathan speaks fluent american english from having tutored us students online .
he is 31 years old , and has a five-year-old daughter .
he earns about eight euros -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- an hour , which he says is more than double what many people his age are earning in other professions in india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nathan carries out his work from punjab for him , tutoring is not just about the money , though , but the love of mentoring students and shaping their future .
nathan holds a master 's degree in mathematics and he has been handpicked and trained for the job .
he had already been tutoring american school kids via the web for three years before joining brightspark .
he said he was impressed with british students . " it 's a much better level with uk students , and often with some subjects , they start them much younger , " nathan said . the time difference between the uk and india is four-and-a-half hours , which nathan said is manageable .
he said if a british student books the latest session available , at 9 pm in the uk , it is 1:30 am in ludhiana . nathan is currently part of a team of 30 tutors .
but the company expects to grow to 100 tutors - all working out of small office booths with laptops and skype headsets . lack of specialists british demand for online math tutorials is growing , according to brightspark education chief tom hooper .
he saw an acute need in britain for specialized math tuition for struggling school kids , and introduced indian online tutors after seeing the project work in the us . one british primary school is already using the online tutorials in class to support the teacher - and there are more schools in the pipeline .
hooper is also working with charities in deprived areas and housing estates by introducing the online tutorials to drop-in centers , where mothers can drop their kids off , for an hour 's session at a computer terminal . he says there is a shocking lack of specialist math teachers in britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tutors are virtual at brightspark " only 11 percent of teachers have a degree in the subject they teach , and only eight percent have any training , " hooper said .
" we thought by going to india , we could bring in a level of academic talent that is 100 percent related to math and a 100 percent trained .
that 's why we are seeing a benefit for our students . " hooper also said it 's not just british children who need help . " there are distinct problems among elements of the adult population who have very low numeracy skills , which creates problems socially , but also for unemployed people who want to re-engage with the workforce , " he said . the tutoring industry in britain is completely unregulated , according to hooper .
the company therefore introduced its own strict standards for data protection , assuring their clients their data are closely guarded .
students often get a different tutor with every new session , and the tutors know nothing about them , except their name . with plans to expand the online tutoring business to other subjects , hooper rejects the accusation that indians are somehow taking away british teaching jobs . " i strongly reject that allegation , " he said .
" we are not outsourcing british jobs ; we are in-sourcing specialist skills . " progress is visible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nick likes the flexibility of online tutoring for nick 's father phil , the online tutoring helps him monitor his son 's progress .
he can see how many sessions nick is booking , because he pays for them - and he can see tangible results in nick 's math scores . " we are able to see his progress , and it makes him much more open to be able to tell us which areas he is dropping back in and needs help , " phil said . an online tutor from india costs clients on average of 13 euros an hour .
a tutor in person can cost up to 46 euros - three times as much .
with that price difference , and specialist math tutors on offer , the company said they expect more students like nick to sign up . author : nina-maria potts / sms editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he had a host of other issues in his luggage as he mets chinese president hu jintao on the sidelines of the summit . there was no shortage of issues awaiting us president barack obama even before the g20 summit began on thursday in seoul .
obama was scheduled to meet both chinese president hu jintao and south korean president lee myung-bak parallel to the summit .
for the latter , the most pressing agenda item was expected to be the ratification of a pending free trade deal that us and south korean diplomats from both sides have been hashing out over the past two days .
despite a number of sticking points , including disagreement on autos and beef trade , myung-bak and obama agreed in a telephone conversation last week to strive for agreement before the g20 .
on thursday morning , news broke that the two sides failed to reach an agreement on a free-trade accord , but said talks would continue after the g20 summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama faces a complex meeting with hu jintao yet the meeting was also be laden with symbolic value , as howard loewen , researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , said .
" i think they want to reaffirm the security alliance between the south korea and the us , for the protection of south korea , " loewen told deutsche welle ahead of the meeting on wednesday .
" which is of course a message for north korea and china . "
chinese tension the meeting with jintao is likely to be more general and possibly less conclusive , however .
apart from recent disagreements over currency issues and accusations of protectionism , the americans are consistently calling on china to take on more responsibility .
" if you 're a big country , you have the power to sit at the table in the biggest forums , but you have to be willing to take on responsibility , and i think that will be a subject of conversation , " says loewen .
for its part , china is wary of obama 's diplomacy drive in asia , particularly us attempts to assert a position in multilateral bodies .
next year the us will join the east asia summit , an annual forum of east asian countries , and loewen believes that obama is consciously going beyond the network of bilateral relations the us maintains with likes of japan , south korea , the philippines and thailand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will join the east asia summit next year " the us is showing more diplomatic initiatives in southeast asia than it did in the bush era , " said loewen .
" at the same time , the us wants to engage more in the multilateral regulation of problems .
you really ca n't say that the us is retreating in the region - on the contrary , it is pushing ahead more . "
" of course , the chinese are not keen on seeing the us engaging themselves more , " he added .
" because they fear that the us could rival their influence , which of course it does .
the chinese are getting nervous . "
multilateral vs. bilateral perhaps for this reason china has made one regional issue a taboo for multilateral talks .
pascal abb of the german institute of global and area studies , told deutsche welle , " china has made it clear that it does not want the territorial conflicts in the south china seas to be discussed multilaterally , but that is the central conflict in the region . "
the conflict is over a number of tiny islands in the south china seas – china , taiwan , vietnam , the philippines and malaysia all lay claim to the islands , mainly because of the rich natural resources in the area , as well as the trade routes that run through these waters .
but china 's refusal to allow the matter to be discussed multilaterally effectively scuppers any chance of progress .
" i do n't see how overlapping territorial conflicts can be solved bilaterally , " says abb , " simply because no third country is likely to accept an agreement that two other states have reached . "
political gamble but for obama , the recent mid-term elections mean that what some people call his " multilateral gamble " may be under more pressure .
while the new strength in the republican party does not extend to controlling the senate , which has more control over us foreign policy , some believe that if obama 's attempts to assert himself in asia do not bear economic fruit , he may hand the republicans extra ammunition in the 2012 presidential election .
but that is still a long term concern .
for now , the republicans are unlikely to gain much traction with such attacks .
" it could be that the republicans want to assert their foreign policies now , and may make demands like that , " says loewen .
" but i think it wo n't be that serious , because there are no multilateral commitments .
it is easier to go back on multilateral agreements , so i do n't think that will play a big role . "

despite a number of sticking points , including disagreement on autos and beef trade , myung-bak and obama agreed in a telephone conversation last week to strive for agreement before the g20 .
on thursday morning , news broke that the two sides failed to reach an agreement on a free-trade accord , but said talks would continue after the g20 summit .

" i think they want to reaffirm the security alliance between the south korea and the us , for the protection of south korea , " loewen told deutsche welle ahead of the meeting on wednesday .
" which is of course a message for north korea and china . "
chinese tension the meeting with jintao is likely to be more general and possibly less conclusive , however .
apart from recent disagreements over currency issues and accusations of protectionism , the americans are consistently calling on china to take on more responsibility .
" if you 're a big country , you have the power to sit at the table in the biggest forums , but you have to be willing to take on responsibility , and i think that will be a subject of conversation , " says loewen .
for its part , china is wary of obama 's diplomacy drive in asia , particularly us attempts to assert a position in multilateral bodies .

pascal abb of the german institute of global and area studies , told deutsche welle , " china has made it clear that it does not want the territorial conflicts in the south china seas to be discussed multilaterally , but that is the central conflict in the region . "
the conflict is over a number of tiny islands in the south china seas – china , taiwan , vietnam , the philippines and malaysia all lay claim to the islands , mainly because of the rich natural resources in the area , as well as the trade routes that run through these waters .
but china 's refusal to allow the matter to be discussed multilaterally effectively scuppers any chance of progress .

it 's match day twelve in the bundesliga and after the abject failure of trying to summon voodoo spirits to do their bidding last week , the dw soccer pundits have resorted to less ghoulish methods . dw 's soccer pundits have been forming a fidgety queue outside the bathroom this week after downing enough tea to fill a swimming pool .
as well as causing numerous pairs of legs to cross , the experiment has also produced enough bundesliga result-shaped tea leaf formations to come up with the predictions for match day twelve .
amuse yourselves with these forecasts while we dash once again to the little boys room ...
saturday , nov 13 bremen – frankfurt oh dear .
just what is going on with werder bremen ?
esteemed colleague jefferson chase nailed it in his commentary this week – whatever 's gone wrong at bremen , it 'll need huge changes to fix it .
while wondering what was going to happen next was initially an endearing game of roulette , as the season wears on , it looks like bremen are playing the russian variety .
no guesses who 'll get the bullet if their form continues to nosedive .
frankfurt very well could be the team to load the gun .
prediction : frankfurt 2-1 wolfsburg – schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke edged closer to safety thanks to raul 's goals go on then , but just whisper it … schalke may have turned a corner .
there – i said it … which means , of course , that wolfsburg 's up-and-down season will ascend again to the detriment of felix magath 's struggling side on saturday .
the royal blues may have fired three past st. pauli to put them one point from safety but the hamburg club are quickly becoming easy pickings as their confidence dwindles .
wolfsburg will be a sterner test .
perhaps the training ground punch-ups suggest the wolves have the fight to come out on top in this one .
prediction : wolfsburg 3-2 cologne – moenchengladbach wake us up when this derby is over .
the two sides who manage to make schalke look good come together in this basement clash with little daylight between them in terms of points and class .
gladbach at least shocked the life out of bayern last week - which always raises a smile in these parts - but with cologne struggling to find anything resembling flair in any of their games to date , these two could blunder and bump against each other for 90 minutes and still not score .
hopefully one will manage it but it 's a coin toss .
heads it 's gladbach .
prediction : gladbach 1-0 kaiserslautern – stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ciprian marica led the way in the thrashing of bremen stuttgart will be nicely rested after last weekend 's game so kaiserslautern should beware .
vfb stuck six past bremen and then must have retired to a dark room to lie down .
despite the green shoots of recovery growing over at the mercedes benz arena , few would have tipped jens keller 's team to thrash werder so comprehensively -lrb- i certainly did n't -rrb- .
but then kaiserslautern looked impressive last week , even though they evenutally lost against in-form leverkusen . this one could prove quite entertaining to watch .
prediction : 2-2 st. pauli – leverkusen pauli continue to slide and it 's already looking like an inevitable one towards what many people think is their rightful place in the relegation zone .
the neutral will hope they can arrest the decline but taking on leverkusen may not be the best place to start .
bayer have been quietly efficient in rising to third place and will be looking to make up ground on mainz in the place above them .
on form alone , it looks as though pauli will be deeper in the mire come saturday night .
prediction : leverkusen 3-1 mainz – hanover mainz in crisis !
two defeats on the bounce !
how easy it is to forget what an achievement this season has already been for mainz .
it is n't only their position which is impressive but the way they 've gotten there .
okay , so freiburg should never have beaten them last week – but only in the context of mainz 's amazing form to date .
last season , this would n't have been such a shock .
losing or drawing with hanover would n't have been either but on the evidence of this campaign alone , one would expect mainz to triumph .
prediction : mainz 2-0 sunday , nov 14 hoffenheim – freiburg despite winning last week , hoffenheim still dropped down the league , giving the illusion that their title charge has already petered out .
do n't be fooled .
the pendulum of form is swinging in the hoff 's direction and a win over freiburg will see them back in the mix .
freiburg had a great result against mainz and will have to be completely free of the hangover to cope with the hoff at home .
expecting the freiburgers to be well up for it as usual , this could be a tight affair .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 bayern – nuremberg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern lost their heads against gladbach last weekend they still have n't quite got it right , have they ?
louis van gaal tore his team a new one after letting the points slip against bottom club gladbach last week and you would expect a reaction from the german champions against nuremberg on sunday .
but how many times has the gruff dutchman got all red in the face only to see his team go pale on the pitch ?
nuremberg cantered to a win against cologne last week and of course bayern , however dire , are the polar opposite of the boys for köln .
however , the bavarians are increasingly hard to fathom so – who knows ?

prediction : frankfurt 2-1 wolfsburg – schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke edged closer to safety thanks to raul 's goals go on then , but just whisper it … schalke may have turned a corner .
there – i said it … which means , of course , that wolfsburg 's up-and-down season will ascend again to the detriment of felix magath 's struggling side on saturday .
the royal blues may have fired three past st. pauli to put them one point from safety but the hamburg club are quickly becoming easy pickings as their confidence dwindles .
wolfsburg will be a sterner test .
perhaps the training ground punch-ups suggest the wolves have the fight to come out on top in this one .
prediction : wolfsburg 3-2 cologne – moenchengladbach wake us up when this derby is over .
the two sides who manage to make schalke look good come together in this basement clash with little daylight between them in terms of points and class .
gladbach at least shocked the life out of bayern last week - which always raises a smile in these parts - but with cologne struggling to find anything resembling flair in any of their games to date , these two could blunder and bump against each other for 90 minutes and still not score .
hopefully one will manage it but it 's a coin toss .
heads it 's gladbach .
prediction : gladbach 1-0 kaiserslautern – stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ciprian marica led the way in the thrashing of bremen stuttgart will be nicely rested after last weekend 's game so kaiserslautern should beware .
vfb stuck six past bremen and then must have retired to a dark room to lie down .
despite the green shoots of recovery growing over at the mercedes benz arena , few would have tipped jens keller 's team to thrash werder so comprehensively -lrb- i certainly did n't -rrb- .
but then kaiserslautern looked impressive last week , even though they evenutally lost against in-form leverkusen . this one could prove quite entertaining to watch .
prediction : 2-2 st. pauli – leverkusen pauli continue to slide and it 's already looking like an inevitable one towards what many people think is their rightful place in the relegation zone .
the neutral will hope they can arrest the decline but taking on leverkusen may not be the best place to start .
bayer have been quietly efficient in rising to third place and will be looking to make up ground on mainz in the place above them .
on form alone , it looks as though pauli will be deeper in the mire come saturday night .
prediction : leverkusen 3-1 mainz – hanover mainz in crisis !
two defeats on the bounce !
how easy it is to forget what an achievement this season has already been for mainz .
it is n't only their position which is impressive but the way they 've gotten there .
okay , so freiburg should never have beaten them last week – but only in the context of mainz 's amazing form to date .
last season , this would n't have been such a shock .
losing or drawing with hanover would n't have been either but on the evidence of this campaign alone , one would expect mainz to triumph .
prediction : mainz 2-0 sunday , nov 14 hoffenheim – freiburg despite winning last week , hoffenheim still dropped down the league , giving the illusion that their title charge has already petered out .
do n't be fooled .
the pendulum of form is swinging in the hoff 's direction and a win over freiburg will see them back in the mix .
freiburg had a great result against mainz and will have to be completely free of the hangover to cope with the hoff at home .
expecting the freiburgers to be well up for it as usual , this could be a tight affair .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 bayern – nuremberg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern lost their heads against gladbach last weekend they still have n't quite got it right , have they ?
louis van gaal tore his team a new one after letting the points slip against bottom club gladbach last week and you would expect a reaction from the german champions against nuremberg on sunday .
but how many times has the gruff dutchman got all red in the face only to see his team go pale on the pitch ?
nuremberg cantered to a win against cologne last week and of course bayern , however dire , are the polar opposite of the boys for köln .
however , the bavarians are increasingly hard to fathom so – who knows ?

it 's match day twelve in the bundesliga and after the abject failure of trying to summon voodoo spirits to do their bidding last week , the dw soccer pundits have resorted to less ghoulish methods . dw 's soccer pundits have been forming a fidgety queue outside the bathroom this week after downing enough tea to fill a swimming pool .
as well as causing numerous pairs of legs to cross , the experiment has also produced enough bundesliga result-shaped tea leaf formations to come up with the predictions for match day twelve .
amuse yourselves with these forecasts while we dash once again to the little boys room ...
saturday , nov 13 bremen – frankfurt oh dear .
just what is going on with werder bremen ?
esteemed colleague jefferson chase nailed it in his commentary this week – whatever 's gone wrong at bremen , it 'll need huge changes to fix it .
while wondering what was going to happen next was initially an endearing game of roulette , as the season wears on , it looks like bremen are playing the russian variety .

" we continue to support the goal of withdrawal , " westerwelle said during a parliamentary debate on thursday in berlin .
disarmament is going to be a " key issue " for germany at the lisbon meeting , the foreign minister said .
there are no official figures about the number of nuclear weapons stationed on german soil , but it is believed that perhaps 10 to 20 nuclear warheads from the us arsenal are stockpiled at the buechel air base in the state of rhineland-palatinate in southwestern germany .
russian cooperation government leaders and heads of state of the 28 nato member countries meet in the portuguese capital next week friday to discuss a major strategic overhaul of the military alliance .

in what westerwelle called an " historic gesture , " russia will be involved in the discussions .
" we do n't want a europe with areas of differing security levels , " westerwelle said .
" we want to improve our security alongside , not in confrontation with russia . "
westerwelle defends cabinet colleague the foreign minister used his address in parliament to also set straight a cornerstone of german military doctrine .
westerwelle rejected accusations that defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was revamping the german armed forces to fight what the opposition called " economic wars . "

westerwelle 's comments were viewed as indirect support for defense minister guttenberg , who recently made controversial remarks to the effect that germany should align its security policies with economic interests , like other countries do .
in response , the green party parliamentary leader , juergen trittin , accused guttenberg of pursuing " gunboat diplomacy . "
defending his position , guttenberg told parliament on thursday that the strategy was contained in a government white paper from 2006 when the opposition social democrats were still in a grand coalition with chancellor merkel 's christian democrats .
" there were no cries of outrage then , " guttenberg said , " but now comes the great wave of indignation . "
the issue of economic intervention is also expected to be on the agenda of the nato summit next week .

it 's match day twelve in the bundesliga and after the abject failure of trying to summon voodoo spirits to do their bidding last week , the dw soccer pundits have resorted to less ghoulish methods . dw 's soccer pundits have been forming a fidgety queue outside the bathroom this week after downing enough tea to fill a swimming pool .
as well as causing numerous pairs of legs to cross , the experiment has also produced enough bundesliga result-shaped tea leaf formations to come up with the predictions for match day twelve .
amuse yourselves with these forecasts while we dash once again to the little boys room ...
saturday , nov 13 bremen – frankfurt oh dear .
just what is going on with werder bremen ?
esteemed colleague jefferson chase nailed it in his commentary this week – whatever 's gone wrong at bremen , it 'll need huge changes to fix it .
while wondering what was going to happen next was initially an endearing game of roulette , as the season wears on , it looks like bremen are playing the russian variety .
no guesses who 'll get the bullet if their form continues to nosedive .
frankfurt very well could be the team to load the gun .
prediction : frankfurt 2-1 wolfsburg – schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke edged closer to safety thanks to raul 's goals go on then , but just whisper it … schalke may have turned a corner .
there – i said it … which means , of course , that wolfsburg 's up-and-down season will ascend again to the detriment of felix magath 's struggling side on saturday .
the royal blues may have fired three past st. pauli to put them one point from safety but the hamburg club are quickly becoming easy pickings as their confidence dwindles .
wolfsburg will be a sterner test .
perhaps the training ground punch-ups suggest the wolves have the fight to come out on top in this one .
prediction : wolfsburg 3-2 cologne – moenchengladbach wake us up when this derby is over .
the two sides who manage to make schalke look good come together in this basement clash with little daylight between them in terms of points and class .
gladbach at least shocked the life out of bayern last week - which always raises a smile in these parts - but with cologne struggling to find anything resembling flair in any of their games to date , these two could blunder and bump against each other for 90 minutes and still not score .
hopefully one will manage it but it 's a coin toss .
heads it 's gladbach .
prediction : gladbach 1-0 kaiserslautern – stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ciprian marica led the way in the thrashing of bremen stuttgart will be nicely rested after last weekend 's game so kaiserslautern should beware .
vfb stuck six past bremen and then must have retired to a dark room to lie down .
despite the green shoots of recovery growing over at the mercedes benz arena , few would have tipped jens keller 's team to thrash werder so comprehensively -lrb- i certainly did n't -rrb- .
but then kaiserslautern looked impressive last week , even though they evenutally lost against in-form leverkusen . this one could prove quite entertaining to watch .
prediction : 2-2 st. pauli – leverkusen pauli continue to slide and it 's already looking like an inevitable one towards what many people think is their rightful place in the relegation zone .
the neutral will hope they can arrest the decline but taking on leverkusen may not be the best place to start .
bayer have been quietly efficient in rising to third place and will be looking to make up ground on mainz in the place above them .
on form alone , it looks as though pauli will be deeper in the mire come saturday night .
prediction : leverkusen 3-1 mainz – hanover mainz in crisis !
two defeats on the bounce !
how easy it is to forget what an achievement this season has already been for mainz .
it is n't only their position which is impressive but the way they 've gotten there .
okay , so freiburg should never have beaten them last week – but only in the context of mainz 's amazing form to date .
last season , this would n't have been such a shock .
losing or drawing with hanover would n't have been either but on the evidence of this campaign alone , one would expect mainz to triumph .
prediction : mainz 2-0 sunday , nov 14 hoffenheim – freiburg despite winning last week , hoffenheim still dropped down the league , giving the illusion that their title charge has already petered out .
do n't be fooled .
the pendulum of form is swinging in the hoff 's direction and a win over freiburg will see them back in the mix .
freiburg had a great result against mainz and will have to be completely free of the hangover to cope with the hoff at home .
expecting the freiburgers to be well up for it as usual , this could be a tight affair .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 bayern – nuremberg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern lost their heads against gladbach last weekend they still have n't quite got it right , have they ?
louis van gaal tore his team a new one after letting the points slip against bottom club gladbach last week and you would expect a reaction from the german champions against nuremberg on sunday .
but how many times has the gruff dutchman got all red in the face only to see his team go pale on the pitch ?
nuremberg cantered to a win against cologne last week and of course bayern , however dire , are the polar opposite of the boys for köln .
however , the bavarians are increasingly hard to fathom so – who knows ?

the findings could have significant implications for dealing with hospital-acquired bugs . every year , over four million hospital patients in europe develop an infection during their stay .
the culprit is most often a strain of the bacteria staphylococcus aureus , also known as mrsa , which has proven resistant to antibiotic treatment .
scientists from the university of wuerzburg and the helmholtz center for infection research -lrb- hzi -rrb- in braunschweig have now found an approach to treating such infections .
they have developed an antibody which specifically targets mrsa in mice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staphylococcus aureus can cause a range of illnesses " we have succeeded in activating a defense mechanism against staphylococcus pathogens in mice with the help of antibodies , " said dr. udo lorenz from the university of wuerzburg 's department of surgery .
together with dr. knut ohlsen from the institute for molecular infection biology , lorenz has spent the last few years pursuing the idea of combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria with antibodies .
" these antibodies attach themselves to a specific point on the bacterium , " lorenz told deutsche welle .
this in turn marks the bacterium , so that the body 's own scavenger cells can detect them and subsequently kill them .
dr. christian erck from hzi worked on actually developing the antibodies in mice .
" these antibodies help make the bacteria visible to the immune system , " he told deutsche welle .
" even when antibiotics can no longer kill multi-resistant bacterial strains , antibodies still have a good chance against them . "
in the experiments , the mice 's immune systems were able to kill 30 percent more pathogens with the aid of the antibodies than without .
" this is a very dramatic advantage , which can constitute the difference between death and survival , " lorenz said .
targeting immune weakness most people have staphylococcus bacteria on their skin and , if they 're healthy , it does n't cause any problems .
" but this is a very flexible bacteria and it can become extremely aggressive , " erck said .
if these pathogens make their way inside patients with weakened immune systems , they cause infections which are extremely difficult to cure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lorenz -lrb- left -rrb- and ohlsen developed this procedure lorenz said this would be the target group for treatment .
" these are patients who have just had surgery or are in intensive care , whose immune systems are not functioning in an optimal way , " he said .
mouse to man the next step now involves transferring the antibody from mice to humans .
this means the entire molecule will need to be " humanized " so that people do n't develop antibodies against the mice antibodies and reject them .
" we will take only the part of the antibody that docks to the bacterium and build the rest of the molecule artificially , so that it is suitable for people , " lorenz said .
if everything goes according to plan , lorenz said he expected the first clinical study to take place at the end of 2012 .
" then we can find out which sort of infections are suitable for this treatment , " he said .
the scientists have published their findings in the current issue of the journal antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy .

the findings could have significant implications for dealing with hospital-acquired bugs . every year , over four million hospital patients in europe develop an infection during their stay .
the culprit is most often a strain of the bacteria staphylococcus aureus , also known as mrsa , which has proven resistant to antibiotic treatment .
scientists from the university of wuerzburg and the helmholtz center for infection research -lrb- hzi -rrb- in braunschweig have now found an approach to treating such infections .
they have developed an antibody which specifically targets mrsa in mice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staphylococcus aureus can cause a range of illnesses " we have succeeded in activating a defense mechanism against staphylococcus pathogens in mice with the help of antibodies , " said dr. udo lorenz from the university of wuerzburg 's department of surgery .
together with dr. knut ohlsen from the institute for molecular infection biology , lorenz has spent the last few years pursuing the idea of combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria with antibodies .
" these antibodies attach themselves to a specific point on the bacterium , " lorenz told deutsche welle .
this in turn marks the bacterium , so that the body 's own scavenger cells can detect them and subsequently kill them .
dr. christian erck from hzi worked on actually developing the antibodies in mice .
" these antibodies help make the bacteria visible to the immune system , " he told deutsche welle .
" even when antibiotics can no longer kill multi-resistant bacterial strains , antibodies still have a good chance against them . "
in the experiments , the mice 's immune systems were able to kill 30 percent more pathogens with the aid of the antibodies than without .
" this is a very dramatic advantage , which can constitute the difference between death and survival , " lorenz said .
targeting immune weakness most people have staphylococcus bacteria on their skin and , if they 're healthy , it does n't cause any problems .
" but this is a very flexible bacteria and it can become extremely aggressive , " erck said .
if these pathogens make their way inside patients with weakened immune systems , they cause infections which are extremely difficult to cure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lorenz -lrb- left -rrb- and ohlsen developed this procedure lorenz said this would be the target group for treatment .
" these are patients who have just had surgery or are in intensive care , whose immune systems are not functioning in an optimal way , " he said .
mouse to man the next step now involves transferring the antibody from mice to humans .
this means the entire molecule will need to be " humanized " so that people do n't develop antibodies against the mice antibodies and reject them .
" we will take only the part of the antibody that docks to the bacterium and build the rest of the molecule artificially , so that it is suitable for people , " lorenz said .
if everything goes according to plan , lorenz said he expected the first clinical study to take place at the end of 2012 .
" then we can find out which sort of infections are suitable for this treatment , " he said .
the scientists have published their findings in the current issue of the journal antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva says there is no " good corruption " no " good corruption " but sri mulyani , a former indonesian finance minister , in comments seen as targeting indonesian politicians who resisted reforms while she was minister said while progress had been made in curbing corruption in indonesia , there was still much to do .
" i see the transformation in my own country , " said sri mulyani . " it is true there is much to be done still .
corruption remains intertwined with politics and there are brazen attacks on those fighting corruption .
we are not alone in that regard .
nonetheless , corruption is an issue that no politician can ignore in indonesia . "
thailand ’ s prime minister abhisit vejjajiva , said despite efforts in thailand corruption remained endemic and was widely accepted within the community : " significantly , even today young people in my country tell me that they expect to see corruption everywhere .
an unbelievable percentage of people also say it is ok for politicians to be corrupt as long as they are capable of bringing economic prosperity .
rampant corruption can exist amid high economic growth .
citizens must be prudently aware that there is no such thing as ' good corruption ' . "
reports put the annual cost of corruption in thailand at around $ 3.0 billion a year .
in a local initiative , more than two dozen thai companies agreed to form a collective alliance to work against corruption .
the directors ’ institute says as many as 200 companies can be expected to join the alliance by next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian protesters demanded that the president should quit over two corruption scandals corruption contributes to inequality but for asian development bank president , haruhiko kuroda , the economic costs of corruption have a wider impact on the community .
" corruption is a tax on the poor , " he said . " corruption and weak governance in general undermine government revenues resulting in poor infrastructure and hinders the pace of poverty reduction .
it also contributes to inequalities in access to education , health , infrastructure and other productive assets .
and it is the poor and the vulnerable that inevitably bear the brunt . "
u.s. secretary of state hilary clinton , in a pre-recorded video statement , stressed the wider impact of corruption from business , politics , and democracy and as a factor in causing malnutrition .
but officials say while the issue of corruption was more openly discussed and legislation strengthened , enforcement remained a problem .
also for many countries where corruption remained rampant there was still some way to go to reduce its impact across societies .

they claimed that the power-sharing deal they had been presented with was not being honoured and that three of the party 's most senior members , barred for their alleged ties to saddam 's baath party , had not been reinstated as promised . as well as the annulment of the bans against the three iraqiya members , iraqiya had presented a further three conditions on which its participation in the power-sharing agreement would hinge : a bill forming the security body , a committee examining cases against political detainees , and codifying the power-sharing deal . iraqiya 's support for any government is seen a hugely important if iraq is not to descend into ethnic violence once more .
the sunni arab minority , which gave iraqiya a narrow victory in the contested march 7 poll , provided the heaviest resistance in the anti-us insurgency after the 2003 invasion .
its involvement in any coalition is imperative if peace is to be achieved . iraqiya 's apparent rejection of the deal highlights the fierce divides and rivalries which have paralysed the iraqi political system since the fall of saddam hussein regime .
the deal , clinched late wednesday night after three days of high-pressure talks between the rival factions , saw shiite prime minister al-maliki returning to office for a second term . talabani , a kurd , is expected to retain the presidency .
and a sunni mp was to be elected as speaker of parliament .
maliki now has 30 days to form his cabinet , and the next parliamentary meeting is scheduled for saturday .
the decision offered hope that the next government would include enough sunni representation to lower the chances of a return to the sectarian violence that killed tens of thousands of people after the 2003 , u.s.-led invasion that ousted sunni dictator saddam hussein .
iraqiya , who had held out for months to take the premiership from maliki after it narrowly won more seats in the march election , initially confirmed it had finally signed up to the deal .
us praises deal the obama administration called the development " a big step forward for iraq . " " all along we 've said the best result would be a government that reflects the results of the elections , includes all the major blocs representing iraq 's ethnic and sectarian groups , and that does not exclude or marginalize anyone .
that 's exactly what iraqis seem to have agreed to , " antony blinken , national security adviser to us vice president joe biden , said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi prime minister ayad allawi 's group finally agreed to the deal iraq has been without a new government since the vote , which gave iraqiya two more seats than maliki 's bloc .
neither had enough for a majority in parliament , leaving the factions to negotiate a government .
iraqiya initially joined a kurdish alliance in supporting maliki following months of contentious negotiations which raised tensions in iraq as the army and police try to cement security gains against a stubborn insurgency .
last month , maliki toured capitals in the region - from iran and syria to turkey and egypt - to gain regional backing for his effort to stay in power .
he offered arab nations investment deals in iraq in exchange for nudging iraqiya toward a compromise , political sources said .
court pressure paid off over the past months , iraqiya repeatedly rejected another maliki term and demanded the right to form the government as the top vote winner in the election .
parliament met briefly in june but lawmakers said they needed more time to decide who would hold the highest offices .
last month , iraq 's high court ordered parliament to resume its sessions , putting pressure on politicians to expedite a deal .
the long deadlock has fueled tension even though the sectarian carnage unleashed after the 2003 invasion is receding while u.s. forces prepare to withdraw in 2011 .
a series of attacks on christian targets across baghdad on wednesday stirred renewed fear in the minority community .
the bomb and mortar blasts occurred just 10 days after a bloody siege at a catholic cathedral that killed 52 .

extraction would be expensive , but there is interest in the us as well as in japan in working with mongolia to extract these resources , says dr. michael j. green .
he served as senior director for asian affairs at the national security council under president george w. bush .
speaking at an event of the jamestown foundation in washington dc , green says : " this is an opportunity for mongolia to refocus .
around this can be built some bilateral or multilateral investment guarantees , things that china does n't do .
mongolia as part of its brand can say , ' we will honor our contracts and not violate the wto by embargoing exports ' . "
and it is not only rare earths that make mongolia attractive .
a little over a year ago , the mongolian government signed a four billion mining deal with a canadian-based company and its anglo-australian partner .
the companies will jointly develop a project in a location thought to hold one of the world 's largest copper and gold reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gold mine in mongolia the us as " a third neighbor " the us , green says , can play a critical role in helping mongolia 's security and economy by being a " third neighbor " – in addition to china and russia – that helps to " galvanize broader relationships for mongolia throughout the world " .
one reason is democracy .
as recently as 20 years ago , mongolia achieved its independence from the ussr through a peaceful democratic revolution .
" mongolia sits in a belt of poor governance and democracy , stretching from beijing to russia - where despite what was said about some economic success , let 's face it : russian democracy is going backwards – to central asia , to belarus , " explains michael green .
" you really have to go thousands and thousands of miles from ulan bator in some directions before you find a functioning democracy that is as successful , despite challenges , as mongolia .
and that is an example that should be important to the us and the west . "
batchimeg migeddorj , national security advisor to the president of mongolia , attributes it to the special circumstances that mongolia was able to develop a democracy .
he says : " exactly during that time , in the nineties , our two neighbors , china and russia , were concentrating more on internal affairs .
that provided mongolias politicians and political parties with more room to work internally to stabilize institutions . "
sending troops to afghanistan but besides being a model democracy , there is more .
mongolia has sent troops to iraq that have been very effective , according to green , " taking risks a lot of nato countries are n't willing to take in terms of being in the line of fire " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us president bush on a visit to mongolia " today , mongolia has about a platoon , helping with perimeter security for the germans in afghanistan , " says green .
he argues that mongolia has more credibility in demanding transparency from china 's military .
at the same time , he says , the us can not compete with russia and china , so the americans have a strong interest that mongolia develops strong ties with other democratic countries like japan ; korea , the eu , india .
colonel munch-ochir dorjjugder , who served as the director for international cooperation of the mongolian ministry of defense and is now a fellow at the brookings institution , rejects the negative assessment that mongolia is " torn " between russia and china .
nevertheless , he observes mongolia 's " identity dilemma " between northeast-asia and eurasia but comes to the conclusion : " we can promote both agendas as our regional identity .
our culture and our background compels us to do so , our current geographic location compels us to do so , as does our good neighborly relations with russia and china and our interest in seeking third neighbors elsewhere . "
seeking options besides china but mongolia is trying to seek more independence from china .
despite the fact that most of the country 's mineral resources are close to the chinese border , the mongolian government decided to develop a railway infrastructure within the country and towards the russian border rather than towards china .
80 percent of imported goods already come through china , dorjjugder says , and since china occasionally closes its borders or restricts exports , the decision will keep alternatives open .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out after the parliamentary election in 2008 mongolia 's new security concept is also a reaction to china 's challenge , says dr. alicia campi , president of the us-mongolia advisory group .
" while certainly mongolia does not want to lose its vigorous democracy and free market , and return to cold war era satellite status , policy makers increasingly are thinking that inviting much more sizable russian fdi -lrb- foreign direct investment -rrb- and military assistance are not bad ideas at all since western nations have so far proven slow to act and disappointing . "
at the same time , she says , mongolians are looking at the central asian states and on to iran and turkey as well as to the fast rising india .
they could play an alternative role in balancing both china and russia .
and in 2010 , iranian delegations have been buying mongolian meat and animal byproducts .
nobody should be surprised , says campi , if the iranians are examining options for investing in mongolia 's mineral sector .
this would give the us another reason to strengthen their ties with mongolia .

but he had a host of other issues in his luggage as he mets chinese president hu jintao on the sidelines of the summit . there was no shortage of issues awaiting us president barack obama even before the g20 summit began on thursday in seoul .
obama was scheduled to meet both chinese president hu jintao and south korean president lee myung-bak parallel to the summit .
for the latter , the most pressing agenda item was expected to be the ratification of a pending free trade deal that us and south korean diplomats from both sides have been hashing out over the past two days .
despite a number of sticking points , including disagreement on autos and beef trade , myung-bak and obama agreed in a telephone conversation last week to strive for agreement before the g20 .
on thursday morning , news broke that the two sides failed to reach an agreement on a free-trade accord , but said talks would continue after the g20 summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama faces a complex meeting with hu jintao yet the meeting was also be laden with symbolic value , as howard loewen , researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , said .
" i think they want to reaffirm the security alliance between the south korea and the us , for the protection of south korea , " loewen told deutsche welle ahead of the meeting on wednesday .
" which is of course a message for north korea and china . "
chinese tension the meeting with jintao is likely to be more general and possibly less conclusive , however .
apart from recent disagreements over currency issues and accusations of protectionism , the americans are consistently calling on china to take on more responsibility .
" if you 're a big country , you have the power to sit at the table in the biggest forums , but you have to be willing to take on responsibility , and i think that will be a subject of conversation , " says loewen .
for its part , china is wary of obama 's diplomacy drive in asia , particularly us attempts to assert a position in multilateral bodies .
next year the us will join the east asia summit , an annual forum of east asian countries , and loewen believes that obama is consciously going beyond the network of bilateral relations the us maintains with likes of japan , south korea , the philippines and thailand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will join the east asia summit next year " the us is showing more diplomatic initiatives in southeast asia than it did in the bush era , " said loewen .
" at the same time , the us wants to engage more in the multilateral regulation of problems .
you really ca n't say that the us is retreating in the region - on the contrary , it is pushing ahead more . "
" of course , the chinese are not keen on seeing the us engaging themselves more , " he added .
" because they fear that the us could rival their influence , which of course it does .
the chinese are getting nervous . "
multilateral vs. bilateral perhaps for this reason china has made one regional issue a taboo for multilateral talks .
pascal abb of the german institute of global and area studies , told deutsche welle , " china has made it clear that it does not want the territorial conflicts in the south china seas to be discussed multilaterally , but that is the central conflict in the region . "
the conflict is over a number of tiny islands in the south china seas – china , taiwan , vietnam , the philippines and malaysia all lay claim to the islands , mainly because of the rich natural resources in the area , as well as the trade routes that run through these waters .
but china 's refusal to allow the matter to be discussed multilaterally effectively scuppers any chance of progress .
" i do n't see how overlapping territorial conflicts can be solved bilaterally , " says abb , " simply because no third country is likely to accept an agreement that two other states have reached . "
political gamble but for obama , the recent mid-term elections mean that what some people call his " multilateral gamble " may be under more pressure .
while the new strength in the republican party does not extend to controlling the senate , which has more control over us foreign policy , some believe that if obama 's attempts to assert himself in asia do not bear economic fruit , he may hand the republicans extra ammunition in the 2012 presidential election .
but that is still a long term concern .
for now , the republicans are unlikely to gain much traction with such attacks .
" it could be that the republicans want to assert their foreign policies now , and may make demands like that , " says loewen .
" but i think it wo n't be that serious , because there are no multilateral commitments .
it is easier to go back on multilateral agreements , so i do n't think that will play a big role . "

the conflict is over a number of tiny islands in the south china seas – china , taiwan , vietnam , the philippines and malaysia all lay claim to the islands , mainly because of the rich natural resources in the area , as well as the trade routes that run through these waters .
but china 's refusal to allow the matter to be discussed multilaterally effectively scuppers any chance of progress .
" i do n't see how overlapping territorial conflicts can be solved bilaterally , " says abb , " simply because no third country is likely to accept an agreement that two other states have reached . "
political gamble but for obama , the recent mid-term elections mean that what some people call his " multilateral gamble " may be under more pressure .
while the new strength in the republican party does not extend to controlling the senate , which has more control over us foreign policy , some believe that if obama 's attempts to assert himself in asia do not bear economic fruit , he may hand the republicans extra ammunition in the 2012 presidential election .
but that is still a long term concern .
for now , the republicans are unlikely to gain much traction with such attacks .
" it could be that the republicans want to assert their foreign policies now , and may make demands like that , " says loewen .
" but i think it wo n't be that serious , because there are no multilateral commitments .
it is easier to go back on multilateral agreements , so i do n't think that will play a big role . "

the report says corruption both affected cost for business development but also crippled countries in efforts to ward off poverty as money used in corrupt payments was not being spent on job creation .
sri mulyani indrawati , world bank managing director said the consequences of corruption also go beyond simply the economic impact .
" over time it becomes a real barrier to development , innovation and business growth because sometimes the corruption is in the form of counterfeit drugs so better don ’ t get better or they die , " he said .
" sometime corruption is a building that collapses in the face of national disaster because the quality inspector took a payment from the construction contractor to falsify an inspection .
corruption can kill . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva says there is no " good corruption " no " good corruption " but sri mulyani , a former indonesian finance minister , in comments seen as targeting indonesian politicians who resisted reforms while she was minister said while progress had been made in curbing corruption in indonesia , there was still much to do .
" i see the transformation in my own country , " said sri mulyani . " it is true there is much to be done still .
corruption remains intertwined with politics and there are brazen attacks on those fighting corruption .
we are not alone in that regard .
nonetheless , corruption is an issue that no politician can ignore in indonesia . "
thailand ’ s prime minister abhisit vejjajiva , said despite efforts in thailand corruption remained endemic and was widely accepted within the community : " significantly , even today young people in my country tell me that they expect to see corruption everywhere .
an unbelievable percentage of people also say it is ok for politicians to be corrupt as long as they are capable of bringing economic prosperity .
rampant corruption can exist amid high economic growth .
citizens must be prudently aware that there is no such thing as ' good corruption ' . "
reports put the annual cost of corruption in thailand at around $ 3.0 billion a year .
in a local initiative , more than two dozen thai companies agreed to form a collective alliance to work against corruption .
the directors ’ institute says as many as 200 companies can be expected to join the alliance by next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian protesters demanded that the president should quit over two corruption scandals corruption contributes to inequality but for asian development bank president , haruhiko kuroda , the economic costs of corruption have a wider impact on the community .
" corruption is a tax on the poor , " he said . " corruption and weak governance in general undermine government revenues resulting in poor infrastructure and hinders the pace of poverty reduction .
it also contributes to inequalities in access to education , health , infrastructure and other productive assets .
and it is the poor and the vulnerable that inevitably bear the brunt . "
u.s. secretary of state hilary clinton , in a pre-recorded video statement , stressed the wider impact of corruption from business , politics , and democracy and as a factor in causing malnutrition .
but officials say while the issue of corruption was more openly discussed and legislation strengthened , enforcement remained a problem .
also for many countries where corruption remained rampant there was still some way to go to reduce its impact across societies .

they claimed that the power-sharing deal they had been presented with was not being honoured and that three of the party 's most senior members , barred for their alleged ties to saddam 's baath party , had not been reinstated as promised . as well as the annulment of the bans against the three iraqiya members , iraqiya had presented a further three conditions on which its participation in the power-sharing agreement would hinge : a bill forming the security body , a committee examining cases against political detainees , and codifying the power-sharing deal . iraqiya 's support for any government is seen a hugely important if iraq is not to descend into ethnic violence once more .
the sunni arab minority , which gave iraqiya a narrow victory in the contested march 7 poll , provided the heaviest resistance in the anti-us insurgency after the 2003 invasion .
its involvement in any coalition is imperative if peace is to be achieved . iraqiya 's apparent rejection of the deal highlights the fierce divides and rivalries which have paralysed the iraqi political system since the fall of saddam hussein regime .
the deal , clinched late wednesday night after three days of high-pressure talks between the rival factions , saw shiite prime minister al-maliki returning to office for a second term . talabani , a kurd , is expected to retain the presidency .
and a sunni mp was to be elected as speaker of parliament .
maliki now has 30 days to form his cabinet , and the next parliamentary meeting is scheduled for saturday .
the decision offered hope that the next government would include enough sunni representation to lower the chances of a return to the sectarian violence that killed tens of thousands of people after the 2003 , u.s.-led invasion that ousted sunni dictator saddam hussein .
iraqiya , who had held out for months to take the premiership from maliki after it narrowly won more seats in the march election , initially confirmed it had finally signed up to the deal .
us praises deal the obama administration called the development " a big step forward for iraq . " " all along we 've said the best result would be a government that reflects the results of the elections , includes all the major blocs representing iraq 's ethnic and sectarian groups , and that does not exclude or marginalize anyone .
that 's exactly what iraqis seem to have agreed to , " antony blinken , national security adviser to us vice president joe biden , said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi prime minister ayad allawi 's group finally agreed to the deal iraq has been without a new government since the vote , which gave iraqiya two more seats than maliki 's bloc .
neither had enough for a majority in parliament , leaving the factions to negotiate a government .
iraqiya initially joined a kurdish alliance in supporting maliki following months of contentious negotiations which raised tensions in iraq as the army and police try to cement security gains against a stubborn insurgency .
last month , maliki toured capitals in the region - from iran and syria to turkey and egypt - to gain regional backing for his effort to stay in power .
he offered arab nations investment deals in iraq in exchange for nudging iraqiya toward a compromise , political sources said .
court pressure paid off over the past months , iraqiya repeatedly rejected another maliki term and demanded the right to form the government as the top vote winner in the election .
parliament met briefly in june but lawmakers said they needed more time to decide who would hold the highest offices .
last month , iraq 's high court ordered parliament to resume its sessions , putting pressure on politicians to expedite a deal .
the long deadlock has fueled tension even though the sectarian carnage unleashed after the 2003 invasion is receding while u.s. forces prepare to withdraw in 2011 .
a series of attacks on christian targets across baghdad on wednesday stirred renewed fear in the minority community .
the bomb and mortar blasts occurred just 10 days after a bloody siege at a catholic cathedral that killed 52 .

it is designed to help children who might be struggling in school , as well as stretch high-achievers . nick treloar , a 15-year-old student at the french lycée in london , used to have a tutor come to the house .
but he finds the online tuition a more flexible alternative . " it 's a whenever-you-want system , " nick said .
" you can book the session for any time of day .
it 's you that says ' i want this hour to this hour . '
it 's your choice , so whenever you have a free period during the day , or you finish an hour earlier , then you can come home , and sit down and do this session . " nick 's tutor nathan is based thousands of miles away , in ludhiana , india .
nick has never even seen what his tutor looks like .
but he can hear him , as he guides nick through math problems on a white board that they can both see and write on - a more effective method than simply chatting with a camera on skype . a manageable structure nathan speaks fluent american english from having tutored us students online .
he is 31 years old , and has a five-year-old daughter .
he earns about eight euros -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- an hour , which he says is more than double what many people his age are earning in other professions in india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nathan carries out his work from punjab for him , tutoring is not just about the money , though , but the love of mentoring students and shaping their future .
nathan holds a master 's degree in mathematics and he has been handpicked and trained for the job .
he had already been tutoring american school kids via the web for three years before joining brightspark .
he said he was impressed with british students . " it 's a much better level with uk students , and often with some subjects , they start them much younger , " nathan said . the time difference between the uk and india is four-and-a-half hours , which nathan said is manageable .
he said if a british student books the latest session available , at 9 pm in the uk , it is 1:30 am in ludhiana . nathan is currently part of a team of 30 tutors .
but the company expects to grow to 100 tutors - all working out of small office booths with laptops and skype headsets . lack of specialists british demand for online math tutorials is growing , according to brightspark education chief tom hooper .
he saw an acute need in britain for specialized math tuition for struggling school kids , and introduced indian online tutors after seeing the project work in the us . one british primary school is already using the online tutorials in class to support the teacher - and there are more schools in the pipeline .
hooper is also working with charities in deprived areas and housing estates by introducing the online tutorials to drop-in centers , where mothers can drop their kids off , for an hour 's session at a computer terminal . he says there is a shocking lack of specialist math teachers in britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tutors are virtual at brightspark " only 11 percent of teachers have a degree in the subject they teach , and only eight percent have any training , " hooper said .
" we thought by going to india , we could bring in a level of academic talent that is 100 percent related to math and a 100 percent trained .
that 's why we are seeing a benefit for our students . " hooper also said it 's not just british children who need help . " there are distinct problems among elements of the adult population who have very low numeracy skills , which creates problems socially , but also for unemployed people who want to re-engage with the workforce , " he said . the tutoring industry in britain is completely unregulated , according to hooper .
the company therefore introduced its own strict standards for data protection , assuring their clients their data are closely guarded .
students often get a different tutor with every new session , and the tutors know nothing about them , except their name . with plans to expand the online tutoring business to other subjects , hooper rejects the accusation that indians are somehow taking away british teaching jobs . " i strongly reject that allegation , " he said .
" we are not outsourcing british jobs ; we are in-sourcing specialist skills . " progress is visible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nick likes the flexibility of online tutoring for nick 's father phil , the online tutoring helps him monitor his son 's progress .
he can see how many sessions nick is booking , because he pays for them - and he can see tangible results in nick 's math scores . " we are able to see his progress , and it makes him much more open to be able to tell us which areas he is dropping back in and needs help , " phil said . an online tutor from india costs clients on average of 13 euros an hour .
a tutor in person can cost up to 46 euros - three times as much .
with that price difference , and specialist math tutors on offer , the company said they expect more students like nick to sign up . author : nina-maria potts / sms editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 11.11.2010 iraq 's power-sharing deal thrown into doubt after sunni walkout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi prime minister-elect al-maliki still faces huge problems after reaching a power-sharing deal to end iraq 's political impasse eight months after elections and install nuri al-maliki as prime minister-elect , the war-torn country was again plunged into uncertainty . ministers from a sunni-backed bloc stormed out of a government session friday over what it said was the rejection of its demands , leaving the process once again in disarray . over 60 angry members of the iraqiya party , the bloc of former prime minister iyad allawi , walked out of a meeting in the council of representatives chamber , leaving the deal in the balance just hours after it had been sealed by iraqi president jalal talabani .
they claimed that the power-sharing deal they had been presented with was not being honoured and that three of the party 's most senior members , barred for their alleged ties to saddam 's baath party , had not been reinstated as promised . as well as the annulment of the bans against the three iraqiya members , iraqiya had presented a further three conditions on which its participation in the power-sharing agreement would hinge : a bill forming the security body , a committee examining cases against political detainees , and codifying the power-sharing deal . iraqiya 's support for any government is seen a hugely important if iraq is not to descend into ethnic violence once more .
the sunni arab minority , which gave iraqiya a narrow victory in the contested march 7 poll , provided the heaviest resistance in the anti-us insurgency after the 2003 invasion .
its involvement in any coalition is imperative if peace is to be achieved . iraqiya 's apparent rejection of the deal highlights the fierce divides and rivalries which have paralysed the iraqi political system since the fall of saddam hussein regime .
the deal , clinched late wednesday night after three days of high-pressure talks between the rival factions , saw shiite prime minister al-maliki returning to office for a second term . talabani , a kurd , is expected to retain the presidency .
and a sunni mp was to be elected as speaker of parliament .
maliki now has 30 days to form his cabinet , and the next parliamentary meeting is scheduled for saturday .
the decision offered hope that the next government would include enough sunni representation to lower the chances of a return to the sectarian violence that killed tens of thousands of people after the 2003 , u.s.-led invasion that ousted sunni dictator saddam hussein .
iraqiya , who had held out for months to take the premiership from maliki after it narrowly won more seats in the march election , initially confirmed it had finally signed up to the deal .
us praises deal the obama administration called the development " a big step forward for iraq . " " all along we 've said the best result would be a government that reflects the results of the elections , includes all the major blocs representing iraq 's ethnic and sectarian groups , and that does not exclude or marginalize anyone .
that 's exactly what iraqis seem to have agreed to , " antony blinken , national security adviser to us vice president joe biden , said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi prime minister ayad allawi 's group finally agreed to the deal iraq has been without a new government since the vote , which gave iraqiya two more seats than maliki 's bloc .
neither had enough for a majority in parliament , leaving the factions to negotiate a government .
iraqiya initially joined a kurdish alliance in supporting maliki following months of contentious negotiations which raised tensions in iraq as the army and police try to cement security gains against a stubborn insurgency .
last month , maliki toured capitals in the region - from iran and syria to turkey and egypt - to gain regional backing for his effort to stay in power .
he offered arab nations investment deals in iraq in exchange for nudging iraqiya toward a compromise , political sources said .
court pressure paid off over the past months , iraqiya repeatedly rejected another maliki term and demanded the right to form the government as the top vote winner in the election .
parliament met briefly in june but lawmakers said they needed more time to decide who would hold the highest offices .
last month , iraq 's high court ordered parliament to resume its sessions , putting pressure on politicians to expedite a deal .
the long deadlock has fueled tension even though the sectarian carnage unleashed after the 2003 invasion is receding while u.s. forces prepare to withdraw in 2011 .
a series of attacks on christian targets across baghdad on wednesday stirred renewed fear in the minority community .
the bomb and mortar blasts occurred just 10 days after a bloody siege at a catholic cathedral that killed 52 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 11.11.2010 greece misses debt target , as worries grow in ireland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have greece and ireland bitten off more than they can chew ?
the greek finance ministry has said it has narrowly missed its january-october target to reduce its budget deficit .
the unwelcome news comes as the eu said it would take action to support ireland , if needed . the greek public deficit has fallen sharply since the implementation of an eu-imf rescue package for the debt-stricken country , but efforts to reduce the shortfall have still fallen short of the targets set for this year .
greece , struggling with a huge public deficit , came close to default in may and had to be bailed out with a 110-billion-euro package arranged by the eu and international monetary fund .
through october , greek public finances showed a deficit of some 17.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 24 billion -rrb- , down 30 percent from the same period a year ago , but still less than the 32 percent target .
the government in athens has implemented a series of draconian reforms aimed at restoring its financial credibility .
it cut spending by 7 percent , or four billion euros , but tax revenues only grew 3.7 percent , well short of the 2010 target of 13.7 percent .
at the same time as this announcement , the european union moved to reassure financial markets on thursday that it was ready to support ireland as the eurozone country 's debt woes made waves at the g20 summit in south korea .
ireland has worst deficit in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu is poised to help ireland too , barroso said concern about ireland is growing after irish bond yields soared to a record level of 8.28 percent on wednesday . as a result , european commission president jose manuel barroso found himself compelled to announce that the eu stood ready to help ireland " in case of need . "
" what is important now is that we have all the necessary instruments in place , " barroso said in the south korean capital , seoul , ahead of the g20 meeting .
" we are monitoring the situation in ireland on a permanent basis , " he added .
the rise in irish bond yields has unsettled investors and put the entire european bond market under serious strain .
ireland is trying to tackle the worst budget deficit in the eu and convince markets that it does not need a greek-style bailout .

the construction group acs handed in its offer to german financial supervisors bafin , which now has 15 days to deliberate . spain 's largest construction group acs presented its offer for german rival hochtief to germany 's financial supervisory authority bafin on thursday .
bafin now has 15 days to rule on the takeover bid , and hochtief shareholders then have a further four weeks to decide whether to accept the offer .
acs , which already holds just under 30 percent of hochtief , germany 's largest public works construction company , wants to take a controlling stake in the business .
it is seeking an all-share swap to create what would become one of the world 's leading construction firms .
however , acs has offered a price below hochtief 's current market value of around 4.3 billion euros -lrb- 5.9 billion dollars -rrb- , which hochtief sees as unfair .
preventative strategies herbert luetkestratkoetter , head of hochtief , said the company considers the acs bid to be hostile and is " definitely " planning further strategic action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees protested against acs in october hochtief 's chief financial officer burkard lohr refused to rule out a capital increase or a convertible loan to refinance the company .
both measures would increase the number of hochtief shares and thus make a takeover bid more difficult .
another option is for essen-based hochtief to puts its subsidiary concessions on the stock market , even if it means separating itself from that part of its business . concessions ' main activity is the operation of airports and toll-roads .
at the same time the german firm is trying to force the spanish group to make a bid for hochtief 's australian subsidiary leighton , thereby increasing the price , and possibly discouraging acs .
acs could instead carry out a capital increase of 78.5 million euros -lrb- 107.6 million dollars -rrb- , which is to be approved during an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on november 19 .

it is designed to help children who might be struggling in school , as well as stretch high-achievers . nick treloar , a 15-year-old student at the french lycée in london , used to have a tutor come to the house .
but he finds the online tuition a more flexible alternative . " it 's a whenever-you-want system , " nick said .
" you can book the session for any time of day .
it 's you that says ' i want this hour to this hour . '
it 's your choice , so whenever you have a free period during the day , or you finish an hour earlier , then you can come home , and sit down and do this session . " nick 's tutor nathan is based thousands of miles away , in ludhiana , india .
nick has never even seen what his tutor looks like .
but he can hear him , as he guides nick through math problems on a white board that they can both see and write on - a more effective method than simply chatting with a camera on skype . a manageable structure nathan speaks fluent american english from having tutored us students online .
he is 31 years old , and has a five-year-old daughter .
he earns about eight euros -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- an hour , which he says is more than double what many people his age are earning in other professions in india . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nathan carries out his work from punjab for him , tutoring is not just about the money , though , but the love of mentoring students and shaping their future .
nathan holds a master 's degree in mathematics and he has been handpicked and trained for the job .
he had already been tutoring american school kids via the web for three years before joining brightspark .
he said he was impressed with british students . " it 's a much better level with uk students , and often with some subjects , they start them much younger , " nathan said . the time difference between the uk and india is four-and-a-half hours , which nathan said is manageable .
he said if a british student books the latest session available , at 9 pm in the uk , it is 1:30 am in ludhiana . nathan is currently part of a team of 30 tutors .
but the company expects to grow to 100 tutors - all working out of small office booths with laptops and skype headsets . lack of specialists british demand for online math tutorials is growing , according to brightspark education chief tom hooper .
he saw an acute need in britain for specialized math tuition for struggling school kids , and introduced indian online tutors after seeing the project work in the us . one british primary school is already using the online tutorials in class to support the teacher - and there are more schools in the pipeline .
hooper is also working with charities in deprived areas and housing estates by introducing the online tutorials to drop-in centers , where mothers can drop their kids off , for an hour 's session at a computer terminal . he says there is a shocking lack of specialist math teachers in britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tutors are virtual at brightspark " only 11 percent of teachers have a degree in the subject they teach , and only eight percent have any training , " hooper said .
" we thought by going to india , we could bring in a level of academic talent that is 100 percent related to math and a 100 percent trained .
that 's why we are seeing a benefit for our students . " hooper also said it 's not just british children who need help . " there are distinct problems among elements of the adult population who have very low numeracy skills , which creates problems socially , but also for unemployed people who want to re-engage with the workforce , " he said . the tutoring industry in britain is completely unregulated , according to hooper .
the company therefore introduced its own strict standards for data protection , assuring their clients their data are closely guarded .
students often get a different tutor with every new session , and the tutors know nothing about them , except their name . with plans to expand the online tutoring business to other subjects , hooper rejects the accusation that indians are somehow taking away british teaching jobs . " i strongly reject that allegation , " he said .
" we are not outsourcing british jobs ; we are in-sourcing specialist skills . " progress is visible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nick likes the flexibility of online tutoring for nick 's father phil , the online tutoring helps him monitor his son 's progress .
he can see how many sessions nick is booking , because he pays for them - and he can see tangible results in nick 's math scores . " we are able to see his progress , and it makes him much more open to be able to tell us which areas he is dropping back in and needs help , " phil said . an online tutor from india costs clients on average of 13 euros an hour .
a tutor in person can cost up to 46 euros - three times as much .
with that price difference , and specialist math tutors on offer , the company said they expect more students like nick to sign up . author : nina-maria potts / sms editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

each year , november 11 marks the kick-off of carnival in cologne . november tends to be dreary in germany 's rhineland region , but the city of cologne looks forward to one bright spot in the month each year .
on november 11 - at exactly 11:11 a.m. - carnival begins !
on the mid-november day , it 's perfectly normal to leave the house in the morning and run across people in all sorts of costumes along the way .
they 're often heading downtown , loaded up with beer and liquor and ready to meet up with other revelers to get the festival started .
carnival is more than just a tradition in the city ; it 's part of cologne 's cultural identity .
bildunterschrift : clown costumes are a favorite , but everything from witches to cows to politicians also hits the streets carnival has its origins in a number of different eras .
ancient greeks and romans honored the god dionysos with a festival featuring " women , wine and song . "
germanic tribes also celebrated the shift to winter as a way of driving away wicked winter demons .
christianity took on the custom later in order to usher in lent .
the latin root , " carne vale , " of the german term " karneval " roughly translates to " farewell to meat . "
rose monday these days , the festival in cologne is organized and hosted by over 100 local carnival associations .
the associations host events during the year 's so-called " fifth season " featuring all sorts of entertainment , from music and dancing to witty political commentary .
in february each year , the world-famous rose monday parade rounds out the carnival season .
hundreds of thousands of visitors head to cologne to party for days and participate in the parades .
november 11 is when the fun gets started , but - except for the members of the carnival associations - the festival remains largely out of sight through the holiday season .

the findings could have significant implications for dealing with hospital-acquired bugs . every year , over four million hospital patients in europe develop an infection during their stay .
the culprit is most often a strain of the bacteria staphylococcus aureus , also known as mrsa , which has proven resistant to antibiotic treatment .
scientists from the university of wuerzburg and the helmholtz center for infection research -lrb- hzi -rrb- in braunschweig have now found an approach to treating such infections .
they have developed an antibody which specifically targets mrsa in mice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staphylococcus aureus can cause a range of illnesses " we have succeeded in activating a defense mechanism against staphylococcus pathogens in mice with the help of antibodies , " said dr. udo lorenz from the university of wuerzburg 's department of surgery .
together with dr. knut ohlsen from the institute for molecular infection biology , lorenz has spent the last few years pursuing the idea of combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria with antibodies .
" these antibodies attach themselves to a specific point on the bacterium , " lorenz told deutsche welle .
this in turn marks the bacterium , so that the body 's own scavenger cells can detect them and subsequently kill them .
dr. christian erck from hzi worked on actually developing the antibodies in mice .
" these antibodies help make the bacteria visible to the immune system , " he told deutsche welle .
" even when antibiotics can no longer kill multi-resistant bacterial strains , antibodies still have a good chance against them . "
in the experiments , the mice 's immune systems were able to kill 30 percent more pathogens with the aid of the antibodies than without .
" this is a very dramatic advantage , which can constitute the difference between death and survival , " lorenz said .
targeting immune weakness most people have staphylococcus bacteria on their skin and , if they 're healthy , it does n't cause any problems .
" but this is a very flexible bacteria and it can become extremely aggressive , " erck said .
if these pathogens make their way inside patients with weakened immune systems , they cause infections which are extremely difficult to cure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lorenz -lrb- left -rrb- and ohlsen developed this procedure lorenz said this would be the target group for treatment .
" these are patients who have just had surgery or are in intensive care , whose immune systems are not functioning in an optimal way , " he said .
mouse to man the next step now involves transferring the antibody from mice to humans .
this means the entire molecule will need to be " humanized " so that people do n't develop antibodies against the mice antibodies and reject them .
" we will take only the part of the antibody that docks to the bacterium and build the rest of the molecule artificially , so that it is suitable for people , " lorenz said .
if everything goes according to plan , lorenz said he expected the first clinical study to take place at the end of 2012 .
" then we can find out which sort of infections are suitable for this treatment , " he said .
the scientists have published their findings in the current issue of the journal antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy .

the greek finance ministry has said it has narrowly missed its january-october target to reduce its budget deficit .
the unwelcome news comes as the eu said it would take action to support ireland , if needed . the greek public deficit has fallen sharply since the implementation of an eu-imf rescue package for the debt-stricken country , but efforts to reduce the shortfall have still fallen short of the targets set for this year .
greece , struggling with a huge public deficit , came close to default in may and had to be bailed out with a 110-billion-euro package arranged by the eu and international monetary fund .
through october , greek public finances showed a deficit of some 17.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 24 billion -rrb- , down 30 percent from the same period a year ago , but still less than the 32 percent target .
the government in athens has implemented a series of draconian reforms aimed at restoring its financial credibility .
it cut spending by 7 percent , or four billion euros , but tax revenues only grew 3.7 percent , well short of the 2010 target of 13.7 percent .
at the same time as this announcement , the european union moved to reassure financial markets on thursday that it was ready to support ireland as the eurozone country 's debt woes made waves at the g20 summit in south korea .
ireland has worst deficit in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu is poised to help ireland too , barroso said concern about ireland is growing after irish bond yields soared to a record level of 8.28 percent on wednesday . as a result , european commission president jose manuel barroso found himself compelled to announce that the eu stood ready to help ireland " in case of need . "
" what is important now is that we have all the necessary instruments in place , " barroso said in the south korean capital , seoul , ahead of the g20 meeting .
" we are monitoring the situation in ireland on a permanent basis , " he added .
the rise in irish bond yields has unsettled investors and put the entire european bond market under serious strain .
ireland is trying to tackle the worst budget deficit in the eu and convince markets that it does not need a greek-style bailout .

" we continue to support the goal of withdrawal , " westerwelle said during a parliamentary debate on thursday in berlin .
disarmament is going to be a " key issue " for germany at the lisbon meeting , the foreign minister said .
there are no official figures about the number of nuclear weapons stationed on german soil , but it is believed that perhaps 10 to 20 nuclear warheads from the us arsenal are stockpiled at the buechel air base in the state of rhineland-palatinate in southwestern germany .
russian cooperation government leaders and heads of state of the 28 nato member countries meet in the portuguese capital next week friday to discuss a major strategic overhaul of the military alliance .
a key element of nato 's new strategy to be decided upon in lisbon is a european missile-defense system .
in what westerwelle called an " historic gesture , " russia will be involved in the discussions .
" we do n't want a europe with areas of differing security levels , " westerwelle said .
" we want to improve our security alongside , not in confrontation with russia . "
westerwelle defends cabinet colleague the foreign minister used his address in parliament to also set straight a cornerstone of german military doctrine .
westerwelle rejected accusations that defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was revamping the german armed forces to fight what the opposition called " economic wars . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister called for nuclear exit and defended his colleague karl-theodor zu guttenberg " we will continue the culture of military restraint .
any other assumption is defamation that has nothing to do with reality , " the minister said .
westerwelle 's comments were viewed as indirect support for defense minister guttenberg , who recently made controversial remarks to the effect that germany should align its security policies with economic interests , like other countries do .
in response , the green party parliamentary leader , juergen trittin , accused guttenberg of pursuing " gunboat diplomacy . "
defending his position , guttenberg told parliament on thursday that the strategy was contained in a government white paper from 2006 when the opposition social democrats were still in a grand coalition with chancellor merkel 's christian democrats .
" there were no cries of outrage then , " guttenberg said , " but now comes the great wave of indignation . "
the issue of economic intervention is also expected to be on the agenda of the nato summit next week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 11.11.2010 obama , seoul , and multilateral ambitions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants to reaffirm ties with south korea , but has other concerns barack obama traveled to south korea ahead of this week 's g20 summit .
but he had a host of other issues in his luggage as he mets chinese president hu jintao on the sidelines of the summit . there was no shortage of issues awaiting us president barack obama even before the g20 summit began on thursday in seoul .
obama was scheduled to meet both chinese president hu jintao and south korean president lee myung-bak parallel to the summit .
for the latter , the most pressing agenda item was expected to be the ratification of a pending free trade deal that us and south korean diplomats from both sides have been hashing out over the past two days .
despite a number of sticking points , including disagreement on autos and beef trade , myung-bak and obama agreed in a telephone conversation last week to strive for agreement before the g20 .
on thursday morning , news broke that the two sides failed to reach an agreement on a free-trade accord , but said talks would continue after the g20 summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama faces a complex meeting with hu jintao yet the meeting was also be laden with symbolic value , as howard loewen , researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , said .
" i think they want to reaffirm the security alliance between the south korea and the us , for the protection of south korea , " loewen told deutsche welle ahead of the meeting on wednesday .
" which is of course a message for north korea and china . "
chinese tension the meeting with jintao is likely to be more general and possibly less conclusive , however .
apart from recent disagreements over currency issues and accusations of protectionism , the americans are consistently calling on china to take on more responsibility .
" if you 're a big country , you have the power to sit at the table in the biggest forums , but you have to be willing to take on responsibility , and i think that will be a subject of conversation , " says loewen .
for its part , china is wary of obama 's diplomacy drive in asia , particularly us attempts to assert a position in multilateral bodies .
next year the us will join the east asia summit , an annual forum of east asian countries , and loewen believes that obama is consciously going beyond the network of bilateral relations the us maintains with likes of japan , south korea , the philippines and thailand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will join the east asia summit next year " the us is showing more diplomatic initiatives in southeast asia than it did in the bush era , " said loewen .
" at the same time , the us wants to engage more in the multilateral regulation of problems .
you really ca n't say that the us is retreating in the region - on the contrary , it is pushing ahead more . "
" of course , the chinese are not keen on seeing the us engaging themselves more , " he added .
" because they fear that the us could rival their influence , which of course it does .
the chinese are getting nervous . "
multilateral vs. bilateral perhaps for this reason china has made one regional issue a taboo for multilateral talks .
pascal abb of the german institute of global and area studies , told deutsche welle , " china has made it clear that it does not want the territorial conflicts in the south china seas to be discussed multilaterally , but that is the central conflict in the region . "
the conflict is over a number of tiny islands in the south china seas – china , taiwan , vietnam , the philippines and malaysia all lay claim to the islands , mainly because of the rich natural resources in the area , as well as the trade routes that run through these waters .
but china 's refusal to allow the matter to be discussed multilaterally effectively scuppers any chance of progress .
" i do n't see how overlapping territorial conflicts can be solved bilaterally , " says abb , " simply because no third country is likely to accept an agreement that two other states have reached . "
political gamble but for obama , the recent mid-term elections mean that what some people call his " multilateral gamble " may be under more pressure .
while the new strength in the republican party does not extend to controlling the senate , which has more control over us foreign policy , some believe that if obama 's attempts to assert himself in asia do not bear economic fruit , he may hand the republicans extra ammunition in the 2012 presidential election .
but that is still a long term concern .
for now , the republicans are unlikely to gain much traction with such attacks .
" it could be that the republicans want to assert their foreign policies now , and may make demands like that , " says loewen .
" but i think it wo n't be that serious , because there are no multilateral commitments .
it is easier to go back on multilateral agreements , so i do n't think that will play a big role . "

it is seeking an all-share swap to create what would become one of the world 's leading construction firms .
however , acs has offered a price below hochtief 's current market value of around 4.3 billion euros -lrb- 5.9 billion dollars -rrb- , which hochtief sees as unfair .
preventative strategies herbert luetkestratkoetter , head of hochtief , said the company considers the acs bid to be hostile and is " definitely " planning further strategic action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief employees protested against acs in october hochtief 's chief financial officer burkard lohr refused to rule out a capital increase or a convertible loan to refinance the company .
both measures would increase the number of hochtief shares and thus make a takeover bid more difficult .
another option is for essen-based hochtief to puts its subsidiary concessions on the stock market , even if it means separating itself from that part of its business . concessions ' main activity is the operation of airports and toll-roads .
at the same time the german firm is trying to force the spanish group to make a bid for hochtief 's australian subsidiary leighton , thereby increasing the price , and possibly discouraging acs .
acs could instead carry out a capital increase of 78.5 million euros -lrb- 107.6 million dollars -rrb- , which is to be approved during an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on november 19 .

saturday , nov 13 bremen – frankfurt oh dear .
just what is going on with werder bremen ?
esteemed colleague jefferson chase nailed it in his commentary this week – whatever 's gone wrong at bremen , it 'll need huge changes to fix it .
while wondering what was going to happen next was initially an endearing game of roulette , as the season wears on , it looks like bremen are playing the russian variety .
no guesses who 'll get the bullet if their form continues to nosedive .
frankfurt very well could be the team to load the gun .
prediction : frankfurt 2-1 wolfsburg – schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke edged closer to safety thanks to raul 's goals go on then , but just whisper it … schalke may have turned a corner .
there – i said it … which means , of course , that wolfsburg 's up-and-down season will ascend again to the detriment of felix magath 's struggling side on saturday .
the royal blues may have fired three past st. pauli to put them one point from safety but the hamburg club are quickly becoming easy pickings as their confidence dwindles .
wolfsburg will be a sterner test .
perhaps the training ground punch-ups suggest the wolves have the fight to come out on top in this one .
prediction : wolfsburg 3-2 cologne – moenchengladbach wake us up when this derby is over .
the two sides who manage to make schalke look good come together in this basement clash with little daylight between them in terms of points and class .
gladbach at least shocked the life out of bayern last week - which always raises a smile in these parts - but with cologne struggling to find anything resembling flair in any of their games to date , these two could blunder and bump against each other for 90 minutes and still not score .
hopefully one will manage it but it 's a coin toss .
heads it 's gladbach .
prediction : gladbach 1-0 kaiserslautern – stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ciprian marica led the way in the thrashing of bremen stuttgart will be nicely rested after last weekend 's game so kaiserslautern should beware .
vfb stuck six past bremen and then must have retired to a dark room to lie down .
despite the green shoots of recovery growing over at the mercedes benz arena , few would have tipped jens keller 's team to thrash werder so comprehensively -lrb- i certainly did n't -rrb- .
but then kaiserslautern looked impressive last week , even though they evenutally lost against in-form leverkusen . this one could prove quite entertaining to watch .
prediction : 2-2 st. pauli – leverkusen pauli continue to slide and it 's already looking like an inevitable one towards what many people think is their rightful place in the relegation zone .
the neutral will hope they can arrest the decline but taking on leverkusen may not be the best place to start .
bayer have been quietly efficient in rising to third place and will be looking to make up ground on mainz in the place above them .
on form alone , it looks as though pauli will be deeper in the mire come saturday night .
prediction : leverkusen 3-1 mainz – hanover mainz in crisis !
two defeats on the bounce !
how easy it is to forget what an achievement this season has already been for mainz .
it is n't only their position which is impressive but the way they 've gotten there .
okay , so freiburg should never have beaten them last week – but only in the context of mainz 's amazing form to date .
last season , this would n't have been such a shock .
losing or drawing with hanover would n't have been either but on the evidence of this campaign alone , one would expect mainz to triumph .
prediction : mainz 2-0 sunday , nov 14 hoffenheim – freiburg despite winning last week , hoffenheim still dropped down the league , giving the illusion that their title charge has already petered out .
do n't be fooled .
the pendulum of form is swinging in the hoff 's direction and a win over freiburg will see them back in the mix .
freiburg had a great result against mainz and will have to be completely free of the hangover to cope with the hoff at home .
expecting the freiburgers to be well up for it as usual , this could be a tight affair .

nuremberg cantered to a win against cologne last week and of course bayern , however dire , are the polar opposite of the boys for köln .
however , the bavarians are increasingly hard to fathom so – who knows ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 11.11.2010 obama , seoul , and multilateral ambitions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama wants to reaffirm ties with south korea , but has other concerns barack obama traveled to south korea ahead of this week 's g20 summit .
but he had a host of other issues in his luggage as he mets chinese president hu jintao on the sidelines of the summit . there was no shortage of issues awaiting us president barack obama even before the g20 summit began on thursday in seoul .
obama was scheduled to meet both chinese president hu jintao and south korean president lee myung-bak parallel to the summit .
for the latter , the most pressing agenda item was expected to be the ratification of a pending free trade deal that us and south korean diplomats from both sides have been hashing out over the past two days .
despite a number of sticking points , including disagreement on autos and beef trade , myung-bak and obama agreed in a telephone conversation last week to strive for agreement before the g20 .
on thursday morning , news broke that the two sides failed to reach an agreement on a free-trade accord , but said talks would continue after the g20 summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama faces a complex meeting with hu jintao yet the meeting was also be laden with symbolic value , as howard loewen , researcher at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , said .
" i think they want to reaffirm the security alliance between the south korea and the us , for the protection of south korea , " loewen told deutsche welle ahead of the meeting on wednesday .
" which is of course a message for north korea and china . "
chinese tension the meeting with jintao is likely to be more general and possibly less conclusive , however .
apart from recent disagreements over currency issues and accusations of protectionism , the americans are consistently calling on china to take on more responsibility .
" if you 're a big country , you have the power to sit at the table in the biggest forums , but you have to be willing to take on responsibility , and i think that will be a subject of conversation , " says loewen .
for its part , china is wary of obama 's diplomacy drive in asia , particularly us attempts to assert a position in multilateral bodies .
next year the us will join the east asia summit , an annual forum of east asian countries , and loewen believes that obama is consciously going beyond the network of bilateral relations the us maintains with likes of japan , south korea , the philippines and thailand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will join the east asia summit next year " the us is showing more diplomatic initiatives in southeast asia than it did in the bush era , " said loewen .
" at the same time , the us wants to engage more in the multilateral regulation of problems .
you really ca n't say that the us is retreating in the region - on the contrary , it is pushing ahead more . "
" of course , the chinese are not keen on seeing the us engaging themselves more , " he added .
" because they fear that the us could rival their influence , which of course it does .
the chinese are getting nervous . "
multilateral vs. bilateral perhaps for this reason china has made one regional issue a taboo for multilateral talks .
pascal abb of the german institute of global and area studies , told deutsche welle , " china has made it clear that it does not want the territorial conflicts in the south china seas to be discussed multilaterally , but that is the central conflict in the region . "
the conflict is over a number of tiny islands in the south china seas – china , taiwan , vietnam , the philippines and malaysia all lay claim to the islands , mainly because of the rich natural resources in the area , as well as the trade routes that run through these waters .
but china 's refusal to allow the matter to be discussed multilaterally effectively scuppers any chance of progress .
" i do n't see how overlapping territorial conflicts can be solved bilaterally , " says abb , " simply because no third country is likely to accept an agreement that two other states have reached . "
political gamble but for obama , the recent mid-term elections mean that what some people call his " multilateral gamble " may be under more pressure .
while the new strength in the republican party does not extend to controlling the senate , which has more control over us foreign policy , some believe that if obama 's attempts to assert himself in asia do not bear economic fruit , he may hand the republicans extra ammunition in the 2012 presidential election .
but that is still a long term concern .
for now , the republicans are unlikely to gain much traction with such attacks .
" it could be that the republicans want to assert their foreign policies now , and may make demands like that , " says loewen .
" but i think it wo n't be that serious , because there are no multilateral commitments .
it is easier to go back on multilateral agreements , so i do n't think that will play a big role . "

" this condition , if not detected , could ultimately result in uncontained engine failure , potentially leading to damage to the airplane and hazards to persons or property on the ground , " easa said in its emergency directive .
qantas , an australian airline , said this week that it had found small oil leaks in rolls-royce trent 900 engines on three of its other airbus a380s during tests it ran after the november 4 incident over indonesia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators are still pondering the cause of the explosion qantas said on thursday that it was keeping its six a380 superjumbos grounded until further checks were completed .
singapore airlines also said on thursday that it was inspecting its a380 engines after easa issued the warning .
" we are inspecting our wider fleet in accordance with the directives set out by easa and the recommendations from rolls-royce , " the airline said in a statement .
singapore , the first to fly the world 's largest passenger jet , operates 11 a380s .
german carrier , lufthansa , the other airline using the rolls-royce engine type , said its planes were all flying after safety checks were completed .
it said one engine was replaced as a precaution .
airlines , however , are worried about the financial impact of grounding planes and changing schedules .
aviation experts said the european directive involved a major safety inspection which would likely disrupt flight schedules .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.11.2010 the german soldiers that history forgot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remains of soldiers are still found in flanders every year each year on november 11 , armistice day , ceremonies take place at commonwealth war cemeteries to commemorate the dead .
but only a few come to remember the german soldiers who died on flanders fields in wwi . a bugle sounded across flanders fields on thursday .
the " last post " used to mark the end of a day on the battlefields and still today it is played as a haunting reminder of the hundreds of thousands of men who laid down their lives along this stretch of the western front during world war i. wreaths of blood-red poppies will be laid at the foot of rows upon rows of white headstones in the commonwealth cemeteries .
but one war memorial will remain silent and empty on armistice day .
the langemark cemetery is the final resting place of 44,294 german soldiers .
more than half of them are buried in one mass grave , the kameraden grab , their names etched on large dark plaques running alongside the site .
" it 's a tragedy that hardly anyone comes here .
least of all the germans themselves , many of whom know very little about what happened , " andre de bruin , a world war i guide and founder of over the top tours , told deutsche welle .
two million german casualties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on some of the cemeteries , not even headstones were permitted andre points to rows of gravestones that lie flat on the ground , explaining : " belgium imposed very strict restrictions on german memorials .
headstones were not allowed to stand , not like those of the commonwealth soldiers and there were many other rules that applied only to germans . "
there were hundreds of burial sites of german soldiers after 1918 but in the 1950s , belgium ordered that the bodies be regrouped in no more than four sites , of which langemark is one .
" it was probably done out of hatred for what happened , especially during world war ii when belgium was occupied .
they even forbade the use of crosses above the headstones , " de bruin said .
germany lost nearly two million men in the first world war , the greatest number of casualties suffered by any nation .
yet for decades , this chapter of history was hardly taught at german schools .
today , the care of german memorials in western flanders , where some of the bloodiest battles took place , is carried out by a voluntary association , the german war graves commission , and its grounds are tended by students .
at the back of langemark , rain-sodden fields stretch ahead , the same ground that turned into a giant , water-clogged inferno of craters and trenches almost a century ago .
it is here that 3,000 german students were killed in 1914 .
" they had received just six weeks basic training before they were sent to the front to accompany german soldiers in what was meant to be a triumphant march to victory .
but they were all killed in the ensuing battles , " andre explained .
" these men died in the same horrific battles as everyone here and yet on armistice day they will lie mostly unremembered , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flanders saw some of wwi 's bloodiest battles only few visitors from germany only a tiny number of germans come to this part of belgium whereas thousands come to visit the commonwealth graves from as far away as australia .
a visitors ' book at langemark shows that most visitors are british school children , who visit the site as part of their trips around ypres .
" we always bring the children here as part of our tours of the world war i sites .
we feel that german families mourned their dead just as british or belgian families would have done , " leonie giles , a teacher at st nicholas school in north-west england , told deutsche welle .
a colleague added that " the aura here is very different , it 's very somber compared to the pristine white cemeteries where the british are buried , which are more like english gardens .
but we want our kids to realize that these soldiers were just like the british who died for king and country . "
simon , a thirteen-year old carrying a small wooden cross with a poppy , said : " it 's so vast , that mass grave .
and it 's such a sad place .
i feel very emotional . "
remains of soldiers are still found in this area every year , and these are added to the mass grave .
but these days , their burials are done with full military honors and are attended by officials from germany and belgium - a sign perhaps that , in time , more recognition will be given to these men who volunteered to lay down their lives .
" deutschland muss leben auch wenn wir sterben muessen , " reads the plaque above their graves .
germany must live even if we must die .

each year , november 11 marks the kick-off of carnival in cologne . november tends to be dreary in germany 's rhineland region , but the city of cologne looks forward to one bright spot in the month each year .
on november 11 - at exactly 11:11 a.m. - carnival begins !
on the mid-november day , it 's perfectly normal to leave the house in the morning and run across people in all sorts of costumes along the way .
they 're often heading downtown , loaded up with beer and liquor and ready to meet up with other revelers to get the festival started .
carnival is more than just a tradition in the city ; it 's part of cologne 's cultural identity .
bildunterschrift : clown costumes are a favorite , but everything from witches to cows to politicians also hits the streets carnival has its origins in a number of different eras .
ancient greeks and romans honored the god dionysos with a festival featuring " women , wine and song . "
germanic tribes also celebrated the shift to winter as a way of driving away wicked winter demons .
christianity took on the custom later in order to usher in lent .
the latin root , " carne vale , " of the german term " karneval " roughly translates to " farewell to meat . "
rose monday these days , the festival in cologne is organized and hosted by over 100 local carnival associations .
the associations host events during the year 's so-called " fifth season " featuring all sorts of entertainment , from music and dancing to witty political commentary .
in february each year , the world-famous rose monday parade rounds out the carnival season .
hundreds of thousands of visitors head to cologne to party for days and participate in the parades .
november 11 is when the fun gets started , but - except for the members of the carnival associations - the festival remains largely out of sight through the holiday season .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 11.11.2010 german scientists discover new treatment for antibiotic-resistant bacteria großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mice can effectively battle bacteria with the newly-developed antibodies researchers have developed a process in mice to battle bacteria no longer treatable with prevalent antibiotics .
the findings could have significant implications for dealing with hospital-acquired bugs . every year , over four million hospital patients in europe develop an infection during their stay .
the culprit is most often a strain of the bacteria staphylococcus aureus , also known as mrsa , which has proven resistant to antibiotic treatment .
scientists from the university of wuerzburg and the helmholtz center for infection research -lrb- hzi -rrb- in braunschweig have now found an approach to treating such infections .
they have developed an antibody which specifically targets mrsa in mice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : staphylococcus aureus can cause a range of illnesses " we have succeeded in activating a defense mechanism against staphylococcus pathogens in mice with the help of antibodies , " said dr. udo lorenz from the university of wuerzburg 's department of surgery .
together with dr. knut ohlsen from the institute for molecular infection biology , lorenz has spent the last few years pursuing the idea of combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria with antibodies .
" these antibodies attach themselves to a specific point on the bacterium , " lorenz told deutsche welle .
this in turn marks the bacterium , so that the body 's own scavenger cells can detect them and subsequently kill them .
dr. christian erck from hzi worked on actually developing the antibodies in mice .
" these antibodies help make the bacteria visible to the immune system , " he told deutsche welle .
" even when antibiotics can no longer kill multi-resistant bacterial strains , antibodies still have a good chance against them . "
in the experiments , the mice 's immune systems were able to kill 30 percent more pathogens with the aid of the antibodies than without .
" this is a very dramatic advantage , which can constitute the difference between death and survival , " lorenz said .
targeting immune weakness most people have staphylococcus bacteria on their skin and , if they 're healthy , it does n't cause any problems .
" but this is a very flexible bacteria and it can become extremely aggressive , " erck said .
if these pathogens make their way inside patients with weakened immune systems , they cause infections which are extremely difficult to cure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lorenz -lrb- left -rrb- and ohlsen developed this procedure lorenz said this would be the target group for treatment .
" these are patients who have just had surgery or are in intensive care , whose immune systems are not functioning in an optimal way , " he said .
mouse to man the next step now involves transferring the antibody from mice to humans .
this means the entire molecule will need to be " humanized " so that people do n't develop antibodies against the mice antibodies and reject them .
" we will take only the part of the antibody that docks to the bacterium and build the rest of the molecule artificially , so that it is suitable for people , " lorenz said .
if everything goes according to plan , lorenz said he expected the first clinical study to take place at the end of 2012 .
" then we can find out which sort of infections are suitable for this treatment , " he said .
the scientists have published their findings in the current issue of the journal antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy .

let me introduce myself - i 'm ali .
ali almakhlafi .
i 'm a journalist from yemen . i live in germany .
i 'm 31 years old .
i 'm muslim .
and i 've never been to mecca in my entire life .
even though , when considered from distance , i was born and spent the first 19 years of my life " right next door . " yemen is the poorest country of the arabian peninsula and has a common border with saudi arabia – one of the richest countries of the region and guardian of islam 's holy sites .
from yemen 's capital , sana 'a , it 's about a 90-minute flight from there to mecca .
from germany it takes about six hours .
reporter , not a pilgrim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali 's journey takes him from bonn to mecca .
yet my journey to mecca starts here in germany , the country i live and work in .
and i 'm deliberately not traveling as a religious pilgrim , but as a neutral journalistic reporter .
my main goal is to provide non-muslim users with insights into the hajj pilgrimage - just as i was once introduced to easter , christmas , and other christian feasts .
as you may know , according to saudi arabia 's interpretation of islam , only muslims may visit the holy city of mecca .
however , it is allowed to let non-muslims know about it .
this is what i want to do as i tell you about my impressions , discoveries , and encounters with pilgrims from all over the world - and particularly from germany .
even many muslims know little more about the hajj than the pictures they get on television , which show religious rites and crowds pouring in .
i 'm sure that there 's a lot to find out about the hajj - so wo n't you join me on my journey of discovery ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : praying at the mosque in mecca would you like to know how , exactly , the religious rituals are performed ?
what safety measures are taken ?
whether men and women go on their pilgrimage together ?
or whether conflicts between moderate and radical political groups in the islamic world influence the festivities ?
honestly , i do n't know many of the answers to these questions myself .
but whatever you may want to learn , i 'll try to find it out for you !
please post your questions and suggestions on deutsche welle 's facebook page : http : / / www.facebook.com / deutschewelle even though i will visit mecca as a journalist , this is anything but a " typical " reporting assignement to me .
maybe it 's like a catholic-raised journalist reporting from the vatican : you 're keeping a distance and reporting neutrally , but somehow the subject moves you more than , say , a piece about the latest tax reform .
learning about prophets , and people so i ca n't keep all my childhood memories separated from my thoughts about , and preparation for , my first trip to mecca .
specifically , my religion class in taiz , the town i was born in , comes to my mind .
they taught us that god is in heaven watching us .
that jews and christians share a lot of prophets with muslims except the last prophet and messenger of god : muhammad .
that the citizens of mecca once chased muhammad out of the city .
and that muhammad returned to mecca eight years later and destroyed the statues of false gods that had been built .
as a little boy i was deeply impressed and shaped by these religious basics .
today they inextricably belong to my personal cultural heritage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : our reporter hails from taiz , in yemen of course , at school , i also learned about the five religious duties of every muslim , the so-called five pillars of islam .
the hajj is one of them - a spiritual journey that is to be performed by every muslim who is healthy enough and can afford to do so .
examining my picture of saudi arabia i also want to examine my personal picture of saudi arabia - which is closely linked to my yemeni descent .
there were times when yemenis were allowed to enter the country without a visa .
older men , such as my grandfather , used to go on business trips to the country next door and bring us back precious presents .
but there was also a time - when saudi arabia and yemen were at serious odds about the kuwait war - that saudi arabian leaders expelled hundreds of thousands of yemeni " guest workers " from the country .
during this period , unemployment and poverty increased dramatically in yemen , and the number of students in my class went from 20 to 120 .
that is when i realized that islamic virtues such as solidarity and brotherhood can vanish into thin air when politics come into play .
and that a common belief does n't prevent people from committing human-rights violations .
i wonder what kind of experiences i will have in mecca ?
maybe they 'll be very different from what i expect .

" we continue to support the goal of withdrawal , " westerwelle said during a parliamentary debate on thursday in berlin .
disarmament is going to be a " key issue " for germany at the lisbon meeting , the foreign minister said .
there are no official figures about the number of nuclear weapons stationed on german soil , but it is believed that perhaps 10 to 20 nuclear warheads from the us arsenal are stockpiled at the buechel air base in the state of rhineland-palatinate in southwestern germany .
russian cooperation government leaders and heads of state of the 28 nato member countries meet in the portuguese capital next week friday to discuss a major strategic overhaul of the military alliance .
a key element of nato 's new strategy to be decided upon in lisbon is a european missile-defense system .
in what westerwelle called an " historic gesture , " russia will be involved in the discussions .
" we do n't want a europe with areas of differing security levels , " westerwelle said .
" we want to improve our security alongside , not in confrontation with russia . "
westerwelle defends cabinet colleague the foreign minister used his address in parliament to also set straight a cornerstone of german military doctrine .
westerwelle rejected accusations that defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was revamping the german armed forces to fight what the opposition called " economic wars . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister called for nuclear exit and defended his colleague karl-theodor zu guttenberg " we will continue the culture of military restraint .
any other assumption is defamation that has nothing to do with reality , " the minister said .
westerwelle 's comments were viewed as indirect support for defense minister guttenberg , who recently made controversial remarks to the effect that germany should align its security policies with economic interests , like other countries do .
in response , the green party parliamentary leader , juergen trittin , accused guttenberg of pursuing " gunboat diplomacy . "
defending his position , guttenberg told parliament on thursday that the strategy was contained in a government white paper from 2006 when the opposition social democrats were still in a grand coalition with chancellor merkel 's christian democrats .
" there were no cries of outrage then , " guttenberg said , " but now comes the great wave of indignation . "
the issue of economic intervention is also expected to be on the agenda of the nato summit next week .

on two separate occasions the tabloid , which is in no way related to the us music magazine of the same name , has printed the identities and addresses of alleged homosexuals .
the campaign launched in october under the headline banner " 100 pictures of uganda 's top homos leak - hang them " has so far outed 29 people .
several of them have since been subjected to harassment and threats from members of the public .
transgender stosh mugisha is among the victims .
biologically a woman but living as a man , the 33-year old 's life has drastically changed since his photograph appeared in the rolling stone " men of shame " gallery .
“ i went to the shop where i usually buy cigarettes , " mugisha told deutsche welle .
" the woman told me ' i do n't sell cigarettes to faggots ' , so i left . "
on his way home passers-by threw verbal abuse and even stones at him .
although he was not physically hurt , he has since had to move away for fear of a more serious attack .
interim ruling in light of the controversial pictures and following a petition from the gay rights group , sexual minorities uganda , the high court ordered rolling stone , which is not yet in possession of a license , to cease publication .
judge vincent musoke kibuuka described the public outing as an invasion of the right to privacy of the individuals identified .
yet the ruling is only temporary and will be reviewed at a hearing later this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the colors of gay pride are not visible on the streets of kampala the newspaper 's managing editor , giles muhame , is confident that he will be able to resume what he says is his duty to expose evils in society before the month is out .
" the main case comes up on november 23 , we shall challenge it , we shall defeat them , the interim order will be quashed , " he said .
in an editor 's note written to accompany the publication of his " men of shame part ii , " muhame cited his motivation for printing the pictures as an attempt to stop a " cross-section of heartless homosexuals " from recruiting and brainwashing unsuspecting kids into gay circles .
it is this allegation in particular that stosh mugisha found hurtful and distasteful .
" how do you recruit someone into something they do not want ? , " he asked . " homosexuality is inborn , you can not start it by going into schools , it 's not like you are looking for votes . ”
ethical issues but the editor begs to differ , and has said he will not quit his printing spree until members of the gay community " stop enrolling minors in their circles . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' most ugandans do n't support gay rights , ' one official said .
where the situation goes from here will depend at least to some extent on whether or not the country 's media council , tasked with promoting responsible and ethical journalism , decides to issue rolling stone with a license .
peter mwesige , executive director of the african center for media excellence , said the council would have to be seriously outraged not to .
but given the debate in the country last year over the introduction of the death penalty for some homosexual acts , that outrage might be hard to come by .
" most people in the society we live in do not support the idea that homosexuals deserve any rights , " mwesige told deutsche welle .
although the council , which freedom house notes " has been criticized for its lack of independence , " has a code of ethics on issues such as invasion of privacy , the guidelines are regularly flouted and many a blind eye is turned .
just so long as there are no officials involved .
" the government does n't pay attention to ethics , " mwesige said .
" but when the stories are politically sensitive , it cares . "
spotlight on human rights that became blatantly obvious last year when the government , under president yoweri museveni , closed four radio stations on the grounds that they were inciting racial hatred .
besides curtailing press freedom , the " write-anything-about-anyone-but-nothing-about-me " modus operandi also highlights another problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the might of the government geoffrey wokulira ssebaggala , programs co-coordinator at human rights network for journalists in uganda , says one of the biggest challenges facing the country 's media today is the establishment of a culture of professionalism .
" people write about anything , and they do n't mind if it infringes on others ' rights , " ssebaggala told deutsche welle .
" those managing media in uganda have no knowledge of human rights . "
he says it is crucial to change the status quo , but that doing so will require a complete rethink on the parts of publishers , broadcasters , proprietors and most of all the government .
" there 's a lot that needs to be done , " he said .
" but as long as we 're not challenging power it is not seen as a threat . "

but only a few come to remember the german soldiers who died on flanders fields in wwi . a bugle sounded across flanders fields on thursday .
the " last post " used to mark the end of a day on the battlefields and still today it is played as a haunting reminder of the hundreds of thousands of men who laid down their lives along this stretch of the western front during world war i. wreaths of blood-red poppies will be laid at the foot of rows upon rows of white headstones in the commonwealth cemeteries .
but one war memorial will remain silent and empty on armistice day .
the langemark cemetery is the final resting place of 44,294 german soldiers .
more than half of them are buried in one mass grave , the kameraden grab , their names etched on large dark plaques running alongside the site .
" it 's a tragedy that hardly anyone comes here .
least of all the germans themselves , many of whom know very little about what happened , " andre de bruin , a world war i guide and founder of over the top tours , told deutsche welle .
two million german casualties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on some of the cemeteries , not even headstones were permitted andre points to rows of gravestones that lie flat on the ground , explaining : " belgium imposed very strict restrictions on german memorials .
headstones were not allowed to stand , not like those of the commonwealth soldiers and there were many other rules that applied only to germans . "
there were hundreds of burial sites of german soldiers after 1918 but in the 1950s , belgium ordered that the bodies be regrouped in no more than four sites , of which langemark is one .
" it was probably done out of hatred for what happened , especially during world war ii when belgium was occupied .
they even forbade the use of crosses above the headstones , " de bruin said .
germany lost nearly two million men in the first world war , the greatest number of casualties suffered by any nation .
yet for decades , this chapter of history was hardly taught at german schools .
today , the care of german memorials in western flanders , where some of the bloodiest battles took place , is carried out by a voluntary association , the german war graves commission , and its grounds are tended by students .
at the back of langemark , rain-sodden fields stretch ahead , the same ground that turned into a giant , water-clogged inferno of craters and trenches almost a century ago .
it is here that 3,000 german students were killed in 1914 .
" they had received just six weeks basic training before they were sent to the front to accompany german soldiers in what was meant to be a triumphant march to victory .
but they were all killed in the ensuing battles , " andre explained .
" these men died in the same horrific battles as everyone here and yet on armistice day they will lie mostly unremembered , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flanders saw some of wwi 's bloodiest battles only few visitors from germany only a tiny number of germans come to this part of belgium whereas thousands come to visit the commonwealth graves from as far away as australia .
a visitors ' book at langemark shows that most visitors are british school children , who visit the site as part of their trips around ypres .
" we always bring the children here as part of our tours of the world war i sites .
we feel that german families mourned their dead just as british or belgian families would have done , " leonie giles , a teacher at st nicholas school in north-west england , told deutsche welle .
a colleague added that " the aura here is very different , it 's very somber compared to the pristine white cemeteries where the british are buried , which are more like english gardens .
but we want our kids to realize that these soldiers were just like the british who died for king and country . "
simon , a thirteen-year old carrying a small wooden cross with a poppy , said : " it 's so vast , that mass grave .
and it 's such a sad place .
i feel very emotional . "
remains of soldiers are still found in this area every year , and these are added to the mass grave .
but these days , their burials are done with full military honors and are attended by officials from germany and belgium - a sign perhaps that , in time , more recognition will be given to these men who volunteered to lay down their lives .
" deutschland muss leben auch wenn wir sterben muessen , " reads the plaque above their graves .
germany must live even if we must die .

on two separate occasions the tabloid , which is in no way related to the us music magazine of the same name , has printed the identities and addresses of alleged homosexuals .
the campaign launched in october under the headline banner " 100 pictures of uganda 's top homos leak - hang them " has so far outed 29 people .
several of them have since been subjected to harassment and threats from members of the public .
transgender stosh mugisha is among the victims .
biologically a woman but living as a man , the 33-year old 's life has drastically changed since his photograph appeared in the rolling stone " men of shame " gallery .
“ i went to the shop where i usually buy cigarettes , " mugisha told deutsche welle .
" the woman told me ' i do n't sell cigarettes to faggots ' , so i left . "
on his way home passers-by threw verbal abuse and even stones at him .
although he was not physically hurt , he has since had to move away for fear of a more serious attack .
interim ruling in light of the controversial pictures and following a petition from the gay rights group , sexual minorities uganda , the high court ordered rolling stone , which is not yet in possession of a license , to cease publication .
judge vincent musoke kibuuka described the public outing as an invasion of the right to privacy of the individuals identified .
yet the ruling is only temporary and will be reviewed at a hearing later this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the colors of gay pride are not visible on the streets of kampala the newspaper 's managing editor , giles muhame , is confident that he will be able to resume what he says is his duty to expose evils in society before the month is out .
" the main case comes up on november 23 , we shall challenge it , we shall defeat them , the interim order will be quashed , " he said .
in an editor 's note written to accompany the publication of his " men of shame part ii , " muhame cited his motivation for printing the pictures as an attempt to stop a " cross-section of heartless homosexuals " from recruiting and brainwashing unsuspecting kids into gay circles .
it is this allegation in particular that stosh mugisha found hurtful and distasteful .
" how do you recruit someone into something they do not want ? , " he asked . " homosexuality is inborn , you can not start it by going into schools , it 's not like you are looking for votes . ”
ethical issues but the editor begs to differ , and has said he will not quit his printing spree until members of the gay community " stop enrolling minors in their circles . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' most ugandans do n't support gay rights , ' one official said .
where the situation goes from here will depend at least to some extent on whether or not the country 's media council , tasked with promoting responsible and ethical journalism , decides to issue rolling stone with a license .
peter mwesige , executive director of the african center for media excellence , said the council would have to be seriously outraged not to .
but given the debate in the country last year over the introduction of the death penalty for some homosexual acts , that outrage might be hard to come by .
" most people in the society we live in do not support the idea that homosexuals deserve any rights , " mwesige told deutsche welle .
although the council , which freedom house notes " has been criticized for its lack of independence , " has a code of ethics on issues such as invasion of privacy , the guidelines are regularly flouted and many a blind eye is turned .
just so long as there are no officials involved .
" the government does n't pay attention to ethics , " mwesige said .
" but when the stories are politically sensitive , it cares . "
spotlight on human rights that became blatantly obvious last year when the government , under president yoweri museveni , closed four radio stations on the grounds that they were inciting racial hatred .
besides curtailing press freedom , the " write-anything-about-anyone-but-nothing-about-me " modus operandi also highlights another problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the might of the government geoffrey wokulira ssebaggala , programs co-coordinator at human rights network for journalists in uganda , says one of the biggest challenges facing the country 's media today is the establishment of a culture of professionalism .
" people write about anything , and they do n't mind if it infringes on others ' rights , " ssebaggala told deutsche welle .
" those managing media in uganda have no knowledge of human rights . "
he says it is crucial to change the status quo , but that doing so will require a complete rethink on the parts of publishers , broadcasters , proprietors and most of all the government .
" there 's a lot that needs to be done , " he said .
" but as long as we 're not challenging power it is not seen as a threat . "

let me introduce myself - i 'm ali .
ali almakhlafi .
i 'm a journalist from yemen . i live in germany .
i 'm 31 years old .
i 'm muslim .
and i 've never been to mecca in my entire life .
even though , when considered from distance , i was born and spent the first 19 years of my life " right next door . " yemen is the poorest country of the arabian peninsula and has a common border with saudi arabia – one of the richest countries of the region and guardian of islam 's holy sites .
from yemen 's capital , sana 'a , it 's about a 90-minute flight from there to mecca .
from germany it takes about six hours .
reporter , not a pilgrim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali 's journey takes him from bonn to mecca .
yet my journey to mecca starts here in germany , the country i live and work in .
and i 'm deliberately not traveling as a religious pilgrim , but as a neutral journalistic reporter .
my main goal is to provide non-muslim users with insights into the hajj pilgrimage - just as i was once introduced to easter , christmas , and other christian feasts .
as you may know , according to saudi arabia 's interpretation of islam , only muslims may visit the holy city of mecca .
however , it is allowed to let non-muslims know about it .
this is what i want to do as i tell you about my impressions , discoveries , and encounters with pilgrims from all over the world - and particularly from germany .
even many muslims know little more about the hajj than the pictures they get on television , which show religious rites and crowds pouring in .
i 'm sure that there 's a lot to find out about the hajj - so wo n't you join me on my journey of discovery ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : praying at the mosque in mecca would you like to know how , exactly , the religious rituals are performed ?
what safety measures are taken ?
whether men and women go on their pilgrimage together ?
or whether conflicts between moderate and radical political groups in the islamic world influence the festivities ?
honestly , i do n't know many of the answers to these questions myself .
but whatever you may want to learn , i 'll try to find it out for you !
please post your questions and suggestions on deutsche welle 's facebook page : http : / / www.facebook.com / deutschewelle even though i will visit mecca as a journalist , this is anything but a " typical " reporting assignement to me .
maybe it 's like a catholic-raised journalist reporting from the vatican : you 're keeping a distance and reporting neutrally , but somehow the subject moves you more than , say , a piece about the latest tax reform .
learning about prophets , and people so i ca n't keep all my childhood memories separated from my thoughts about , and preparation for , my first trip to mecca .
specifically , my religion class in taiz , the town i was born in , comes to my mind .
they taught us that god is in heaven watching us .
that jews and christians share a lot of prophets with muslims except the last prophet and messenger of god : muhammad .
that the citizens of mecca once chased muhammad out of the city .
and that muhammad returned to mecca eight years later and destroyed the statues of false gods that had been built .
as a little boy i was deeply impressed and shaped by these religious basics .
today they inextricably belong to my personal cultural heritage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : our reporter hails from taiz , in yemen of course , at school , i also learned about the five religious duties of every muslim , the so-called five pillars of islam .
the hajj is one of them - a spiritual journey that is to be performed by every muslim who is healthy enough and can afford to do so .
examining my picture of saudi arabia i also want to examine my personal picture of saudi arabia - which is closely linked to my yemeni descent .
there were times when yemenis were allowed to enter the country without a visa .
older men , such as my grandfather , used to go on business trips to the country next door and bring us back precious presents .
but there was also a time - when saudi arabia and yemen were at serious odds about the kuwait war - that saudi arabian leaders expelled hundreds of thousands of yemeni " guest workers " from the country .
during this period , unemployment and poverty increased dramatically in yemen , and the number of students in my class went from 20 to 120 .
that is when i realized that islamic virtues such as solidarity and brotherhood can vanish into thin air when politics come into play .
and that a common belief does n't prevent people from committing human-rights violations .
i wonder what kind of experiences i will have in mecca ?
maybe they 'll be very different from what i expect .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 11.11.2010 straight couples in britain fight for gay marriage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay couples can enter civil partnerships , but not marriage in britain , eight couples – gay and straight – are campaigning to have both civil partnerships and marriage open for both straight and same-sex couples .
they say they ’ re willing to go to the highest european court . tom freeman and katherine doyle are a heterosexual couple applying for a civil partnership – a form of legal union available only to same-sex couples .
they are one of four heterosexual couples and four same-sex couples trying to challenge the current uk legislation on marriage and civil partnerships .
" initially our aim was equality but increasingly as we look critically at marriage , we feel it is not relevant to us , " katherine doyle told deutsche welle .
" we really do want a civil partnership .
in our day-to-day lives we are more like partners . "
" the important question for us is : why should n't we have a civil partnership , " her partner tom added .
" the institution is being provided for by law so why should n't i have one ? "
gay couples in britain have been allowed to enter into civil partnerships since 2004 , which gives them all the same legal rights and responsibilities as a civil marriage . however they are denied a civil marriage certificate .
on the other hand heterosexual couples do not qualify to enter a civil partnership .
they can either get married or not .
a violation of human rights ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom freeman and katherine doyle are prepared to fight for years working alongside the gay rights group outrage , the eight couples argue that denying each group the legal rights of the other is discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation , something which is contrary to britain 's human rights act . yet tom and katherine 's application has been refused so far .
all they got was a short statement from the town hall , saying that " a civil partnership is a relationship between two people of the same sex . "
the eight couples are one by one each week applying to their local town halls for either a marriage certificate , or a civil partnership certificate , whichever is denied them by law .
at the end of two months , if all applications are turned down , as they are expected to be , the couples will begin a high court challenge . it is the first time that heterosexual couples have taken such an active role in a campaign which at first glance might appear to benefit gay couples wanting equality and a full marriage .
all the way to the european court of human rights the civil partnerships act of 2004 was introduced by the then labour government with wide support in parliament .
it gives same-sex couples the same legal rights and responsibilities as civil marriage .
there also is a formal process for dissolving partnerships which is akin to divorce , but gay rights activists still criticize that it does n't grant full marriage status to gay couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil partnerships exist in most eu member states " when all eight couples - gay and straight - have filed their applications and have been refused we 'll then consult with our legal advisers with a view to bringing the case to the courts , " peter tatchell of the group outrage , which is leading the equal love campaign , told deutsche welle .
" there ’ s a very strong argument that the twin bans on gay marriages and heterosexual civil partnerships are illegal under the human rights act , " he added .
tatchell says the group is prepared to take the case all the way to the european court of human rights if necessary . public opinion backs gay marriage in response to the campaign , the government has issued a statement saying that it is currently considering the next steps for civil partnerships . it said that earlier this year ministers met with people and organizations holding a range of views and that they are looking at the best way to take those views forward . the equal love campaign argues that public attitudes have shifted strongly in favor of allowing gay couples to marry , citing an opinion poll carried out by the group populus in june 2009 , which found that 61 percent of the public believe gay couples should be allowed to marry , while 33 percent disagreed . however , if there is a change in the law , it is not likely to come soon .
" it could take five to ten years to go through the courts , " said katherine doyle .
" but we really feel that we ca n't commit to marriage when it 's exclusive . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 11.11.2010 mongolia 's role in eurasia is on the up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mongolia is rich in resources when china restricted its export of rare earth materials earlier this year , the european union , japan and the us may want to look to mongolia . the small country between russia and china has less then three million people – but is one of the few countries in the world that is believed to have large resources of rare earths .
extraction would be expensive , but there is interest in the us as well as in japan in working with mongolia to extract these resources , says dr. michael j. green .
he served as senior director for asian affairs at the national security council under president george w. bush .
speaking at an event of the jamestown foundation in washington dc , green says : " this is an opportunity for mongolia to refocus .
around this can be built some bilateral or multilateral investment guarantees , things that china does n't do .
mongolia as part of its brand can say , ' we will honor our contracts and not violate the wto by embargoing exports ' . "
and it is not only rare earths that make mongolia attractive .
a little over a year ago , the mongolian government signed a four billion mining deal with a canadian-based company and its anglo-australian partner .
the companies will jointly develop a project in a location thought to hold one of the world 's largest copper and gold reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gold mine in mongolia the us as " a third neighbor " the us , green says , can play a critical role in helping mongolia 's security and economy by being a " third neighbor " – in addition to china and russia – that helps to " galvanize broader relationships for mongolia throughout the world " .
one reason is democracy .
as recently as 20 years ago , mongolia achieved its independence from the ussr through a peaceful democratic revolution .
" mongolia sits in a belt of poor governance and democracy , stretching from beijing to russia - where despite what was said about some economic success , let 's face it : russian democracy is going backwards – to central asia , to belarus , " explains michael green .
" you really have to go thousands and thousands of miles from ulan bator in some directions before you find a functioning democracy that is as successful , despite challenges , as mongolia .
and that is an example that should be important to the us and the west . "
batchimeg migeddorj , national security advisor to the president of mongolia , attributes it to the special circumstances that mongolia was able to develop a democracy .
he says : " exactly during that time , in the nineties , our two neighbors , china and russia , were concentrating more on internal affairs .
that provided mongolias politicians and political parties with more room to work internally to stabilize institutions . "
sending troops to afghanistan but besides being a model democracy , there is more .
mongolia has sent troops to iraq that have been very effective , according to green , " taking risks a lot of nato countries are n't willing to take in terms of being in the line of fire " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us president bush on a visit to mongolia " today , mongolia has about a platoon , helping with perimeter security for the germans in afghanistan , " says green .
he argues that mongolia has more credibility in demanding transparency from china 's military .
at the same time , he says , the us can not compete with russia and china , so the americans have a strong interest that mongolia develops strong ties with other democratic countries like japan ; korea , the eu , india .
colonel munch-ochir dorjjugder , who served as the director for international cooperation of the mongolian ministry of defense and is now a fellow at the brookings institution , rejects the negative assessment that mongolia is " torn " between russia and china .
nevertheless , he observes mongolia 's " identity dilemma " between northeast-asia and eurasia but comes to the conclusion : " we can promote both agendas as our regional identity .
our culture and our background compels us to do so , our current geographic location compels us to do so , as does our good neighborly relations with russia and china and our interest in seeking third neighbors elsewhere . "
seeking options besides china but mongolia is trying to seek more independence from china .
despite the fact that most of the country 's mineral resources are close to the chinese border , the mongolian government decided to develop a railway infrastructure within the country and towards the russian border rather than towards china .
80 percent of imported goods already come through china , dorjjugder says , and since china occasionally closes its borders or restricts exports , the decision will keep alternatives open .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out after the parliamentary election in 2008 mongolia 's new security concept is also a reaction to china 's challenge , says dr. alicia campi , president of the us-mongolia advisory group .
" while certainly mongolia does not want to lose its vigorous democracy and free market , and return to cold war era satellite status , policy makers increasingly are thinking that inviting much more sizable russian fdi -lrb- foreign direct investment -rrb- and military assistance are not bad ideas at all since western nations have so far proven slow to act and disappointing . "
at the same time , she says , mongolians are looking at the central asian states and on to iran and turkey as well as to the fast rising india .
they could play an alternative role in balancing both china and russia .
and in 2010 , iranian delegations have been buying mongolian meat and animal byproducts .
nobody should be surprised , says campi , if the iranians are examining options for investing in mongolia 's mineral sector .
this would give the us another reason to strengthen their ties with mongolia .

extraction would be expensive , but there is interest in the us as well as in japan in working with mongolia to extract these resources , says dr. michael j. green .
he served as senior director for asian affairs at the national security council under president george w. bush .
speaking at an event of the jamestown foundation in washington dc , green says : " this is an opportunity for mongolia to refocus .
around this can be built some bilateral or multilateral investment guarantees , things that china does n't do .
mongolia as part of its brand can say , ' we will honor our contracts and not violate the wto by embargoing exports ' . "
and it is not only rare earths that make mongolia attractive .
a little over a year ago , the mongolian government signed a four billion mining deal with a canadian-based company and its anglo-australian partner .
the companies will jointly develop a project in a location thought to hold one of the world 's largest copper and gold reserves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gold mine in mongolia the us as " a third neighbor " the us , green says , can play a critical role in helping mongolia 's security and economy by being a " third neighbor " – in addition to china and russia – that helps to " galvanize broader relationships for mongolia throughout the world " .
one reason is democracy .
as recently as 20 years ago , mongolia achieved its independence from the ussr through a peaceful democratic revolution .
" mongolia sits in a belt of poor governance and democracy , stretching from beijing to russia - where despite what was said about some economic success , let 's face it : russian democracy is going backwards – to central asia , to belarus , " explains michael green .
" you really have to go thousands and thousands of miles from ulan bator in some directions before you find a functioning democracy that is as successful , despite challenges , as mongolia .
and that is an example that should be important to the us and the west . "
batchimeg migeddorj , national security advisor to the president of mongolia , attributes it to the special circumstances that mongolia was able to develop a democracy .
he says : " exactly during that time , in the nineties , our two neighbors , china and russia , were concentrating more on internal affairs .
that provided mongolias politicians and political parties with more room to work internally to stabilize institutions . "
sending troops to afghanistan but besides being a model democracy , there is more .
mongolia has sent troops to iraq that have been very effective , according to green , " taking risks a lot of nato countries are n't willing to take in terms of being in the line of fire " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us president bush on a visit to mongolia " today , mongolia has about a platoon , helping with perimeter security for the germans in afghanistan , " says green .
he argues that mongolia has more credibility in demanding transparency from china 's military .
at the same time , he says , the us can not compete with russia and china , so the americans have a strong interest that mongolia develops strong ties with other democratic countries like japan ; korea , the eu , india .
colonel munch-ochir dorjjugder , who served as the director for international cooperation of the mongolian ministry of defense and is now a fellow at the brookings institution , rejects the negative assessment that mongolia is " torn " between russia and china .
nevertheless , he observes mongolia 's " identity dilemma " between northeast-asia and eurasia but comes to the conclusion : " we can promote both agendas as our regional identity .
our culture and our background compels us to do so , our current geographic location compels us to do so , as does our good neighborly relations with russia and china and our interest in seeking third neighbors elsewhere . "
seeking options besides china but mongolia is trying to seek more independence from china .
despite the fact that most of the country 's mineral resources are close to the chinese border , the mongolian government decided to develop a railway infrastructure within the country and towards the russian border rather than towards china .
80 percent of imported goods already come through china , dorjjugder says , and since china occasionally closes its borders or restricts exports , the decision will keep alternatives open .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out after the parliamentary election in 2008 mongolia 's new security concept is also a reaction to china 's challenge , says dr. alicia campi , president of the us-mongolia advisory group .
" while certainly mongolia does not want to lose its vigorous democracy and free market , and return to cold war era satellite status , policy makers increasingly are thinking that inviting much more sizable russian fdi -lrb- foreign direct investment -rrb- and military assistance are not bad ideas at all since western nations have so far proven slow to act and disappointing . "
at the same time , she says , mongolians are looking at the central asian states and on to iran and turkey as well as to the fast rising india .
they could play an alternative role in balancing both china and russia .
and in 2010 , iranian delegations have been buying mongolian meat and animal byproducts .
nobody should be surprised , says campi , if the iranians are examining options for investing in mongolia 's mineral sector .
this would give the us another reason to strengthen their ties with mongolia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 11.11.2010 corruption in asia : a tax on the poor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters wear traditional costumes during an anti-corruption protest in jakarta , indonesia the more than thousand delegates attending the 14th international anti-corruption conference are being reminded of corruption ’ s wider cost to society , both to business and to communities . the world bank in a report released to coincide with the latest international anti-corruption conference says the cost of corruption each year worldwide is more than one trillion dollars .
the report says corruption both affected cost for business development but also crippled countries in efforts to ward off poverty as money used in corrupt payments was not being spent on job creation .
sri mulyani indrawati , world bank managing director said the consequences of corruption also go beyond simply the economic impact .
" over time it becomes a real barrier to development , innovation and business growth because sometimes the corruption is in the form of counterfeit drugs so better don ’ t get better or they die , " he said .
" sometime corruption is a building that collapses in the face of national disaster because the quality inspector took a payment from the construction contractor to falsify an inspection .
corruption can kill . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva says there is no " good corruption " no " good corruption " but sri mulyani , a former indonesian finance minister , in comments seen as targeting indonesian politicians who resisted reforms while she was minister said while progress had been made in curbing corruption in indonesia , there was still much to do .
" i see the transformation in my own country , " said sri mulyani . " it is true there is much to be done still .
corruption remains intertwined with politics and there are brazen attacks on those fighting corruption .
we are not alone in that regard .
nonetheless , corruption is an issue that no politician can ignore in indonesia . "
thailand ’ s prime minister abhisit vejjajiva , said despite efforts in thailand corruption remained endemic and was widely accepted within the community : " significantly , even today young people in my country tell me that they expect to see corruption everywhere .
an unbelievable percentage of people also say it is ok for politicians to be corrupt as long as they are capable of bringing economic prosperity .
rampant corruption can exist amid high economic growth .
citizens must be prudently aware that there is no such thing as ' good corruption ' . "
reports put the annual cost of corruption in thailand at around $ 3.0 billion a year .
in a local initiative , more than two dozen thai companies agreed to form a collective alliance to work against corruption .
the directors ’ institute says as many as 200 companies can be expected to join the alliance by next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian protesters demanded that the president should quit over two corruption scandals corruption contributes to inequality but for asian development bank president , haruhiko kuroda , the economic costs of corruption have a wider impact on the community .
" corruption is a tax on the poor , " he said . " corruption and weak governance in general undermine government revenues resulting in poor infrastructure and hinders the pace of poverty reduction .
it also contributes to inequalities in access to education , health , infrastructure and other productive assets .
and it is the poor and the vulnerable that inevitably bear the brunt . "
u.s. secretary of state hilary clinton , in a pre-recorded video statement , stressed the wider impact of corruption from business , politics , and democracy and as a factor in causing malnutrition .
but officials say while the issue of corruption was more openly discussed and legislation strengthened , enforcement remained a problem .
also for many countries where corruption remained rampant there was still some way to go to reduce its impact across societies .
