program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 17.07.2010 poland hosts major european gay rights rally großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : similar parades in poland , like this one in 2006 , have caused controversy in the past the annual europride gay rights rally is being staged in a former warsaw pact country for the first time on saturday .
thousands of people marched through warsaw - thousands also opposed the event . the landmark gay rights rally in the polish capital was the first europride parade ever to take place behind the cold war iron curtain . the event was small by its own standards , with police estimating about 8,000 people took part this year , as opposed to 50,000 at last year 's march in zurich and more than a million in madrid three years ago . nevertheless , politicians from countries like great britain , sweden and germany also plan to take part in the rally , which will focus on a call for legal recognition of same-sex partnerships .
polish officials , however , are not expected at the rally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer people participated in the warsaw march than in other years and cities despite marching with banners calling for new civil partnership laws , participants at the parade admitted that the legal situation for homosexuals in poland was unlikely to change . " we 're hoping to open up a debate on the topic of affording legal status to the partnerships of gay and lesbian couples but we 're not optimistic such legislation will be passed anytime soon , " jacek adler , editor in chief of the www.gaylife.pl polish gay lifestyle website , told the afp news agency . local backlash the parade is facing strong opposition in largely catholic and conservative poland ; some 55,000 people have signed a petition which describes europride as " an obscene event of filth and perversion . "
counter-protesters chanted , " no to sodom and gomorrah , " while one man distributed copies of the old testament . opinion polls have shown that as much as 80 percent of poles oppose gay marriage and 93 percent say gay and lesbian couples should not be permitted to adopt children .
two-thirds of the polish population oppose gay demonstrations . gay rights were repressed during the communist era , and gays and lesbians have struggled since communism fell 20 years ago for acceptance in a society still strongly influenced by the church . poland 's conservative opposition , led by jaroslaw kaczynski , is against the recognition of homosexual partnerships .
kaczynski 's twin brother , recently deceased former president lech kaczynski banned a similar demonstration in warsaw in 2005 when he was mayor of the city . conservatives are planning a counter-demonstration on the streets of warsaw in response . " politicians are afraid of us and would rather ignore this topic , " said tomasz baczkowski from the " equality " foundation , which has helped organize the event . author : mark hallam -lrb- afp , dpa , ap -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the friday meeting was the first to be held by experts to supervise the un 's millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , aimed at halving global extreme poverty by 2015 .
kagame and zapatero are the co-chairs of the group .
the spanish judiciary accuses kagame of a reign of terror during the 1990s in rwanda .
at least 800,000 people , mostly from the tutsi minority were killed by hutu extremist militias and government troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero did n't think it was " appropriate " to meet kagame in 2008 spain 's high court announced its intention to prosecute 40 rwandan army officers for genocide , crimes against humanity and terrorism related to events that took place between 1994 and 2000 , including under kagame 's rule .
the rwandan officers are accused , among other things , of murdering nine spanish missionaries and expatriates allegedly witnesses to massacres .
no indictment was issued , however , because kagame had immunity as a head of state .
spain 's " internal politics " de la vega said that a request had been made by several spanish political groups for zapatero not to attend .
in new york on friday , a un spokesman said that " the government of spain had been fully informed of the choice of president kagame as one of the co-facilitators . "
but rwandan officials played down the significance of zapatero 's decision to withdraw from the meeting with kagame .
" it is not a big deal for us .
it is spain 's internal politics , " rwandan foreign minister louise mushikiwabo told reporters on the sidelines of the gathering .
" we would like the spanish people to get to know rwanda 's president kagame better .
he is not what we see him portrayed as . "
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos took zapatero 's place at the meeting , also attended by un secretary-general ban ki-moon who met zapatero separately .
ban " expressed his concerns " that the recent murder of opposition official andre kagwa rwisereka and journalist jean leonard rugambage has " caused political tensions " in rwanda ahead of august 9 presidential elections , his spokeswoman said .
the venue for the meeting was moved from the seat of government , moncloa palace , to a hotel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 17.07.2010 hamburg remains divided ahead of education referendum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proponents of the reform say it will help the disadvantaged the german city of hamburg is gearing up for a referendum on a controversial reform to education that could see primary school extended from four years to six .
but a citizens ' initiative stands in the government 's way . twenty-five girls and boys stand in a semicircle in their classroom and sing a song in latin .
the kids are fourth-graders at the grumbrecht street primary school in the hamburg suburb of heimfeld .
the school 's headmaster , rainer kuehlke , said the singing exercise is part of grumbrecht street 's so-called language carousel , a program that sees the young students learning latin , spanish , french and english one after the other for nine weeks at a time .
the carousel course is designed to make it easier for the children to select one foreign language to learn in fifth grade , if they are selected for what the german system calls a gymnasium , or academic high school .
germany has a three-tier education system where children are sent to separate institutions after primary school .
the weak students go to a hauptschule , those opting for higher vocational training to a realschule and future academics to a gymnasium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : primary school students would stay together for an extra two years in germany education policy is not centralized , but rather left to the governments of all 16 federal states to decide on - and this has led to a lot of variety across the country .
in the city-state of hamburg , children go to primary school for four years until the age of 10 and are then separated according to their abilities - a move that shapes their lives .
education experts say this is too early - they argue that two more years of learning together would help the weaker students improve their chances for the future .
this notion is at the heart of government proposals to reform hamburg 's education system that would see students spend an extra two years at primary school .
the reforms would also see the different types of grammar schools boiled down to just two - the gymnasium and a so-called neighborhood school .
parents would also no longer be allowed to select which of these schools their child attended .
this decision would be made by teachers on the basis of merit and ability .
divisive plans the city 's trade unions and chambers of commerce , as well as numerous migrant associations , have spoken out in favor of extending primary school learning , arguing that the current system discriminates against children with working-class and migrant backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all students would have the chance to take a university entrance exam " in my home country it 's natural to go to primary school for six years , and if i had not been able to do that , i would surely not have made it to the level where i can pursue an academic career here in germany , " said native greek panis drossinakis .
in hamburg , every second child has some kind of a migrant background , and their families often belong to the disadvantaged in german society .
many have a working class background and their parents ' german skills are lacking , so it is these boys and girls who are left behind in the current system .
pedagogical scientist johannes bastian said success in the german school system depends too much on family background .
" even with the same level of achievement , children from working-class families have a smaller chance of making it to gymnasium than the child of university-educated parents , " he says .
lowering the bar ?
but the plan has been bitterly opposed by school groups and many parents ' groups , who are planning a referendum on the issue for this sunday - it 's outcome , political observers say , could make or break the ruling coalition .
the city 's gymnasium schools are especially concerned about the effect the proposed changes could have on the quality of education .
they fear their specialist profiles would be trimmed if the government gets it way , and that students would receive a lesser education because they would have less time to study their desired field , be it music , the humanities or the arts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christa goetsch is trying to push the reforms through many of hamburg 's headmasters and parents accuse the city 's schools minister , christa goetsch of the greens , of lowering educational standards .
they say they ca n't understand how there could be no exception made for schools and educational methods they say have been time-proven .
media lawyer walter scheuerl heads an initiative he founded two years ago called we want to learn .
in november last year , the initiative organized a petition against the government 's education reforms , and within only a few weeks had gathered some 180,000 signatures against the changes , enough to force sunday 's referendum .
this pushed the city 's government - a coalition of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the hamburg greens party - into weeks of debate over a possible compromise to avert the public vote .
the coalition was unable to reach that compromise .
many schools around hamburg have already begun adapting to the changes espoused by the city government , but if hamburgers vote against the reforms on sunday then it will have all been in vain .

" wagner , who is also the director of the dora-mittelbau concentration camp memorial , added that the exhibition will " use the frame of forced labor to tell the social history of nazism , the history of a social order that was ideologically anchored in extreme racism . " he said the exhibition is not simply a " commission " by the evz but will critically examine both at forced labor and at compensation paid to victims by the evz . to that end , wagner said the exhibition will also " consider the italian military detainee or the soviet prisoner of war , who were denied compensation and humanitarian aid , but who , of course - in the eyes of historians - were also forced workers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 17.07.2010 ten years on , syrian leader keeps his options open großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : propagandistic iconography featuring al assad is the norm in damascus ten years ago , syrian president bashar al-assad was named to replace his deceased father .
what role has his leadership played in the troubled search for peace in the middle east ? generations of middle east experts have asked themselves the same question : is syria the key to peace in the middle east , or is it a stumbling block ?
both possibilities are closely linked .
through its relations with iran , the hezbollah militia in lebanon , and radical hamas in gaza , the regime in damascus has enormous potential to influence the situation there - both for the positive and for the negative .
anti-israel , but open to the west president bashar al-assad shows a similar flexibility as his father , whose job he inherited on july 17 , 2000 .
under his reign the syrian state media is on a strictly anti-israeli course : the disliked neighbor is portrayed as an ever-agressive , propoganda-crazy " zionist entity . "
in the streets of damascus , endless numbers of propaganda posters show al-assad side by side with hezbollah chief hassan nasrallah , or iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
and the leadership of hamas lives in the syrian metropolis - along with a few other radical palestinian organizations .
at the same time , al-assad has repeatedly sent signals that show an interest in peace in the region , and on improved relations with western countries .
in that way , he is different from his partners in iran , hamas or hezbollah , which loudly agitate for the destruction of israel .
attempts at indirect peace talks when al-assad criticizes israel , he tends to do so from the standpoint of a peace-loving politician who , sadly , does n't find the same attitude in his opponent .
speaking to the bbc in mid-june after the israeli marine 's deadly attack on the gaza flotilla , al-assad said : " the attack destroyed any chance for peace in the near future .
very simply , mainly because it proved that this government is another pyromaniac government .
you can not achieve peace with such a government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hafiz al assad , left , was pictured on election posters with his son .
al-assad himself has tried it , though .
like his father before him , he agreed to indirect peace talks with israel .
turkey mediated at first , but they have been on hold since the gaza war in 2008 .
another round seems unlikely in the near future - especially in light of the currently poor relations between turkey and israel .
critics say there is more likely to be new war in the region than peace anytime soon .
dealing with the golan question many european observers believe that syria has no interest in a new escalation in the region .
while the country was considered part of the " axis of evil " by former us president george w. bush , today , syria 's leader is essentially courted by western politicians .
indeed , syria has a number of interests that speak in favor of taking the path of peace and working together with western leaders .
syria wants to reform its ailing economy and needs to shed itself of american sanctions in order to do it .
above all , syria wants to get back the golan heights , which it lost to israel in 1967 , and which israel later annexed .
for the government , the return of the golan is a question of prestige .
" no syrian politician can give up on the golan .
the golan is part of syria , " explains samir al-aita , editor-in-chief of the arabic edition of le monde diplomatique .
delicate balance of influences german middle-east expert volker perthes believes it is possible to remove syria from its tight connections to iran , hamas and hezbollah .
the director of the german institute for international policy and security at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , says syria and hezbollah are allies out of necessity : syria needs hezbollah to keep up the credibility of its threats to israel , and hezbollah is using syria for financial and material support - including arms deliveries .
" that would all change if syria really signed a peace deal with israel and regained its occupied territory .
that is clear .
and beirut and the hezbollah know it .
the relationship of syria to hezbollah would change because they would no longer have the same strategic interests . "
but can al-assad take the risk - both in terms of domestic and foreign policy - of renouncing its allegiance to hamas , hezbollah and iran , in order to reclaim the golan and have better relations to the west ?
failed peace attempts thus far attempts to make that happen have failed up to the present .
us secretary of state hillary clinton became aware of that last february , when she openly asked al-assad to reconsider his tight strategic links to iran .
he replied that syria knew its own history , and said the middle east could take care of its own business , thank you .
at the end of the day , the question of whether syria is a key to peace or a stumbling block on the road there , is an open one .
and bashar al-assad seems bent on keeping it that way .

speaking to the bbc in mid-june after the israeli marine 's deadly attack on the gaza flotilla , al-assad said : " the attack destroyed any chance for peace in the near future .
very simply , mainly because it proved that this government is another pyromaniac government .
you can not achieve peace with such a government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hafiz al assad , left , was pictured on election posters with his son .
al-assad himself has tried it , though .
like his father before him , he agreed to indirect peace talks with israel .
turkey mediated at first , but they have been on hold since the gaza war in 2008 .
another round seems unlikely in the near future - especially in light of the currently poor relations between turkey and israel .
critics say there is more likely to be new war in the region than peace anytime soon .
dealing with the golan question many european observers believe that syria has no interest in a new escalation in the region .
while the country was considered part of the " axis of evil " by former us president george w. bush , today , syria 's leader is essentially courted by western politicians .
indeed , syria has a number of interests that speak in favor of taking the path of peace and working together with western leaders .
syria wants to reform its ailing economy and needs to shed itself of american sanctions in order to do it .
above all , syria wants to get back the golan heights , which it lost to israel in 1967 , and which israel later annexed .
for the government , the return of the golan is a question of prestige .
" no syrian politician can give up on the golan .
the golan is part of syria , " explains samir al-aita , editor-in-chief of the arabic edition of le monde diplomatique .
delicate balance of influences german middle-east expert volker perthes believes it is possible to remove syria from its tight connections to iran , hamas and hezbollah .
the director of the german institute for international policy and security at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , says syria and hezbollah are allies out of necessity : syria needs hezbollah to keep up the credibility of its threats to israel , and hezbollah is using syria for financial and material support - including arms deliveries .
" that would all change if syria really signed a peace deal with israel and regained its occupied territory .
that is clear .
and beirut and the hezbollah know it .
the relationship of syria to hezbollah would change because they would no longer have the same strategic interests . "
but can al-assad take the risk - both in terms of domestic and foreign policy - of renouncing its allegiance to hamas , hezbollah and iran , in order to reclaim the golan and have better relations to the west ?
failed peace attempts thus far attempts to make that happen have failed up to the present .
us secretary of state hillary clinton became aware of that last february , when she openly asked al-assad to reconsider his tight strategic links to iran .
he replied that syria knew its own history , and said the middle east could take care of its own business , thank you .
at the end of the day , the question of whether syria is a key to peace or a stumbling block on the road there , is an open one .
and bashar al-assad seems bent on keeping it that way .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 17.07.2010 ten years on , syrian leader keeps his options open großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : propagandistic iconography featuring al assad is the norm in damascus ten years ago , syrian president bashar al-assad was named to replace his deceased father .
what role has his leadership played in the troubled search for peace in the middle east ? generations of middle east experts have asked themselves the same question : is syria the key to peace in the middle east , or is it a stumbling block ?
both possibilities are closely linked .
through its relations with iran , the hezbollah militia in lebanon , and radical hamas in gaza , the regime in damascus has enormous potential to influence the situation there - both for the positive and for the negative .
anti-israel , but open to the west president bashar al-assad shows a similar flexibility as his father , whose job he inherited on july 17 , 2000 .
under his reign the syrian state media is on a strictly anti-israeli course : the disliked neighbor is portrayed as an ever-agressive , propoganda-crazy " zionist entity . "

attempts at indirect peace talks when al-assad criticizes israel , he tends to do so from the standpoint of a peace-loving politician who , sadly , does n't find the same attitude in his opponent .

syria wants to reform its ailing economy and needs to shed itself of american sanctions in order to do it .
above all , syria wants to get back the golan heights , which it lost to israel in 1967 , and which israel later annexed .

" that would all change if syria really signed a peace deal with israel and regained its occupied territory .
that is clear .
and beirut and the hezbollah know it .
the relationship of syria to hezbollah would change because they would no longer have the same strategic interests . "
but can al-assad take the risk - both in terms of domestic and foreign policy - of renouncing its allegiance to hamas , hezbollah and iran , in order to reclaim the golan and have better relations to the west ?
failed peace attempts thus far attempts to make that happen have failed up to the present .
us secretary of state hillary clinton became aware of that last february , when she openly asked al-assad to reconsider his tight strategic links to iran .

awards for best schools , best reading competence or mathematical ability are usually given to other countries ' education systems . but germany does have the distinction of one record : it 's the country with the most education systems .
each of germany 's 16 states has its own system . that 's a big disadvantage for students switching to a new school in a different state , according to rita nikolai , an education researcher from the social science research center in berlin .

previously , students took placement tests to determine if they were placed in a college-preparatory school or a vocational school . saarland has just decided to extend the time students spend in primary school from four to five years , while most of the other states are debating between four or six years . in hamburg , another german city that doubles as its own state , voters are heading to the polls sunday to decide on whether to continue tracking students when they reach fifth grade or to keep all students in the same primary school classes until the end of sixth grade . the autonomy of the states has grown since 2006 , when the federal and state governments agreed on a new division of responsibilities - a decision that favored giving the states more discretion in deciding their education policy .
while there have always been differences in each state , there is no longer anyone to arbitrate among the states , according to nikolai . " since the reforms the problem is that the federal government can no longer take control of the wheel , " she said .
" federal programs for preschool programs can no longer be coordinated from berlin alone .

some experts say that makes life tough for students . german students do n't tend to be at the front of the class when it comes to international rankings .
awards for best schools , best reading competence or mathematical ability are usually given to other countries ' education systems . but germany does have the distinction of one record : it 's the country with the most education systems .
each of germany 's 16 states has its own system . that 's a big disadvantage for students switching to a new school in a different state , according to rita nikolai , an education researcher from the social science research center in berlin . " the danger that kids will have to step down a level in school or get held back exists , " nikolai said .
" between the states , there are significant differences in the curriculum . " take the state of hesse .
it offers students foreign language instruction in sixth grade .
in most other states , foreign language classes begin a year later .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 17.07.2010 hamburg remains divided ahead of education referendum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proponents of the reform say it will help the disadvantaged the german city of hamburg is gearing up for a referendum on a controversial reform to education that could see primary school extended from four years to six .
but a citizens ' initiative stands in the government 's way . twenty-five girls and boys stand in a semicircle in their classroom and sing a song in latin .
the kids are fourth-graders at the grumbrecht street primary school in the hamburg suburb of heimfeld .
the school 's headmaster , rainer kuehlke , said the singing exercise is part of grumbrecht street 's so-called language carousel , a program that sees the young students learning latin , spanish , french and english one after the other for nine weeks at a time .
the carousel course is designed to make it easier for the children to select one foreign language to learn in fifth grade , if they are selected for what the german system calls a gymnasium , or academic high school .
germany has a three-tier education system where children are sent to separate institutions after primary school .
the weak students go to a hauptschule , those opting for higher vocational training to a realschule and future academics to a gymnasium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : primary school students would stay together for an extra two years in germany education policy is not centralized , but rather left to the governments of all 16 federal states to decide on - and this has led to a lot of variety across the country .
in the city-state of hamburg , children go to primary school for four years until the age of 10 and are then separated according to their abilities - a move that shapes their lives .
education experts say this is too early - they argue that two more years of learning together would help the weaker students improve their chances for the future .
this notion is at the heart of government proposals to reform hamburg 's education system that would see students spend an extra two years at primary school .
the reforms would also see the different types of grammar schools boiled down to just two - the gymnasium and a so-called neighborhood school .
parents would also no longer be allowed to select which of these schools their child attended .
this decision would be made by teachers on the basis of merit and ability .
divisive plans the city 's trade unions and chambers of commerce , as well as numerous migrant associations , have spoken out in favor of extending primary school learning , arguing that the current system discriminates against children with working-class and migrant backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all students would have the chance to take a university entrance exam " in my home country it 's natural to go to primary school for six years , and if i had not been able to do that , i would surely not have made it to the level where i can pursue an academic career here in germany , " said native greek panis drossinakis .
in hamburg , every second child has some kind of a migrant background , and their families often belong to the disadvantaged in german society .
many have a working class background and their parents ' german skills are lacking , so it is these boys and girls who are left behind in the current system .
pedagogical scientist johannes bastian said success in the german school system depends too much on family background .
" even with the same level of achievement , children from working-class families have a smaller chance of making it to gymnasium than the child of university-educated parents , " he says .
lowering the bar ?
but the plan has been bitterly opposed by school groups and many parents ' groups , who are planning a referendum on the issue for this sunday - it 's outcome , political observers say , could make or break the ruling coalition .
the city 's gymnasium schools are especially concerned about the effect the proposed changes could have on the quality of education .
they fear their specialist profiles would be trimmed if the government gets it way , and that students would receive a lesser education because they would have less time to study their desired field , be it music , the humanities or the arts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christa goetsch is trying to push the reforms through many of hamburg 's headmasters and parents accuse the city 's schools minister , christa goetsch of the greens , of lowering educational standards .
they say they ca n't understand how there could be no exception made for schools and educational methods they say have been time-proven .
media lawyer walter scheuerl heads an initiative he founded two years ago called we want to learn .
in november last year , the initiative organized a petition against the government 's education reforms , and within only a few weeks had gathered some 180,000 signatures against the changes , enough to force sunday 's referendum .
this pushed the city 's government - a coalition of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the hamburg greens party - into weeks of debate over a possible compromise to avert the public vote .
the coalition was unable to reach that compromise .
many schools around hamburg have already begun adapting to the changes espoused by the city government , but if hamburgers vote against the reforms on sunday then it will have all been in vain .

german politicians and police proposed measures to crack down on internet crime and improve education of young internet surfers . prosecutors in the western city of aachen are questioning a man for spying on schoolgirls using the web cameras on their own computers .
police used the man 's internet protocol -lrb- ip -rrb- address to track him to his home , according to an association of german data protection specialists . the daily westfalenblatt reported that the man spied used a computer virus to spy on over 150 girls .
prosecutors confirmed an investigation was ongoing but declined to comment on the number of victims . a widespread problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one girl 's chat contacts provided a list of victims for the hacker the case was discovered by thomas floss , a data protection advocate who gives presentations in schools to promote awareness of safe internet practices .

" i 've visited 50 to 60 schools , and each time at least one girl tells me she has had this kind of problem , " he said . floss 's suspicions were confirmed when he discovered a so-called trojan virus on one of the girl 's computers .

jansen called for identification requirements for web surfers - and for the introduction of a " reset button for the internet " that would allow the german chancellor to remove germany from the internet in the case of an emergency . a simpler solution ? constanze kurz of the hacker association chaos computer club , dismissed jansen 's suggestions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 17.07.2010 ten years on , syrian leader keeps his options open großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : propagandistic iconography featuring al assad is the norm in damascus ten years ago , syrian president bashar al-assad was named to replace his deceased father .
what role has his leadership played in the troubled search for peace in the middle east ? generations of middle east experts have asked themselves the same question : is syria the key to peace in the middle east , or is it a stumbling block ?
both possibilities are closely linked .
through its relations with iran , the hezbollah militia in lebanon , and radical hamas in gaza , the regime in damascus has enormous potential to influence the situation there - both for the positive and for the negative .
anti-israel , but open to the west president bashar al-assad shows a similar flexibility as his father , whose job he inherited on july 17 , 2000 .
under his reign the syrian state media is on a strictly anti-israeli course : the disliked neighbor is portrayed as an ever-agressive , propoganda-crazy " zionist entity . "
in the streets of damascus , endless numbers of propaganda posters show al-assad side by side with hezbollah chief hassan nasrallah , or iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
and the leadership of hamas lives in the syrian metropolis - along with a few other radical palestinian organizations .
at the same time , al-assad has repeatedly sent signals that show an interest in peace in the region , and on improved relations with western countries .
in that way , he is different from his partners in iran , hamas or hezbollah , which loudly agitate for the destruction of israel .
attempts at indirect peace talks when al-assad criticizes israel , he tends to do so from the standpoint of a peace-loving politician who , sadly , does n't find the same attitude in his opponent .
speaking to the bbc in mid-june after the israeli marine 's deadly attack on the gaza flotilla , al-assad said : " the attack destroyed any chance for peace in the near future .
very simply , mainly because it proved that this government is another pyromaniac government .
you can not achieve peace with such a government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hafiz al assad , left , was pictured on election posters with his son .
al-assad himself has tried it , though .
like his father before him , he agreed to indirect peace talks with israel .
turkey mediated at first , but they have been on hold since the gaza war in 2008 .
another round seems unlikely in the near future - especially in light of the currently poor relations between turkey and israel .
critics say there is more likely to be new war in the region than peace anytime soon .
dealing with the golan question many european observers believe that syria has no interest in a new escalation in the region .
while the country was considered part of the " axis of evil " by former us president george w. bush , today , syria 's leader is essentially courted by western politicians .
indeed , syria has a number of interests that speak in favor of taking the path of peace and working together with western leaders .
syria wants to reform its ailing economy and needs to shed itself of american sanctions in order to do it .
above all , syria wants to get back the golan heights , which it lost to israel in 1967 , and which israel later annexed .
for the government , the return of the golan is a question of prestige .
" no syrian politician can give up on the golan .
the golan is part of syria , " explains samir al-aita , editor-in-chief of the arabic edition of le monde diplomatique .
delicate balance of influences german middle-east expert volker perthes believes it is possible to remove syria from its tight connections to iran , hamas and hezbollah .
the director of the german institute for international policy and security at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , says syria and hezbollah are allies out of necessity : syria needs hezbollah to keep up the credibility of its threats to israel , and hezbollah is using syria for financial and material support - including arms deliveries .
" that would all change if syria really signed a peace deal with israel and regained its occupied territory .
that is clear .
and beirut and the hezbollah know it .
the relationship of syria to hezbollah would change because they would no longer have the same strategic interests . "
but can al-assad take the risk - both in terms of domestic and foreign policy - of renouncing its allegiance to hamas , hezbollah and iran , in order to reclaim the golan and have better relations to the west ?
failed peace attempts thus far attempts to make that happen have failed up to the present .
us secretary of state hillary clinton became aware of that last february , when she openly asked al-assad to reconsider his tight strategic links to iran .
he replied that syria knew its own history , and said the middle east could take care of its own business , thank you .
at the end of the day , the question of whether syria is a key to peace or a stumbling block on the road there , is an open one .
and bashar al-assad seems bent on keeping it that way .

some experts say that makes life tough for students . german students do n't tend to be at the front of the class when it comes to international rankings .
awards for best schools , best reading competence or mathematical ability are usually given to other countries ' education systems . but germany does have the distinction of one record : it 's the country with the most education systems .
each of germany 's 16 states has its own system . that 's a big disadvantage for students switching to a new school in a different state , according to rita nikolai , an education researcher from the social science research center in berlin . " the danger that kids will have to step down a level in school or get held back exists , " nikolai said .
" between the states , there are significant differences in the curriculum . " take the state of hesse .
it offers students foreign language instruction in sixth grade .
in most other states , foreign language classes begin a year later .
that put students moving to hesse after completing the sixth grade a year behind their cohorts when it comes to foreign languages .
in hesse , it is then up to individual schools to decide if the student needs to repeat sixth grade or find another solution . hands tied at national level bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : different states have different education standards examples like this are everywhere in the german education system , and the confusion may become worse .
many states are planning sweeping education reforms in the next few years . when students return from summer holidays in berlin , which is one of germany 's states as well as the capital city , they 'll find that all forms of secondary education will be offered in a single school .
previously , students took placement tests to determine if they were placed in a college-preparatory school or a vocational school . saarland has just decided to extend the time students spend in primary school from four to five years , while most of the other states are debating between four or six years . in hamburg , another german city that doubles as its own state , voters are heading to the polls sunday to decide on whether to continue tracking students when they reach fifth grade or to keep all students in the same primary school classes until the end of sixth grade . the autonomy of the states has grown since 2006 , when the federal and state governments agreed on a new division of responsibilities - a decision that favored giving the states more discretion in deciding their education policy .
while there have always been differences in each state , there is no longer anyone to arbitrate among the states , according to nikolai . " since the reforms the problem is that the federal government can no longer take control of the wheel , " she said .
" federal programs for preschool programs can no longer be coordinated from berlin alone .

a decision on the matter is expected next week . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- failed to reach a decision saturday on whether to send an international police mission into kyrgyzstan to help authorities restore stability after a government overthrow in april and ethnic violence in june , which human rights groups say claimed up to 2,000 lives . though the decision has been put off until a thursday meeting in vienna .
but the osce 's meetings are on track , according to sources close to german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who along with his french counterpart bernard kouchner , called saturday 's meeting in kazakhstan . herbert salber , the head of the osce 's conflict prevention center , also remained confident that the mission would go forward . " our proposal to send police officers to kyrgyzstan is being assessed by osce member-countries , " he said .
" i think in the next few weeks , we will see their first arrivals . " twin missions ? the police advisory group currently being discussed by the osce would only be concerned with maintaining the fragile peace in the country ; 52 officers would be sent for the first four months , with the option for a further 50 after time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 17.07.2010 ten years on , syrian leader keeps his options open großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : propagandistic iconography featuring al assad is the norm in damascus ten years ago , syrian president bashar al-assad was named to replace his deceased father .
what role has his leadership played in the troubled search for peace in the middle east ? generations of middle east experts have asked themselves the same question : is syria the key to peace in the middle east , or is it a stumbling block ?
both possibilities are closely linked .
through its relations with iran , the hezbollah militia in lebanon , and radical hamas in gaza , the regime in damascus has enormous potential to influence the situation there - both for the positive and for the negative .
anti-israel , but open to the west president bashar al-assad shows a similar flexibility as his father , whose job he inherited on july 17 , 2000 .
under his reign the syrian state media is on a strictly anti-israeli course : the disliked neighbor is portrayed as an ever-agressive , propoganda-crazy " zionist entity . "
in the streets of damascus , endless numbers of propaganda posters show al-assad side by side with hezbollah chief hassan nasrallah , or iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
and the leadership of hamas lives in the syrian metropolis - along with a few other radical palestinian organizations .
at the same time , al-assad has repeatedly sent signals that show an interest in peace in the region , and on improved relations with western countries .
in that way , he is different from his partners in iran , hamas or hezbollah , which loudly agitate for the destruction of israel .
attempts at indirect peace talks when al-assad criticizes israel , he tends to do so from the standpoint of a peace-loving politician who , sadly , does n't find the same attitude in his opponent .
speaking to the bbc in mid-june after the israeli marine 's deadly attack on the gaza flotilla , al-assad said : " the attack destroyed any chance for peace in the near future .
very simply , mainly because it proved that this government is another pyromaniac government .
you can not achieve peace with such a government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hafiz al assad , left , was pictured on election posters with his son .
al-assad himself has tried it , though .
like his father before him , he agreed to indirect peace talks with israel .
turkey mediated at first , but they have been on hold since the gaza war in 2008 .
another round seems unlikely in the near future - especially in light of the currently poor relations between turkey and israel .
critics say there is more likely to be new war in the region than peace anytime soon .
dealing with the golan question many european observers believe that syria has no interest in a new escalation in the region .
while the country was considered part of the " axis of evil " by former us president george w. bush , today , syria 's leader is essentially courted by western politicians .
indeed , syria has a number of interests that speak in favor of taking the path of peace and working together with western leaders .
syria wants to reform its ailing economy and needs to shed itself of american sanctions in order to do it .
above all , syria wants to get back the golan heights , which it lost to israel in 1967 , and which israel later annexed .
for the government , the return of the golan is a question of prestige .
" no syrian politician can give up on the golan .
the golan is part of syria , " explains samir al-aita , editor-in-chief of the arabic edition of le monde diplomatique .
delicate balance of influences german middle-east expert volker perthes believes it is possible to remove syria from its tight connections to iran , hamas and hezbollah .
the director of the german institute for international policy and security at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , says syria and hezbollah are allies out of necessity : syria needs hezbollah to keep up the credibility of its threats to israel , and hezbollah is using syria for financial and material support - including arms deliveries .
" that would all change if syria really signed a peace deal with israel and regained its occupied territory .
that is clear .
and beirut and the hezbollah know it .
the relationship of syria to hezbollah would change because they would no longer have the same strategic interests . "
but can al-assad take the risk - both in terms of domestic and foreign policy - of renouncing its allegiance to hamas , hezbollah and iran , in order to reclaim the golan and have better relations to the west ?
failed peace attempts thus far attempts to make that happen have failed up to the present .
us secretary of state hillary clinton became aware of that last february , when she openly asked al-assad to reconsider his tight strategic links to iran .
he replied that syria knew its own history , and said the middle east could take care of its own business , thank you .
at the end of the day , the question of whether syria is a key to peace or a stumbling block on the road there , is an open one .
and bashar al-assad seems bent on keeping it that way .

a decision on the matter is expected next week . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- failed to reach a decision saturday on whether to send an international police mission into kyrgyzstan to help authorities restore stability after a government overthrow in april and ethnic violence in june , which human rights groups say claimed up to 2,000 lives . though the decision has been put off until a thursday meeting in vienna .
but the osce 's meetings are on track , according to sources close to german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who along with his french counterpart bernard kouchner , called saturday 's meeting in kazakhstan . herbert salber , the head of the osce 's conflict prevention center , also remained confident that the mission would go forward . " our proposal to send police officers to kyrgyzstan is being assessed by osce member-countries , " he said .
" i think in the next few weeks , we will see their first arrivals . " twin missions ? the police advisory group currently being discussed by the osce would only be concerned with maintaining the fragile peace in the country ; 52 officers would be sent for the first four months , with the option for a further 50 after time . " the tasks of this mission are first of all advising the kyrgyz police , " said salber .
" they will be assisting , and also monitoring , the kyrgyz police .

" the clashes were the culmination of repeated unrest and the mass displacement of citizens which began during the ousting of president kurmanbek bakiyev in early april . otunbayeva 's interim government is promising elections in october , and is seeking to reform the country into a parliamentary democracy , in a region where autocratic governments are more commonplace . author : mark hallam / david levitz -lrb- afp / apn / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thousands of people marched through warsaw - thousands also opposed the event . the landmark gay rights rally in the polish capital was the first europride parade ever to take place behind the cold war iron curtain . the event was small by its own standards , with police estimating about 8,000 people took part this year , as opposed to 50,000 at last year 's march in zurich and more than a million in madrid three years ago . nevertheless , politicians from countries like great britain , sweden and germany also plan to take part in the rally , which will focus on a call for legal recognition of same-sex partnerships .
polish officials , however , are not expected at the rally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer people participated in the warsaw march than in other years and cities despite marching with banners calling for new civil partnership laws , participants at the parade admitted that the legal situation for homosexuals in poland was unlikely to change . " we 're hoping to open up a debate on the topic of affording legal status to the partnerships of gay and lesbian couples but we 're not optimistic such legislation will be passed anytime soon , " jacek adler , editor in chief of the www.gaylife.pl polish gay lifestyle website , told the afp news agency . local backlash the parade is facing strong opposition in largely catholic and conservative poland ; some 55,000 people have signed a petition which describes europride as " an obscene event of filth and perversion . "
counter-protesters chanted , " no to sodom and gomorrah , " while one man distributed copies of the old testament . opinion polls have shown that as much as 80 percent of poles oppose gay marriage and 93 percent say gay and lesbian couples should not be permitted to adopt children .
two-thirds of the polish population oppose gay demonstrations . gay rights were repressed during the communist era , and gays and lesbians have struggled since communism fell 20 years ago for acceptance in a society still strongly influenced by the church . poland 's conservative opposition , led by jaroslaw kaczynski , is against the recognition of homosexual partnerships .
kaczynski 's twin brother , recently deceased former president lech kaczynski banned a similar demonstration in warsaw in 2005 when he was mayor of the city . conservatives are planning a counter-demonstration on the streets of warsaw in response . " politicians are afraid of us and would rather ignore this topic , " said tomasz baczkowski from the " equality " foundation , which has helped organize the event . author : mark hallam -lrb- afp , dpa , ap -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thousands of people marched through warsaw - thousands also opposed the event . the landmark gay rights rally in the polish capital was the first europride parade ever to take place behind the cold war iron curtain . the event was small by its own standards , with police estimating about 8,000 people took part this year , as opposed to 50,000 at last year 's march in zurich and more than a million in madrid three years ago . nevertheless , politicians from countries like great britain , sweden and germany also plan to take part in the rally , which will focus on a call for legal recognition of same-sex partnerships .
polish officials , however , are not expected at the rally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer people participated in the warsaw march than in other years and cities despite marching with banners calling for new civil partnership laws , participants at the parade admitted that the legal situation for homosexuals in poland was unlikely to change . " we 're hoping to open up a debate on the topic of affording legal status to the partnerships of gay and lesbian couples but we 're not optimistic such legislation will be passed anytime soon , " jacek adler , editor in chief of the www.gaylife.pl polish gay lifestyle website , told the afp news agency . local backlash the parade is facing strong opposition in largely catholic and conservative poland ; some 55,000 people have signed a petition which describes europride as " an obscene event of filth and perversion . "
counter-protesters chanted , " no to sodom and gomorrah , " while one man distributed copies of the old testament . opinion polls have shown that as much as 80 percent of poles oppose gay marriage and 93 percent say gay and lesbian couples should not be permitted to adopt children .
two-thirds of the polish population oppose gay demonstrations . gay rights were repressed during the communist era , and gays and lesbians have struggled since communism fell 20 years ago for acceptance in a society still strongly influenced by the church . poland 's conservative opposition , led by jaroslaw kaczynski , is against the recognition of homosexual partnerships .
kaczynski 's twin brother , recently deceased former president lech kaczynski banned a similar demonstration in warsaw in 2005 when he was mayor of the city . conservatives are planning a counter-demonstration on the streets of warsaw in response . " politicians are afraid of us and would rather ignore this topic , " said tomasz baczkowski from the " equality " foundation , which has helped organize the event . author : mark hallam -lrb- afp , dpa , ap -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the prime minister yesterday received a petition from various political groups saying that they did n't think it was appropriate for the meeting to take place , " vice president maria teresa fernandez de la vega said on spanish public television station tve on friday .
the friday meeting was the first to be held by experts to supervise the un 's millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , aimed at halving global extreme poverty by 2015 .
kagame and zapatero are the co-chairs of the group .
the spanish judiciary accuses kagame of a reign of terror during the 1990s in rwanda .
at least 800,000 people , mostly from the tutsi minority were killed by hutu extremist militias and government troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero did n't think it was " appropriate " to meet kagame in 2008 spain 's high court announced its intention to prosecute 40 rwandan army officers for genocide , crimes against humanity and terrorism related to events that took place between 1994 and 2000 , including under kagame 's rule .
the rwandan officers are accused , among other things , of murdering nine spanish missionaries and expatriates allegedly witnesses to massacres .
no indictment was issued , however , because kagame had immunity as a head of state .
spain 's " internal politics " de la vega said that a request had been made by several spanish political groups for zapatero not to attend .
in new york on friday , a un spokesman said that " the government of spain had been fully informed of the choice of president kagame as one of the co-facilitators . "
but rwandan officials played down the significance of zapatero 's decision to withdraw from the meeting with kagame .
" it is not a big deal for us .
it is spain 's internal politics , " rwandan foreign minister louise mushikiwabo told reporters on the sidelines of the gathering .
" we would like the spanish people to get to know rwanda 's president kagame better .
he is not what we see him portrayed as . "
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos took zapatero 's place at the meeting , also attended by un secretary-general ban ki-moon who met zapatero separately .
ban " expressed his concerns " that the recent murder of opposition official andre kagwa rwisereka and journalist jean leonard rugambage has " caused political tensions " in rwanda ahead of august 9 presidential elections , his spokeswoman said .
the venue for the meeting was moved from the seat of government , moncloa palace , to a hotel .

" our proposal to send police officers to kyrgyzstan is being assessed by osce member-countries , " he said .
" i think in the next few weeks , we will see their first arrivals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 17.07.2010 hamburg remains divided ahead of education referendum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proponents of the reform say it will help the disadvantaged the german city of hamburg is gearing up for a referendum on a controversial reform to education that could see primary school extended from four years to six .
but a citizens ' initiative stands in the government 's way . twenty-five girls and boys stand in a semicircle in their classroom and sing a song in latin .
the kids are fourth-graders at the grumbrecht street primary school in the hamburg suburb of heimfeld .
the school 's headmaster , rainer kuehlke , said the singing exercise is part of grumbrecht street 's so-called language carousel , a program that sees the young students learning latin , spanish , french and english one after the other for nine weeks at a time .
the carousel course is designed to make it easier for the children to select one foreign language to learn in fifth grade , if they are selected for what the german system calls a gymnasium , or academic high school .
germany has a three-tier education system where children are sent to separate institutions after primary school .
the weak students go to a hauptschule , those opting for higher vocational training to a realschule and future academics to a gymnasium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : primary school students would stay together for an extra two years in germany education policy is not centralized , but rather left to the governments of all 16 federal states to decide on - and this has led to a lot of variety across the country .
in the city-state of hamburg , children go to primary school for four years until the age of 10 and are then separated according to their abilities - a move that shapes their lives .
education experts say this is too early - they argue that two more years of learning together would help the weaker students improve their chances for the future .
this notion is at the heart of government proposals to reform hamburg 's education system that would see students spend an extra two years at primary school .
the reforms would also see the different types of grammar schools boiled down to just two - the gymnasium and a so-called neighborhood school .
parents would also no longer be allowed to select which of these schools their child attended .
this decision would be made by teachers on the basis of merit and ability .
divisive plans the city 's trade unions and chambers of commerce , as well as numerous migrant associations , have spoken out in favor of extending primary school learning , arguing that the current system discriminates against children with working-class and migrant backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all students would have the chance to take a university entrance exam " in my home country it 's natural to go to primary school for six years , and if i had not been able to do that , i would surely not have made it to the level where i can pursue an academic career here in germany , " said native greek panis drossinakis .
in hamburg , every second child has some kind of a migrant background , and their families often belong to the disadvantaged in german society .
many have a working class background and their parents ' german skills are lacking , so it is these boys and girls who are left behind in the current system .
pedagogical scientist johannes bastian said success in the german school system depends too much on family background .
" even with the same level of achievement , children from working-class families have a smaller chance of making it to gymnasium than the child of university-educated parents , " he says .
lowering the bar ?
but the plan has been bitterly opposed by school groups and many parents ' groups , who are planning a referendum on the issue for this sunday - it 's outcome , political observers say , could make or break the ruling coalition .
the city 's gymnasium schools are especially concerned about the effect the proposed changes could have on the quality of education .
they fear their specialist profiles would be trimmed if the government gets it way , and that students would receive a lesser education because they would have less time to study their desired field , be it music , the humanities or the arts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christa goetsch is trying to push the reforms through many of hamburg 's headmasters and parents accuse the city 's schools minister , christa goetsch of the greens , of lowering educational standards .
they say they ca n't understand how there could be no exception made for schools and educational methods they say have been time-proven .
media lawyer walter scheuerl heads an initiative he founded two years ago called we want to learn .
in november last year , the initiative organized a petition against the government 's education reforms , and within only a few weeks had gathered some 180,000 signatures against the changes , enough to force sunday 's referendum .
this pushed the city 's government - a coalition of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the hamburg greens party - into weeks of debate over a possible compromise to avert the public vote .
the coalition was unable to reach that compromise .
many schools around hamburg have already begun adapting to the changes espoused by the city government , but if hamburgers vote against the reforms on sunday then it will have all been in vain .

german politicians and police proposed measures to crack down on internet crime and improve education of young internet surfers . prosecutors in the western city of aachen are questioning a man for spying on schoolgirls using the web cameras on their own computers .
police used the man 's internet protocol -lrb- ip -rrb- address to track him to his home , according to an association of german data protection specialists . the daily westfalenblatt reported that the man spied used a computer virus to spy on over 150 girls .
prosecutors confirmed an investigation was ongoing but declined to comment on the number of victims . a widespread problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one girl 's chat contacts provided a list of victims for the hacker the case was discovered by thomas floss , a data protection advocate who gives presentations in schools to promote awareness of safe internet practices .
two girls came forward after one of his presentations to tell him that their web cameras lit up even when the girls had not activated them . floss said he believes the problem to be widespread . " i 've visited 50 to 60 schools , and each time at least one girl tells me she has had this kind of problem , " he said . floss 's suspicions were confirmed when he discovered a so-called trojan virus on one of the girl 's computers .

" wolfgang bosbach , a leading member of the chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , meanwhile called for a systematic prosecution of internet crime to discourage copy-cats . " this is why it 's so important to educate especially children and teenagers about the dangers of the internet , " he said . stronger demands came from klaus jansen , head of the association of german detectives , who insisted that there was no longer room for anonymity on the internet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 17.07.2010 ten years on , syrian leader keeps his options open großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : propagandistic iconography featuring al assad is the norm in damascus ten years ago , syrian president bashar al-assad was named to replace his deceased father .
what role has his leadership played in the troubled search for peace in the middle east ? generations of middle east experts have asked themselves the same question : is syria the key to peace in the middle east , or is it a stumbling block ?
both possibilities are closely linked .
through its relations with iran , the hezbollah militia in lebanon , and radical hamas in gaza , the regime in damascus has enormous potential to influence the situation there - both for the positive and for the negative .
anti-israel , but open to the west president bashar al-assad shows a similar flexibility as his father , whose job he inherited on july 17 , 2000 .
under his reign the syrian state media is on a strictly anti-israeli course : the disliked neighbor is portrayed as an ever-agressive , propoganda-crazy " zionist entity . "
in the streets of damascus , endless numbers of propaganda posters show al-assad side by side with hezbollah chief hassan nasrallah , or iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
and the leadership of hamas lives in the syrian metropolis - along with a few other radical palestinian organizations .
at the same time , al-assad has repeatedly sent signals that show an interest in peace in the region , and on improved relations with western countries .
in that way , he is different from his partners in iran , hamas or hezbollah , which loudly agitate for the destruction of israel .
attempts at indirect peace talks when al-assad criticizes israel , he tends to do so from the standpoint of a peace-loving politician who , sadly , does n't find the same attitude in his opponent .
speaking to the bbc in mid-june after the israeli marine 's deadly attack on the gaza flotilla , al-assad said : " the attack destroyed any chance for peace in the near future .
very simply , mainly because it proved that this government is another pyromaniac government .
you can not achieve peace with such a government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hafiz al assad , left , was pictured on election posters with his son .
al-assad himself has tried it , though .
like his father before him , he agreed to indirect peace talks with israel .
turkey mediated at first , but they have been on hold since the gaza war in 2008 .
another round seems unlikely in the near future - especially in light of the currently poor relations between turkey and israel .
critics say there is more likely to be new war in the region than peace anytime soon .
dealing with the golan question many european observers believe that syria has no interest in a new escalation in the region .
while the country was considered part of the " axis of evil " by former us president george w. bush , today , syria 's leader is essentially courted by western politicians .
indeed , syria has a number of interests that speak in favor of taking the path of peace and working together with western leaders .
syria wants to reform its ailing economy and needs to shed itself of american sanctions in order to do it .
above all , syria wants to get back the golan heights , which it lost to israel in 1967 , and which israel later annexed .
for the government , the return of the golan is a question of prestige .
" no syrian politician can give up on the golan .
the golan is part of syria , " explains samir al-aita , editor-in-chief of the arabic edition of le monde diplomatique .
delicate balance of influences german middle-east expert volker perthes believes it is possible to remove syria from its tight connections to iran , hamas and hezbollah .
the director of the german institute for international policy and security at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , says syria and hezbollah are allies out of necessity : syria needs hezbollah to keep up the credibility of its threats to israel , and hezbollah is using syria for financial and material support - including arms deliveries .
" that would all change if syria really signed a peace deal with israel and regained its occupied territory .
that is clear .
and beirut and the hezbollah know it .
the relationship of syria to hezbollah would change because they would no longer have the same strategic interests . "
but can al-assad take the risk - both in terms of domestic and foreign policy - of renouncing its allegiance to hamas , hezbollah and iran , in order to reclaim the golan and have better relations to the west ?
failed peace attempts thus far attempts to make that happen have failed up to the present .
us secretary of state hillary clinton became aware of that last february , when she openly asked al-assad to reconsider his tight strategic links to iran .
he replied that syria knew its own history , and said the middle east could take care of its own business , thank you .
at the end of the day , the question of whether syria is a key to peace or a stumbling block on the road there , is an open one .
and bashar al-assad seems bent on keeping it that way .

" the prime minister yesterday received a petition from various political groups saying that they did n't think it was appropriate for the meeting to take place , " vice president maria teresa fernandez de la vega said on spanish public television station tve on friday .
the friday meeting was the first to be held by experts to supervise the un 's millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , aimed at halving global extreme poverty by 2015 .
kagame and zapatero are the co-chairs of the group .
the spanish judiciary accuses kagame of a reign of terror during the 1990s in rwanda .
at least 800,000 people , mostly from the tutsi minority were killed by hutu extremist militias and government troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero did n't think it was " appropriate " to meet kagame in 2008 spain 's high court announced its intention to prosecute 40 rwandan army officers for genocide , crimes against humanity and terrorism related to events that took place between 1994 and 2000 , including under kagame 's rule .
the rwandan officers are accused , among other things , of murdering nine spanish missionaries and expatriates allegedly witnesses to massacres .
no indictment was issued , however , because kagame had immunity as a head of state .
spain 's " internal politics " de la vega said that a request had been made by several spanish political groups for zapatero not to attend .
in new york on friday , a un spokesman said that " the government of spain had been fully informed of the choice of president kagame as one of the co-facilitators . "
but rwandan officials played down the significance of zapatero 's decision to withdraw from the meeting with kagame .
" it is not a big deal for us .
it is spain 's internal politics , " rwandan foreign minister louise mushikiwabo told reporters on the sidelines of the gathering .
" we would like the spanish people to get to know rwanda 's president kagame better .
he is not what we see him portrayed as . "
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos took zapatero 's place at the meeting , also attended by un secretary-general ban ki-moon who met zapatero separately .
ban " expressed his concerns " that the recent murder of opposition official andre kagwa rwisereka and journalist jean leonard rugambage has " caused political tensions " in rwanda ahead of august 9 presidential elections , his spokeswoman said .
the venue for the meeting was moved from the seat of government , moncloa palace , to a hotel .

some experts say that makes life tough for students . german students do n't tend to be at the front of the class when it comes to international rankings .
awards for best schools , best reading competence or mathematical ability are usually given to other countries ' education systems . but germany does have the distinction of one record : it 's the country with the most education systems .
each of germany 's 16 states has its own system . that 's a big disadvantage for students switching to a new school in a different state , according to rita nikolai , an education researcher from the social science research center in berlin . " the danger that kids will have to step down a level in school or get held back exists , " nikolai said .
" between the states , there are significant differences in the curriculum . " take the state of hesse .
it offers students foreign language instruction in sixth grade .
in most other states , foreign language classes begin a year later .
that put students moving to hesse after completing the sixth grade a year behind their cohorts when it comes to foreign languages .
in hesse , it is then up to individual schools to decide if the student needs to repeat sixth grade or find another solution . hands tied at national level bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : different states have different education standards examples like this are everywhere in the german education system , and the confusion may become worse .
many states are planning sweeping education reforms in the next few years . when students return from summer holidays in berlin , which is one of germany 's states as well as the capital city , they 'll find that all forms of secondary education will be offered in a single school .
previously , students took placement tests to determine if they were placed in a college-preparatory school or a vocational school . saarland has just decided to extend the time students spend in primary school from four to five years , while most of the other states are debating between four or six years . in hamburg , another german city that doubles as its own state , voters are heading to the polls sunday to decide on whether to continue tracking students when they reach fifth grade or to keep all students in the same primary school classes until the end of sixth grade . the autonomy of the states has grown since 2006 , when the federal and state governments agreed on a new division of responsibilities - a decision that favored giving the states more discretion in deciding their education policy .
while there have always been differences in each state , there is no longer anyone to arbitrate among the states , according to nikolai . " since the reforms the problem is that the federal government can no longer take control of the wheel , " she said .
" federal programs for preschool programs can no longer be coordinated from berlin alone . " ' education should have gone to the federal government ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matschie thinks education should be left to the federal government common education standards , the recognition of high school diplomas from other states and similar questions are debated between the states at the conference of german cultural ministers .

" with education policies , it is urgently necessary that we ensure kids have the same educational standards whether they go to school in berlin , hamburg , or erfurt , " said christoph matschie , education minister in thuringia . he is one of the few state ministers who does n't support the idea of giving states the upper hand when it comes to education .

attempts at indirect peace talks when al-assad criticizes israel , he tends to do so from the standpoint of a peace-loving politician who , sadly , does n't find the same attitude in his opponent .
speaking to the bbc in mid-june after the israeli marine 's deadly attack on the gaza flotilla , al-assad said : " the attack destroyed any chance for peace in the near future .
very simply , mainly because it proved that this government is another pyromaniac government .
you can not achieve peace with such a government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hafiz al assad , left , was pictured on election posters with his son .
al-assad himself has tried it , though .
like his father before him , he agreed to indirect peace talks with israel .
turkey mediated at first , but they have been on hold since the gaza war in 2008 .
another round seems unlikely in the near future - especially in light of the currently poor relations between turkey and israel .
critics say there is more likely to be new war in the region than peace anytime soon .
dealing with the golan question many european observers believe that syria has no interest in a new escalation in the region .
while the country was considered part of the " axis of evil " by former us president george w. bush , today , syria 's leader is essentially courted by western politicians .
indeed , syria has a number of interests that speak in favor of taking the path of peace and working together with western leaders .
syria wants to reform its ailing economy and needs to shed itself of american sanctions in order to do it .
above all , syria wants to get back the golan heights , which it lost to israel in 1967 , and which israel later annexed .
for the government , the return of the golan is a question of prestige .
" no syrian politician can give up on the golan .
the golan is part of syria , " explains samir al-aita , editor-in-chief of the arabic edition of le monde diplomatique .
delicate balance of influences german middle-east expert volker perthes believes it is possible to remove syria from its tight connections to iran , hamas and hezbollah .
the director of the german institute for international policy and security at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , says syria and hezbollah are allies out of necessity : syria needs hezbollah to keep up the credibility of its threats to israel , and hezbollah is using syria for financial and material support - including arms deliveries .
" that would all change if syria really signed a peace deal with israel and regained its occupied territory .
that is clear .
and beirut and the hezbollah know it .
the relationship of syria to hezbollah would change because they would no longer have the same strategic interests . "
but can al-assad take the risk - both in terms of domestic and foreign policy - of renouncing its allegiance to hamas , hezbollah and iran , in order to reclaim the golan and have better relations to the west ?
failed peace attempts thus far attempts to make that happen have failed up to the present .
us secretary of state hillary clinton became aware of that last february , when she openly asked al-assad to reconsider his tight strategic links to iran .
he replied that syria knew its own history , and said the middle east could take care of its own business , thank you .
at the end of the day , the question of whether syria is a key to peace or a stumbling block on the road there , is an open one .
and bashar al-assad seems bent on keeping it that way .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 17.07.2010 chinese and congolese artists explore their countries ' ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty is widespread in kinshasa one country devastated by violence , the other poised to become an economic superpower : congolese and chinese artists teamed up for a unique project which reveals how the countries view each other . " in china , i experienced an advanced country that is developing itself and making strides toward the future - but that also bears its traditions in mind , " said freddy tsimba from kinshasa , the capital of the democratic republic of congo .
" the situation in dr congo seemed so chaotic to me .
nothing really worked well - neither the police , nor the transportation system nor the political system , " said pak chuen sheung from hong kong , immediately excusing himself , should he come across as being impolite .
both men are artists taking part in the " brave new worlds " project at the theater der welt -lrb- theater of the world -rrb- festival in germany 's ruhr valley - part of this year 's european capital of culture programming .
there 's a world of distance separating the capital of an african nation shattered by civil war and the busy textile center of a nation that is among the most powerful in the world .
those economic and political contingencies affected not only the observations of the " brave new worlds " artists , but also their creative output .
' made in china ' a cultural center in muelheim , germany , was transformed into an open studio for the project .
there , vitshois mwilambwe spread balls of yarn out on a large table .
every size and color was represented ; some unraveled while others were still tightly coiled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one congolese artist used yarn to refer to china 's export dominance in africa " these days , our culture is dominated by products from china , " said vitshois .
" these colors symbolize ' made in china . '
nearly everything that you can find at the markets in kinshasa - whether it 's t-shirts , sneakers , bags , suitcases or toys - was manufactured in china . "
freddy tsimba put together an imposing installation made up of machetes , which were china 's first mass export to reach dr congo and continue to sell extremely well there .
they are used as farm tools , but the swords also invoke the violence and genocide the region has witnessed .
photography banned pak chuen sheung found numerous traces and remnants of war in dr congo - an unsettling experience for an artist more accustomed to the bustling world of finance and markets .
for instance , he brought a few small toy soldiers dressed for war that he found in the markets of kinshasa .
his colleague jiang jun described sensing aggression and tension everywhere he went in dr congo .
he took around 4,000 photos during his trip and said , with a touch of pride , " there , photography is illegal , but i did it anyway .
everyone is angry when photographed .
that 's totally different for us in china , where you can photograph everything . "
during his trip to dr congo , architect chen shuyu gave five congolese colleagues a small amount of money and let them decide what they would like to buy .
then he photographed them with their purchases .
his subjects included a mother who purchased a small toy and a backpack for her child and a young man who bought flip flops .
their choices represent the everyday items that many in dr congo can not afford .
bildunterschrift : some africans seek employment opportunities in china 's big cities , but live relatively isolated lives worlds apart " the point of the project was to encourage the artists to think about the roles of their respective countries - it 's a process , a work in progress , " said one curator of the project , els silvrants of belgium .
as such , the conversations stimulated by " brave new worlds " are more important than the artistic results alone .
it 's also an experiment that shows how difficult it can be for people from such different culture to see eye-to-eye , despite the participants ' best efforts .
many africans share mwilambe 's view that chinese products dominate africa , while many chinese may agree with artist jiang jun , when he said : " many africans come to china because they want to work with us and live with us . "
according to the artists , the image of china in africa is heavily influenced by the mass-produced items that find their way there along with massive , complex building projects , while the image of africa in china is influenced by the skyscrapers in chinese cities in which african laborers live communally and without contact to their neighbors .
architect cheng shuyu views the entire situation rather critically .
" what i saw in the markets in kinshasa were the cheapest , most artificially reproduced things - objects that we in china have not needed for a long time .
that 's somehow troubling .
it 's strange that all of these cheap products are flooding kinshasa , while we in china are trying to accommodate ourselves to western standards . "
els silvrants acknowledges that china is after sturdy raw materials in africa , but still she sees china as a possible way into the future for africa .
" it 's a different future than is available in europe , where so many restrictions exist and so many debates about values take place , " said silvrants .
europe turning its back ?
in this discourse , europe is largely neglected .
it plays almost no role other than occasionally being described as arrogant or withdrawn .
" why is africa turning to china ?
because europe is turning away , " said tsimba .
" china is willing to give us year-long visas , but being able to stay in europe is extremely hard . "
indeed , three of artists participating in the brave new worlds exhibition were unable to travel to germany for the show because they did not receive visas .
on the other hand , one congolese participant was also denied entry into china .
in her passport , her occupation is listed as journalist .

what role has his leadership played in the troubled search for peace in the middle east ? generations of middle east experts have asked themselves the same question : is syria the key to peace in the middle east , or is it a stumbling block ?
both possibilities are closely linked .
through its relations with iran , the hezbollah militia in lebanon , and radical hamas in gaza , the regime in damascus has enormous potential to influence the situation there - both for the positive and for the negative .
anti-israel , but open to the west president bashar al-assad shows a similar flexibility as his father , whose job he inherited on july 17 , 2000 .
under his reign the syrian state media is on a strictly anti-israeli course : the disliked neighbor is portrayed as an ever-agressive , propoganda-crazy " zionist entity . "
in the streets of damascus , endless numbers of propaganda posters show al-assad side by side with hezbollah chief hassan nasrallah , or iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
and the leadership of hamas lives in the syrian metropolis - along with a few other radical palestinian organizations .
at the same time , al-assad has repeatedly sent signals that show an interest in peace in the region , and on improved relations with western countries .
in that way , he is different from his partners in iran , hamas or hezbollah , which loudly agitate for the destruction of israel .
attempts at indirect peace talks when al-assad criticizes israel , he tends to do so from the standpoint of a peace-loving politician who , sadly , does n't find the same attitude in his opponent .
speaking to the bbc in mid-june after the israeli marine 's deadly attack on the gaza flotilla , al-assad said : " the attack destroyed any chance for peace in the near future .
very simply , mainly because it proved that this government is another pyromaniac government .

dealing with the golan question many european observers believe that syria has no interest in a new escalation in the region .
while the country was considered part of the " axis of evil " by former us president george w. bush , today , syria 's leader is essentially courted by western politicians .
indeed , syria has a number of interests that speak in favor of taking the path of peace and working together with western leaders .
syria wants to reform its ailing economy and needs to shed itself of american sanctions in order to do it .
above all , syria wants to get back the golan heights , which it lost to israel in 1967 , and which israel later annexed .
for the government , the return of the golan is a question of prestige .
" no syrian politician can give up on the golan .
the golan is part of syria , " explains samir al-aita , editor-in-chief of the arabic edition of le monde diplomatique .
delicate balance of influences german middle-east expert volker perthes believes it is possible to remove syria from its tight connections to iran , hamas and hezbollah .
the director of the german institute for international policy and security at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , says syria and hezbollah are allies out of necessity : syria needs hezbollah to keep up the credibility of its threats to israel , and hezbollah is using syria for financial and material support - including arms deliveries .
" that would all change if syria really signed a peace deal with israel and regained its occupied territory .
that is clear .
and beirut and the hezbollah know it .
the relationship of syria to hezbollah would change because they would no longer have the same strategic interests . "
but can al-assad take the risk - both in terms of domestic and foreign policy - of renouncing its allegiance to hamas , hezbollah and iran , in order to reclaim the golan and have better relations to the west ?
failed peace attempts thus far attempts to make that happen have failed up to the present .
us secretary of state hillary clinton became aware of that last february , when she openly asked al-assad to reconsider his tight strategic links to iran .
he replied that syria knew its own history , and said the middle east could take care of its own business , thank you .
at the end of the day , the question of whether syria is a key to peace or a stumbling block on the road there , is an open one .

dealing with the golan question many european observers believe that syria has no interest in a new escalation in the region .
while the country was considered part of the " axis of evil " by former us president george w. bush , today , syria 's leader is essentially courted by western politicians .

syria wants to reform its ailing economy and needs to shed itself of american sanctions in order to do it .
above all , syria wants to get back the golan heights , which it lost to israel in 1967 , and which israel later annexed .
for the government , the return of the golan is a question of prestige .

" that would all change if syria really signed a peace deal with israel and regained its occupied territory .
that is clear .
and beirut and the hezbollah know it .
the relationship of syria to hezbollah would change because they would no longer have the same strategic interests . "
but can al-assad take the risk - both in terms of domestic and foreign policy - of renouncing its allegiance to hamas , hezbollah and iran , in order to reclaim the golan and have better relations to the west ?
failed peace attempts thus far attempts to make that happen have failed up to the present .
us secretary of state hillary clinton became aware of that last february , when she openly asked al-assad to reconsider his tight strategic links to iran .
he replied that syria knew its own history , and said the middle east could take care of its own business , thank you .

under his reign the syrian state media is on a strictly anti-israeli course : the disliked neighbor is portrayed as an ever-agressive , propoganda-crazy " zionist entity . "
in the streets of damascus , endless numbers of propaganda posters show al-assad side by side with hezbollah chief hassan nasrallah , or iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
and the leadership of hamas lives in the syrian metropolis - along with a few other radical palestinian organizations .
at the same time , al-assad has repeatedly sent signals that show an interest in peace in the region , and on improved relations with western countries .
in that way , he is different from his partners in iran , hamas or hezbollah , which loudly agitate for the destruction of israel .
attempts at indirect peace talks when al-assad criticizes israel , he tends to do so from the standpoint of a peace-loving politician who , sadly , does n't find the same attitude in his opponent .
speaking to the bbc in mid-june after the israeli marine 's deadly attack on the gaza flotilla , al-assad said : " the attack destroyed any chance for peace in the near future .
very simply , mainly because it proved that this government is another pyromaniac government .
you can not achieve peace with such a government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hafiz al assad , left , was pictured on election posters with his son .
al-assad himself has tried it , though .
like his father before him , he agreed to indirect peace talks with israel .
turkey mediated at first , but they have been on hold since the gaza war in 2008 .
another round seems unlikely in the near future - especially in light of the currently poor relations between turkey and israel .
critics say there is more likely to be new war in the region than peace anytime soon .
dealing with the golan question many european observers believe that syria has no interest in a new escalation in the region .
while the country was considered part of the " axis of evil " by former us president george w. bush , today , syria 's leader is essentially courted by western politicians .
indeed , syria has a number of interests that speak in favor of taking the path of peace and working together with western leaders .
syria wants to reform its ailing economy and needs to shed itself of american sanctions in order to do it .
above all , syria wants to get back the golan heights , which it lost to israel in 1967 , and which israel later annexed .
for the government , the return of the golan is a question of prestige .
" no syrian politician can give up on the golan .
the golan is part of syria , " explains samir al-aita , editor-in-chief of the arabic edition of le monde diplomatique .
delicate balance of influences german middle-east expert volker perthes believes it is possible to remove syria from its tight connections to iran , hamas and hezbollah .
the director of the german institute for international policy and security at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , says syria and hezbollah are allies out of necessity : syria needs hezbollah to keep up the credibility of its threats to israel , and hezbollah is using syria for financial and material support - including arms deliveries .
" that would all change if syria really signed a peace deal with israel and regained its occupied territory .
that is clear .
and beirut and the hezbollah know it .
the relationship of syria to hezbollah would change because they would no longer have the same strategic interests . "
but can al-assad take the risk - both in terms of domestic and foreign policy - of renouncing its allegiance to hamas , hezbollah and iran , in order to reclaim the golan and have better relations to the west ?
failed peace attempts thus far attempts to make that happen have failed up to the present .
us secretary of state hillary clinton became aware of that last february , when she openly asked al-assad to reconsider his tight strategic links to iran .
he replied that syria knew its own history , and said the middle east could take care of its own business , thank you .
at the end of the day , the question of whether syria is a key to peace or a stumbling block on the road there , is an open one .
and bashar al-assad seems bent on keeping it that way .

but a citizens ' initiative stands in the government 's way . twenty-five girls and boys stand in a semicircle in their classroom and sing a song in latin .
the kids are fourth-graders at the grumbrecht street primary school in the hamburg suburb of heimfeld .
the school 's headmaster , rainer kuehlke , said the singing exercise is part of grumbrecht street 's so-called language carousel , a program that sees the young students learning latin , spanish , french and english one after the other for nine weeks at a time .
the carousel course is designed to make it easier for the children to select one foreign language to learn in fifth grade , if they are selected for what the german system calls a gymnasium , or academic high school .
germany has a three-tier education system where children are sent to separate institutions after primary school .
the weak students go to a hauptschule , those opting for higher vocational training to a realschule and future academics to a gymnasium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : primary school students would stay together for an extra two years in germany education policy is not centralized , but rather left to the governments of all 16 federal states to decide on - and this has led to a lot of variety across the country .
in the city-state of hamburg , children go to primary school for four years until the age of 10 and are then separated according to their abilities - a move that shapes their lives .
education experts say this is too early - they argue that two more years of learning together would help the weaker students improve their chances for the future .
this notion is at the heart of government proposals to reform hamburg 's education system that would see students spend an extra two years at primary school .
the reforms would also see the different types of grammar schools boiled down to just two - the gymnasium and a so-called neighborhood school .
parents would also no longer be allowed to select which of these schools their child attended .
this decision would be made by teachers on the basis of merit and ability .
divisive plans the city 's trade unions and chambers of commerce , as well as numerous migrant associations , have spoken out in favor of extending primary school learning , arguing that the current system discriminates against children with working-class and migrant backgrounds .

in hamburg , every second child has some kind of a migrant background , and their families often belong to the disadvantaged in german society .
many have a working class background and their parents ' german skills are lacking , so it is these boys and girls who are left behind in the current system .

" even with the same level of achievement , children from working-class families have a smaller chance of making it to gymnasium than the child of university-educated parents , " he says .
lowering the bar ?
but the plan has been bitterly opposed by school groups and many parents ' groups , who are planning a referendum on the issue for this sunday - it 's outcome , political observers say , could make or break the ruling coalition .
the city 's gymnasium schools are especially concerned about the effect the proposed changes could have on the quality of education .

but a citizens ' initiative stands in the government 's way . twenty-five girls and boys stand in a semicircle in their classroom and sing a song in latin .
the kids are fourth-graders at the grumbrecht street primary school in the hamburg suburb of heimfeld .
the school 's headmaster , rainer kuehlke , said the singing exercise is part of grumbrecht street 's so-called language carousel , a program that sees the young students learning latin , spanish , french and english one after the other for nine weeks at a time .
the carousel course is designed to make it easier for the children to select one foreign language to learn in fifth grade , if they are selected for what the german system calls a gymnasium , or academic high school .
germany has a three-tier education system where children are sent to separate institutions after primary school .
the weak students go to a hauptschule , those opting for higher vocational training to a realschule and future academics to a gymnasium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : primary school students would stay together for an extra two years in germany education policy is not centralized , but rather left to the governments of all 16 federal states to decide on - and this has led to a lot of variety across the country .
in the city-state of hamburg , children go to primary school for four years until the age of 10 and are then separated according to their abilities - a move that shapes their lives .
education experts say this is too early - they argue that two more years of learning together would help the weaker students improve their chances for the future .
this notion is at the heart of government proposals to reform hamburg 's education system that would see students spend an extra two years at primary school .
the reforms would also see the different types of grammar schools boiled down to just two - the gymnasium and a so-called neighborhood school .
parents would also no longer be allowed to select which of these schools their child attended .
this decision would be made by teachers on the basis of merit and ability .
divisive plans the city 's trade unions and chambers of commerce , as well as numerous migrant associations , have spoken out in favor of extending primary school learning , arguing that the current system discriminates against children with working-class and migrant backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all students would have the chance to take a university entrance exam " in my home country it 's natural to go to primary school for six years , and if i had not been able to do that , i would surely not have made it to the level where i can pursue an academic career here in germany , " said native greek panis drossinakis .
in hamburg , every second child has some kind of a migrant background , and their families often belong to the disadvantaged in german society .
many have a working class background and their parents ' german skills are lacking , so it is these boys and girls who are left behind in the current system .
pedagogical scientist johannes bastian said success in the german school system depends too much on family background .
" even with the same level of achievement , children from working-class families have a smaller chance of making it to gymnasium than the child of university-educated parents , " he says .
lowering the bar ?
but the plan has been bitterly opposed by school groups and many parents ' groups , who are planning a referendum on the issue for this sunday - it 's outcome , political observers say , could make or break the ruling coalition .
the city 's gymnasium schools are especially concerned about the effect the proposed changes could have on the quality of education .
they fear their specialist profiles would be trimmed if the government gets it way , and that students would receive a lesser education because they would have less time to study their desired field , be it music , the humanities or the arts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christa goetsch is trying to push the reforms through many of hamburg 's headmasters and parents accuse the city 's schools minister , christa goetsch of the greens , of lowering educational standards .
they say they ca n't understand how there could be no exception made for schools and educational methods they say have been time-proven .
media lawyer walter scheuerl heads an initiative he founded two years ago called we want to learn .
in november last year , the initiative organized a petition against the government 's education reforms , and within only a few weeks had gathered some 180,000 signatures against the changes , enough to force sunday 's referendum .
this pushed the city 's government - a coalition of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the hamburg greens party - into weeks of debate over a possible compromise to avert the public vote .
the coalition was unable to reach that compromise .
many schools around hamburg have already begun adapting to the changes espoused by the city government , but if hamburgers vote against the reforms on sunday then it will have all been in vain .

" considering the 13 million people who were brought to germany as forced workers , you have to recognize that forced labor was a european occurrence , " saathoff told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saathoff said all of europe should remember nazi forced labor " it must be a permanently anchored and fundamental element of the history of wrongdoing in a european culture of remembrance , " he added . the ezb has holdings of about 400 million euros , which it has used to fund over 2,100 projects , including a program called " europeans for peace .

one such project in eastern europe encourages dialogue about the once-taboo topic of forced labor .
the dialogues initiated by the program give long-needed acknowledgement to the " other " victims of nazism , according to saathoff . " under stalin many returning forced laborers were seen as traitors to the fatherland , " saathoff said , adding that many of them lived as pariahs within their societies . " this project attempts to give those people a voice again in their communities , and we also want to encourage the communities to give the victims their attention , so intergenerational dialog and local initiatives are at the center of our efforts , " he said . jewish museum exhibition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many forced laborers became pariahs once they returned to their home countries berlin 's jewish museum is set to host a large exhibition on nazi-era forced labor beginning this september with the evz 's financial support . one of the exhibition planners , jens-christian wagner , explained that the exhibition will show " when and how germans had to decide what position to take on forced labor . " wagner , who is also the director of the dora-mittelbau concentration camp memorial , added that the exhibition will " use the frame of forced labor to tell the social history of nazism , the history of a social order that was ideologically anchored in extreme racism . " he said the exhibition is not simply a " commission " by the evz but will critically examine both at forced labor and at compensation paid to victims by the evz . to that end , wagner said the exhibition will also " consider the italian military detainee or the soviet prisoner of war , who were denied compensation and humanitarian aid , but who , of course - in the eyes of historians - were also forced workers . " an injury to justice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jewish museum exhibition looks at forced labor and victims ' compensation wagner said it would have been impossible to make the distribution of compensation absolutely fair .
he said this " injury to justice " is yet another result of germany 's coming to terms with nazi forced labor . the exhibition will move to warsaw in 2011 , with further stations planned in russia to mark the 70th anniversary of germany 's 1941 attack on the soviet union . author : marcel fürstenau -lrb- dl -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 17.07.2010 hamburg remains divided ahead of education referendum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proponents of the reform say it will help the disadvantaged the german city of hamburg is gearing up for a referendum on a controversial reform to education that could see primary school extended from four years to six .
but a citizens ' initiative stands in the government 's way . twenty-five girls and boys stand in a semicircle in their classroom and sing a song in latin .
the kids are fourth-graders at the grumbrecht street primary school in the hamburg suburb of heimfeld .
the school 's headmaster , rainer kuehlke , said the singing exercise is part of grumbrecht street 's so-called language carousel , a program that sees the young students learning latin , spanish , french and english one after the other for nine weeks at a time .
the carousel course is designed to make it easier for the children to select one foreign language to learn in fifth grade , if they are selected for what the german system calls a gymnasium , or academic high school .
germany has a three-tier education system where children are sent to separate institutions after primary school .
the weak students go to a hauptschule , those opting for higher vocational training to a realschule and future academics to a gymnasium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : primary school students would stay together for an extra two years in germany education policy is not centralized , but rather left to the governments of all 16 federal states to decide on - and this has led to a lot of variety across the country .
in the city-state of hamburg , children go to primary school for four years until the age of 10 and are then separated according to their abilities - a move that shapes their lives .
education experts say this is too early - they argue that two more years of learning together would help the weaker students improve their chances for the future .
this notion is at the heart of government proposals to reform hamburg 's education system that would see students spend an extra two years at primary school .
the reforms would also see the different types of grammar schools boiled down to just two - the gymnasium and a so-called neighborhood school .
parents would also no longer be allowed to select which of these schools their child attended .
this decision would be made by teachers on the basis of merit and ability .
divisive plans the city 's trade unions and chambers of commerce , as well as numerous migrant associations , have spoken out in favor of extending primary school learning , arguing that the current system discriminates against children with working-class and migrant backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all students would have the chance to take a university entrance exam " in my home country it 's natural to go to primary school for six years , and if i had not been able to do that , i would surely not have made it to the level where i can pursue an academic career here in germany , " said native greek panis drossinakis .
in hamburg , every second child has some kind of a migrant background , and their families often belong to the disadvantaged in german society .
many have a working class background and their parents ' german skills are lacking , so it is these boys and girls who are left behind in the current system .
pedagogical scientist johannes bastian said success in the german school system depends too much on family background .
" even with the same level of achievement , children from working-class families have a smaller chance of making it to gymnasium than the child of university-educated parents , " he says .
lowering the bar ?
but the plan has been bitterly opposed by school groups and many parents ' groups , who are planning a referendum on the issue for this sunday - it 's outcome , political observers say , could make or break the ruling coalition .
the city 's gymnasium schools are especially concerned about the effect the proposed changes could have on the quality of education .
they fear their specialist profiles would be trimmed if the government gets it way , and that students would receive a lesser education because they would have less time to study their desired field , be it music , the humanities or the arts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christa goetsch is trying to push the reforms through many of hamburg 's headmasters and parents accuse the city 's schools minister , christa goetsch of the greens , of lowering educational standards .
they say they ca n't understand how there could be no exception made for schools and educational methods they say have been time-proven .
media lawyer walter scheuerl heads an initiative he founded two years ago called we want to learn .
in november last year , the initiative organized a petition against the government 's education reforms , and within only a few weeks had gathered some 180,000 signatures against the changes , enough to force sunday 's referendum .
this pushed the city 's government - a coalition of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the hamburg greens party - into weeks of debate over a possible compromise to avert the public vote .
the coalition was unable to reach that compromise .
many schools around hamburg have already begun adapting to the changes espoused by the city government , but if hamburgers vote against the reforms on sunday then it will have all been in vain .

what role has his leadership played in the troubled search for peace in the middle east ? generations of middle east experts have asked themselves the same question : is syria the key to peace in the middle east , or is it a stumbling block ?
both possibilities are closely linked .
through its relations with iran , the hezbollah militia in lebanon , and radical hamas in gaza , the regime in damascus has enormous potential to influence the situation there - both for the positive and for the negative .
anti-israel , but open to the west president bashar al-assad shows a similar flexibility as his father , whose job he inherited on july 17 , 2000 .
under his reign the syrian state media is on a strictly anti-israeli course : the disliked neighbor is portrayed as an ever-agressive , propoganda-crazy " zionist entity . "
in the streets of damascus , endless numbers of propaganda posters show al-assad side by side with hezbollah chief hassan nasrallah , or iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
and the leadership of hamas lives in the syrian metropolis - along with a few other radical palestinian organizations .
at the same time , al-assad has repeatedly sent signals that show an interest in peace in the region , and on improved relations with western countries .
in that way , he is different from his partners in iran , hamas or hezbollah , which loudly agitate for the destruction of israel .
attempts at indirect peace talks when al-assad criticizes israel , he tends to do so from the standpoint of a peace-loving politician who , sadly , does n't find the same attitude in his opponent .
speaking to the bbc in mid-june after the israeli marine 's deadly attack on the gaza flotilla , al-assad said : " the attack destroyed any chance for peace in the near future .
very simply , mainly because it proved that this government is another pyromaniac government .
you can not achieve peace with such a government . "

al-assad himself has tried it , though .
like his father before him , he agreed to indirect peace talks with israel .
turkey mediated at first , but they have been on hold since the gaza war in 2008 .
another round seems unlikely in the near future - especially in light of the currently poor relations between turkey and israel .
critics say there is more likely to be new war in the region than peace anytime soon .
dealing with the golan question many european observers believe that syria has no interest in a new escalation in the region .
while the country was considered part of the " axis of evil " by former us president george w. bush , today , syria 's leader is essentially courted by western politicians .
indeed , syria has a number of interests that speak in favor of taking the path of peace and working together with western leaders .
syria wants to reform its ailing economy and needs to shed itself of american sanctions in order to do it .
above all , syria wants to get back the golan heights , which it lost to israel in 1967 , and which israel later annexed .
for the government , the return of the golan is a question of prestige .
" no syrian politician can give up on the golan .
the golan is part of syria , " explains samir al-aita , editor-in-chief of the arabic edition of le monde diplomatique .
delicate balance of influences german middle-east expert volker perthes believes it is possible to remove syria from its tight connections to iran , hamas and hezbollah .
the director of the german institute for international policy and security at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , says syria and hezbollah are allies out of necessity : syria needs hezbollah to keep up the credibility of its threats to israel , and hezbollah is using syria for financial and material support - including arms deliveries .
" that would all change if syria really signed a peace deal with israel and regained its occupied territory .
that is clear .
and beirut and the hezbollah know it .
the relationship of syria to hezbollah would change because they would no longer have the same strategic interests . "
but can al-assad take the risk - both in terms of domestic and foreign policy - of renouncing its allegiance to hamas , hezbollah and iran , in order to reclaim the golan and have better relations to the west ?
failed peace attempts thus far attempts to make that happen have failed up to the present .
us secretary of state hillary clinton became aware of that last february , when she openly asked al-assad to reconsider his tight strategic links to iran .
he replied that syria knew its own history , and said the middle east could take care of its own business , thank you .
at the end of the day , the question of whether syria is a key to peace or a stumbling block on the road there , is an open one .
and bashar al-assad seems bent on keeping it that way .

what role has his leadership played in the troubled search for peace in the middle east ? generations of middle east experts have asked themselves the same question : is syria the key to peace in the middle east , or is it a stumbling block ?
both possibilities are closely linked .
through its relations with iran , the hezbollah militia in lebanon , and radical hamas in gaza , the regime in damascus has enormous potential to influence the situation there - both for the positive and for the negative .
anti-israel , but open to the west president bashar al-assad shows a similar flexibility as his father , whose job he inherited on july 17 , 2000 .
under his reign the syrian state media is on a strictly anti-israeli course : the disliked neighbor is portrayed as an ever-agressive , propoganda-crazy " zionist entity . "
in the streets of damascus , endless numbers of propaganda posters show al-assad side by side with hezbollah chief hassan nasrallah , or iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
and the leadership of hamas lives in the syrian metropolis - along with a few other radical palestinian organizations .
at the same time , al-assad has repeatedly sent signals that show an interest in peace in the region , and on improved relations with western countries .
in that way , he is different from his partners in iran , hamas or hezbollah , which loudly agitate for the destruction of israel .
attempts at indirect peace talks when al-assad criticizes israel , he tends to do so from the standpoint of a peace-loving politician who , sadly , does n't find the same attitude in his opponent .
speaking to the bbc in mid-june after the israeli marine 's deadly attack on the gaza flotilla , al-assad said : " the attack destroyed any chance for peace in the near future .
very simply , mainly because it proved that this government is another pyromaniac government .
you can not achieve peace with such a government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hafiz al assad , left , was pictured on election posters with his son .
al-assad himself has tried it , though .
like his father before him , he agreed to indirect peace talks with israel .
turkey mediated at first , but they have been on hold since the gaza war in 2008 .
another round seems unlikely in the near future - especially in light of the currently poor relations between turkey and israel .
critics say there is more likely to be new war in the region than peace anytime soon .
dealing with the golan question many european observers believe that syria has no interest in a new escalation in the region .
while the country was considered part of the " axis of evil " by former us president george w. bush , today , syria 's leader is essentially courted by western politicians .
indeed , syria has a number of interests that speak in favor of taking the path of peace and working together with western leaders .
syria wants to reform its ailing economy and needs to shed itself of american sanctions in order to do it .
above all , syria wants to get back the golan heights , which it lost to israel in 1967 , and which israel later annexed .
for the government , the return of the golan is a question of prestige .
" no syrian politician can give up on the golan .
the golan is part of syria , " explains samir al-aita , editor-in-chief of the arabic edition of le monde diplomatique .
delicate balance of influences german middle-east expert volker perthes believes it is possible to remove syria from its tight connections to iran , hamas and hezbollah .
the director of the german institute for international policy and security at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , says syria and hezbollah are allies out of necessity : syria needs hezbollah to keep up the credibility of its threats to israel , and hezbollah is using syria for financial and material support - including arms deliveries .
" that would all change if syria really signed a peace deal with israel and regained its occupied territory .
that is clear .
and beirut and the hezbollah know it .
the relationship of syria to hezbollah would change because they would no longer have the same strategic interests . "
but can al-assad take the risk - both in terms of domestic and foreign policy - of renouncing its allegiance to hamas , hezbollah and iran , in order to reclaim the golan and have better relations to the west ?
failed peace attempts thus far attempts to make that happen have failed up to the present .
us secretary of state hillary clinton became aware of that last february , when she openly asked al-assad to reconsider his tight strategic links to iran .
he replied that syria knew its own history , and said the middle east could take care of its own business , thank you .
at the end of the day , the question of whether syria is a key to peace or a stumbling block on the road there , is an open one .
and bashar al-assad seems bent on keeping it that way .

some experts say that makes life tough for students . german students do n't tend to be at the front of the class when it comes to international rankings .
awards for best schools , best reading competence or mathematical ability are usually given to other countries ' education systems . but germany does have the distinction of one record : it 's the country with the most education systems .
each of germany 's 16 states has its own system . that 's a big disadvantage for students switching to a new school in a different state , according to rita nikolai , an education researcher from the social science research center in berlin .

previously , students took placement tests to determine if they were placed in a college-preparatory school or a vocational school . saarland has just decided to extend the time students spend in primary school from four to five years , while most of the other states are debating between four or six years . in hamburg , another german city that doubles as its own state , voters are heading to the polls sunday to decide on whether to continue tracking students when they reach fifth grade or to keep all students in the same primary school classes until the end of sixth grade . the autonomy of the states has grown since 2006 , when the federal and state governments agreed on a new division of responsibilities - a decision that favored giving the states more discretion in deciding their education policy .
while there have always been differences in each state , there is no longer anyone to arbitrate among the states , according to nikolai . " since the reforms the problem is that the federal government can no longer take control of the wheel , " she said .

previously , students took placement tests to determine if they were placed in a college-preparatory school or a vocational school . saarland has just decided to extend the time students spend in primary school from four to five years , while most of the other states are debating between four or six years . in hamburg , another german city that doubles as its own state , voters are heading to the polls sunday to decide on whether to continue tracking students when they reach fifth grade or to keep all students in the same primary school classes until the end of sixth grade . the autonomy of the states has grown since 2006 , when the federal and state governments agreed on a new division of responsibilities - a decision that favored giving the states more discretion in deciding their education policy .
while there have always been differences in each state , there is no longer anyone to arbitrate among the states , according to nikolai . " since the reforms the problem is that the federal government can no longer take control of the wheel , " she said .
" federal programs for preschool programs can no longer be coordinated from berlin alone . " ' education should have gone to the federal government ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matschie thinks education should be left to the federal government common education standards , the recognition of high school diplomas from other states and similar questions are debated between the states at the conference of german cultural ministers .
the 16 state ministers have to find a consensus on all questions that come up . " with education policies , it is urgently necessary that we ensure kids have the same educational standards whether they go to school in berlin , hamburg , or erfurt , " said christoph matschie , education minister in thuringia . he is one of the few state ministers who does n't support the idea of giving states the upper hand when it comes to education .

it is spain 's internal politics , " rwandan foreign minister louise mushikiwabo told reporters on the sidelines of the gathering .
" we would like the spanish people to get to know rwanda 's president kagame better .
he is not what we see him portrayed as . "
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos took zapatero 's place at the meeting , also attended by un secretary-general ban ki-moon who met zapatero separately .
ban " expressed his concerns " that the recent murder of opposition official andre kagwa rwisereka and journalist jean leonard rugambage has " caused political tensions " in rwanda ahead of august 9 presidential elections , his spokeswoman said .
the venue for the meeting was moved from the seat of government , moncloa palace , to a hotel .

thousands of people marched through warsaw - thousands also opposed the event . the landmark gay rights rally in the polish capital was the first europride parade ever to take place behind the cold war iron curtain . the event was small by its own standards , with police estimating about 8,000 people took part this year , as opposed to 50,000 at last year 's march in zurich and more than a million in madrid three years ago . nevertheless , politicians from countries like great britain , sweden and germany also plan to take part in the rally , which will focus on a call for legal recognition of same-sex partnerships .
polish officials , however , are not expected at the rally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer people participated in the warsaw march than in other years and cities despite marching with banners calling for new civil partnership laws , participants at the parade admitted that the legal situation for homosexuals in poland was unlikely to change .

so far over 100,000 young people from 28 countries have participated in the program aimed to help victims of anti-semitism and right-wing extremism . labeled traitors to the fatherland still of particular importance to the foundation are projects that support former forced laborers and their families through local initiatives .
one such project in eastern europe encourages dialogue about the once-taboo topic of forced labor .
the dialogues initiated by the program give long-needed acknowledgement to the " other " victims of nazism , according to saathoff . " under stalin many returning forced laborers were seen as traitors to the fatherland , " saathoff said , adding that many of them lived as pariahs within their societies . " this project attempts to give those people a voice again in their communities , and we also want to encourage the communities to give the victims their attention , so intergenerational dialog and local initiatives are at the center of our efforts , " he said . jewish museum exhibition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many forced laborers became pariahs once they returned to their home countries berlin 's jewish museum is set to host a large exhibition on nazi-era forced labor beginning this september with the evz 's financial support . one of the exhibition planners , jens-christian wagner , explained that the exhibition will show " when and how germans had to decide what position to take on forced labor . " wagner , who is also the director of the dora-mittelbau concentration camp memorial , added that the exhibition will " use the frame of forced labor to tell the social history of nazism , the history of a social order that was ideologically anchored in extreme racism . " he said the exhibition is not simply a " commission " by the evz but will critically examine both at forced labor and at compensation paid to victims by the evz . to that end , wagner said the exhibition will also " consider the italian military detainee or the soviet prisoner of war , who were denied compensation and humanitarian aid , but who , of course - in the eyes of historians - were also forced workers . " an injury to justice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jewish museum exhibition looks at forced labor and victims ' compensation wagner said it would have been impossible to make the distribution of compensation absolutely fair .
he said this " injury to justice " is yet another result of germany 's coming to terms with nazi forced labor . the exhibition will move to warsaw in 2011 , with further stations planned in russia to mark the 70th anniversary of germany 's 1941 attack on the soviet union . author : marcel fürstenau -lrb- dl -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" considering the 13 million people who were brought to germany as forced workers , you have to recognize that forced labor was a european occurrence , " saathoff told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saathoff said all of europe should remember nazi forced labor " it must be a permanently anchored and fundamental element of the history of wrongdoing in a european culture of remembrance , " he added . the ezb has holdings of about 400 million euros , which it has used to fund over 2,100 projects , including a program called " europeans for peace .

one such project in eastern europe encourages dialogue about the once-taboo topic of forced labor .
the dialogues initiated by the program give long-needed acknowledgement to the " other " victims of nazism , according to saathoff . " under stalin many returning forced laborers were seen as traitors to the fatherland , " saathoff said , adding that many of them lived as pariahs within their societies . " this project attempts to give those people a voice again in their communities , and we also want to encourage the communities to give the victims their attention , so intergenerational dialog and local initiatives are at the center of our efforts , " he said . jewish museum exhibition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many forced laborers became pariahs once they returned to their home countries berlin 's jewish museum is set to host a large exhibition on nazi-era forced labor beginning this september with the evz 's financial support . one of the exhibition planners , jens-christian wagner , explained that the exhibition will show " when and how germans had to decide what position to take on forced labor . " wagner , who is also the director of the dora-mittelbau concentration camp memorial , added that the exhibition will " use the frame of forced labor to tell the social history of nazism , the history of a social order that was ideologically anchored in extreme racism . " he said the exhibition is not simply a " commission " by the evz but will critically examine both at forced labor and at compensation paid to victims by the evz . to that end , wagner said the exhibition will also " consider the italian military detainee or the soviet prisoner of war , who were denied compensation and humanitarian aid , but who , of course - in the eyes of historians - were also forced workers . " an injury to justice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jewish museum exhibition looks at forced labor and victims ' compensation wagner said it would have been impossible to make the distribution of compensation absolutely fair .
he said this " injury to justice " is yet another result of germany 's coming to terms with nazi forced labor . the exhibition will move to warsaw in 2011 , with further stations planned in russia to mark the 70th anniversary of germany 's 1941 attack on the soviet union . author : marcel fürstenau -lrb- dl -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" considering the 13 million people who were brought to germany as forced workers , you have to recognize that forced labor was a european occurrence , " saathoff told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saathoff said all of europe should remember nazi forced labor " it must be a permanently anchored and fundamental element of the history of wrongdoing in a european culture of remembrance , " he added . the ezb has holdings of about 400 million euros , which it has used to fund over 2,100 projects , including a program called " europeans for peace .

the dialogues initiated by the program give long-needed acknowledgement to the " other " victims of nazism , according to saathoff . " under stalin many returning forced laborers were seen as traitors to the fatherland , " saathoff said , adding that many of them lived as pariahs within their societies .

" wagner , who is also the director of the dora-mittelbau concentration camp memorial , added that the exhibition will " use the frame of forced labor to tell the social history of nazism , the history of a social order that was ideologically anchored in extreme racism . " he said the exhibition is not simply a " commission " by the evz but will critically examine both at forced labor and at compensation paid to victims by the evz . to that end , wagner said the exhibition will also " consider the italian military detainee or the soviet prisoner of war , who were denied compensation and humanitarian aid , but who , of course - in the eyes of historians - were also forced workers . " an injury to justice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jewish museum exhibition looks at forced labor and victims ' compensation wagner said it would have been impossible to make the distribution of compensation absolutely fair .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 17.07.2010 ten years on , syrian leader keeps his options open großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : propagandistic iconography featuring al assad is the norm in damascus ten years ago , syrian president bashar al-assad was named to replace his deceased father .
what role has his leadership played in the troubled search for peace in the middle east ? generations of middle east experts have asked themselves the same question : is syria the key to peace in the middle east , or is it a stumbling block ?
both possibilities are closely linked .
through its relations with iran , the hezbollah militia in lebanon , and radical hamas in gaza , the regime in damascus has enormous potential to influence the situation there - both for the positive and for the negative .
anti-israel , but open to the west president bashar al-assad shows a similar flexibility as his father , whose job he inherited on july 17 , 2000 .
under his reign the syrian state media is on a strictly anti-israeli course : the disliked neighbor is portrayed as an ever-agressive , propoganda-crazy " zionist entity . "
in the streets of damascus , endless numbers of propaganda posters show al-assad side by side with hezbollah chief hassan nasrallah , or iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
and the leadership of hamas lives in the syrian metropolis - along with a few other radical palestinian organizations .
at the same time , al-assad has repeatedly sent signals that show an interest in peace in the region , and on improved relations with western countries .
in that way , he is different from his partners in iran , hamas or hezbollah , which loudly agitate for the destruction of israel .
attempts at indirect peace talks when al-assad criticizes israel , he tends to do so from the standpoint of a peace-loving politician who , sadly , does n't find the same attitude in his opponent .
speaking to the bbc in mid-june after the israeli marine 's deadly attack on the gaza flotilla , al-assad said : " the attack destroyed any chance for peace in the near future .
very simply , mainly because it proved that this government is another pyromaniac government .
you can not achieve peace with such a government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hafiz al assad , left , was pictured on election posters with his son .
al-assad himself has tried it , though .
like his father before him , he agreed to indirect peace talks with israel .
turkey mediated at first , but they have been on hold since the gaza war in 2008 .
another round seems unlikely in the near future - especially in light of the currently poor relations between turkey and israel .
critics say there is more likely to be new war in the region than peace anytime soon .
dealing with the golan question many european observers believe that syria has no interest in a new escalation in the region .
while the country was considered part of the " axis of evil " by former us president george w. bush , today , syria 's leader is essentially courted by western politicians .
indeed , syria has a number of interests that speak in favor of taking the path of peace and working together with western leaders .
syria wants to reform its ailing economy and needs to shed itself of american sanctions in order to do it .
above all , syria wants to get back the golan heights , which it lost to israel in 1967 , and which israel later annexed .
for the government , the return of the golan is a question of prestige .
" no syrian politician can give up on the golan .
the golan is part of syria , " explains samir al-aita , editor-in-chief of the arabic edition of le monde diplomatique .
delicate balance of influences german middle-east expert volker perthes believes it is possible to remove syria from its tight connections to iran , hamas and hezbollah .
the director of the german institute for international policy and security at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , says syria and hezbollah are allies out of necessity : syria needs hezbollah to keep up the credibility of its threats to israel , and hezbollah is using syria for financial and material support - including arms deliveries .
" that would all change if syria really signed a peace deal with israel and regained its occupied territory .
that is clear .
and beirut and the hezbollah know it .
the relationship of syria to hezbollah would change because they would no longer have the same strategic interests . "
but can al-assad take the risk - both in terms of domestic and foreign policy - of renouncing its allegiance to hamas , hezbollah and iran , in order to reclaim the golan and have better relations to the west ?
failed peace attempts thus far attempts to make that happen have failed up to the present .
us secretary of state hillary clinton became aware of that last february , when she openly asked al-assad to reconsider his tight strategic links to iran .
he replied that syria knew its own history , and said the middle east could take care of its own business , thank you .
at the end of the day , the question of whether syria is a key to peace or a stumbling block on the road there , is an open one .
and bashar al-assad seems bent on keeping it that way .

some experts say that makes life tough for students . german students do n't tend to be at the front of the class when it comes to international rankings .
awards for best schools , best reading competence or mathematical ability are usually given to other countries ' education systems . but germany does have the distinction of one record : it 's the country with the most education systems .
each of germany 's 16 states has its own system . that 's a big disadvantage for students switching to a new school in a different state , according to rita nikolai , an education researcher from the social science research center in berlin . " the danger that kids will have to step down a level in school or get held back exists , " nikolai said .
" between the states , there are significant differences in the curriculum . " take the state of hesse .
it offers students foreign language instruction in sixth grade .
in most other states , foreign language classes begin a year later .
that put students moving to hesse after completing the sixth grade a year behind their cohorts when it comes to foreign languages .
in hesse , it is then up to individual schools to decide if the student needs to repeat sixth grade or find another solution . hands tied at national level bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : different states have different education standards examples like this are everywhere in the german education system , and the confusion may become worse .
many states are planning sweeping education reforms in the next few years . when students return from summer holidays in berlin , which is one of germany 's states as well as the capital city , they 'll find that all forms of secondary education will be offered in a single school .
previously , students took placement tests to determine if they were placed in a college-preparatory school or a vocational school . saarland has just decided to extend the time students spend in primary school from four to five years , while most of the other states are debating between four or six years . in hamburg , another german city that doubles as its own state , voters are heading to the polls sunday to decide on whether to continue tracking students when they reach fifth grade or to keep all students in the same primary school classes until the end of sixth grade . the autonomy of the states has grown since 2006 , when the federal and state governments agreed on a new division of responsibilities - a decision that favored giving the states more discretion in deciding their education policy .
while there have always been differences in each state , there is no longer anyone to arbitrate among the states , according to nikolai . " since the reforms the problem is that the federal government can no longer take control of the wheel , " she said .
" federal programs for preschool programs can no longer be coordinated from berlin alone . " ' education should have gone to the federal government ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matschie thinks education should be left to the federal government common education standards , the recognition of high school diplomas from other states and similar questions are debated between the states at the conference of german cultural ministers .
the 16 state ministers have to find a consensus on all questions that come up . " with education policies , it is urgently necessary that we ensure kids have the same educational standards whether they go to school in berlin , hamburg , or erfurt , " said christoph matschie , education minister in thuringia . he is one of the few state ministers who does n't support the idea of giving states the upper hand when it comes to education . " the responsibility of education should have gone to the federal government , " he said . author : mathias boelinger -lrb- mz -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a citizens ' initiative stands in the government 's way . twenty-five girls and boys stand in a semicircle in their classroom and sing a song in latin .
the kids are fourth-graders at the grumbrecht street primary school in the hamburg suburb of heimfeld .
the school 's headmaster , rainer kuehlke , said the singing exercise is part of grumbrecht street 's so-called language carousel , a program that sees the young students learning latin , spanish , french and english one after the other for nine weeks at a time .
the carousel course is designed to make it easier for the children to select one foreign language to learn in fifth grade , if they are selected for what the german system calls a gymnasium , or academic high school .
germany has a three-tier education system where children are sent to separate institutions after primary school .
the weak students go to a hauptschule , those opting for higher vocational training to a realschule and future academics to a gymnasium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : primary school students would stay together for an extra two years in germany education policy is not centralized , but rather left to the governments of all 16 federal states to decide on - and this has led to a lot of variety across the country .
in the city-state of hamburg , children go to primary school for four years until the age of 10 and are then separated according to their abilities - a move that shapes their lives .
education experts say this is too early - they argue that two more years of learning together would help the weaker students improve their chances for the future .
this notion is at the heart of government proposals to reform hamburg 's education system that would see students spend an extra two years at primary school .
the reforms would also see the different types of grammar schools boiled down to just two - the gymnasium and a so-called neighborhood school .
parents would also no longer be allowed to select which of these schools their child attended .
this decision would be made by teachers on the basis of merit and ability .
divisive plans the city 's trade unions and chambers of commerce , as well as numerous migrant associations , have spoken out in favor of extending primary school learning , arguing that the current system discriminates against children with working-class and migrant backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all students would have the chance to take a university entrance exam " in my home country it 's natural to go to primary school for six years , and if i had not been able to do that , i would surely not have made it to the level where i can pursue an academic career here in germany , " said native greek panis drossinakis .
in hamburg , every second child has some kind of a migrant background , and their families often belong to the disadvantaged in german society .
many have a working class background and their parents ' german skills are lacking , so it is these boys and girls who are left behind in the current system .
pedagogical scientist johannes bastian said success in the german school system depends too much on family background .
" even with the same level of achievement , children from working-class families have a smaller chance of making it to gymnasium than the child of university-educated parents , " he says .
lowering the bar ?
but the plan has been bitterly opposed by school groups and many parents ' groups , who are planning a referendum on the issue for this sunday - it 's outcome , political observers say , could make or break the ruling coalition .
the city 's gymnasium schools are especially concerned about the effect the proposed changes could have on the quality of education .
they fear their specialist profiles would be trimmed if the government gets it way , and that students would receive a lesser education because they would have less time to study their desired field , be it music , the humanities or the arts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christa goetsch is trying to push the reforms through many of hamburg 's headmasters and parents accuse the city 's schools minister , christa goetsch of the greens , of lowering educational standards .
they say they ca n't understand how there could be no exception made for schools and educational methods they say have been time-proven .
media lawyer walter scheuerl heads an initiative he founded two years ago called we want to learn .
in november last year , the initiative organized a petition against the government 's education reforms , and within only a few weeks had gathered some 180,000 signatures against the changes , enough to force sunday 's referendum .
this pushed the city 's government - a coalition of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the hamburg greens party - into weeks of debate over a possible compromise to avert the public vote .
the coalition was unable to reach that compromise .
many schools around hamburg have already begun adapting to the changes espoused by the city government , but if hamburgers vote against the reforms on sunday then it will have all been in vain .

but a citizens ' initiative stands in the government 's way . twenty-five girls and boys stand in a semicircle in their classroom and sing a song in latin .
the kids are fourth-graders at the grumbrecht street primary school in the hamburg suburb of heimfeld .
the school 's headmaster , rainer kuehlke , said the singing exercise is part of grumbrecht street 's so-called language carousel , a program that sees the young students learning latin , spanish , french and english one after the other for nine weeks at a time .
the carousel course is designed to make it easier for the children to select one foreign language to learn in fifth grade , if they are selected for what the german system calls a gymnasium , or academic high school .
germany has a three-tier education system where children are sent to separate institutions after primary school .
the weak students go to a hauptschule , those opting for higher vocational training to a realschule and future academics to a gymnasium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : primary school students would stay together for an extra two years in germany education policy is not centralized , but rather left to the governments of all 16 federal states to decide on - and this has led to a lot of variety across the country .
in the city-state of hamburg , children go to primary school for four years until the age of 10 and are then separated according to their abilities - a move that shapes their lives .
education experts say this is too early - they argue that two more years of learning together would help the weaker students improve their chances for the future .
this notion is at the heart of government proposals to reform hamburg 's education system that would see students spend an extra two years at primary school .
the reforms would also see the different types of grammar schools boiled down to just two - the gymnasium and a so-called neighborhood school .
parents would also no longer be allowed to select which of these schools their child attended .
this decision would be made by teachers on the basis of merit and ability .
divisive plans the city 's trade unions and chambers of commerce , as well as numerous migrant associations , have spoken out in favor of extending primary school learning , arguing that the current system discriminates against children with working-class and migrant backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all students would have the chance to take a university entrance exam " in my home country it 's natural to go to primary school for six years , and if i had not been able to do that , i would surely not have made it to the level where i can pursue an academic career here in germany , " said native greek panis drossinakis .
in hamburg , every second child has some kind of a migrant background , and their families often belong to the disadvantaged in german society .
many have a working class background and their parents ' german skills are lacking , so it is these boys and girls who are left behind in the current system .
pedagogical scientist johannes bastian said success in the german school system depends too much on family background .
" even with the same level of achievement , children from working-class families have a smaller chance of making it to gymnasium than the child of university-educated parents , " he says .
lowering the bar ?
but the plan has been bitterly opposed by school groups and many parents ' groups , who are planning a referendum on the issue for this sunday - it 's outcome , political observers say , could make or break the ruling coalition .
the city 's gymnasium schools are especially concerned about the effect the proposed changes could have on the quality of education .
they fear their specialist profiles would be trimmed if the government gets it way , and that students would receive a lesser education because they would have less time to study their desired field , be it music , the humanities or the arts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christa goetsch is trying to push the reforms through many of hamburg 's headmasters and parents accuse the city 's schools minister , christa goetsch of the greens , of lowering educational standards .
they say they ca n't understand how there could be no exception made for schools and educational methods they say have been time-proven .
media lawyer walter scheuerl heads an initiative he founded two years ago called we want to learn .
in november last year , the initiative organized a petition against the government 's education reforms , and within only a few weeks had gathered some 180,000 signatures against the changes , enough to force sunday 's referendum .
this pushed the city 's government - a coalition of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the hamburg greens party - into weeks of debate over a possible compromise to avert the public vote .
the coalition was unable to reach that compromise .
many schools around hamburg have already begun adapting to the changes espoused by the city government , but if hamburgers vote against the reforms on sunday then it will have all been in vain .

some experts say that makes life tough for students . german students do n't tend to be at the front of the class when it comes to international rankings .
awards for best schools , best reading competence or mathematical ability are usually given to other countries ' education systems . but germany does have the distinction of one record : it 's the country with the most education systems .
each of germany 's 16 states has its own system . that 's a big disadvantage for students switching to a new school in a different state , according to rita nikolai , an education researcher from the social science research center in berlin . " the danger that kids will have to step down a level in school or get held back exists , " nikolai said .
" between the states , there are significant differences in the curriculum . " take the state of hesse .
it offers students foreign language instruction in sixth grade .
in most other states , foreign language classes begin a year later .

what role has his leadership played in the troubled search for peace in the middle east ? generations of middle east experts have asked themselves the same question : is syria the key to peace in the middle east , or is it a stumbling block ?
both possibilities are closely linked .
through its relations with iran , the hezbollah militia in lebanon , and radical hamas in gaza , the regime in damascus has enormous potential to influence the situation there - both for the positive and for the negative .
anti-israel , but open to the west president bashar al-assad shows a similar flexibility as his father , whose job he inherited on july 17 , 2000 .
under his reign the syrian state media is on a strictly anti-israeli course : the disliked neighbor is portrayed as an ever-agressive , propoganda-crazy " zionist entity . "
in the streets of damascus , endless numbers of propaganda posters show al-assad side by side with hezbollah chief hassan nasrallah , or iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
and the leadership of hamas lives in the syrian metropolis - along with a few other radical palestinian organizations .
at the same time , al-assad has repeatedly sent signals that show an interest in peace in the region , and on improved relations with western countries .
in that way , he is different from his partners in iran , hamas or hezbollah , which loudly agitate for the destruction of israel .
attempts at indirect peace talks when al-assad criticizes israel , he tends to do so from the standpoint of a peace-loving politician who , sadly , does n't find the same attitude in his opponent .
speaking to the bbc in mid-june after the israeli marine 's deadly attack on the gaza flotilla , al-assad said : " the attack destroyed any chance for peace in the near future .
very simply , mainly because it proved that this government is another pyromaniac government .
you can not achieve peace with such a government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hafiz al assad , left , was pictured on election posters with his son .
al-assad himself has tried it , though .
like his father before him , he agreed to indirect peace talks with israel .
turkey mediated at first , but they have been on hold since the gaza war in 2008 .
another round seems unlikely in the near future - especially in light of the currently poor relations between turkey and israel .
critics say there is more likely to be new war in the region than peace anytime soon .
dealing with the golan question many european observers believe that syria has no interest in a new escalation in the region .
while the country was considered part of the " axis of evil " by former us president george w. bush , today , syria 's leader is essentially courted by western politicians .
indeed , syria has a number of interests that speak in favor of taking the path of peace and working together with western leaders .
syria wants to reform its ailing economy and needs to shed itself of american sanctions in order to do it .
above all , syria wants to get back the golan heights , which it lost to israel in 1967 , and which israel later annexed .
for the government , the return of the golan is a question of prestige .
" no syrian politician can give up on the golan .
the golan is part of syria , " explains samir al-aita , editor-in-chief of the arabic edition of le monde diplomatique .
delicate balance of influences german middle-east expert volker perthes believes it is possible to remove syria from its tight connections to iran , hamas and hezbollah .
the director of the german institute for international policy and security at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , says syria and hezbollah are allies out of necessity : syria needs hezbollah to keep up the credibility of its threats to israel , and hezbollah is using syria for financial and material support - including arms deliveries .
" that would all change if syria really signed a peace deal with israel and regained its occupied territory .
that is clear .
and beirut and the hezbollah know it .
the relationship of syria to hezbollah would change because they would no longer have the same strategic interests . "
but can al-assad take the risk - both in terms of domestic and foreign policy - of renouncing its allegiance to hamas , hezbollah and iran , in order to reclaim the golan and have better relations to the west ?
failed peace attempts thus far attempts to make that happen have failed up to the present .
us secretary of state hillary clinton became aware of that last february , when she openly asked al-assad to reconsider his tight strategic links to iran .
he replied that syria knew its own history , and said the middle east could take care of its own business , thank you .
at the end of the day , the question of whether syria is a key to peace or a stumbling block on the road there , is an open one .
and bashar al-assad seems bent on keeping it that way .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 17.07.2010 ten years on , syrian leader keeps his options open großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : propagandistic iconography featuring al assad is the norm in damascus ten years ago , syrian president bashar al-assad was named to replace his deceased father .
what role has his leadership played in the troubled search for peace in the middle east ? generations of middle east experts have asked themselves the same question : is syria the key to peace in the middle east , or is it a stumbling block ?
both possibilities are closely linked .
through its relations with iran , the hezbollah militia in lebanon , and radical hamas in gaza , the regime in damascus has enormous potential to influence the situation there - both for the positive and for the negative .
anti-israel , but open to the west president bashar al-assad shows a similar flexibility as his father , whose job he inherited on july 17 , 2000 .
under his reign the syrian state media is on a strictly anti-israeli course : the disliked neighbor is portrayed as an ever-agressive , propoganda-crazy " zionist entity . "
in the streets of damascus , endless numbers of propaganda posters show al-assad side by side with hezbollah chief hassan nasrallah , or iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
and the leadership of hamas lives in the syrian metropolis - along with a few other radical palestinian organizations .
at the same time , al-assad has repeatedly sent signals that show an interest in peace in the region , and on improved relations with western countries .
in that way , he is different from his partners in iran , hamas or hezbollah , which loudly agitate for the destruction of israel .
attempts at indirect peace talks when al-assad criticizes israel , he tends to do so from the standpoint of a peace-loving politician who , sadly , does n't find the same attitude in his opponent .
speaking to the bbc in mid-june after the israeli marine 's deadly attack on the gaza flotilla , al-assad said : " the attack destroyed any chance for peace in the near future .
very simply , mainly because it proved that this government is another pyromaniac government .
you can not achieve peace with such a government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hafiz al assad , left , was pictured on election posters with his son .
al-assad himself has tried it , though .
like his father before him , he agreed to indirect peace talks with israel .
turkey mediated at first , but they have been on hold since the gaza war in 2008 .
another round seems unlikely in the near future - especially in light of the currently poor relations between turkey and israel .
critics say there is more likely to be new war in the region than peace anytime soon .
dealing with the golan question many european observers believe that syria has no interest in a new escalation in the region .
while the country was considered part of the " axis of evil " by former us president george w. bush , today , syria 's leader is essentially courted by western politicians .
indeed , syria has a number of interests that speak in favor of taking the path of peace and working together with western leaders .
syria wants to reform its ailing economy and needs to shed itself of american sanctions in order to do it .
above all , syria wants to get back the golan heights , which it lost to israel in 1967 , and which israel later annexed .
for the government , the return of the golan is a question of prestige .
" no syrian politician can give up on the golan .
the golan is part of syria , " explains samir al-aita , editor-in-chief of the arabic edition of le monde diplomatique .
delicate balance of influences german middle-east expert volker perthes believes it is possible to remove syria from its tight connections to iran , hamas and hezbollah .
the director of the german institute for international policy and security at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , says syria and hezbollah are allies out of necessity : syria needs hezbollah to keep up the credibility of its threats to israel , and hezbollah is using syria for financial and material support - including arms deliveries .
" that would all change if syria really signed a peace deal with israel and regained its occupied territory .
that is clear .
and beirut and the hezbollah know it .
the relationship of syria to hezbollah would change because they would no longer have the same strategic interests . "
but can al-assad take the risk - both in terms of domestic and foreign policy - of renouncing its allegiance to hamas , hezbollah and iran , in order to reclaim the golan and have better relations to the west ?
failed peace attempts thus far attempts to make that happen have failed up to the present .

" wagner , who is also the director of the dora-mittelbau concentration camp memorial , added that the exhibition will " use the frame of forced labor to tell the social history of nazism , the history of a social order that was ideologically anchored in extreme racism . " he said the exhibition is not simply a " commission " by the evz but will critically examine both at forced labor and at compensation paid to victims by the evz . to that end , wagner said the exhibition will also " consider the italian military detainee or the soviet prisoner of war , who were denied compensation and humanitarian aid , but who , of course - in the eyes of historians - were also forced workers .

thousands of people marched through warsaw - thousands also opposed the event . the landmark gay rights rally in the polish capital was the first europride parade ever to take place behind the cold war iron curtain . the event was small by its own standards , with police estimating about 8,000 people took part this year , as opposed to 50,000 at last year 's march in zurich and more than a million in madrid three years ago . nevertheless , politicians from countries like great britain , sweden and germany also plan to take part in the rally , which will focus on a call for legal recognition of same-sex partnerships .
polish officials , however , are not expected at the rally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer people participated in the warsaw march than in other years and cities despite marching with banners calling for new civil partnership laws , participants at the parade admitted that the legal situation for homosexuals in poland was unlikely to change . " we 're hoping to open up a debate on the topic of affording legal status to the partnerships of gay and lesbian couples but we 're not optimistic such legislation will be passed anytime soon , " jacek adler , editor in chief of the www.gaylife.pl polish gay lifestyle website , told the afp news agency . local backlash the parade is facing strong opposition in largely catholic and conservative poland ; some 55,000 people have signed a petition which describes europride as " an obscene event of filth and perversion . "
counter-protesters chanted , " no to sodom and gomorrah , " while one man distributed copies of the old testament . opinion polls have shown that as much as 80 percent of poles oppose gay marriage and 93 percent say gay and lesbian couples should not be permitted to adopt children .
two-thirds of the polish population oppose gay demonstrations . gay rights were repressed during the communist era , and gays and lesbians have struggled since communism fell 20 years ago for acceptance in a society still strongly influenced by the church . poland 's conservative opposition , led by jaroslaw kaczynski , is against the recognition of homosexual partnerships .
kaczynski 's twin brother , recently deceased former president lech kaczynski banned a similar demonstration in warsaw in 2005 when he was mayor of the city . conservatives are planning a counter-demonstration on the streets of warsaw in response .

thousands of people marched through warsaw - thousands also opposed the event . the landmark gay rights rally in the polish capital was the first europride parade ever to take place behind the cold war iron curtain . the event was small by its own standards , with police estimating about 8,000 people took part this year , as opposed to 50,000 at last year 's march in zurich and more than a million in madrid three years ago . nevertheless , politicians from countries like great britain , sweden and germany also plan to take part in the rally , which will focus on a call for legal recognition of same-sex partnerships .
polish officials , however , are not expected at the rally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer people participated in the warsaw march than in other years and cities despite marching with banners calling for new civil partnership laws , participants at the parade admitted that the legal situation for homosexuals in poland was unlikely to change .

two-thirds of the polish population oppose gay demonstrations . gay rights were repressed during the communist era , and gays and lesbians have struggled since communism fell 20 years ago for acceptance in a society still strongly influenced by the church . poland 's conservative opposition , led by jaroslaw kaczynski , is against the recognition of homosexual partnerships .
kaczynski 's twin brother , recently deceased former president lech kaczynski banned a similar demonstration in warsaw in 2005 when he was mayor of the city . conservatives are planning a counter-demonstration on the streets of warsaw in response .

" the prime minister yesterday received a petition from various political groups saying that they did n't think it was appropriate for the meeting to take place , " vice president maria teresa fernandez de la vega said on spanish public television station tve on friday .
the friday meeting was the first to be held by experts to supervise the un 's millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , aimed at halving global extreme poverty by 2015 .
kagame and zapatero are the co-chairs of the group .
the spanish judiciary accuses kagame of a reign of terror during the 1990s in rwanda .
at least 800,000 people , mostly from the tutsi minority were killed by hutu extremist militias and government troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero did n't think it was " appropriate " to meet kagame in 2008 spain 's high court announced its intention to prosecute 40 rwandan army officers for genocide , crimes against humanity and terrorism related to events that took place between 1994 and 2000 , including under kagame 's rule .
the rwandan officers are accused , among other things , of murdering nine spanish missionaries and expatriates allegedly witnesses to massacres .
no indictment was issued , however , because kagame had immunity as a head of state .
spain 's " internal politics " de la vega said that a request had been made by several spanish political groups for zapatero not to attend .
in new york on friday , a un spokesman said that " the government of spain had been fully informed of the choice of president kagame as one of the co-facilitators . "
but rwandan officials played down the significance of zapatero 's decision to withdraw from the meeting with kagame .
" it is not a big deal for us .
it is spain 's internal politics , " rwandan foreign minister louise mushikiwabo told reporters on the sidelines of the gathering .
" we would like the spanish people to get to know rwanda 's president kagame better .
he is not what we see him portrayed as . "
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos took zapatero 's place at the meeting , also attended by un secretary-general ban ki-moon who met zapatero separately .
ban " expressed his concerns " that the recent murder of opposition official andre kagwa rwisereka and journalist jean leonard rugambage has " caused political tensions " in rwanda ahead of august 9 presidential elections , his spokeswoman said .
the venue for the meeting was moved from the seat of government , moncloa palace , to a hotel .

" the prime minister yesterday received a petition from various political groups saying that they did n't think it was appropriate for the meeting to take place , " vice president maria teresa fernandez de la vega said on spanish public television station tve on friday .
the friday meeting was the first to be held by experts to supervise the un 's millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , aimed at halving global extreme poverty by 2015 .
kagame and zapatero are the co-chairs of the group .
the spanish judiciary accuses kagame of a reign of terror during the 1990s in rwanda .
at least 800,000 people , mostly from the tutsi minority were killed by hutu extremist militias and government troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero did n't think it was " appropriate " to meet kagame in 2008 spain 's high court announced its intention to prosecute 40 rwandan army officers for genocide , crimes against humanity and terrorism related to events that took place between 1994 and 2000 , including under kagame 's rule .
the rwandan officers are accused , among other things , of murdering nine spanish missionaries and expatriates allegedly witnesses to massacres .
no indictment was issued , however , because kagame had immunity as a head of state .
spain 's " internal politics " de la vega said that a request had been made by several spanish political groups for zapatero not to attend .
in new york on friday , a un spokesman said that " the government of spain had been fully informed of the choice of president kagame as one of the co-facilitators . "
but rwandan officials played down the significance of zapatero 's decision to withdraw from the meeting with kagame .
" it is not a big deal for us .
it is spain 's internal politics , " rwandan foreign minister louise mushikiwabo told reporters on the sidelines of the gathering .
" we would like the spanish people to get to know rwanda 's president kagame better .
he is not what we see him portrayed as . "
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos took zapatero 's place at the meeting , also attended by un secretary-general ban ki-moon who met zapatero separately .
ban " expressed his concerns " that the recent murder of opposition official andre kagwa rwisereka and journalist jean leonard rugambage has " caused political tensions " in rwanda ahead of august 9 presidential elections , his spokeswoman said .
the venue for the meeting was moved from the seat of government , moncloa palace , to a hotel .

thousands of people marched through warsaw - thousands also opposed the event . the landmark gay rights rally in the polish capital was the first europride parade ever to take place behind the cold war iron curtain . the event was small by its own standards , with police estimating about 8,000 people took part this year , as opposed to 50,000 at last year 's march in zurich and more than a million in madrid three years ago . nevertheless , politicians from countries like great britain , sweden and germany also plan to take part in the rally , which will focus on a call for legal recognition of same-sex partnerships .

" considering the 13 million people who were brought to germany as forced workers , you have to recognize that forced labor was a european occurrence , " saathoff told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saathoff said all of europe should remember nazi forced labor " it must be a permanently anchored and fundamental element of the history of wrongdoing in a european culture of remembrance , " he added . the ezb has holdings of about 400 million euros , which it has used to fund over 2,100 projects , including a program called " europeans for peace . "
so far over 100,000 young people from 28 countries have participated in the program aimed to help victims of anti-semitism and right-wing extremism . labeled traitors to the fatherland still of particular importance to the foundation are projects that support former forced laborers and their families through local initiatives .
one such project in eastern europe encourages dialogue about the once-taboo topic of forced labor .
the dialogues initiated by the program give long-needed acknowledgement to the " other " victims of nazism , according to saathoff . " under stalin many returning forced laborers were seen as traitors to the fatherland , " saathoff said , adding that many of them lived as pariahs within their societies . " this project attempts to give those people a voice again in their communities , and we also want to encourage the communities to give the victims their attention , so intergenerational dialog and local initiatives are at the center of our efforts , " he said . jewish museum exhibition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many forced laborers became pariahs once they returned to their home countries berlin 's jewish museum is set to host a large exhibition on nazi-era forced labor beginning this september with the evz 's financial support . one of the exhibition planners , jens-christian wagner , explained that the exhibition will show " when and how germans had to decide what position to take on forced labor . " wagner , who is also the director of the dora-mittelbau concentration camp memorial , added that the exhibition will " use the frame of forced labor to tell the social history of nazism , the history of a social order that was ideologically anchored in extreme racism . " he said the exhibition is not simply a " commission " by the evz but will critically examine both at forced labor and at compensation paid to victims by the evz . to that end , wagner said the exhibition will also " consider the italian military detainee or the soviet prisoner of war , who were denied compensation and humanitarian aid , but who , of course - in the eyes of historians - were also forced workers . " an injury to justice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the jewish museum exhibition looks at forced labor and victims ' compensation wagner said it would have been impossible to make the distribution of compensation absolutely fair .
he said this " injury to justice " is yet another result of germany 's coming to terms with nazi forced labor . the exhibition will move to warsaw in 2011 , with further stations planned in russia to mark the 70th anniversary of germany 's 1941 attack on the soviet union . author : marcel fürstenau -lrb- dl -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thousands of people marched through warsaw - thousands also opposed the event . the landmark gay rights rally in the polish capital was the first europride parade ever to take place behind the cold war iron curtain . the event was small by its own standards , with police estimating about 8,000 people took part this year , as opposed to 50,000 at last year 's march in zurich and more than a million in madrid three years ago . nevertheless , politicians from countries like great britain , sweden and germany also plan to take part in the rally , which will focus on a call for legal recognition of same-sex partnerships .
polish officials , however , are not expected at the rally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer people participated in the warsaw march than in other years and cities despite marching with banners calling for new civil partnership laws , participants at the parade admitted that the legal situation for homosexuals in poland was unlikely to change . " we 're hoping to open up a debate on the topic of affording legal status to the partnerships of gay and lesbian couples but we 're not optimistic such legislation will be passed anytime soon , " jacek adler , editor in chief of the www.gaylife.pl polish gay lifestyle website , told the afp news agency . local backlash the parade is facing strong opposition in largely catholic and conservative poland ; some 55,000 people have signed a petition which describes europride as " an obscene event of filth and perversion . "
counter-protesters chanted , " no to sodom and gomorrah , " while one man distributed copies of the old testament . opinion polls have shown that as much as 80 percent of poles oppose gay marriage and 93 percent say gay and lesbian couples should not be permitted to adopt children .
two-thirds of the polish population oppose gay demonstrations . gay rights were repressed during the communist era , and gays and lesbians have struggled since communism fell 20 years ago for acceptance in a society still strongly influenced by the church . poland 's conservative opposition , led by jaroslaw kaczynski , is against the recognition of homosexual partnerships .
kaczynski 's twin brother , recently deceased former president lech kaczynski banned a similar demonstration in warsaw in 2005 when he was mayor of the city . conservatives are planning a counter-demonstration on the streets of warsaw in response . " politicians are afraid of us and would rather ignore this topic , " said tomasz baczkowski from the " equality " foundation , which has helped organize the event . author : mark hallam -lrb- afp , dpa , ap -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a group of about 30 youths had attacked the tram with baseball bats and iron bars , forcing out passengers . after police arrived , the youths began burning cars , setting between 50 and 60 vehicles ablaze .
gunfire ensued , with police returning fire four times . no one was injured in the riots , according to police , who arrested two men aged 18 and 20 for burning cars and three others for attempting to loot shops . " no future for hoodlums " interior minister brice hortefeux arrived later on saturday , vowing to restore order to the villeneuve neighborhood . " i 've asked for the prefect to use all means to secure the neighborhood , " he said .
" there is a simple and clear reality in this country : there 's no future for hoodlums and delinquents because in the end the public authority always wins . " boudouda 's accomplice escaped the scene of the casino robbery after an hour-long helicopter chase .
police reportedly found a getaway vehicle with between 20,000 and 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 25,000- $ 50,000 -rrb- . the robbery at the casino in uriage-les-bains , some 15 kilometers from grenoble , is the third casino robbery in the region so far this year . ongoing violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil unrests swept french suburbs in 2005 , as seen here in paris according to police union sgp , violence in grenoble has been on the rise for months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 17.07.2010 hamburg remains divided ahead of education referendum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proponents of the reform say it will help the disadvantaged the german city of hamburg is gearing up for a referendum on a controversial reform to education that could see primary school extended from four years to six .
but a citizens ' initiative stands in the government 's way . twenty-five girls and boys stand in a semicircle in their classroom and sing a song in latin .
the kids are fourth-graders at the grumbrecht street primary school in the hamburg suburb of heimfeld .
the school 's headmaster , rainer kuehlke , said the singing exercise is part of grumbrecht street 's so-called language carousel , a program that sees the young students learning latin , spanish , french and english one after the other for nine weeks at a time .
the carousel course is designed to make it easier for the children to select one foreign language to learn in fifth grade , if they are selected for what the german system calls a gymnasium , or academic high school .
germany has a three-tier education system where children are sent to separate institutions after primary school .
the weak students go to a hauptschule , those opting for higher vocational training to a realschule and future academics to a gymnasium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : primary school students would stay together for an extra two years in germany education policy is not centralized , but rather left to the governments of all 16 federal states to decide on - and this has led to a lot of variety across the country .
in the city-state of hamburg , children go to primary school for four years until the age of 10 and are then separated according to their abilities - a move that shapes their lives .
education experts say this is too early - they argue that two more years of learning together would help the weaker students improve their chances for the future .
this notion is at the heart of government proposals to reform hamburg 's education system that would see students spend an extra two years at primary school .
the reforms would also see the different types of grammar schools boiled down to just two - the gymnasium and a so-called neighborhood school .
parents would also no longer be allowed to select which of these schools their child attended .
this decision would be made by teachers on the basis of merit and ability .
divisive plans the city 's trade unions and chambers of commerce , as well as numerous migrant associations , have spoken out in favor of extending primary school learning , arguing that the current system discriminates against children with working-class and migrant backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all students would have the chance to take a university entrance exam " in my home country it 's natural to go to primary school for six years , and if i had not been able to do that , i would surely not have made it to the level where i can pursue an academic career here in germany , " said native greek panis drossinakis .
in hamburg , every second child has some kind of a migrant background , and their families often belong to the disadvantaged in german society .
many have a working class background and their parents ' german skills are lacking , so it is these boys and girls who are left behind in the current system .
pedagogical scientist johannes bastian said success in the german school system depends too much on family background .
" even with the same level of achievement , children from working-class families have a smaller chance of making it to gymnasium than the child of university-educated parents , " he says .
lowering the bar ?
but the plan has been bitterly opposed by school groups and many parents ' groups , who are planning a referendum on the issue for this sunday - it 's outcome , political observers say , could make or break the ruling coalition .
the city 's gymnasium schools are especially concerned about the effect the proposed changes could have on the quality of education .
they fear their specialist profiles would be trimmed if the government gets it way , and that students would receive a lesser education because they would have less time to study their desired field , be it music , the humanities or the arts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christa goetsch is trying to push the reforms through many of hamburg 's headmasters and parents accuse the city 's schools minister , christa goetsch of the greens , of lowering educational standards .
they say they ca n't understand how there could be no exception made for schools and educational methods they say have been time-proven .
media lawyer walter scheuerl heads an initiative he founded two years ago called we want to learn .
in november last year , the initiative organized a petition against the government 's education reforms , and within only a few weeks had gathered some 180,000 signatures against the changes , enough to force sunday 's referendum .
this pushed the city 's government - a coalition of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the hamburg greens party - into weeks of debate over a possible compromise to avert the public vote .
the coalition was unable to reach that compromise .
many schools around hamburg have already begun adapting to the changes espoused by the city government , but if hamburgers vote against the reforms on sunday then it will have all been in vain .

but a citizens ' initiative stands in the government 's way . twenty-five girls and boys stand in a semicircle in their classroom and sing a song in latin .
the kids are fourth-graders at the grumbrecht street primary school in the hamburg suburb of heimfeld .
the school 's headmaster , rainer kuehlke , said the singing exercise is part of grumbrecht street 's so-called language carousel , a program that sees the young students learning latin , spanish , french and english one after the other for nine weeks at a time .
the carousel course is designed to make it easier for the children to select one foreign language to learn in fifth grade , if they are selected for what the german system calls a gymnasium , or academic high school .
germany has a three-tier education system where children are sent to separate institutions after primary school .
the weak students go to a hauptschule , those opting for higher vocational training to a realschule and future academics to a gymnasium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : primary school students would stay together for an extra two years in germany education policy is not centralized , but rather left to the governments of all 16 federal states to decide on - and this has led to a lot of variety across the country .
in the city-state of hamburg , children go to primary school for four years until the age of 10 and are then separated according to their abilities - a move that shapes their lives .
education experts say this is too early - they argue that two more years of learning together would help the weaker students improve their chances for the future .
this notion is at the heart of government proposals to reform hamburg 's education system that would see students spend an extra two years at primary school .
the reforms would also see the different types of grammar schools boiled down to just two - the gymnasium and a so-called neighborhood school .
parents would also no longer be allowed to select which of these schools their child attended .
this decision would be made by teachers on the basis of merit and ability .
divisive plans the city 's trade unions and chambers of commerce , as well as numerous migrant associations , have spoken out in favor of extending primary school learning , arguing that the current system discriminates against children with working-class and migrant backgrounds .

in hamburg , every second child has some kind of a migrant background , and their families often belong to the disadvantaged in german society .
many have a working class background and their parents ' german skills are lacking , so it is these boys and girls who are left behind in the current system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 17.07.2010 ten years on , syrian leader keeps his options open großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : propagandistic iconography featuring al assad is the norm in damascus ten years ago , syrian president bashar al-assad was named to replace his deceased father .
what role has his leadership played in the troubled search for peace in the middle east ? generations of middle east experts have asked themselves the same question : is syria the key to peace in the middle east , or is it a stumbling block ?
both possibilities are closely linked .
through its relations with iran , the hezbollah militia in lebanon , and radical hamas in gaza , the regime in damascus has enormous potential to influence the situation there - both for the positive and for the negative .
anti-israel , but open to the west president bashar al-assad shows a similar flexibility as his father , whose job he inherited on july 17 , 2000 .
under his reign the syrian state media is on a strictly anti-israeli course : the disliked neighbor is portrayed as an ever-agressive , propoganda-crazy " zionist entity . "
in the streets of damascus , endless numbers of propaganda posters show al-assad side by side with hezbollah chief hassan nasrallah , or iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
and the leadership of hamas lives in the syrian metropolis - along with a few other radical palestinian organizations .
at the same time , al-assad has repeatedly sent signals that show an interest in peace in the region , and on improved relations with western countries .
in that way , he is different from his partners in iran , hamas or hezbollah , which loudly agitate for the destruction of israel .
attempts at indirect peace talks when al-assad criticizes israel , he tends to do so from the standpoint of a peace-loving politician who , sadly , does n't find the same attitude in his opponent .
speaking to the bbc in mid-june after the israeli marine 's deadly attack on the gaza flotilla , al-assad said : " the attack destroyed any chance for peace in the near future .
very simply , mainly because it proved that this government is another pyromaniac government .
you can not achieve peace with such a government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hafiz al assad , left , was pictured on election posters with his son .
al-assad himself has tried it , though .
like his father before him , he agreed to indirect peace talks with israel .
turkey mediated at first , but they have been on hold since the gaza war in 2008 .
another round seems unlikely in the near future - especially in light of the currently poor relations between turkey and israel .
critics say there is more likely to be new war in the region than peace anytime soon .
dealing with the golan question many european observers believe that syria has no interest in a new escalation in the region .
while the country was considered part of the " axis of evil " by former us president george w. bush , today , syria 's leader is essentially courted by western politicians .
indeed , syria has a number of interests that speak in favor of taking the path of peace and working together with western leaders .
syria wants to reform its ailing economy and needs to shed itself of american sanctions in order to do it .
above all , syria wants to get back the golan heights , which it lost to israel in 1967 , and which israel later annexed .
for the government , the return of the golan is a question of prestige .
" no syrian politician can give up on the golan .
the golan is part of syria , " explains samir al-aita , editor-in-chief of the arabic edition of le monde diplomatique .
delicate balance of influences german middle-east expert volker perthes believes it is possible to remove syria from its tight connections to iran , hamas and hezbollah .
the director of the german institute for international policy and security at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , says syria and hezbollah are allies out of necessity : syria needs hezbollah to keep up the credibility of its threats to israel , and hezbollah is using syria for financial and material support - including arms deliveries .
" that would all change if syria really signed a peace deal with israel and regained its occupied territory .
that is clear .
and beirut and the hezbollah know it .
the relationship of syria to hezbollah would change because they would no longer have the same strategic interests . "
but can al-assad take the risk - both in terms of domestic and foreign policy - of renouncing its allegiance to hamas , hezbollah and iran , in order to reclaim the golan and have better relations to the west ?
failed peace attempts thus far attempts to make that happen have failed up to the present .
us secretary of state hillary clinton became aware of that last february , when she openly asked al-assad to reconsider his tight strategic links to iran .
he replied that syria knew its own history , and said the middle east could take care of its own business , thank you .
at the end of the day , the question of whether syria is a key to peace or a stumbling block on the road there , is an open one .

at the same time , al-assad has repeatedly sent signals that show an interest in peace in the region , and on improved relations with western countries .

attempts at indirect peace talks when al-assad criticizes israel , he tends to do so from the standpoint of a peace-loving politician who , sadly , does n't find the same attitude in his opponent .
speaking to the bbc in mid-june after the israeli marine 's deadly attack on the gaza flotilla , al-assad said : " the attack destroyed any chance for peace in the near future .

indeed , syria has a number of interests that speak in favor of taking the path of peace and working together with western leaders .
syria wants to reform its ailing economy and needs to shed itself of american sanctions in order to do it .
above all , syria wants to get back the golan heights , which it lost to israel in 1967 , and which israel later annexed .
for the government , the return of the golan is a question of prestige .

us secretary of state hillary clinton became aware of that last february , when she openly asked al-assad to reconsider his tight strategic links to iran .

what role has his leadership played in the troubled search for peace in the middle east ? generations of middle east experts have asked themselves the same question : is syria the key to peace in the middle east , or is it a stumbling block ?
both possibilities are closely linked .
through its relations with iran , the hezbollah militia in lebanon , and radical hamas in gaza , the regime in damascus has enormous potential to influence the situation there - both for the positive and for the negative .
anti-israel , but open to the west president bashar al-assad shows a similar flexibility as his father , whose job he inherited on july 17 , 2000 .
under his reign the syrian state media is on a strictly anti-israeli course : the disliked neighbor is portrayed as an ever-agressive , propoganda-crazy " zionist entity . "
in the streets of damascus , endless numbers of propaganda posters show al-assad side by side with hezbollah chief hassan nasrallah , or iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
and the leadership of hamas lives in the syrian metropolis - along with a few other radical palestinian organizations .
at the same time , al-assad has repeatedly sent signals that show an interest in peace in the region , and on improved relations with western countries .
in that way , he is different from his partners in iran , hamas or hezbollah , which loudly agitate for the destruction of israel .
attempts at indirect peace talks when al-assad criticizes israel , he tends to do so from the standpoint of a peace-loving politician who , sadly , does n't find the same attitude in his opponent .
speaking to the bbc in mid-june after the israeli marine 's deadly attack on the gaza flotilla , al-assad said : " the attack destroyed any chance for peace in the near future .
very simply , mainly because it proved that this government is another pyromaniac government .
you can not achieve peace with such a government . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hafiz al assad , left , was pictured on election posters with his son .
al-assad himself has tried it , though .
like his father before him , he agreed to indirect peace talks with israel .
turkey mediated at first , but they have been on hold since the gaza war in 2008 .
another round seems unlikely in the near future - especially in light of the currently poor relations between turkey and israel .
critics say there is more likely to be new war in the region than peace anytime soon .
dealing with the golan question many european observers believe that syria has no interest in a new escalation in the region .
while the country was considered part of the " axis of evil " by former us president george w. bush , today , syria 's leader is essentially courted by western politicians .
indeed , syria has a number of interests that speak in favor of taking the path of peace and working together with western leaders .
syria wants to reform its ailing economy and needs to shed itself of american sanctions in order to do it .
above all , syria wants to get back the golan heights , which it lost to israel in 1967 , and which israel later annexed .
for the government , the return of the golan is a question of prestige .
" no syrian politician can give up on the golan .
the golan is part of syria , " explains samir al-aita , editor-in-chief of the arabic edition of le monde diplomatique .
delicate balance of influences german middle-east expert volker perthes believes it is possible to remove syria from its tight connections to iran , hamas and hezbollah .
the director of the german institute for international policy and security at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , says syria and hezbollah are allies out of necessity : syria needs hezbollah to keep up the credibility of its threats to israel , and hezbollah is using syria for financial and material support - including arms deliveries .
" that would all change if syria really signed a peace deal with israel and regained its occupied territory .
that is clear .
and beirut and the hezbollah know it .
the relationship of syria to hezbollah would change because they would no longer have the same strategic interests . "
but can al-assad take the risk - both in terms of domestic and foreign policy - of renouncing its allegiance to hamas , hezbollah and iran , in order to reclaim the golan and have better relations to the west ?

" the prime minister yesterday received a petition from various political groups saying that they did n't think it was appropriate for the meeting to take place , " vice president maria teresa fernandez de la vega said on spanish public television station tve on friday .
the friday meeting was the first to be held by experts to supervise the un 's millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , aimed at halving global extreme poverty by 2015 .
kagame and zapatero are the co-chairs of the group .
the spanish judiciary accuses kagame of a reign of terror during the 1990s in rwanda .
at least 800,000 people , mostly from the tutsi minority were killed by hutu extremist militias and government troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero did n't think it was " appropriate " to meet kagame in 2008 spain 's high court announced its intention to prosecute 40 rwandan army officers for genocide , crimes against humanity and terrorism related to events that took place between 1994 and 2000 , including under kagame 's rule .
the rwandan officers are accused , among other things , of murdering nine spanish missionaries and expatriates allegedly witnesses to massacres .
no indictment was issued , however , because kagame had immunity as a head of state .
spain 's " internal politics " de la vega said that a request had been made by several spanish political groups for zapatero not to attend .
in new york on friday , a un spokesman said that " the government of spain had been fully informed of the choice of president kagame as one of the co-facilitators . "
but rwandan officials played down the significance of zapatero 's decision to withdraw from the meeting with kagame .
" it is not a big deal for us .
it is spain 's internal politics , " rwandan foreign minister louise mushikiwabo told reporters on the sidelines of the gathering .
" we would like the spanish people to get to know rwanda 's president kagame better .
he is not what we see him portrayed as . "
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos took zapatero 's place at the meeting , also attended by un secretary-general ban ki-moon who met zapatero separately .
ban " expressed his concerns " that the recent murder of opposition official andre kagwa rwisereka and journalist jean leonard rugambage has " caused political tensions " in rwanda ahead of august 9 presidential elections , his spokeswoman said .
the venue for the meeting was moved from the seat of government , moncloa palace , to a hotel .

" the prime minister yesterday received a petition from various political groups saying that they did n't think it was appropriate for the meeting to take place , " vice president maria teresa fernandez de la vega said on spanish public television station tve on friday .
the friday meeting was the first to be held by experts to supervise the un 's millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , aimed at halving global extreme poverty by 2015 .
kagame and zapatero are the co-chairs of the group .
the spanish judiciary accuses kagame of a reign of terror during the 1990s in rwanda .
at least 800,000 people , mostly from the tutsi minority were killed by hutu extremist militias and government troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero did n't think it was " appropriate " to meet kagame in 2008 spain 's high court announced its intention to prosecute 40 rwandan army officers for genocide , crimes against humanity and terrorism related to events that took place between 1994 and 2000 , including under kagame 's rule .
the rwandan officers are accused , among other things , of murdering nine spanish missionaries and expatriates allegedly witnesses to massacres .
no indictment was issued , however , because kagame had immunity as a head of state .
spain 's " internal politics " de la vega said that a request had been made by several spanish political groups for zapatero not to attend .
in new york on friday , a un spokesman said that " the government of spain had been fully informed of the choice of president kagame as one of the co-facilitators . "
but rwandan officials played down the significance of zapatero 's decision to withdraw from the meeting with kagame .
" it is not a big deal for us .
it is spain 's internal politics , " rwandan foreign minister louise mushikiwabo told reporters on the sidelines of the gathering .
" we would like the spanish people to get to know rwanda 's president kagame better .
he is not what we see him portrayed as . "
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos took zapatero 's place at the meeting , also attended by un secretary-general ban ki-moon who met zapatero separately .
ban " expressed his concerns " that the recent murder of opposition official andre kagwa rwisereka and journalist jean leonard rugambage has " caused political tensions " in rwanda ahead of august 9 presidential elections , his spokeswoman said .
the venue for the meeting was moved from the seat of government , moncloa palace , to a hotel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 17.07.2010 hamburg remains divided ahead of education referendum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proponents of the reform say it will help the disadvantaged the german city of hamburg is gearing up for a referendum on a controversial reform to education that could see primary school extended from four years to six .
but a citizens ' initiative stands in the government 's way . twenty-five girls and boys stand in a semicircle in their classroom and sing a song in latin .
the kids are fourth-graders at the grumbrecht street primary school in the hamburg suburb of heimfeld .
the school 's headmaster , rainer kuehlke , said the singing exercise is part of grumbrecht street 's so-called language carousel , a program that sees the young students learning latin , spanish , french and english one after the other for nine weeks at a time .
the carousel course is designed to make it easier for the children to select one foreign language to learn in fifth grade , if they are selected for what the german system calls a gymnasium , or academic high school .
germany has a three-tier education system where children are sent to separate institutions after primary school .
the weak students go to a hauptschule , those opting for higher vocational training to a realschule and future academics to a gymnasium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : primary school students would stay together for an extra two years in germany education policy is not centralized , but rather left to the governments of all 16 federal states to decide on - and this has led to a lot of variety across the country .
in the city-state of hamburg , children go to primary school for four years until the age of 10 and are then separated according to their abilities - a move that shapes their lives .
education experts say this is too early - they argue that two more years of learning together would help the weaker students improve their chances for the future .
this notion is at the heart of government proposals to reform hamburg 's education system that would see students spend an extra two years at primary school .
the reforms would also see the different types of grammar schools boiled down to just two - the gymnasium and a so-called neighborhood school .
parents would also no longer be allowed to select which of these schools their child attended .
this decision would be made by teachers on the basis of merit and ability .
divisive plans the city 's trade unions and chambers of commerce , as well as numerous migrant associations , have spoken out in favor of extending primary school learning , arguing that the current system discriminates against children with working-class and migrant backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all students would have the chance to take a university entrance exam " in my home country it 's natural to go to primary school for six years , and if i had not been able to do that , i would surely not have made it to the level where i can pursue an academic career here in germany , " said native greek panis drossinakis .
in hamburg , every second child has some kind of a migrant background , and their families often belong to the disadvantaged in german society .
many have a working class background and their parents ' german skills are lacking , so it is these boys and girls who are left behind in the current system .
pedagogical scientist johannes bastian said success in the german school system depends too much on family background .
" even with the same level of achievement , children from working-class families have a smaller chance of making it to gymnasium than the child of university-educated parents , " he says .
lowering the bar ?
but the plan has been bitterly opposed by school groups and many parents ' groups , who are planning a referendum on the issue for this sunday - it 's outcome , political observers say , could make or break the ruling coalition .
the city 's gymnasium schools are especially concerned about the effect the proposed changes could have on the quality of education .
they fear their specialist profiles would be trimmed if the government gets it way , and that students would receive a lesser education because they would have less time to study their desired field , be it music , the humanities or the arts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christa goetsch is trying to push the reforms through many of hamburg 's headmasters and parents accuse the city 's schools minister , christa goetsch of the greens , of lowering educational standards .
they say they ca n't understand how there could be no exception made for schools and educational methods they say have been time-proven .
media lawyer walter scheuerl heads an initiative he founded two years ago called we want to learn .
in november last year , the initiative organized a petition against the government 's education reforms , and within only a few weeks had gathered some 180,000 signatures against the changes , enough to force sunday 's referendum .
this pushed the city 's government - a coalition of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the hamburg greens party - into weeks of debate over a possible compromise to avert the public vote .
the coalition was unable to reach that compromise .
many schools around hamburg have already begun adapting to the changes espoused by the city government , but if hamburgers vote against the reforms on sunday then it will have all been in vain .

a decision on the matter is expected next week . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- failed to reach a decision saturday on whether to send an international police mission into kyrgyzstan to help authorities restore stability after a government overthrow in april and ethnic violence in june , which human rights groups say claimed up to 2,000 lives . though the decision has been put off until a thursday meeting in vienna .
but the osce 's meetings are on track , according to sources close to german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who along with his french counterpart bernard kouchner , called saturday 's meeting in kazakhstan . herbert salber , the head of the osce 's conflict prevention center , also remained confident that the mission would go forward . " our proposal to send police officers to kyrgyzstan is being assessed by osce member-countries , " he said .
" i think in the next few weeks , we will see their first arrivals .

thousands of people marched through warsaw - thousands also opposed the event . the landmark gay rights rally in the polish capital was the first europride parade ever to take place behind the cold war iron curtain . the event was small by its own standards , with police estimating about 8,000 people took part this year , as opposed to 50,000 at last year 's march in zurich and more than a million in madrid three years ago . nevertheless , politicians from countries like great britain , sweden and germany also plan to take part in the rally , which will focus on a call for legal recognition of same-sex partnerships .

" the prime minister yesterday received a petition from various political groups saying that they did n't think it was appropriate for the meeting to take place , " vice president maria teresa fernandez de la vega said on spanish public television station tve on friday .
the friday meeting was the first to be held by experts to supervise the un 's millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , aimed at halving global extreme poverty by 2015 .
kagame and zapatero are the co-chairs of the group .
the spanish judiciary accuses kagame of a reign of terror during the 1990s in rwanda .
at least 800,000 people , mostly from the tutsi minority were killed by hutu extremist militias and government troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero did n't think it was " appropriate " to meet kagame in 2008 spain 's high court announced its intention to prosecute 40 rwandan army officers for genocide , crimes against humanity and terrorism related to events that took place between 1994 and 2000 , including under kagame 's rule .
the rwandan officers are accused , among other things , of murdering nine spanish missionaries and expatriates allegedly witnesses to massacres .
no indictment was issued , however , because kagame had immunity as a head of state .
spain 's " internal politics " de la vega said that a request had been made by several spanish political groups for zapatero not to attend .
in new york on friday , a un spokesman said that " the government of spain had been fully informed of the choice of president kagame as one of the co-facilitators . "
but rwandan officials played down the significance of zapatero 's decision to withdraw from the meeting with kagame .
" it is not a big deal for us .
it is spain 's internal politics , " rwandan foreign minister louise mushikiwabo told reporters on the sidelines of the gathering .
" we would like the spanish people to get to know rwanda 's president kagame better .
he is not what we see him portrayed as . "
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos took zapatero 's place at the meeting , also attended by un secretary-general ban ki-moon who met zapatero separately .
ban " expressed his concerns " that the recent murder of opposition official andre kagwa rwisereka and journalist jean leonard rugambage has " caused political tensions " in rwanda ahead of august 9 presidential elections , his spokeswoman said .
the venue for the meeting was moved from the seat of government , moncloa palace , to a hotel .

german politicians and police proposed measures to crack down on internet crime and improve education of young internet surfers . prosecutors in the western city of aachen are questioning a man for spying on schoolgirls using the web cameras on their own computers .
police used the man 's internet protocol -lrb- ip -rrb- address to track him to his home , according to an association of german data protection specialists . the daily westfalenblatt reported that the man spied used a computer virus to spy on over 150 girls .

" the prime minister yesterday received a petition from various political groups saying that they did n't think it was appropriate for the meeting to take place , " vice president maria teresa fernandez de la vega said on spanish public television station tve on friday .
the friday meeting was the first to be held by experts to supervise the un 's millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , aimed at halving global extreme poverty by 2015 .
kagame and zapatero are the co-chairs of the group .
the spanish judiciary accuses kagame of a reign of terror during the 1990s in rwanda .
at least 800,000 people , mostly from the tutsi minority were killed by hutu extremist militias and government troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero did n't think it was " appropriate " to meet kagame in 2008 spain 's high court announced its intention to prosecute 40 rwandan army officers for genocide , crimes against humanity and terrorism related to events that took place between 1994 and 2000 , including under kagame 's rule .
the rwandan officers are accused , among other things , of murdering nine spanish missionaries and expatriates allegedly witnesses to massacres .
no indictment was issued , however , because kagame had immunity as a head of state .
spain 's " internal politics " de la vega said that a request had been made by several spanish political groups for zapatero not to attend .
in new york on friday , a un spokesman said that " the government of spain had been fully informed of the choice of president kagame as one of the co-facilitators . "
but rwandan officials played down the significance of zapatero 's decision to withdraw from the meeting with kagame .
" it is not a big deal for us .
it is spain 's internal politics , " rwandan foreign minister louise mushikiwabo told reporters on the sidelines of the gathering .
" we would like the spanish people to get to know rwanda 's president kagame better .
he is not what we see him portrayed as . "
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos took zapatero 's place at the meeting , also attended by un secretary-general ban ki-moon who met zapatero separately .
ban " expressed his concerns " that the recent murder of opposition official andre kagwa rwisereka and journalist jean leonard rugambage has " caused political tensions " in rwanda ahead of august 9 presidential elections , his spokeswoman said .
the venue for the meeting was moved from the seat of government , moncloa palace , to a hotel .

" the prime minister yesterday received a petition from various political groups saying that they did n't think it was appropriate for the meeting to take place , " vice president maria teresa fernandez de la vega said on spanish public television station tve on friday .
the friday meeting was the first to be held by experts to supervise the un 's millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , aimed at halving global extreme poverty by 2015 .
kagame and zapatero are the co-chairs of the group .
the spanish judiciary accuses kagame of a reign of terror during the 1990s in rwanda .

some experts say that makes life tough for students . german students do n't tend to be at the front of the class when it comes to international rankings .
awards for best schools , best reading competence or mathematical ability are usually given to other countries ' education systems . but germany does have the distinction of one record : it 's the country with the most education systems .
each of germany 's 16 states has its own system . that 's a big disadvantage for students switching to a new school in a different state , according to rita nikolai , an education researcher from the social science research center in berlin . " the danger that kids will have to step down a level in school or get held back exists , " nikolai said .
" between the states , there are significant differences in the curriculum . " take the state of hesse .
it offers students foreign language instruction in sixth grade .
in most other states , foreign language classes begin a year later .
that put students moving to hesse after completing the sixth grade a year behind their cohorts when it comes to foreign languages .
in hesse , it is then up to individual schools to decide if the student needs to repeat sixth grade or find another solution . hands tied at national level bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : different states have different education standards examples like this are everywhere in the german education system , and the confusion may become worse .
many states are planning sweeping education reforms in the next few years . when students return from summer holidays in berlin , which is one of germany 's states as well as the capital city , they 'll find that all forms of secondary education will be offered in a single school .
previously , students took placement tests to determine if they were placed in a college-preparatory school or a vocational school . saarland has just decided to extend the time students spend in primary school from four to five years , while most of the other states are debating between four or six years . in hamburg , another german city that doubles as its own state , voters are heading to the polls sunday to decide on whether to continue tracking students when they reach fifth grade or to keep all students in the same primary school classes until the end of sixth grade . the autonomy of the states has grown since 2006 , when the federal and state governments agreed on a new division of responsibilities - a decision that favored giving the states more discretion in deciding their education policy .
while there have always been differences in each state , there is no longer anyone to arbitrate among the states , according to nikolai . " since the reforms the problem is that the federal government can no longer take control of the wheel , " she said .
" federal programs for preschool programs can no longer be coordinated from berlin alone . " ' education should have gone to the federal government ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matschie thinks education should be left to the federal government common education standards , the recognition of high school diplomas from other states and similar questions are debated between the states at the conference of german cultural ministers .
the 16 state ministers have to find a consensus on all questions that come up . " with education policies , it is urgently necessary that we ensure kids have the same educational standards whether they go to school in berlin , hamburg , or erfurt , " said christoph matschie , education minister in thuringia . he is one of the few state ministers who does n't support the idea of giving states the upper hand when it comes to education .

german politicians and police proposed measures to crack down on internet crime and improve education of young internet surfers . prosecutors in the western city of aachen are questioning a man for spying on schoolgirls using the web cameras on their own computers .
police used the man 's internet protocol -lrb- ip -rrb- address to track him to his home , according to an association of german data protection specialists . the daily westfalenblatt reported that the man spied used a computer virus to spy on over 150 girls .
prosecutors confirmed an investigation was ongoing but declined to comment on the number of victims . a widespread problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one girl 's chat contacts provided a list of victims for the hacker the case was discovered by thomas floss , a data protection advocate who gives presentations in schools to promote awareness of safe internet practices .
two girls came forward after one of his presentations to tell him that their web cameras lit up even when the girls had not activated them . floss said he believes the problem to be widespread . " i 've visited 50 to 60 schools , and each time at least one girl tells me she has had this kind of problem , " he said . floss 's suspicions were confirmed when he discovered a so-called trojan virus on one of the girl 's computers .

" the prime minister yesterday received a petition from various political groups saying that they did n't think it was appropriate for the meeting to take place , " vice president maria teresa fernandez de la vega said on spanish public television station tve on friday .
the friday meeting was the first to be held by experts to supervise the un 's millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- , aimed at halving global extreme poverty by 2015 .
kagame and zapatero are the co-chairs of the group .
the spanish judiciary accuses kagame of a reign of terror during the 1990s in rwanda .
at least 800,000 people , mostly from the tutsi minority were killed by hutu extremist militias and government troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero did n't think it was " appropriate " to meet kagame in 2008 spain 's high court announced its intention to prosecute 40 rwandan army officers for genocide , crimes against humanity and terrorism related to events that took place between 1994 and 2000 , including under kagame 's rule .
the rwandan officers are accused , among other things , of murdering nine spanish missionaries and expatriates allegedly witnesses to massacres .
no indictment was issued , however , because kagame had immunity as a head of state .
spain 's " internal politics " de la vega said that a request had been made by several spanish political groups for zapatero not to attend .
in new york on friday , a un spokesman said that " the government of spain had been fully informed of the choice of president kagame as one of the co-facilitators . "
but rwandan officials played down the significance of zapatero 's decision to withdraw from the meeting with kagame .
" it is not a big deal for us .
it is spain 's internal politics , " rwandan foreign minister louise mushikiwabo told reporters on the sidelines of the gathering .
" we would like the spanish people to get to know rwanda 's president kagame better .
he is not what we see him portrayed as . "
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos took zapatero 's place at the meeting , also attended by un secretary-general ban ki-moon who met zapatero separately .
ban " expressed his concerns " that the recent murder of opposition official andre kagwa rwisereka and journalist jean leonard rugambage has " caused political tensions " in rwanda ahead of august 9 presidential elections , his spokeswoman said .
the venue for the meeting was moved from the seat of government , moncloa palace , to a hotel .

" in china , i experienced an advanced country that is developing itself and making strides toward the future - but that also bears its traditions in mind , " said freddy tsimba from kinshasa , the capital of the democratic republic of congo .
" the situation in dr congo seemed so chaotic to me .
nothing really worked well - neither the police , nor the transportation system nor the political system , " said pak chuen sheung from hong kong , immediately excusing himself , should he come across as being impolite .
both men are artists taking part in the " brave new worlds " project at the theater der welt -lrb- theater of the world -rrb- festival in germany 's ruhr valley - part of this year 's european capital of culture programming .
there 's a world of distance separating the capital of an african nation shattered by civil war and the busy textile center of a nation that is among the most powerful in the world .
those economic and political contingencies affected not only the observations of the " brave new worlds " artists , but also their creative output .
' made in china ' a cultural center in muelheim , germany , was transformed into an open studio for the project .
there , vitshois mwilambwe spread balls of yarn out on a large table .
every size and color was represented ; some unraveled while others were still tightly coiled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one congolese artist used yarn to refer to china 's export dominance in africa " these days , our culture is dominated by products from china , " said vitshois .
" these colors symbolize ' made in china . '
nearly everything that you can find at the markets in kinshasa - whether it 's t-shirts , sneakers , bags , suitcases or toys - was manufactured in china . "
freddy tsimba put together an imposing installation made up of machetes , which were china 's first mass export to reach dr congo and continue to sell extremely well there .
they are used as farm tools , but the swords also invoke the violence and genocide the region has witnessed .
photography banned pak chuen sheung found numerous traces and remnants of war in dr congo - an unsettling experience for an artist more accustomed to the bustling world of finance and markets .
for instance , he brought a few small toy soldiers dressed for war that he found in the markets of kinshasa .
his colleague jiang jun described sensing aggression and tension everywhere he went in dr congo .
he took around 4,000 photos during his trip and said , with a touch of pride , " there , photography is illegal , but i did it anyway .
everyone is angry when photographed .
that 's totally different for us in china , where you can photograph everything . "
during his trip to dr congo , architect chen shuyu gave five congolese colleagues a small amount of money and let them decide what they would like to buy .
then he photographed them with their purchases .
his subjects included a mother who purchased a small toy and a backpack for her child and a young man who bought flip flops .
their choices represent the everyday items that many in dr congo can not afford .
bildunterschrift : some africans seek employment opportunities in china 's big cities , but live relatively isolated lives worlds apart " the point of the project was to encourage the artists to think about the roles of their respective countries - it 's a process , a work in progress , " said one curator of the project , els silvrants of belgium .
as such , the conversations stimulated by " brave new worlds " are more important than the artistic results alone .
it 's also an experiment that shows how difficult it can be for people from such different culture to see eye-to-eye , despite the participants ' best efforts .
many africans share mwilambe 's view that chinese products dominate africa , while many chinese may agree with artist jiang jun , when he said : " many africans come to china because they want to work with us and live with us . "
according to the artists , the image of china in africa is heavily influenced by the mass-produced items that find their way there along with massive , complex building projects , while the image of africa in china is influenced by the skyscrapers in chinese cities in which african laborers live communally and without contact to their neighbors .
architect cheng shuyu views the entire situation rather critically .
" what i saw in the markets in kinshasa were the cheapest , most artificially reproduced things - objects that we in china have not needed for a long time .
that 's somehow troubling .
it 's strange that all of these cheap products are flooding kinshasa , while we in china are trying to accommodate ourselves to western standards . "
els silvrants acknowledges that china is after sturdy raw materials in africa , but still she sees china as a possible way into the future for africa .
" it 's a different future than is available in europe , where so many restrictions exist and so many debates about values take place , " said silvrants .
europe turning its back ?
in this discourse , europe is largely neglected .
it plays almost no role other than occasionally being described as arrogant or withdrawn .
" why is africa turning to china ?
because europe is turning away , " said tsimba .
" china is willing to give us year-long visas , but being able to stay in europe is extremely hard . "
indeed , three of artists participating in the brave new worlds exhibition were unable to travel to germany for the show because they did not receive visas .
on the other hand , one congolese participant was also denied entry into china .
in her passport , her occupation is listed as journalist .

thousands of people marched through warsaw - thousands also opposed the event . the landmark gay rights rally in the polish capital was the first europride parade ever to take place behind the cold war iron curtain . the event was small by its own standards , with police estimating about 8,000 people took part this year , as opposed to 50,000 at last year 's march in zurich and more than a million in madrid three years ago . nevertheless , politicians from countries like great britain , sweden and germany also plan to take part in the rally , which will focus on a call for legal recognition of same-sex partnerships .
polish officials , however , are not expected at the rally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer people participated in the warsaw march than in other years and cities despite marching with banners calling for new civil partnership laws , participants at the parade admitted that the legal situation for homosexuals in poland was unlikely to change . " we 're hoping to open up a debate on the topic of affording legal status to the partnerships of gay and lesbian couples but we 're not optimistic such legislation will be passed anytime soon , " jacek adler , editor in chief of the www.gaylife.pl polish gay lifestyle website , told the afp news agency . local backlash the parade is facing strong opposition in largely catholic and conservative poland ; some 55,000 people have signed a petition which describes europride as " an obscene event of filth and perversion . "
counter-protesters chanted , " no to sodom and gomorrah , " while one man distributed copies of the old testament . opinion polls have shown that as much as 80 percent of poles oppose gay marriage and 93 percent say gay and lesbian couples should not be permitted to adopt children .
two-thirds of the polish population oppose gay demonstrations . gay rights were repressed during the communist era , and gays and lesbians have struggled since communism fell 20 years ago for acceptance in a society still strongly influenced by the church . poland 's conservative opposition , led by jaroslaw kaczynski , is against the recognition of homosexual partnerships .
kaczynski 's twin brother , recently deceased former president lech kaczynski banned a similar demonstration in warsaw in 2005 when he was mayor of the city . conservatives are planning a counter-demonstration on the streets of warsaw in response . " politicians are afraid of us and would rather ignore this topic , " said tomasz baczkowski from the " equality " foundation , which has helped organize the event . author : mark hallam -lrb- afp , dpa , ap -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a decision on the matter is expected next week . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- failed to reach a decision saturday on whether to send an international police mission into kyrgyzstan to help authorities restore stability after a government overthrow in april and ethnic violence in june , which human rights groups say claimed up to 2,000 lives . though the decision has been put off until a thursday meeting in vienna .
but the osce 's meetings are on track , according to sources close to german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who along with his french counterpart bernard kouchner , called saturday 's meeting in kazakhstan . herbert salber , the head of the osce 's conflict prevention center , also remained confident that the mission would go forward . " our proposal to send police officers to kyrgyzstan is being assessed by osce member-countries , " he said .
" i think in the next few weeks , we will see their first arrivals . " twin missions ? the police advisory group currently being discussed by the osce would only be concerned with maintaining the fragile peace in the country ; 52 officers would be sent for the first four months , with the option for a further 50 after time .

" the clashes were the culmination of repeated unrest and the mass displacement of citizens which began during the ousting of president kurmanbek bakiyev in early april . otunbayeva 's interim government is promising elections in october , and is seeking to reform the country into a parliamentary democracy , in a region where autocratic governments are more commonplace . author : mark hallam / david levitz -lrb- afp / apn / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 17.07.2010 chinese and congolese artists explore their countries ' ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty is widespread in kinshasa one country devastated by violence , the other poised to become an economic superpower : congolese and chinese artists teamed up for a unique project which reveals how the countries view each other . " in china , i experienced an advanced country that is developing itself and making strides toward the future - but that also bears its traditions in mind , " said freddy tsimba from kinshasa , the capital of the democratic republic of congo .
" the situation in dr congo seemed so chaotic to me .
nothing really worked well - neither the police , nor the transportation system nor the political system , " said pak chuen sheung from hong kong , immediately excusing himself , should he come across as being impolite .
both men are artists taking part in the " brave new worlds " project at the theater der welt -lrb- theater of the world -rrb- festival in germany 's ruhr valley - part of this year 's european capital of culture programming .
there 's a world of distance separating the capital of an african nation shattered by civil war and the busy textile center of a nation that is among the most powerful in the world .
those economic and political contingencies affected not only the observations of the " brave new worlds " artists , but also their creative output .
' made in china ' a cultural center in muelheim , germany , was transformed into an open studio for the project .
there , vitshois mwilambwe spread balls of yarn out on a large table .
every size and color was represented ; some unraveled while others were still tightly coiled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one congolese artist used yarn to refer to china 's export dominance in africa " these days , our culture is dominated by products from china , " said vitshois .
" these colors symbolize ' made in china . '
nearly everything that you can find at the markets in kinshasa - whether it 's t-shirts , sneakers , bags , suitcases or toys - was manufactured in china . "
freddy tsimba put together an imposing installation made up of machetes , which were china 's first mass export to reach dr congo and continue to sell extremely well there .
they are used as farm tools , but the swords also invoke the violence and genocide the region has witnessed .
photography banned pak chuen sheung found numerous traces and remnants of war in dr congo - an unsettling experience for an artist more accustomed to the bustling world of finance and markets .
for instance , he brought a few small toy soldiers dressed for war that he found in the markets of kinshasa .
his colleague jiang jun described sensing aggression and tension everywhere he went in dr congo .
he took around 4,000 photos during his trip and said , with a touch of pride , " there , photography is illegal , but i did it anyway .
everyone is angry when photographed .
that 's totally different for us in china , where you can photograph everything . "
during his trip to dr congo , architect chen shuyu gave five congolese colleagues a small amount of money and let them decide what they would like to buy .
then he photographed them with their purchases .
his subjects included a mother who purchased a small toy and a backpack for her child and a young man who bought flip flops .
their choices represent the everyday items that many in dr congo can not afford .
bildunterschrift : some africans seek employment opportunities in china 's big cities , but live relatively isolated lives worlds apart " the point of the project was to encourage the artists to think about the roles of their respective countries - it 's a process , a work in progress , " said one curator of the project , els silvrants of belgium .
as such , the conversations stimulated by " brave new worlds " are more important than the artistic results alone .
it 's also an experiment that shows how difficult it can be for people from such different culture to see eye-to-eye , despite the participants ' best efforts .
many africans share mwilambe 's view that chinese products dominate africa , while many chinese may agree with artist jiang jun , when he said : " many africans come to china because they want to work with us and live with us . "
according to the artists , the image of china in africa is heavily influenced by the mass-produced items that find their way there along with massive , complex building projects , while the image of africa in china is influenced by the skyscrapers in chinese cities in which african laborers live communally and without contact to their neighbors .
architect cheng shuyu views the entire situation rather critically .
" what i saw in the markets in kinshasa were the cheapest , most artificially reproduced things - objects that we in china have not needed for a long time .
that 's somehow troubling .
it 's strange that all of these cheap products are flooding kinshasa , while we in china are trying to accommodate ourselves to western standards . "
els silvrants acknowledges that china is after sturdy raw materials in africa , but still she sees china as a possible way into the future for africa .
" it 's a different future than is available in europe , where so many restrictions exist and so many debates about values take place , " said silvrants .
europe turning its back ?
in this discourse , europe is largely neglected .
it plays almost no role other than occasionally being described as arrogant or withdrawn .
" why is africa turning to china ?
because europe is turning away , " said tsimba .
" china is willing to give us year-long visas , but being able to stay in europe is extremely hard . "
indeed , three of artists participating in the brave new worlds exhibition were unable to travel to germany for the show because they did not receive visas .
on the other hand , one congolese participant was also denied entry into china .
in her passport , her occupation is listed as journalist .

" in china , i experienced an advanced country that is developing itself and making strides toward the future - but that also bears its traditions in mind , " said freddy tsimba from kinshasa , the capital of the democratic republic of congo .
" the situation in dr congo seemed so chaotic to me .
nothing really worked well - neither the police , nor the transportation system nor the political system , " said pak chuen sheung from hong kong , immediately excusing himself , should he come across as being impolite .
both men are artists taking part in the " brave new worlds " project at the theater der welt -lrb- theater of the world -rrb- festival in germany 's ruhr valley - part of this year 's european capital of culture programming .
there 's a world of distance separating the capital of an african nation shattered by civil war and the busy textile center of a nation that is among the most powerful in the world .
those economic and political contingencies affected not only the observations of the " brave new worlds " artists , but also their creative output .
' made in china ' a cultural center in muelheim , germany , was transformed into an open studio for the project .
there , vitshois mwilambwe spread balls of yarn out on a large table .
every size and color was represented ; some unraveled while others were still tightly coiled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one congolese artist used yarn to refer to china 's export dominance in africa " these days , our culture is dominated by products from china , " said vitshois .
" these colors symbolize ' made in china . '
nearly everything that you can find at the markets in kinshasa - whether it 's t-shirts , sneakers , bags , suitcases or toys - was manufactured in china . "
freddy tsimba put together an imposing installation made up of machetes , which were china 's first mass export to reach dr congo and continue to sell extremely well there .
they are used as farm tools , but the swords also invoke the violence and genocide the region has witnessed .
photography banned pak chuen sheung found numerous traces and remnants of war in dr congo - an unsettling experience for an artist more accustomed to the bustling world of finance and markets .
for instance , he brought a few small toy soldiers dressed for war that he found in the markets of kinshasa .
his colleague jiang jun described sensing aggression and tension everywhere he went in dr congo .
he took around 4,000 photos during his trip and said , with a touch of pride , " there , photography is illegal , but i did it anyway .
everyone is angry when photographed .
that 's totally different for us in china , where you can photograph everything . "
during his trip to dr congo , architect chen shuyu gave five congolese colleagues a small amount of money and let them decide what they would like to buy .
then he photographed them with their purchases .
his subjects included a mother who purchased a small toy and a backpack for her child and a young man who bought flip flops .
their choices represent the everyday items that many in dr congo can not afford .
bildunterschrift : some africans seek employment opportunities in china 's big cities , but live relatively isolated lives worlds apart " the point of the project was to encourage the artists to think about the roles of their respective countries - it 's a process , a work in progress , " said one curator of the project , els silvrants of belgium .
as such , the conversations stimulated by " brave new worlds " are more important than the artistic results alone .
it 's also an experiment that shows how difficult it can be for people from such different culture to see eye-to-eye , despite the participants ' best efforts .
many africans share mwilambe 's view that chinese products dominate africa , while many chinese may agree with artist jiang jun , when he said : " many africans come to china because they want to work with us and live with us . "
according to the artists , the image of china in africa is heavily influenced by the mass-produced items that find their way there along with massive , complex building projects , while the image of africa in china is influenced by the skyscrapers in chinese cities in which african laborers live communally and without contact to their neighbors .
architect cheng shuyu views the entire situation rather critically .
" what i saw in the markets in kinshasa were the cheapest , most artificially reproduced things - objects that we in china have not needed for a long time .
that 's somehow troubling .
it 's strange that all of these cheap products are flooding kinshasa , while we in china are trying to accommodate ourselves to western standards . "
els silvrants acknowledges that china is after sturdy raw materials in africa , but still she sees china as a possible way into the future for africa .
" it 's a different future than is available in europe , where so many restrictions exist and so many debates about values take place , " said silvrants .
europe turning its back ?
in this discourse , europe is largely neglected .
it plays almost no role other than occasionally being described as arrogant or withdrawn .
" why is africa turning to china ?
because europe is turning away , " said tsimba .
" china is willing to give us year-long visas , but being able to stay in europe is extremely hard . "
indeed , three of artists participating in the brave new worlds exhibition were unable to travel to germany for the show because they did not receive visas .
on the other hand , one congolese participant was also denied entry into china .
in her passport , her occupation is listed as journalist .
