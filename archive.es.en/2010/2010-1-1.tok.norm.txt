the journalists were in the country working on a documentary for french public television . french defense minister herve morin , who was visiting french troops in afghanistan thursday , confirmed that the journalists have been missing since wednesday .
the two , a reporter and a cameraman , were working on a documentary for french public broadcaster france televisions .
they were kidnapped in kapisa province , about 60 kilometers from kabul .
their afghan translator and the translator 's brother and cousin were also seized . " we have no news of the two french journalists , who said yesterday they were leaving on reportage in kapisa , " morin said , adding there had been no claim for their disappearance from any group .
" we ca n't rule out any hypothesis and are doing everything to make contact with them , " he added .
french troops have begun a search in kapisa for the kidnapped party .
kidnapping on the rise criminal groups and taliban insurgents have kidnapped several dozen foreigners , many of them journalists , since the 2001 us-led invasion ousted the taliban regime in kabul . the latest kidnapping comes just weeks after two afghan and an iraqi journalist on assignment for a british newspaper were abducted and released after six days .
last month , two other journalists , one norwegian and one canadian , were also kidnapped and later released by militants .
in the past , many of those kidnapped were freed after ransom payments or prisoner swaps .
however , a number of hostages were also executed , with captors saying their demands had not been met. mk / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

home fans had little to celebrate as the germans trailed the pack . austria 's defending world cup champion gregor schlierenzauer made up for his poor start to the tournament leaping 136.5 and 137.5 meters to post a winning score of 277.7 points in garmisch-partenkirchen in southern germany .

his compatriot wolfgang loitzl twice jumped 135 meters to come in second on 272.5 points .
although switzerland 's simon ammann set a new venue record with a leap of 143.5 meters , it was n't enough to make up for an earlier jump of 132 meters , and he finished in third place on 272.4 points .

he put the poor start down to a stomach infection .
kofler retains four hills lead the winner of oberstdorf , austrian andreas kofler , came fourth in garmisch-partenkirchen .
he scored 271.9 points with jumps of 136 and 137 meters , though he still retains the lead in the four-venue competition as it prepares to head down to austria .

home fans had little to celebrate as the germans trailed the pack . austria 's defending world cup champion gregor schlierenzauer made up for his poor start to the tournament leaping 136.5 and 137.5 meters to post a winning score of 277.7 points in garmisch-partenkirchen in southern germany .

his compatriot wolfgang loitzl twice jumped 135 meters to come in second on 272.5 points .
although switzerland 's simon ammann set a new venue record with a leap of 143.5 meters , it was n't enough to make up for an earlier jump of 132 meters , and he finished in third place on 272.4 points .

he put the poor start down to a stomach infection .
kofler retains four hills lead the winner of oberstdorf , austrian andreas kofler , came fourth in garmisch-partenkirchen .
he scored 271.9 points with jumps of 136 and 137 meters , though he still retains the lead in the four-venue competition as it prepares to head down to austria .

zapatero , who has led his country since 2004 , said achieving an eu-wide economic recovery would come from making european economies " more productive , innovative and sustainable . "
" europe needs far-reaching changes " he said however that this should not be accomplished at the expense of ordinary europeans .
" to achieve this we must rely on both workers and businesses , to make our companies more productive and our workforce better qualified without losing sight of that great european symbol : the welfare state and social policies , " zapatero said friday in a video posted on the spanish government 's official eu presidency web site .
" in addition to this priority , the key objective for this new period in the european union after the lisbon treaty is to make europe an increasingly important player on the international stage , " he added .
" europe has been in need of more far-reaching changes for some time .
it needs its citizens to feel closer to its institutions and understand that the basic reference point of the european organization , the european government and the 27 european union member states , is the policies and initiatives which directly affect its people . "
spain has work cut out zapatero 's comments at a time when spain faces severe challenges to its own economy at home .
with unemployment at about 20 percent and the downgrading this month of its debt outlook by ratings agency standard & poor 's , spain is among the worst affected by the economic crisis and may struggle to pursue an ambitious economic agenda .
spain assumed the eu presidency from sweden , which led the bloc for the previous six months .
madrid 's tenure as chief coordinator of eu events for the next half year comes following the ratification and enactment of the reforming lisbon treaty .
unlike any previous eu president nation , spain must now work alongside a new full-time eu president - belgian herman van rompuy - and foreign policy chief - briton catherine ashton. dfm / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ inflammable and other materials that can be used to make explosives should not be available in duty-free stores , ” rainer wendt , the head of germany 's police union -lrb- dpoig -rrb- , said .
“ these include high-percentage alcohol beverages , perfumes , and chemical substances such as cleaning materials .
everything needs to be checked .
if necessary , dangerous materials should be taken off the shelves , ” he said .
in an interview with newspaper neuen osnabruecker zeitung , wendt called for an eu-wide ban on potentially dangerous products .
he also said restaurants in airport terminals should stop using metal cutlery .
" the security interests of citizens need to have priority over economic interests , " wendt said .
pilots ' group skeptical of ban unions representing pilots in germany are also concerned about the easy availability of potentially dangerous duty-free goods at airports .
but some remain doubtful whether a ban would make a difference .
“ of course we can think about what products might be used , to put it bluntly , blow a plane up out of the sky .
we are very concerned about this , " joerg handwerg , spokesman for the pilot 's association , said .
" but whether banning razor blades is going to be the answer , i doubt whether this is the answer . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de insurance -pipe- 01.01.2010 insurance giant warns of rising costs due to climate change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia suffered the most deadly natural disaster in 2009 when an earthquake killed 1,200 people a report by german insurance company munich re says 2009 was a year of relatively few natural disasters .
but it warns that climate change remains a threat in 2010 and beyond , impacting on insurance costs . in an annual look at the cost of natural disasters , munich re , one of the world 's largest reinsurers , said that natural catastrophes took many fewer lives and caused much less damage on average in 2009 than in the previous decade .
it put the death toll in 2009 at " around 10,000 , " well below the average of 75,000 in each of the past 10 years .
the single most deadly event was a 7.6 magnitude earthquake in indonesia on september 30 , killing nearly 1,200 people in and around the city of padang , on the island of sumatra .
asian storms meanwhile killed thousands more and caused widespread damage in the philippines , vietnam and taiwan .
lower insurers ' losses the munich-based company said that in monetary terms too , 2009 losses were also much lower than in previous years .
the report pointed out that insurers ' losses from natural disasters fell by more than half in 2009 , thanks to fewer hurricanes and earthquakes , although climate change contributed to a significant increase in damages and losses in the us .
it said insured losses came in at 15.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- this year , down from nearly 35 billion euros in 2008 .
it said total economic losses , including losses not covered by insurance , fell 75 percent to 35 billion euros from 139 billion euros in the previous year .
the most expensive single event was klaus , a winter storm that hit northern spain and southwestern france in january 2009 .
klaus left more than one million people without electricity while causing economic losses of over 3.5 billion euros and insured losses of about 2 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a storm that hit spain and france in january proved the single most expensive event weather-related catastrophes " despite the lack of severe hurricanes and other mega catastrophes , there were a large number of moderately severe natural catastrophes , " munich re ’ s head of geo risk research , peter hoeppe , pointed out , warning that " the trend towards an increase in weather-related catastrophes continues . "
he believes that the catastrophes are related to climate change , and that at least part of the cause must lie at the location of the disasters .

zapatero , who has led his country since 2004 , said achieving an eu-wide economic recovery would come from making european economies " more productive , innovative and sustainable . "
" europe needs far-reaching changes " he said however that this should not be accomplished at the expense of ordinary europeans .
" to achieve this we must rely on both workers and businesses , to make our companies more productive and our workforce better qualified without losing sight of that great european symbol : the welfare state and social policies , " zapatero said friday in a video posted on the spanish government 's official eu presidency web site .
" in addition to this priority , the key objective for this new period in the european union after the lisbon treaty is to make europe an increasingly important player on the international stage , " he added .
" europe has been in need of more far-reaching changes for some time .
it needs its citizens to feel closer to its institutions and understand that the basic reference point of the european organization , the european government and the 27 european union member states , is the policies and initiatives which directly affect its people . "
spain has work cut out zapatero 's comments at a time when spain faces severe challenges to its own economy at home .
with unemployment at about 20 percent and the downgrading this month of its debt outlook by ratings agency standard & poor 's , spain is among the worst affected by the economic crisis and may struggle to pursue an ambitious economic agenda .
spain assumed the eu presidency from sweden , which led the bloc for the previous six months .
madrid 's tenure as chief coordinator of eu events for the next half year comes following the ratification and enactment of the reforming lisbon treaty .
unlike any previous eu president nation , spain must now work alongside a new full-time eu president - belgian herman van rompuy - and foreign policy chief - briton catherine ashton. dfm / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ inflammable and other materials that can be used to make explosives should not be available in duty-free stores , ” rainer wendt , the head of germany 's police union -lrb- dpoig -rrb- , said .
“ these include high-percentage alcohol beverages , perfumes , and chemical substances such as cleaning materials .
everything needs to be checked .
if necessary , dangerous materials should be taken off the shelves , ” he said .
in an interview with newspaper neuen osnabruecker zeitung , wendt called for an eu-wide ban on potentially dangerous products .
he also said restaurants in airport terminals should stop using metal cutlery .
" the security interests of citizens need to have priority over economic interests , " wendt said .
pilots ' group skeptical of ban unions representing pilots in germany are also concerned about the easy availability of potentially dangerous duty-free goods at airports .
but some remain doubtful whether a ban would make a difference .
“ of course we can think about what products might be used , to put it bluntly , blow a plane up out of the sky .
we are very concerned about this , " joerg handwerg , spokesman for the pilot 's association , said .
" but whether banning razor blades is going to be the answer , i doubt whether this is the answer . ”

privacy concerns have prevented the use of such scanners .
but the netherlands has said it would start using the scanners at schiphol airport in amsterdam by the end of january .
british prime minister gordon brown too has ordered airport security arrangements to be reviewed , and is keen to introduce the scanners at british airports as soon as possible .
“ the failed attack in detroit on christmas day reminds us of a deeper reality : that almost 10 years after september 11th international terrorism is still a very real threat , " brown said this week .

spain takes over the european union 's rotating presidency , just as the role is being downgraded in the bloc 's institutional shake-up . the lisbon treaty , which came into force at the beginning of december , means spain 's eu presidency will be somewhat different from preceding ones .
the idea behind the lisbon treaty was to make the european union more effective and efficient as a world player .
instead , the institutional shake-up is producing an element of confusion as eu officials get used to the new rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van rompuy 's role is still being defined one of the key issues as the treaty comes into play and spain assumes its new role will be the resulting balance of power .
the lisbon treaty created positions for the bloc 's two new leaders : herman van rompuy , who takes on the role of president of the european council , and catherine ashton , who is taking charge of eu foreign policy .
until now , that job has belonged to the eu 's rotating presidency , passed around the 27 member states every six months : an expensive logistical exercise , which often confused governments outside europe .
balancing act as rompuy and ashton begin to take over some of the main responsibilities of the rotating presidency , it may come as a surprise to some that it still even exists .
that it does reflects the desires of national governments who are unwilling to give up their turn at the helm .
despite the position 's downgraded role , eu member states still want to maintain their influence in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's turn with the eu presidency will set a new precedent spanish foreign minister michel angel moratinos , whose government inherits the rotating presidency from sweden at the start of 2010 , insists he will not try and dominate .
" the lisbon treaty is the beginning of a new europe - this europe will be led by the president of the permanent council , mr. van rompuy , and by the high representative and vice-president of the european commission -lsb- ashton -rsb- , " moratinos said .
" therefore , it will be up to them , to these two people , to manage , to boost , to represent the eu in the first half of 2010 . "
that may be true in principal , but in the case of high representative ashton , moratinos may often have to step in to deputize , given the amount of travel ashton is expected to undertake .
as for president van rompuy , he will be expected to chair eu summits .
spain will take charge of general affairs , which includes justice and home affairs , economic policies , the environment , agriculture , and fisheries .
eu transparency advocates of the new system say it makes sense , arguing that the only area that required a single representative was foreign affairs .
germany 's martin schulz is the leader of the social democratic party in the european parliament , and he believes the old system was flawed .
according to schulz , leaders such as french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel played tactics and kept their cards close to their chests .
" thank goodness that has come to an end , " said the european parliamentarian .
" we now have the lisbon treaty , which gives a little bit more transparency .
it 's still too early to tell if the eu will really become more transparent , but eu diplomats insist the lisbon treaty will bring more consistency and coherence to the eu 's external representation .
foreign policy questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ashton 's position is a large question mark for some a lot of that , however , depends on the role that is now being filled by catherine ashton , even though she has little in the way of foreign policy experience .
the spanish government says it will support ashton in her efforts to build up the eu 's new diplomatic corps .
analysts say that will involve trying to suppress a brewing mutiny among eu member states to win back control lost under lisbon .
however , swedish prime minister frederik reinfeldt , head of the country ending its run as chair of the eu presidency , sees the lisbon treaty as a good thing for democracy .
" " now the new president of the eu council will ensure continuity , the high representative will assure coordination in our external relations , " he said . " now we will have a more democratic union with a greater involvement of the european parliament and of our national parliaments . "
the eu begins 2010 facing the daunting task of getting itself up and operational under a completely new set of rules .

the journalists were in the country working on a documentary for french public television . french defense minister herve morin , who was visiting french troops in afghanistan thursday , confirmed that the journalists have been missing since wednesday .
the two , a reporter and a cameraman , were working on a documentary for french public broadcaster france televisions .
they were kidnapped in kapisa province , about 60 kilometers from kabul .
their afghan translator and the translator 's brother and cousin were also seized . " we have no news of the two french journalists , who said yesterday they were leaving on reportage in kapisa , " morin said , adding there had been no claim for their disappearance from any group .
" we ca n't rule out any hypothesis and are doing everything to make contact with them , " he added .
french troops have begun a search in kapisa for the kidnapped party .
kidnapping on the rise criminal groups and taliban insurgents have kidnapped several dozen foreigners , many of them journalists , since the 2001 us-led invasion ousted the taliban regime in kabul . the latest kidnapping comes just weeks after two afghan and an iraqi journalist on assignment for a british newspaper were abducted and released after six days .
last month , two other journalists , one norwegian and one canadian , were also kidnapped and later released by militants .
in the past , many of those kidnapped were freed after ransom payments or prisoner swaps .
however , a number of hostages were also executed , with captors saying their demands had not been met. mk / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.01.2010 eu presidency power-sharing takes effect großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lisbon treaty : simplifying or stupifying ?
spain takes over the european union 's rotating presidency , just as the role is being downgraded in the bloc 's institutional shake-up . the lisbon treaty , which came into force at the beginning of december , means spain 's eu presidency will be somewhat different from preceding ones .
the idea behind the lisbon treaty was to make the european union more effective and efficient as a world player .
instead , the institutional shake-up is producing an element of confusion as eu officials get used to the new rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van rompuy 's role is still being defined one of the key issues as the treaty comes into play and spain assumes its new role will be the resulting balance of power .
the lisbon treaty created positions for the bloc 's two new leaders : herman van rompuy , who takes on the role of president of the european council , and catherine ashton , who is taking charge of eu foreign policy .
until now , that job has belonged to the eu 's rotating presidency , passed around the 27 member states every six months : an expensive logistical exercise , which often confused governments outside europe .
balancing act as rompuy and ashton begin to take over some of the main responsibilities of the rotating presidency , it may come as a surprise to some that it still even exists .
that it does reflects the desires of national governments who are unwilling to give up their turn at the helm .
despite the position 's downgraded role , eu member states still want to maintain their influence in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's turn with the eu presidency will set a new precedent spanish foreign minister michel angel moratinos , whose government inherits the rotating presidency from sweden at the start of 2010 , insists he will not try and dominate .
" the lisbon treaty is the beginning of a new europe - this europe will be led by the president of the permanent council , mr. van rompuy , and by the high representative and vice-president of the european commission -lsb- ashton -rsb- , " moratinos said .
" therefore , it will be up to them , to these two people , to manage , to boost , to represent the eu in the first half of 2010 . "
that may be true in principal , but in the case of high representative ashton , moratinos may often have to step in to deputize , given the amount of travel ashton is expected to undertake .
as for president van rompuy , he will be expected to chair eu summits .
spain will take charge of general affairs , which includes justice and home affairs , economic policies , the environment , agriculture , and fisheries .
eu transparency advocates of the new system say it makes sense , arguing that the only area that required a single representative was foreign affairs .
germany 's martin schulz is the leader of the social democratic party in the european parliament , and he believes the old system was flawed .
according to schulz , leaders such as french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel played tactics and kept their cards close to their chests .
" thank goodness that has come to an end , " said the european parliamentarian .
" we now have the lisbon treaty , which gives a little bit more transparency .
it 's still too early to tell if the eu will really become more transparent , but eu diplomats insist the lisbon treaty will bring more consistency and coherence to the eu 's external representation .
foreign policy questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ashton 's position is a large question mark for some a lot of that , however , depends on the role that is now being filled by catherine ashton , even though she has little in the way of foreign policy experience .
the spanish government says it will support ashton in her efforts to build up the eu 's new diplomatic corps .
analysts say that will involve trying to suppress a brewing mutiny among eu member states to win back control lost under lisbon .
however , swedish prime minister frederik reinfeldt , head of the country ending its run as chair of the eu presidency , sees the lisbon treaty as a good thing for democracy .
" " now the new president of the eu council will ensure continuity , the high representative will assure coordination in our external relations , " he said . " now we will have a more democratic union with a greater involvement of the european parliament and of our national parliaments . "
the eu begins 2010 facing the daunting task of getting itself up and operational under a completely new set of rules .

but it warns that climate change remains a threat in 2010 and beyond , impacting on insurance costs . in an annual look at the cost of natural disasters , munich re , one of the world 's largest reinsurers , said that natural catastrophes took many fewer lives and caused much less damage on average in 2009 than in the previous decade .
it put the death toll in 2009 at " around 10,000 , " well below the average of 75,000 in each of the past 10 years .
the single most deadly event was a 7.6 magnitude earthquake in indonesia on september 30 , killing nearly 1,200 people in and around the city of padang , on the island of sumatra .
asian storms meanwhile killed thousands more and caused widespread damage in the philippines , vietnam and taiwan .
lower insurers ' losses the munich-based company said that in monetary terms too , 2009 losses were also much lower than in previous years .
the report pointed out that insurers ' losses from natural disasters fell by more than half in 2009 , thanks to fewer hurricanes and earthquakes , although climate change contributed to a significant increase in damages and losses in the us .
it said insured losses came in at 15.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- this year , down from nearly 35 billion euros in 2008 .
it said total economic losses , including losses not covered by insurance , fell 75 percent to 35 billion euros from 139 billion euros in the previous year .
the most expensive single event was klaus , a winter storm that hit northern spain and southwestern france in january 2009 .
klaus left more than one million people without electricity while causing economic losses of over 3.5 billion euros and insured losses of about 2 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a storm that hit spain and france in january proved the single most expensive event weather-related catastrophes " despite the lack of severe hurricanes and other mega catastrophes , there were a large number of moderately severe natural catastrophes , " munich re ’ s head of geo risk research , peter hoeppe , pointed out , warning that " the trend towards an increase in weather-related catastrophes continues . "
he believes that the catastrophes are related to climate change , and that at least part of the cause must lie at the location of the disasters .
" and we know from climate scientists that because some changes have occurred , that it has become warmer , that there is more humidity in the atmosphere because the oceans have warmed up as well .
everything we learn from climate scientists fits together perfectly - that climate change is causing extreme weather events to intensify . "
copenhagen fallout munich re company board member torsten jeworrek expressed disappointment at the lack of a significant breakthrough at the copenhagen climate summit in december , especially given an almost three-fold rise in weather-related natural catastrophes since 1950 .
" we need as soon as possible an agreement that significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions because the climate reacts slowly and what we fail to do now will have a bearing for decades to come , " jeworrek said .
the munich re report warned that climate change remains a threat in 2010 and the decades to come , adding that the failed copenhagen summit is bound to make insurance costs rise in the future. rb / afp / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it warns that climate change remains a threat in 2010 and beyond , impacting on insurance costs . in an annual look at the cost of natural disasters , munich re , one of the world 's largest reinsurers , said that natural catastrophes took many fewer lives and caused much less damage on average in 2009 than in the previous decade .
it put the death toll in 2009 at " around 10,000 , " well below the average of 75,000 in each of the past 10 years .
the single most deadly event was a 7.6 magnitude earthquake in indonesia on september 30 , killing nearly 1,200 people in and around the city of padang , on the island of sumatra .
asian storms meanwhile killed thousands more and caused widespread damage in the philippines , vietnam and taiwan .
lower insurers ' losses the munich-based company said that in monetary terms too , 2009 losses were also much lower than in previous years .
the report pointed out that insurers ' losses from natural disasters fell by more than half in 2009 , thanks to fewer hurricanes and earthquakes , although climate change contributed to a significant increase in damages and losses in the us .
it said insured losses came in at 15.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- this year , down from nearly 35 billion euros in 2008 .
it said total economic losses , including losses not covered by insurance , fell 75 percent to 35 billion euros from 139 billion euros in the previous year .
the most expensive single event was klaus , a winter storm that hit northern spain and southwestern france in january 2009 .
klaus left more than one million people without electricity while causing economic losses of over 3.5 billion euros and insured losses of about 2 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a storm that hit spain and france in january proved the single most expensive event weather-related catastrophes " despite the lack of severe hurricanes and other mega catastrophes , there were a large number of moderately severe natural catastrophes , " munich re ’ s head of geo risk research , peter hoeppe , pointed out , warning that " the trend towards an increase in weather-related catastrophes continues . "
he believes that the catastrophes are related to climate change , and that at least part of the cause must lie at the location of the disasters .
" and we know from climate scientists that because some changes have occurred , that it has become warmer , that there is more humidity in the atmosphere because the oceans have warmed up as well .
everything we learn from climate scientists fits together perfectly - that climate change is causing extreme weather events to intensify . "
copenhagen fallout munich re company board member torsten jeworrek expressed disappointment at the lack of a significant breakthrough at the copenhagen climate summit in december , especially given an almost three-fold rise in weather-related natural catastrophes since 1950 .
" we need as soon as possible an agreement that significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions because the climate reacts slowly and what we fail to do now will have a bearing for decades to come , " jeworrek said .
the munich re report warned that climate change remains a threat in 2010 and the decades to come , adding that the failed copenhagen summit is bound to make insurance costs rise in the future. rb / afp / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

zapatero , who has led his country since 2004 , said achieving an eu-wide economic recovery would come from making european economies " more productive , innovative and sustainable . "
" europe needs far-reaching changes " he said however that this should not be accomplished at the expense of ordinary europeans .
" to achieve this we must rely on both workers and businesses , to make our companies more productive and our workforce better qualified without losing sight of that great european symbol : the welfare state and social policies , " zapatero said friday in a video posted on the spanish government 's official eu presidency web site .
" in addition to this priority , the key objective for this new period in the european union after the lisbon treaty is to make europe an increasingly important player on the international stage , " he added .
" europe has been in need of more far-reaching changes for some time .
it needs its citizens to feel closer to its institutions and understand that the basic reference point of the european organization , the european government and the 27 european union member states , is the policies and initiatives which directly affect its people . "
spain has work cut out zapatero 's comments at a time when spain faces severe challenges to its own economy at home .
with unemployment at about 20 percent and the downgrading this month of its debt outlook by ratings agency standard & poor 's , spain is among the worst affected by the economic crisis and may struggle to pursue an ambitious economic agenda .
spain assumed the eu presidency from sweden , which led the bloc for the previous six months .
madrid 's tenure as chief coordinator of eu events for the next half year comes following the ratification and enactment of the reforming lisbon treaty .
unlike any previous eu president nation , spain must now work alongside a new full-time eu president - belgian herman van rompuy - and foreign policy chief - briton catherine ashton. dfm / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spain takes over the european union 's rotating presidency , just as the role is being downgraded in the bloc 's institutional shake-up . the lisbon treaty , which came into force at the beginning of december , means spain 's eu presidency will be somewhat different from preceding ones .
the idea behind the lisbon treaty was to make the european union more effective and efficient as a world player .

home fans had little to celebrate as the germans trailed the pack . austria 's defending world cup champion gregor schlierenzauer made up for his poor start to the tournament leaping 136.5 and 137.5 meters to post a winning score of 277.7 points in garmisch-partenkirchen in southern germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's loitzl came second , a position he also retains in the standings .
his compatriot wolfgang loitzl twice jumped 135 meters to come in second on 272.5 points .
although switzerland 's simon ammann set a new venue record with a leap of 143.5 meters , it was n't enough to make up for an earlier jump of 132 meters , and he finished in third place on 272.4 points .
" the new year has started off well - that was really a perfect day , " said schlierenzauer , who only managed to place ninth on the first leg of the tournament in oberstdorf last tuesday .
he put the poor start down to a stomach infection .
kofler retains four hills lead the winner of oberstdorf , austrian andreas kofler , came fourth in garmisch-partenkirchen .
he scored 271.9 points with jumps of 136 and 137 meters , though he still retains the lead in the four-venue competition as it prepares to head down to austria .
his nearest rival in the four hills standings is fellow austrian loitzl , who is twenty points behind .
another five points behind him is finnish five-time overall winner janne ahonen .
the mainly german crowd of 25,000 spectators had little to cheer for .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope wants people to remember that they are the planet 's caretakers a month after world leaders gathered in copenhagen to try to secure a global deal to tackle climate change , the german-born pontiff said individual and community level action was just as important to address the problem .
" i would like to underline the importance of the choices of individuals , families and local administrations in preserving the environment , " he told thousands of worshippers at st. peter 's square in rome , adding that " ecological responsibility " should become part of the education syllabus .
the catholic church has become increasingly outspoken on environmental issues under benedict and his predecessor john paul ii .
last month benedict called on rich nations to acknowledge their historical responsibility for climate change .
celebration of diversity world peace has long been one of the central messages of the church and the pope returned to this theme again as he heralded in 2010 , calling on humans to show more tolerance for each other as societies become more diverse .
" respect others , regardless of their skin colour , nationality , language , religion … it is important to be taught to respect others , even when they are different to us " , benedict said .
the pontiff also said it was becoming increasingly common for schools to have children of different backgrounds , and that it was important children learn at an early age to accept those different from themselves .
" their faces represent the prophecy of humanity that we are invited to develop : a family of families and peoples . "
in his first angelus blessing of the year , the pope decried war , saying too often conflict and violence ruined the lives of the young , leaving children 's faces " sunken by hunger and illness , disfigured by pain and hopelessness .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.01.2010 spanish eu presidency to focus on economic recovery großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero says economies should n't recover at the expense of the people spanish premier jose luis rodriguez zapatero has outlined his country 's main goals for its six-month presidency of the european union , with a bloc-wide economic recovery at the top of the agenda . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero , whose country assumed the rotating eu presidency on friday , says helping the economies of the 27-nation bloc recover from the financial crisis will be his country 's most important task over the next six months .
zapatero , who has led his country since 2004 , said achieving an eu-wide economic recovery would come from making european economies " more productive , innovative and sustainable . "
" europe needs far-reaching changes " he said however that this should not be accomplished at the expense of ordinary europeans .
" to achieve this we must rely on both workers and businesses , to make our companies more productive and our workforce better qualified without losing sight of that great european symbol : the welfare state and social policies , " zapatero said friday in a video posted on the spanish government 's official eu presidency web site .
" in addition to this priority , the key objective for this new period in the european union after the lisbon treaty is to make europe an increasingly important player on the international stage , " he added .
" europe has been in need of more far-reaching changes for some time .
it needs its citizens to feel closer to its institutions and understand that the basic reference point of the european organization , the european government and the 27 european union member states , is the policies and initiatives which directly affect its people . "
spain has work cut out zapatero 's comments at a time when spain faces severe challenges to its own economy at home .
with unemployment at about 20 percent and the downgrading this month of its debt outlook by ratings agency standard & poor 's , spain is among the worst affected by the economic crisis and may struggle to pursue an ambitious economic agenda .
spain assumed the eu presidency from sweden , which led the bloc for the previous six months .
madrid 's tenure as chief coordinator of eu events for the next half year comes following the ratification and enactment of the reforming lisbon treaty .
unlike any previous eu president nation , spain must now work alongside a new full-time eu president - belgian herman van rompuy - and foreign policy chief - briton catherine ashton. dfm / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.01.2010 eu presidency power-sharing takes effect großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lisbon treaty : simplifying or stupifying ?
spain takes over the european union 's rotating presidency , just as the role is being downgraded in the bloc 's institutional shake-up . the lisbon treaty , which came into force at the beginning of december , means spain 's eu presidency will be somewhat different from preceding ones .
the idea behind the lisbon treaty was to make the european union more effective and efficient as a world player .
instead , the institutional shake-up is producing an element of confusion as eu officials get used to the new rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van rompuy 's role is still being defined one of the key issues as the treaty comes into play and spain assumes its new role will be the resulting balance of power .
the lisbon treaty created positions for the bloc 's two new leaders : herman van rompuy , who takes on the role of president of the european council , and catherine ashton , who is taking charge of eu foreign policy .
until now , that job has belonged to the eu 's rotating presidency , passed around the 27 member states every six months : an expensive logistical exercise , which often confused governments outside europe .
balancing act as rompuy and ashton begin to take over some of the main responsibilities of the rotating presidency , it may come as a surprise to some that it still even exists .
that it does reflects the desires of national governments who are unwilling to give up their turn at the helm .
despite the position 's downgraded role , eu member states still want to maintain their influence in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's turn with the eu presidency will set a new precedent spanish foreign minister michel angel moratinos , whose government inherits the rotating presidency from sweden at the start of 2010 , insists he will not try and dominate .
" the lisbon treaty is the beginning of a new europe - this europe will be led by the president of the permanent council , mr. van rompuy , and by the high representative and vice-president of the european commission -lsb- ashton -rsb- , " moratinos said .
" therefore , it will be up to them , to these two people , to manage , to boost , to represent the eu in the first half of 2010 . "
that may be true in principal , but in the case of high representative ashton , moratinos may often have to step in to deputize , given the amount of travel ashton is expected to undertake .
as for president van rompuy , he will be expected to chair eu summits .
spain will take charge of general affairs , which includes justice and home affairs , economic policies , the environment , agriculture , and fisheries .
eu transparency advocates of the new system say it makes sense , arguing that the only area that required a single representative was foreign affairs .
germany 's martin schulz is the leader of the social democratic party in the european parliament , and he believes the old system was flawed .
according to schulz , leaders such as french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel played tactics and kept their cards close to their chests .
" thank goodness that has come to an end , " said the european parliamentarian .
" we now have the lisbon treaty , which gives a little bit more transparency .
it 's still too early to tell if the eu will really become more transparent , but eu diplomats insist the lisbon treaty will bring more consistency and coherence to the eu 's external representation .
foreign policy questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ashton 's position is a large question mark for some a lot of that , however , depends on the role that is now being filled by catherine ashton , even though she has little in the way of foreign policy experience .
the spanish government says it will support ashton in her efforts to build up the eu 's new diplomatic corps .
analysts say that will involve trying to suppress a brewing mutiny among eu member states to win back control lost under lisbon .
however , swedish prime minister frederik reinfeldt , head of the country ending its run as chair of the eu presidency , sees the lisbon treaty as a good thing for democracy .
" " now the new president of the eu council will ensure continuity , the high representative will assure coordination in our external relations , " he said . " now we will have a more democratic union with a greater involvement of the european parliament and of our national parliaments . "
the eu begins 2010 facing the daunting task of getting itself up and operational under a completely new set of rules .

the protesters had gathered in triumfalnaya square to demand more freedoms and that the government to adhere to the russian constitution .
they carried signs reading , " putin behind bars ! " and had begun shouting " freedom ! " and " end putin 's reign ! " when anti-riot police broke up the rally and made the arrests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexeeva is one of russia 's most respected rights activists " i did n't have time to open my mouth , i just made a hand signal , " the 82-year-old alexeeva said on the radio shortly after her arrest .
alexeeva is considered to be the " grand dame " of russia 's human rights movement and recently received the european parliament 's sakharov prize for freedom of thought .
in 1976 she was a founding member of the moscow helsinski group , the oldest human rights organization still active in russia .
the group was subject to harassment and arrests by the soviet regime and alexeeva left the ussr in 1977 .
she returned to moscow in 1990 .
limonov is the founder of the outlawed national bolshevik party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 01.01.2010 eu presidency power-sharing takes effect großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lisbon treaty : simplifying or stupifying ?
spain takes over the european union 's rotating presidency , just as the role is being downgraded in the bloc 's institutional shake-up . the lisbon treaty , which came into force at the beginning of december , means spain 's eu presidency will be somewhat different from preceding ones .
the idea behind the lisbon treaty was to make the european union more effective and efficient as a world player .
instead , the institutional shake-up is producing an element of confusion as eu officials get used to the new rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van rompuy 's role is still being defined one of the key issues as the treaty comes into play and spain assumes its new role will be the resulting balance of power .
the lisbon treaty created positions for the bloc 's two new leaders : herman van rompuy , who takes on the role of president of the european council , and catherine ashton , who is taking charge of eu foreign policy .
until now , that job has belonged to the eu 's rotating presidency , passed around the 27 member states every six months : an expensive logistical exercise , which often confused governments outside europe .
balancing act as rompuy and ashton begin to take over some of the main responsibilities of the rotating presidency , it may come as a surprise to some that it still even exists .
that it does reflects the desires of national governments who are unwilling to give up their turn at the helm .
despite the position 's downgraded role , eu member states still want to maintain their influence in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's turn with the eu presidency will set a new precedent spanish foreign minister michel angel moratinos , whose government inherits the rotating presidency from sweden at the start of 2010 , insists he will not try and dominate .
" the lisbon treaty is the beginning of a new europe - this europe will be led by the president of the permanent council , mr. van rompuy , and by the high representative and vice-president of the european commission -lsb- ashton -rsb- , " moratinos said .
" therefore , it will be up to them , to these two people , to manage , to boost , to represent the eu in the first half of 2010 . "
that may be true in principal , but in the case of high representative ashton , moratinos may often have to step in to deputize , given the amount of travel ashton is expected to undertake .
as for president van rompuy , he will be expected to chair eu summits .
spain will take charge of general affairs , which includes justice and home affairs , economic policies , the environment , agriculture , and fisheries .
eu transparency advocates of the new system say it makes sense , arguing that the only area that required a single representative was foreign affairs .
germany 's martin schulz is the leader of the social democratic party in the european parliament , and he believes the old system was flawed .
according to schulz , leaders such as french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel played tactics and kept their cards close to their chests .
" thank goodness that has come to an end , " said the european parliamentarian .
" we now have the lisbon treaty , which gives a little bit more transparency .
it 's still too early to tell if the eu will really become more transparent , but eu diplomats insist the lisbon treaty will bring more consistency and coherence to the eu 's external representation .
foreign policy questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ashton 's position is a large question mark for some a lot of that , however , depends on the role that is now being filled by catherine ashton , even though she has little in the way of foreign policy experience .
the spanish government says it will support ashton in her efforts to build up the eu 's new diplomatic corps .
analysts say that will involve trying to suppress a brewing mutiny among eu member states to win back control lost under lisbon .
however , swedish prime minister frederik reinfeldt , head of the country ending its run as chair of the eu presidency , sees the lisbon treaty as a good thing for democracy .
" " now the new president of the eu council will ensure continuity , the high representative will assure coordination in our external relations , " he said . " now we will have a more democratic union with a greater involvement of the european parliament and of our national parliaments . "
the eu begins 2010 facing the daunting task of getting itself up and operational under a completely new set of rules .

the minimum price is to be reviewed each year by a government commission and is meant to discourage over-drinking .
but doctors worry that the minimum price will instead lead to increased numbers drinking industrial alcohol , antifreeze or other homemade spirits , all dangerous alternatives .
medvedev also turned his attention to the dangers of alcohol during his live end-of-year interview with state television , calling for a return to the country 's former zero tolerance toward drunk driving .
" one who drinks , loses his head .
and we know people drink here !
first one shot — that 's allowed .

i think we should ban getting behind the wheel in an intoxicated state , " medvedev said .

but it warns that climate change remains a threat in 2010 and beyond , impacting on insurance costs . in an annual look at the cost of natural disasters , munich re , one of the world 's largest reinsurers , said that natural catastrophes took many fewer lives and caused much less damage on average in 2009 than in the previous decade .
it put the death toll in 2009 at " around 10,000 , " well below the average of 75,000 in each of the past 10 years .
the single most deadly event was a 7.6 magnitude earthquake in indonesia on september 30 , killing nearly 1,200 people in and around the city of padang , on the island of sumatra .
asian storms meanwhile killed thousands more and caused widespread damage in the philippines , vietnam and taiwan .
lower insurers ' losses the munich-based company said that in monetary terms too , 2009 losses were also much lower than in previous years .
the report pointed out that insurers ' losses from natural disasters fell by more than half in 2009 , thanks to fewer hurricanes and earthquakes , although climate change contributed to a significant increase in damages and losses in the us .
it said insured losses came in at 15.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- this year , down from nearly 35 billion euros in 2008 .
it said total economic losses , including losses not covered by insurance , fell 75 percent to 35 billion euros from 139 billion euros in the previous year .
the most expensive single event was klaus , a winter storm that hit northern spain and southwestern france in january 2009 .
klaus left more than one million people without electricity while causing economic losses of over 3.5 billion euros and insured losses of about 2 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a storm that hit spain and france in january proved the single most expensive event weather-related catastrophes " despite the lack of severe hurricanes and other mega catastrophes , there were a large number of moderately severe natural catastrophes , " munich re ’ s head of geo risk research , peter hoeppe , pointed out , warning that " the trend towards an increase in weather-related catastrophes continues . "
he believes that the catastrophes are related to climate change , and that at least part of the cause must lie at the location of the disasters .
" and we know from climate scientists that because some changes have occurred , that it has become warmer , that there is more humidity in the atmosphere because the oceans have warmed up as well .
everything we learn from climate scientists fits together perfectly - that climate change is causing extreme weather events to intensify . "
copenhagen fallout munich re company board member torsten jeworrek expressed disappointment at the lack of a significant breakthrough at the copenhagen climate summit in december , especially given an almost three-fold rise in weather-related natural catastrophes since 1950 .
" we need as soon as possible an agreement that significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions because the climate reacts slowly and what we fail to do now will have a bearing for decades to come , " jeworrek said .
the munich re report warned that climate change remains a threat in 2010 and the decades to come , adding that the failed copenhagen summit is bound to make insurance costs rise in the future. rb / afp / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it warns that climate change remains a threat in 2010 and beyond , impacting on insurance costs . in an annual look at the cost of natural disasters , munich re , one of the world 's largest reinsurers , said that natural catastrophes took many fewer lives and caused much less damage on average in 2009 than in the previous decade .
it put the death toll in 2009 at " around 10,000 , " well below the average of 75,000 in each of the past 10 years .
the single most deadly event was a 7.6 magnitude earthquake in indonesia on september 30 , killing nearly 1,200 people in and around the city of padang , on the island of sumatra .
asian storms meanwhile killed thousands more and caused widespread damage in the philippines , vietnam and taiwan .
lower insurers ' losses the munich-based company said that in monetary terms too , 2009 losses were also much lower than in previous years .
the report pointed out that insurers ' losses from natural disasters fell by more than half in 2009 , thanks to fewer hurricanes and earthquakes , although climate change contributed to a significant increase in damages and losses in the us .
it said insured losses came in at 15.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- this year , down from nearly 35 billion euros in 2008 .
it said total economic losses , including losses not covered by insurance , fell 75 percent to 35 billion euros from 139 billion euros in the previous year .
the most expensive single event was klaus , a winter storm that hit northern spain and southwestern france in january 2009 .
klaus left more than one million people without electricity while causing economic losses of over 3.5 billion euros and insured losses of about 2 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a storm that hit spain and france in january proved the single most expensive event weather-related catastrophes " despite the lack of severe hurricanes and other mega catastrophes , there were a large number of moderately severe natural catastrophes , " munich re ’ s head of geo risk research , peter hoeppe , pointed out , warning that " the trend towards an increase in weather-related catastrophes continues . "
he believes that the catastrophes are related to climate change , and that at least part of the cause must lie at the location of the disasters .
" and we know from climate scientists that because some changes have occurred , that it has become warmer , that there is more humidity in the atmosphere because the oceans have warmed up as well .
everything we learn from climate scientists fits together perfectly - that climate change is causing extreme weather events to intensify . "
copenhagen fallout munich re company board member torsten jeworrek expressed disappointment at the lack of a significant breakthrough at the copenhagen climate summit in december , especially given an almost three-fold rise in weather-related natural catastrophes since 1950 .
" we need as soon as possible an agreement that significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions because the climate reacts slowly and what we fail to do now will have a bearing for decades to come , " jeworrek said .
the munich re report warned that climate change remains a threat in 2010 and the decades to come , adding that the failed copenhagen summit is bound to make insurance costs rise in the future. rb / afp / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

zapatero , who has led his country since 2004 , said achieving an eu-wide economic recovery would come from making european economies " more productive , innovative and sustainable . "
" europe needs far-reaching changes " he said however that this should not be accomplished at the expense of ordinary europeans .
" to achieve this we must rely on both workers and businesses , to make our companies more productive and our workforce better qualified without losing sight of that great european symbol : the welfare state and social policies , " zapatero said friday in a video posted on the spanish government 's official eu presidency web site .
" in addition to this priority , the key objective for this new period in the european union after the lisbon treaty is to make europe an increasingly important player on the international stage , " he added .
" europe has been in need of more far-reaching changes for some time .
it needs its citizens to feel closer to its institutions and understand that the basic reference point of the european organization , the european government and the 27 european union member states , is the policies and initiatives which directly affect its people . "
spain has work cut out zapatero 's comments at a time when spain faces severe challenges to its own economy at home .
with unemployment at about 20 percent and the downgrading this month of its debt outlook by ratings agency standard & poor 's , spain is among the worst affected by the economic crisis and may struggle to pursue an ambitious economic agenda .
spain assumed the eu presidency from sweden , which led the bloc for the previous six months .
madrid 's tenure as chief coordinator of eu events for the next half year comes following the ratification and enactment of the reforming lisbon treaty .
unlike any previous eu president nation , spain must now work alongside a new full-time eu president - belgian herman van rompuy - and foreign policy chief - briton catherine ashton. dfm / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ inflammable and other materials that can be used to make explosives should not be available in duty-free stores , ” rainer wendt , the head of germany 's police union -lrb- dpoig -rrb- , said .
“ these include high-percentage alcohol beverages , perfumes , and chemical substances such as cleaning materials .
everything needs to be checked .
if necessary , dangerous materials should be taken off the shelves , ” he said .
in an interview with newspaper neuen osnabruecker zeitung , wendt called for an eu-wide ban on potentially dangerous products .
he also said restaurants in airport terminals should stop using metal cutlery .
" the security interests of citizens need to have priority over economic interests , " wendt said .
pilots ' group skeptical of ban unions representing pilots in germany are also concerned about the easy availability of potentially dangerous duty-free goods at airports .
but some remain doubtful whether a ban would make a difference .
“ of course we can think about what products might be used , to put it bluntly , blow a plane up out of the sky .
we are very concerned about this , " joerg handwerg , spokesman for the pilot 's association , said .
" but whether banning razor blades is going to be the answer , i doubt whether this is the answer . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police patrol busy frankfurt airport with well over 50 million people passing through frankfurt international airport every year , a ban would hurt sales at duty-free stores .
security debate on scanners the failed terror attack on the northwest / klm flight from amsterdam to detroit on christmas day has prompted airports around the world to beef up security measures .
german security officials have said that existing regulations for passenger safety are adequate .
but the country 's politicians are debating whether controversial body scanners should be installed at german airports .
privacy concerns have prevented the use of such scanners .
but the netherlands has said it would start using the scanners at schiphol airport in amsterdam by the end of january .
british prime minister gordon brown too has ordered airport security arrangements to be reviewed , and is keen to introduce the scanners at british airports as soon as possible .
“ the failed attack in detroit on christmas day reminds us of a deeper reality : that almost 10 years after september 11th international terrorism is still a very real threat , " brown said this week .
