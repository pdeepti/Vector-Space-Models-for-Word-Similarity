anti-lgv associations and green associations had banners reading " off my estate . "
" there were at least 20,000 of us and there would have been many more had the police not slowed down traffic , " alberto perino , the head of the no tav -lrb- no to high-speed trains -rrb- , told italian media of the protest at susa , near turin .
france and italy signed a deal in 2001 on building a new rail link , which is to be a strategic link in the european network and allow travel time between milan and paris to be slashed from seven to four hours .
the cost has been estimated at 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 21 billion -rrb- but residents of the susa valley have fiercely opposed the plan , saying the construction of tunnels would damage the environment .
in a separate protest , environmentalists from france and spain held a similar demonstration against a planned high-speed line running through the basque country .
they also launched the " hendaye charter " , after the french border town where the protest was held , which urges european governments not to build more such lines as they are not in line with " sustainable development " .
the text , adopted by political movements from france , spain and italy , denounced these projects as " an ecological , socio-economic and human disaster .

consumer groups in germany have criticized clothing chains h & m and c & a after media reports said the two firms had allegedly used genetically-modified cotton from india in their eco-friendly range . monika buening of the federal consumer affairs agency said the two companies needed to take action fast to limit the damage .
" the fashion chains -lrb- h & m and c & a -rrb- were not vigilant enough , " the frankfurter rundschau newspaper quoted her as saying in its saturday edition .
buening demanded the clothing chains must now " disclose their supply chain " and " inspect their certifiers better , at least by conducting random checks . "
rebecca harms , a member of the european parliament for germany 's green party , called for tighter controls on organic textiles from the developing world .
" consumer fraud " environmental organization greenpeace called for a legal investigation into the matter .
the organization 's agricultural expert , martin hofstetter , told german radio station mdr that some products which had not been organically produced , were being sold as such .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not easy to find out whether organic clothes are really what they claim to be " this is a major malpractice .
it 's consumer fraud , which must be punished , " he said .
the problem with organic cotton from india primarily involves the small structures of the farming sector , hofstetter said .
he pointed out that many small fields in the country were often clustered together in close proximity to each other , cultivating a variety of different crops – organic , conventional and gm .
that often resulted in crop contamination from one field to the other , he said .
on friday , german newspaper financial times deutschland reported that last year , a large volume of gm cotton produced in india had been sold as organic cotton .
the newspaper said indian authorities had discovered the incident in april 2009 .
it quoted the head of the indian agricultural authority , apeda , sanjay dave , saying they were dealing with fraud on " a gigantic scale . "
two european certification companies , responsible for ensuring that producers stick to eco-friendly standards , had awarded the organic label .
the newspaper said it remained unclear whether the certifiers , a dutch and a french company , had knowingly and falsely labeled the cotton as " organic . "
setback to clothing firms a spokeswoman for the swedish clothing chain h & m told news agency afp that the company became aware of the incident last year .
she said it could n't be ruled out that the tainted cotton had landed in h & m 's organic range .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h & m says it 's looking into the incident clothing retailer c & a , which has head offices in brussels and duesseldorf , has announced it planned to carry out a thorough investigation .
the controversy could have serious implications for both firms at a time when companies are trying to profit from jumping on the organic bandwagon .
in fact , h & m is set to launch its spring " garden collection " in march , which the chain says " is made using organic and recycled materials . " rb / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it helps the convicts gain media skills and allows kids on the outside to see that prison is far worse than they 've heard . most people 's idea of what prison must be like comes from the movies .
now , a group of juvenile prisoners in germany are going public with the non-hollywood version of their everyday lives . while their own mobility is rather limited , the internet gives them direct access to an unlimited audience .
the young prisoners create videos and audios behind bars and upload them to their web site podknast.de.
the program , which is sponsored by the state broadcasting authority of the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , has caught on quickly and many view it as an opportunity to educate young people about the realities of life in prison . " this project helps young men come to terms with their crimes and to acquire media skills , " explained inga roy , program coordinator and educator at the siegburg correctional facility .

not even a dog is as confined as i am , " dennis added .
through the podknast project , dennis has had the opportunity to get out of his cell and leave the grey prison compound for short periods of time . the project has proven very popular among young people , parents , and social workers .
to add to its success , more and more schools and police stations have picked up on the production series as a tool to dissuade young people from committing crimes . true identities despite the accolades the site has received , some say the project has allowed criminals a luxury they do not deserve - all at the expense of the taxpayer .

it helps the convicts gain media skills and allows kids on the outside to see that prison is far worse than they 've heard . most people 's idea of what prison must be like comes from the movies .
now , a group of juvenile prisoners in germany are going public with the non-hollywood version of their everyday lives . while their own mobility is rather limited , the internet gives them direct access to an unlimited audience .
the young prisoners create videos and audios behind bars and upload them to their web site podknast.de.
the program , which is sponsored by the state broadcasting authority of the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , has caught on quickly and many view it as an opportunity to educate young people about the realities of life in prison . " this project helps young men come to terms with their crimes and to acquire media skills , " explained inga roy , program coordinator and educator at the siegburg correctional facility . " more importantly , though , our goal is to make a project that will act as a deterrent for other young people , " she said . looking ahead to freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prisoners are allowed more freedom in order to film the podcasts currently four correctional facilities in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia are taking part in the program .
the young men , whose crimes range from driving without a license to assault and even murder , volunteer to participate in the program . on the one hand , the podknast project is designed to retrain prisoners and ease them back into the job market once they have served their time .
the new skills they have acquired while working in this program can all be used on the outside . the podcasts , which are regularly updated on the site , have been produced by the prisoners with the technical help of students from the aachen university of applied sciences . " you learn how to be a team player , " dennis , a young prisoner who is currently serving a two-year sentence , said of the project .
" but when you are always confined to a cell , you ca n't be as creative .
you need more variety . " the truth about life in prison the online postings have addressed issues like prison violence and the banality of life behind bars .
the young prisoners wanted their podcasts and videos to reflect the fact that prison life is not as glamorous as some believe it to be . " every morning i wake up , work , eat , shower , have some free time , and that 's it .
not even a dog is as confined as i am , " dennis added .
through the podknast project , dennis has had the opportunity to get out of his cell and leave the grey prison compound for short periods of time . the project has proven very popular among young people , parents , and social workers .
to add to its success , more and more schools and police stations have picked up on the production series as a tool to dissuade young people from committing crimes . true identities despite the accolades the site has received , some say the project has allowed criminals a luxury they do not deserve - all at the expense of the taxpayer .
those involved in the project , though , have said they feel more prepared for life after prison and have a greater ability to concentrate . in many of the videos , the prisoners decided against having their faces pixeled in order to make the scenes more realistic .
by being open about their identity , they risk being recognized in the future by potential employers .

consumer groups in germany have criticized clothing chains h & m and c & a after media reports said the two firms had allegedly used genetically-modified cotton from india in their eco-friendly range . monika buening of the federal consumer affairs agency said the two companies needed to take action fast to limit the damage .
" the fashion chains -lrb- h & m and c & a -rrb- were not vigilant enough , " the frankfurter rundschau newspaper quoted her as saying in its saturday edition .
buening demanded the clothing chains must now " disclose their supply chain " and " inspect their certifiers better , at least by conducting random checks . "
rebecca harms , a member of the european parliament for germany 's green party , called for tighter controls on organic textiles from the developing world .
" consumer fraud " environmental organization greenpeace called for a legal investigation into the matter .
the organization 's agricultural expert , martin hofstetter , told german radio station mdr that some products which had not been organically produced , were being sold as such .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not easy to find out whether organic clothes are really what they claim to be " this is a major malpractice .
it 's consumer fraud , which must be punished , " he said .
the problem with organic cotton from india primarily involves the small structures of the farming sector , hofstetter said .
he pointed out that many small fields in the country were often clustered together in close proximity to each other , cultivating a variety of different crops – organic , conventional and gm .
that often resulted in crop contamination from one field to the other , he said .
on friday , german newspaper financial times deutschland reported that last year , a large volume of gm cotton produced in india had been sold as organic cotton .
the newspaper said indian authorities had discovered the incident in april 2009 .
it quoted the head of the indian agricultural authority , apeda , sanjay dave , saying they were dealing with fraud on " a gigantic scale . "
two european certification companies , responsible for ensuring that producers stick to eco-friendly standards , had awarded the organic label .
the newspaper said it remained unclear whether the certifiers , a dutch and a french company , had knowingly and falsely labeled the cotton as " organic . "
setback to clothing firms a spokeswoman for the swedish clothing chain h & m told news agency afp that the company became aware of the incident last year .
she said it could n't be ruled out that the tainted cotton had landed in h & m 's organic range .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h & m says it 's looking into the incident clothing retailer c & a , which has head offices in brussels and duesseldorf , has announced it planned to carry out a thorough investigation .
the controversy could have serious implications for both firms at a time when companies are trying to profit from jumping on the organic bandwagon .
in fact , h & m is set to launch its spring " garden collection " in march , which the chain says " is made using organic and recycled materials . " rb / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

consumer groups in germany have criticized clothing chains h & m and c & a after media reports said the two firms had allegedly used genetically-modified cotton from india in their eco-friendly range . monika buening of the federal consumer affairs agency said the two companies needed to take action fast to limit the damage .
" the fashion chains -lrb- h & m and c & a -rrb- were not vigilant enough , " the frankfurter rundschau newspaper quoted her as saying in its saturday edition .
buening demanded the clothing chains must now " disclose their supply chain " and " inspect their certifiers better , at least by conducting random checks . "
rebecca harms , a member of the european parliament for germany 's green party , called for tighter controls on organic textiles from the developing world .
" consumer fraud " environmental organization greenpeace called for a legal investigation into the matter .
the organization 's agricultural expert , martin hofstetter , told german radio station mdr that some products which had not been organically produced , were being sold as such .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not easy to find out whether organic clothes are really what they claim to be " this is a major malpractice .
it 's consumer fraud , which must be punished , " he said .
the problem with organic cotton from india primarily involves the small structures of the farming sector , hofstetter said .
he pointed out that many small fields in the country were often clustered together in close proximity to each other , cultivating a variety of different crops – organic , conventional and gm .
that often resulted in crop contamination from one field to the other , he said .
on friday , german newspaper financial times deutschland reported that last year , a large volume of gm cotton produced in india had been sold as organic cotton .
the newspaper said indian authorities had discovered the incident in april 2009 .
it quoted the head of the indian agricultural authority , apeda , sanjay dave , saying they were dealing with fraud on " a gigantic scale . "
two european certification companies , responsible for ensuring that producers stick to eco-friendly standards , had awarded the organic label .
the newspaper said it remained unclear whether the certifiers , a dutch and a french company , had knowingly and falsely labeled the cotton as " organic . "
setback to clothing firms a spokeswoman for the swedish clothing chain h & m told news agency afp that the company became aware of the incident last year .
she said it could n't be ruled out that the tainted cotton had landed in h & m 's organic range .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h & m says it 's looking into the incident clothing retailer c & a , which has head offices in brussels and duesseldorf , has announced it planned to carry out a thorough investigation .
the controversy could have serious implications for both firms at a time when companies are trying to profit from jumping on the organic bandwagon .
in fact , h & m is set to launch its spring " garden collection " in march , which the chain says " is made using organic and recycled materials . " rb / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

consumer groups in germany have criticized clothing chains h & m and c & a after media reports said the two firms had allegedly used genetically-modified cotton from india in their eco-friendly range . monika buening of the federal consumer affairs agency said the two companies needed to take action fast to limit the damage .
" the fashion chains -lrb- h & m and c & a -rrb- were not vigilant enough , " the frankfurter rundschau newspaper quoted her as saying in its saturday edition .
buening demanded the clothing chains must now " disclose their supply chain " and " inspect their certifiers better , at least by conducting random checks . "
rebecca harms , a member of the european parliament for germany 's green party , called for tighter controls on organic textiles from the developing world .
" consumer fraud " environmental organization greenpeace called for a legal investigation into the matter .
the organization 's agricultural expert , martin hofstetter , told german radio station mdr that some products which had not been organically produced , were being sold as such .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not easy to find out whether organic clothes are really what they claim to be " this is a major malpractice .
it 's consumer fraud , which must be punished , " he said .
the problem with organic cotton from india primarily involves the small structures of the farming sector , hofstetter said .
he pointed out that many small fields in the country were often clustered together in close proximity to each other , cultivating a variety of different crops – organic , conventional and gm .
that often resulted in crop contamination from one field to the other , he said .
on friday , german newspaper financial times deutschland reported that last year , a large volume of gm cotton produced in india had been sold as organic cotton .
the newspaper said indian authorities had discovered the incident in april 2009 .
it quoted the head of the indian agricultural authority , apeda , sanjay dave , saying they were dealing with fraud on " a gigantic scale . "
two european certification companies , responsible for ensuring that producers stick to eco-friendly standards , had awarded the organic label .
the newspaper said it remained unclear whether the certifiers , a dutch and a french company , had knowingly and falsely labeled the cotton as " organic . "
setback to clothing firms a spokeswoman for the swedish clothing chain h & m told news agency afp that the company became aware of the incident last year .
she said it could n't be ruled out that the tainted cotton had landed in h & m 's organic range .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h & m says it 's looking into the incident clothing retailer c & a , which has head offices in brussels and duesseldorf , has announced it planned to carry out a thorough investigation .
the controversy could have serious implications for both firms at a time when companies are trying to profit from jumping on the organic bandwagon .
in fact , h & m is set to launch its spring " garden collection " in march , which the chain says " is made using organic and recycled materials . " rb / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

van nistelrooy , who has played for manchester united and psv eindhoven , is the only player to have been top scorer in the english , dutch and spanish leagues .
the deal will last until 2011 and van nistelrooy will earn much less than the salary of 6 million euros -lrb- $ 8.5 million -rrb- he received at real .
" i am delighted that it worked out , " said van nistelrooy .
" hsv is a great club , has a strong team and great ambitions .
and i have great ambitions as well , " he said .
manager bruno labbadia said the striker , who retired from international football in 2008 but has been mulling a comeback for the oranje at the world cup , was a valuable addition to his squad .
" i am convinced that he will score important goals for hamburg , " he said .
" it shows this club 's standing that a player of ruud van nistelrooy 's caliber would choose to come here . "
hamburg had been competing with english sides tottenham hotspur and west ham united for the striker 's services. rc / afp / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

consumer groups in germany have criticized clothing chains h & m and c & a after media reports said the two firms had allegedly used genetically-modified cotton from india in their eco-friendly range . monika buening of the federal consumer affairs agency said the two companies needed to take action fast to limit the damage .
" the fashion chains -lrb- h & m and c & a -rrb- were not vigilant enough , " the frankfurter rundschau newspaper quoted her as saying in its saturday edition .
buening demanded the clothing chains must now " disclose their supply chain " and " inspect their certifiers better , at least by conducting random checks . "
rebecca harms , a member of the european parliament for germany 's green party , called for tighter controls on organic textiles from the developing world .
" consumer fraud " environmental organization greenpeace called for a legal investigation into the matter .
the organization 's agricultural expert , martin hofstetter , told german radio station mdr that some products which had not been organically produced , were being sold as such .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not easy to find out whether organic clothes are really what they claim to be " this is a major malpractice .
it 's consumer fraud , which must be punished , " he said .
the problem with organic cotton from india primarily involves the small structures of the farming sector , hofstetter said .
he pointed out that many small fields in the country were often clustered together in close proximity to each other , cultivating a variety of different crops – organic , conventional and gm .
that often resulted in crop contamination from one field to the other , he said .
on friday , german newspaper financial times deutschland reported that last year , a large volume of gm cotton produced in india had been sold as organic cotton .
the newspaper said indian authorities had discovered the incident in april 2009 .
it quoted the head of the indian agricultural authority , apeda , sanjay dave , saying they were dealing with fraud on " a gigantic scale . "
two european certification companies , responsible for ensuring that producers stick to eco-friendly standards , had awarded the organic label .
the newspaper said it remained unclear whether the certifiers , a dutch and a french company , had knowingly and falsely labeled the cotton as " organic . "
setback to clothing firms a spokeswoman for the swedish clothing chain h & m told news agency afp that the company became aware of the incident last year .
she said it could n't be ruled out that the tainted cotton had landed in h & m 's organic range .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h & m says it 's looking into the incident clothing retailer c & a , which has head offices in brussels and duesseldorf , has announced it planned to carry out a thorough investigation .
the controversy could have serious implications for both firms at a time when companies are trying to profit from jumping on the organic bandwagon .
in fact , h & m is set to launch its spring " garden collection " in march , which the chain says " is made using organic and recycled materials . " rb / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the club announced the news after a 1-0 away defeat to dortmund which leaves it in fifth place . ruud van nistelrooy signed a contract with hamburg on a free transfer from real madrid in what is the most daring personnel move in the bundesliga this winter .
the former dutch international netted 46 goals in 68 league games for real .
a knee injury put him out of action last season , and he was having difficulty getting playing time at the spanish giants .
van nistelrooy , who has played for manchester united and psv eindhoven , is the only player to have been top scorer in the english , dutch and spanish leagues .
the deal will last until 2011 and van nistelrooy will earn much less than the salary of 6 million euros -lrb- $ 8.5 million -rrb- he received at real .
" i am delighted that it worked out , " said van nistelrooy .
" hsv is a great club , has a strong team and great ambitions .
and i have great ambitions as well , " he said .
manager bruno labbadia said the striker , who retired from international football in 2008 but has been mulling a comeback for the oranje at the world cup , was a valuable addition to his squad .

consumer groups in germany have criticized clothing chains h & m and c & a after media reports said the two firms had allegedly used genetically-modified cotton from india in their eco-friendly range . monika buening of the federal consumer affairs agency said the two companies needed to take action fast to limit the damage .
" the fashion chains -lrb- h & m and c & a -rrb- were not vigilant enough , " the frankfurter rundschau newspaper quoted her as saying in its saturday edition .
buening demanded the clothing chains must now " disclose their supply chain " and " inspect their certifiers better , at least by conducting random checks . "
rebecca harms , a member of the european parliament for germany 's green party , called for tighter controls on organic textiles from the developing world .

the problem with organic cotton from india primarily involves the small structures of the farming sector , hofstetter said .
he pointed out that many small fields in the country were often clustered together in close proximity to each other , cultivating a variety of different crops – organic , conventional and gm .
that often resulted in crop contamination from one field to the other , he said .
on friday , german newspaper financial times deutschland reported that last year , a large volume of gm cotton produced in india had been sold as organic cotton .
the newspaper said indian authorities had discovered the incident in april 2009 .
it quoted the head of the indian agricultural authority , apeda , sanjay dave , saying they were dealing with fraud on " a gigantic scale . "
two european certification companies , responsible for ensuring that producers stick to eco-friendly standards , had awarded the organic label .
the newspaper said it remained unclear whether the certifiers , a dutch and a french company , had knowingly and falsely labeled the cotton as " organic . "

she said it could n't be ruled out that the tainted cotton had landed in h & m 's organic range .

consumer groups in germany have criticized clothing chains h & m and c & a after media reports said the two firms had allegedly used genetically-modified cotton from india in their eco-friendly range . monika buening of the federal consumer affairs agency said the two companies needed to take action fast to limit the damage .
" the fashion chains -lrb- h & m and c & a -rrb- were not vigilant enough , " the frankfurter rundschau newspaper quoted her as saying in its saturday edition .
buening demanded the clothing chains must now " disclose their supply chain " and " inspect their certifiers better , at least by conducting random checks . "
rebecca harms , a member of the european parliament for germany 's green party , called for tighter controls on organic textiles from the developing world .
" consumer fraud " environmental organization greenpeace called for a legal investigation into the matter .
the organization 's agricultural expert , martin hofstetter , told german radio station mdr that some products which had not been organically produced , were being sold as such .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not easy to find out whether organic clothes are really what they claim to be " this is a major malpractice .
it 's consumer fraud , which must be punished , " he said .
the problem with organic cotton from india primarily involves the small structures of the farming sector , hofstetter said .
he pointed out that many small fields in the country were often clustered together in close proximity to each other , cultivating a variety of different crops – organic , conventional and gm .
that often resulted in crop contamination from one field to the other , he said .
on friday , german newspaper financial times deutschland reported that last year , a large volume of gm cotton produced in india had been sold as organic cotton .
the newspaper said indian authorities had discovered the incident in april 2009 .
it quoted the head of the indian agricultural authority , apeda , sanjay dave , saying they were dealing with fraud on " a gigantic scale . "
two european certification companies , responsible for ensuring that producers stick to eco-friendly standards , had awarded the organic label .
the newspaper said it remained unclear whether the certifiers , a dutch and a french company , had knowingly and falsely labeled the cotton as " organic . "

consumer groups in germany have criticized clothing chains h & m and c & a after media reports said the two firms had allegedly used genetically-modified cotton from india in their eco-friendly range . monika buening of the federal consumer affairs agency said the two companies needed to take action fast to limit the damage .
" the fashion chains -lrb- h & m and c & a -rrb- were not vigilant enough , " the frankfurter rundschau newspaper quoted her as saying in its saturday edition .
buening demanded the clothing chains must now " disclose their supply chain " and " inspect their certifiers better , at least by conducting random checks . "
rebecca harms , a member of the european parliament for germany 's green party , called for tighter controls on organic textiles from the developing world .
" consumer fraud " environmental organization greenpeace called for a legal investigation into the matter .

he pointed out that many small fields in the country were often clustered together in close proximity to each other , cultivating a variety of different crops – organic , conventional and gm .
that often resulted in crop contamination from one field to the other , he said .
on friday , german newspaper financial times deutschland reported that last year , a large volume of gm cotton produced in india had been sold as organic cotton .
the newspaper said indian authorities had discovered the incident in april 2009 .
it quoted the head of the indian agricultural authority , apeda , sanjay dave , saying they were dealing with fraud on " a gigantic scale . "

anti-lgv associations and green associations had banners reading " off my estate . "
" there were at least 20,000 of us and there would have been many more had the police not slowed down traffic , " alberto perino , the head of the no tav -lrb- no to high-speed trains -rrb- , told italian media of the protest at susa , near turin .
france and italy signed a deal in 2001 on building a new rail link , which is to be a strategic link in the european network and allow travel time between milan and paris to be slashed from seven to four hours .
the cost has been estimated at 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 21 billion -rrb- but residents of the susa valley have fiercely opposed the plan , saying the construction of tunnels would damage the environment .
in a separate protest , environmentalists from france and spain held a similar demonstration against a planned high-speed line running through the basque country .
they also launched the " hendaye charter " , after the french border town where the protest was held , which urges european governments not to build more such lines as they are not in line with " sustainable development " .
the text , adopted by political movements from france , spain and italy , denounced these projects as " an ecological , socio-economic and human disaster .

consumer groups in germany have criticized clothing chains h & m and c & a after media reports said the two firms had allegedly used genetically-modified cotton from india in their eco-friendly range . monika buening of the federal consumer affairs agency said the two companies needed to take action fast to limit the damage .
" the fashion chains -lrb- h & m and c & a -rrb- were not vigilant enough , " the frankfurter rundschau newspaper quoted her as saying in its saturday edition .
buening demanded the clothing chains must now " disclose their supply chain " and " inspect their certifiers better , at least by conducting random checks . "
rebecca harms , a member of the european parliament for germany 's green party , called for tighter controls on organic textiles from the developing world .
" consumer fraud " environmental organization greenpeace called for a legal investigation into the matter .
the organization 's agricultural expert , martin hofstetter , told german radio station mdr that some products which had not been organically produced , were being sold as such .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not easy to find out whether organic clothes are really what they claim to be " this is a major malpractice .
it 's consumer fraud , which must be punished , " he said .
the problem with organic cotton from india primarily involves the small structures of the farming sector , hofstetter said .
he pointed out that many small fields in the country were often clustered together in close proximity to each other , cultivating a variety of different crops – organic , conventional and gm .
that often resulted in crop contamination from one field to the other , he said .
on friday , german newspaper financial times deutschland reported that last year , a large volume of gm cotton produced in india had been sold as organic cotton .
the newspaper said indian authorities had discovered the incident in april 2009 .
it quoted the head of the indian agricultural authority , apeda , sanjay dave , saying they were dealing with fraud on " a gigantic scale . "
two european certification companies , responsible for ensuring that producers stick to eco-friendly standards , had awarded the organic label .
the newspaper said it remained unclear whether the certifiers , a dutch and a french company , had knowingly and falsely labeled the cotton as " organic . "
setback to clothing firms a spokeswoman for the swedish clothing chain h & m told news agency afp that the company became aware of the incident last year .
she said it could n't be ruled out that the tainted cotton had landed in h & m 's organic range .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h & m says it 's looking into the incident clothing retailer c & a , which has head offices in brussels and duesseldorf , has announced it planned to carry out a thorough investigation .
the controversy could have serious implications for both firms at a time when companies are trying to profit from jumping on the organic bandwagon .
in fact , h & m is set to launch its spring " garden collection " in march , which the chain says " is made using organic and recycled materials . " rb / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the fashion chains -lrb- h & m and c & a -rrb- were not vigilant enough , " the frankfurter rundschau newspaper quoted her as saying in its saturday edition .
buening demanded the clothing chains must now " disclose their supply chain " and " inspect their certifiers better , at least by conducting random checks . "
rebecca harms , a member of the european parliament for germany 's green party , called for tighter controls on organic textiles from the developing world .

he pointed out that many small fields in the country were often clustered together in close proximity to each other , cultivating a variety of different crops – organic , conventional and gm .

on friday , german newspaper financial times deutschland reported that last year , a large volume of gm cotton produced in india had been sold as organic cotton .
the newspaper said indian authorities had discovered the incident in april 2009 .
it quoted the head of the indian agricultural authority , apeda , sanjay dave , saying they were dealing with fraud on " a gigantic scale . "
two european certification companies , responsible for ensuring that producers stick to eco-friendly standards , had awarded the organic label .
the newspaper said it remained unclear whether the certifiers , a dutch and a french company , had knowingly and falsely labeled the cotton as " organic . "

" the fashion chains -lrb- h & m and c & a -rrb- were not vigilant enough , " the frankfurter rundschau newspaper quoted her as saying in its saturday edition .
buening demanded the clothing chains must now " disclose their supply chain " and " inspect their certifiers better , at least by conducting random checks . "
rebecca harms , a member of the european parliament for germany 's green party , called for tighter controls on organic textiles from the developing world .
" consumer fraud " environmental organization greenpeace called for a legal investigation into the matter .
the organization 's agricultural expert , martin hofstetter , told german radio station mdr that some products which had not been organically produced , were being sold as such .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not easy to find out whether organic clothes are really what they claim to be " this is a major malpractice .
it 's consumer fraud , which must be punished , " he said .
the problem with organic cotton from india primarily involves the small structures of the farming sector , hofstetter said .
he pointed out that many small fields in the country were often clustered together in close proximity to each other , cultivating a variety of different crops – organic , conventional and gm .
that often resulted in crop contamination from one field to the other , he said .
on friday , german newspaper financial times deutschland reported that last year , a large volume of gm cotton produced in india had been sold as organic cotton .
the newspaper said indian authorities had discovered the incident in april 2009 .
it quoted the head of the indian agricultural authority , apeda , sanjay dave , saying they were dealing with fraud on " a gigantic scale . "
two european certification companies , responsible for ensuring that producers stick to eco-friendly standards , had awarded the organic label .
the newspaper said it remained unclear whether the certifiers , a dutch and a french company , had knowingly and falsely labeled the cotton as " organic . "
setback to clothing firms a spokeswoman for the swedish clothing chain h & m told news agency afp that the company became aware of the incident last year .
she said it could n't be ruled out that the tainted cotton had landed in h & m 's organic range .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h & m says it 's looking into the incident clothing retailer c & a , which has head offices in brussels and duesseldorf , has announced it planned to carry out a thorough investigation .

it helps the convicts gain media skills and allows kids on the outside to see that prison is far worse than they 've heard . most people 's idea of what prison must be like comes from the movies .
now , a group of juvenile prisoners in germany are going public with the non-hollywood version of their everyday lives . while their own mobility is rather limited , the internet gives them direct access to an unlimited audience .
the young prisoners create videos and audios behind bars and upload them to their web site podknast.de.
the program , which is sponsored by the state broadcasting authority of the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , has caught on quickly and many view it as an opportunity to educate young people about the realities of life in prison . " this project helps young men come to terms with their crimes and to acquire media skills , " explained inga roy , program coordinator and educator at the siegburg correctional facility .

not even a dog is as confined as i am , " dennis added .
through the podknast project , dennis has had the opportunity to get out of his cell and leave the grey prison compound for short periods of time . the project has proven very popular among young people , parents , and social workers .
to add to its success , more and more schools and police stations have picked up on the production series as a tool to dissuade young people from committing crimes . true identities despite the accolades the site has received , some say the project has allowed criminals a luxury they do not deserve - all at the expense of the taxpayer .
those involved in the project , though , have said they feel more prepared for life after prison and have a greater ability to concentrate . in many of the videos , the prisoners decided against having their faces pixeled in order to make the scenes more realistic .
by being open about their identity , they risk being recognized in the future by potential employers . " i would like to be able to tell my future employer or school students that i took part in this project , " said marcel , a 21-year old serving a sentence for breaking and entering .

it helps the convicts gain media skills and allows kids on the outside to see that prison is far worse than they 've heard . most people 's idea of what prison must be like comes from the movies .
now , a group of juvenile prisoners in germany are going public with the non-hollywood version of their everyday lives . while their own mobility is rather limited , the internet gives them direct access to an unlimited audience .
the young prisoners create videos and audios behind bars and upload them to their web site podknast.de.
the program , which is sponsored by the state broadcasting authority of the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , has caught on quickly and many view it as an opportunity to educate young people about the realities of life in prison . " this project helps young men come to terms with their crimes and to acquire media skills , " explained inga roy , program coordinator and educator at the siegburg correctional facility . " more importantly , though , our goal is to make a project that will act as a deterrent for other young people , " she said . looking ahead to freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prisoners are allowed more freedom in order to film the podcasts currently four correctional facilities in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia are taking part in the program .
the young men , whose crimes range from driving without a license to assault and even murder , volunteer to participate in the program . on the one hand , the podknast project is designed to retrain prisoners and ease them back into the job market once they have served their time .
the new skills they have acquired while working in this program can all be used on the outside . the podcasts , which are regularly updated on the site , have been produced by the prisoners with the technical help of students from the aachen university of applied sciences . " you learn how to be a team player , " dennis , a young prisoner who is currently serving a two-year sentence , said of the project .
" but when you are always confined to a cell , you ca n't be as creative .
you need more variety . " the truth about life in prison the online postings have addressed issues like prison violence and the banality of life behind bars .
the young prisoners wanted their podcasts and videos to reflect the fact that prison life is not as glamorous as some believe it to be . " every morning i wake up , work , eat , shower , have some free time , and that 's it .
not even a dog is as confined as i am , " dennis added .
through the podknast project , dennis has had the opportunity to get out of his cell and leave the grey prison compound for short periods of time . the project has proven very popular among young people , parents , and social workers .
to add to its success , more and more schools and police stations have picked up on the production series as a tool to dissuade young people from committing crimes . true identities despite the accolades the site has received , some say the project has allowed criminals a luxury they do not deserve - all at the expense of the taxpayer .
those involved in the project , though , have said they feel more prepared for life after prison and have a greater ability to concentrate . in many of the videos , the prisoners decided against having their faces pixeled in order to make the scenes more realistic .
by being open about their identity , they risk being recognized in the future by potential employers . " i would like to be able to tell my future employer or school students that i took part in this project , " said marcel , a 21-year old serving a sentence for breaking and entering . " if they do n't hire me because of that , that 's just something i will have to learn to accept .
i really screwed up and now i have to make the best out of the situation , " he said . bildunterschrift : author : katrin schilling -lrb- gmb -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the fashion chains -lrb- h & m and c & a -rrb- were not vigilant enough , " the frankfurter rundschau newspaper quoted her as saying in its saturday edition .

consumer groups in germany have criticized clothing chains h & m and c & a after media reports said the two firms had allegedly used genetically-modified cotton from india in their eco-friendly range . monika buening of the federal consumer affairs agency said the two companies needed to take action fast to limit the damage .
" the fashion chains -lrb- h & m and c & a -rrb- were not vigilant enough , " the frankfurter rundschau newspaper quoted her as saying in its saturday edition .
buening demanded the clothing chains must now " disclose their supply chain " and " inspect their certifiers better , at least by conducting random checks . "
rebecca harms , a member of the european parliament for germany 's green party , called for tighter controls on organic textiles from the developing world .
" consumer fraud " environmental organization greenpeace called for a legal investigation into the matter .
the organization 's agricultural expert , martin hofstetter , told german radio station mdr that some products which had not been organically produced , were being sold as such .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not easy to find out whether organic clothes are really what they claim to be " this is a major malpractice .
it 's consumer fraud , which must be punished , " he said .
the problem with organic cotton from india primarily involves the small structures of the farming sector , hofstetter said .
he pointed out that many small fields in the country were often clustered together in close proximity to each other , cultivating a variety of different crops – organic , conventional and gm .
that often resulted in crop contamination from one field to the other , he said .
on friday , german newspaper financial times deutschland reported that last year , a large volume of gm cotton produced in india had been sold as organic cotton .
the newspaper said indian authorities had discovered the incident in april 2009 .
it quoted the head of the indian agricultural authority , apeda , sanjay dave , saying they were dealing with fraud on " a gigantic scale . "
two european certification companies , responsible for ensuring that producers stick to eco-friendly standards , had awarded the organic label .
the newspaper said it remained unclear whether the certifiers , a dutch and a french company , had knowingly and falsely labeled the cotton as " organic . "
setback to clothing firms a spokeswoman for the swedish clothing chain h & m told news agency afp that the company became aware of the incident last year .
she said it could n't be ruled out that the tainted cotton had landed in h & m 's organic range .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h & m says it 's looking into the incident clothing retailer c & a , which has head offices in brussels and duesseldorf , has announced it planned to carry out a thorough investigation .
the controversy could have serious implications for both firms at a time when companies are trying to profit from jumping on the organic bandwagon .
in fact , h & m is set to launch its spring " garden collection " in march , which the chain says " is made using organic and recycled materials . " rb / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

consumer groups in germany have criticized clothing chains h & m and c & a after media reports said the two firms had allegedly used genetically-modified cotton from india in their eco-friendly range . monika buening of the federal consumer affairs agency said the two companies needed to take action fast to limit the damage .
" the fashion chains -lrb- h & m and c & a -rrb- were not vigilant enough , " the frankfurter rundschau newspaper quoted her as saying in its saturday edition .
buening demanded the clothing chains must now " disclose their supply chain " and " inspect their certifiers better , at least by conducting random checks . "
rebecca harms , a member of the european parliament for germany 's green party , called for tighter controls on organic textiles from the developing world .

he pointed out that many small fields in the country were often clustered together in close proximity to each other , cultivating a variety of different crops – organic , conventional and gm .
that often resulted in crop contamination from one field to the other , he said .
on friday , german newspaper financial times deutschland reported that last year , a large volume of gm cotton produced in india had been sold as organic cotton .
the newspaper said indian authorities had discovered the incident in april 2009 .
it quoted the head of the indian agricultural authority , apeda , sanjay dave , saying they were dealing with fraud on " a gigantic scale . "
two european certification companies , responsible for ensuring that producers stick to eco-friendly standards , had awarded the organic label .
the newspaper said it remained unclear whether the certifiers , a dutch and a french company , had knowingly and falsely labeled the cotton as " organic . "

it helps the convicts gain media skills and allows kids on the outside to see that prison is far worse than they 've heard . most people 's idea of what prison must be like comes from the movies .
now , a group of juvenile prisoners in germany are going public with the non-hollywood version of their everyday lives . while their own mobility is rather limited , the internet gives them direct access to an unlimited audience .
the young prisoners create videos and audios behind bars and upload them to their web site podknast.de.
the program , which is sponsored by the state broadcasting authority of the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , has caught on quickly and many view it as an opportunity to educate young people about the realities of life in prison . " this project helps young men come to terms with their crimes and to acquire media skills , " explained inga roy , program coordinator and educator at the siegburg correctional facility .

the young men , whose crimes range from driving without a license to assault and even murder , volunteer to participate in the program . on the one hand , the podknast project is designed to retrain prisoners and ease them back into the job market once they have served their time .
the new skills they have acquired while working in this program can all be used on the outside . the podcasts , which are regularly updated on the site , have been produced by the prisoners with the technical help of students from the aachen university of applied sciences .

the young prisoners wanted their podcasts and videos to reflect the fact that prison life is not as glamorous as some believe it to be . " every morning i wake up , work , eat , shower , have some free time , and that 's it .
not even a dog is as confined as i am , " dennis added .
through the podknast project , dennis has had the opportunity to get out of his cell and leave the grey prison compound for short periods of time . the project has proven very popular among young people , parents , and social workers .
to add to its success , more and more schools and police stations have picked up on the production series as a tool to dissuade young people from committing crimes . true identities despite the accolades the site has received , some say the project has allowed criminals a luxury they do not deserve - all at the expense of the taxpayer .
those involved in the project , though , have said they feel more prepared for life after prison and have a greater ability to concentrate . in many of the videos , the prisoners decided against having their faces pixeled in order to make the scenes more realistic .
by being open about their identity , they risk being recognized in the future by potential employers . " i would like to be able to tell my future employer or school students that i took part in this project , " said marcel , a 21-year old serving a sentence for breaking and entering . " if they do n't hire me because of that , that 's just something i will have to learn to accept .

the program , which is sponsored by the state broadcasting authority of the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , has caught on quickly and many view it as an opportunity to educate young people about the realities of life in prison . " this project helps young men come to terms with their crimes and to acquire media skills , " explained inga roy , program coordinator and educator at the siegburg correctional facility . " more importantly , though , our goal is to make a project that will act as a deterrent for other young people , " she said . looking ahead to freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prisoners are allowed more freedom in order to film the podcasts currently four correctional facilities in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia are taking part in the program .
the young men , whose crimes range from driving without a license to assault and even murder , volunteer to participate in the program . on the one hand , the podknast project is designed to retrain prisoners and ease them back into the job market once they have served their time .
the new skills they have acquired while working in this program can all be used on the outside . the podcasts , which are regularly updated on the site , have been produced by the prisoners with the technical help of students from the aachen university of applied sciences . " you learn how to be a team player , " dennis , a young prisoner who is currently serving a two-year sentence , said of the project .
" but when you are always confined to a cell , you ca n't be as creative .
you need more variety . " the truth about life in prison the online postings have addressed issues like prison violence and the banality of life behind bars .
the young prisoners wanted their podcasts and videos to reflect the fact that prison life is not as glamorous as some believe it to be . " every morning i wake up , work , eat , shower , have some free time , and that 's it .
not even a dog is as confined as i am , " dennis added .
through the podknast project , dennis has had the opportunity to get out of his cell and leave the grey prison compound for short periods of time . the project has proven very popular among young people , parents , and social workers .
to add to its success , more and more schools and police stations have picked up on the production series as a tool to dissuade young people from committing crimes . true identities despite the accolades the site has received , some say the project has allowed criminals a luxury they do not deserve - all at the expense of the taxpayer .
those involved in the project , though , have said they feel more prepared for life after prison and have a greater ability to concentrate . in many of the videos , the prisoners decided against having their faces pixeled in order to make the scenes more realistic .
by being open about their identity , they risk being recognized in the future by potential employers . " i would like to be able to tell my future employer or school students that i took part in this project , " said marcel , a 21-year old serving a sentence for breaking and entering . " if they do n't hire me because of that , that 's just something i will have to learn to accept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.01.2010 european clothing chains hit by ' fake ' organic label controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how green are those clothes really ?
consumer groups in germany have criticized clothing chains h & m and c & a after media reports said the two firms had allegedly used genetically-modified cotton from india in their eco-friendly range . monika buening of the federal consumer affairs agency said the two companies needed to take action fast to limit the damage .
" the fashion chains -lrb- h & m and c & a -rrb- were not vigilant enough , " the frankfurter rundschau newspaper quoted her as saying in its saturday edition .
buening demanded the clothing chains must now " disclose their supply chain " and " inspect their certifiers better , at least by conducting random checks . "
rebecca harms , a member of the european parliament for germany 's green party , called for tighter controls on organic textiles from the developing world .
" consumer fraud " environmental organization greenpeace called for a legal investigation into the matter .
the organization 's agricultural expert , martin hofstetter , told german radio station mdr that some products which had not been organically produced , were being sold as such .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not easy to find out whether organic clothes are really what they claim to be " this is a major malpractice .
it 's consumer fraud , which must be punished , " he said .
the problem with organic cotton from india primarily involves the small structures of the farming sector , hofstetter said .
he pointed out that many small fields in the country were often clustered together in close proximity to each other , cultivating a variety of different crops – organic , conventional and gm .
that often resulted in crop contamination from one field to the other , he said .
on friday , german newspaper financial times deutschland reported that last year , a large volume of gm cotton produced in india had been sold as organic cotton .
the newspaper said indian authorities had discovered the incident in april 2009 .

consumer groups in germany have criticized clothing chains h & m and c & a after media reports said the two firms had allegedly used genetically-modified cotton from india in their eco-friendly range . monika buening of the federal consumer affairs agency said the two companies needed to take action fast to limit the damage .
" the fashion chains -lrb- h & m and c & a -rrb- were not vigilant enough , " the frankfurter rundschau newspaper quoted her as saying in its saturday edition .
buening demanded the clothing chains must now " disclose their supply chain " and " inspect their certifiers better , at least by conducting random checks . "
rebecca harms , a member of the european parliament for germany 's green party , called for tighter controls on organic textiles from the developing world .
" consumer fraud " environmental organization greenpeace called for a legal investigation into the matter .
the organization 's agricultural expert , martin hofstetter , told german radio station mdr that some products which had not been organically produced , were being sold as such .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not easy to find out whether organic clothes are really what they claim to be " this is a major malpractice .
it 's consumer fraud , which must be punished , " he said .
the problem with organic cotton from india primarily involves the small structures of the farming sector , hofstetter said .
he pointed out that many small fields in the country were often clustered together in close proximity to each other , cultivating a variety of different crops – organic , conventional and gm .
that often resulted in crop contamination from one field to the other , he said .
on friday , german newspaper financial times deutschland reported that last year , a large volume of gm cotton produced in india had been sold as organic cotton .
the newspaper said indian authorities had discovered the incident in april 2009 .
it quoted the head of the indian agricultural authority , apeda , sanjay dave , saying they were dealing with fraud on " a gigantic scale . "

consumer groups in germany have criticized clothing chains h & m and c & a after media reports said the two firms had allegedly used genetically-modified cotton from india in their eco-friendly range . monika buening of the federal consumer affairs agency said the two companies needed to take action fast to limit the damage .
" the fashion chains -lrb- h & m and c & a -rrb- were not vigilant enough , " the frankfurter rundschau newspaper quoted her as saying in its saturday edition .
buening demanded the clothing chains must now " disclose their supply chain " and " inspect their certifiers better , at least by conducting random checks . "
rebecca harms , a member of the european parliament for germany 's green party , called for tighter controls on organic textiles from the developing world .
" consumer fraud " environmental organization greenpeace called for a legal investigation into the matter .
the organization 's agricultural expert , martin hofstetter , told german radio station mdr that some products which had not been organically produced , were being sold as such .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not easy to find out whether organic clothes are really what they claim to be " this is a major malpractice .
it 's consumer fraud , which must be punished , " he said .
the problem with organic cotton from india primarily involves the small structures of the farming sector , hofstetter said .
he pointed out that many small fields in the country were often clustered together in close proximity to each other , cultivating a variety of different crops – organic , conventional and gm .
that often resulted in crop contamination from one field to the other , he said .
on friday , german newspaper financial times deutschland reported that last year , a large volume of gm cotton produced in india had been sold as organic cotton .
the newspaper said indian authorities had discovered the incident in april 2009 .
it quoted the head of the indian agricultural authority , apeda , sanjay dave , saying they were dealing with fraud on " a gigantic scale . "
two european certification companies , responsible for ensuring that producers stick to eco-friendly standards , had awarded the organic label .
the newspaper said it remained unclear whether the certifiers , a dutch and a french company , had knowingly and falsely labeled the cotton as " organic . "
setback to clothing firms a spokeswoman for the swedish clothing chain h & m told news agency afp that the company became aware of the incident last year .
she said it could n't be ruled out that the tainted cotton had landed in h & m 's organic range .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h & m says it 's looking into the incident clothing retailer c & a , which has head offices in brussels and duesseldorf , has announced it planned to carry out a thorough investigation .
the controversy could have serious implications for both firms at a time when companies are trying to profit from jumping on the organic bandwagon .
in fact , h & m is set to launch its spring " garden collection " in march , which the chain says " is made using organic and recycled materials . " rb / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the club announced the news after a 1-0 away defeat to dortmund which leaves it in fifth place . ruud van nistelrooy signed a contract with hamburg on a free transfer from real madrid in what is the most daring personnel move in the bundesliga this winter .
the former dutch international netted 46 goals in 68 league games for real .
a knee injury put him out of action last season , and he was having difficulty getting playing time at the spanish giants .
van nistelrooy , who has played for manchester united and psv eindhoven , is the only player to have been top scorer in the english , dutch and spanish leagues .
the deal will last until 2011 and van nistelrooy will earn much less than the salary of 6 million euros -lrb- $ 8.5 million -rrb- he received at real .
" i am delighted that it worked out , " said van nistelrooy .
" hsv is a great club , has a strong team and great ambitions .
and i have great ambitions as well , " he said .
manager bruno labbadia said the striker , who retired from international football in 2008 but has been mulling a comeback for the oranje at the world cup , was a valuable addition to his squad .
" i am convinced that he will score important goals for hamburg , " he said .
" it shows this club 's standing that a player of ruud van nistelrooy 's caliber would choose to come here . "
hamburg had been competing with english sides tottenham hotspur and west ham united for the striker 's services. rc / afp / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it helps the convicts gain media skills and allows kids on the outside to see that prison is far worse than they 've heard . most people 's idea of what prison must be like comes from the movies .
now , a group of juvenile prisoners in germany are going public with the non-hollywood version of their everyday lives . while their own mobility is rather limited , the internet gives them direct access to an unlimited audience .
the young prisoners create videos and audios behind bars and upload them to their web site podknast.de.
the program , which is sponsored by the state broadcasting authority of the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , has caught on quickly and many view it as an opportunity to educate young people about the realities of life in prison . " this project helps young men come to terms with their crimes and to acquire media skills , " explained inga roy , program coordinator and educator at the siegburg correctional facility . " more importantly , though , our goal is to make a project that will act as a deterrent for other young people , " she said . looking ahead to freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prisoners are allowed more freedom in order to film the podcasts currently four correctional facilities in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia are taking part in the program .
the young men , whose crimes range from driving without a license to assault and even murder , volunteer to participate in the program . on the one hand , the podknast project is designed to retrain prisoners and ease them back into the job market once they have served their time .
the new skills they have acquired while working in this program can all be used on the outside . the podcasts , which are regularly updated on the site , have been produced by the prisoners with the technical help of students from the aachen university of applied sciences . " you learn how to be a team player , " dennis , a young prisoner who is currently serving a two-year sentence , said of the project .
" but when you are always confined to a cell , you ca n't be as creative .
you need more variety . " the truth about life in prison the online postings have addressed issues like prison violence and the banality of life behind bars .
the young prisoners wanted their podcasts and videos to reflect the fact that prison life is not as glamorous as some believe it to be . " every morning i wake up , work , eat , shower , have some free time , and that 's it .
not even a dog is as confined as i am , " dennis added .
through the podknast project , dennis has had the opportunity to get out of his cell and leave the grey prison compound for short periods of time . the project has proven very popular among young people , parents , and social workers .
to add to its success , more and more schools and police stations have picked up on the production series as a tool to dissuade young people from committing crimes . true identities despite the accolades the site has received , some say the project has allowed criminals a luxury they do not deserve - all at the expense of the taxpayer .
those involved in the project , though , have said they feel more prepared for life after prison and have a greater ability to concentrate . in many of the videos , the prisoners decided against having their faces pixeled in order to make the scenes more realistic .
by being open about their identity , they risk being recognized in the future by potential employers . " i would like to be able to tell my future employer or school students that i took part in this project , " said marcel , a 21-year old serving a sentence for breaking and entering . " if they do n't hire me because of that , that 's just something i will have to learn to accept .

" this project helps young men come to terms with their crimes and to acquire media skills , " explained inga roy , program coordinator and educator at the siegburg correctional facility .

the young men , whose crimes range from driving without a license to assault and even murder , volunteer to participate in the program . on the one hand , the podknast project is designed to retrain prisoners and ease them back into the job market once they have served their time .
the new skills they have acquired while working in this program can all be used on the outside . the podcasts , which are regularly updated on the site , have been produced by the prisoners with the technical help of students from the aachen university of applied sciences .

" but when you are always confined to a cell , you ca n't be as creative .
you need more variety . " the truth about life in prison the online postings have addressed issues like prison violence and the banality of life behind bars .
the young prisoners wanted their podcasts and videos to reflect the fact that prison life is not as glamorous as some believe it to be . " every morning i wake up , work , eat , shower , have some free time , and that 's it .
not even a dog is as confined as i am , " dennis added .
through the podknast project , dennis has had the opportunity to get out of his cell and leave the grey prison compound for short periods of time . the project has proven very popular among young people , parents , and social workers .
to add to its success , more and more schools and police stations have picked up on the production series as a tool to dissuade young people from committing crimes . true identities despite the accolades the site has received , some say the project has allowed criminals a luxury they do not deserve - all at the expense of the taxpayer .
those involved in the project , though , have said they feel more prepared for life after prison and have a greater ability to concentrate . in many of the videos , the prisoners decided against having their faces pixeled in order to make the scenes more realistic .
by being open about their identity , they risk being recognized in the future by potential employers . " i would like to be able to tell my future employer or school students that i took part in this project , " said marcel , a 21-year old serving a sentence for breaking and entering . " if they do n't hire me because of that , that 's just something i will have to learn to accept .

it helps the convicts gain media skills and allows kids on the outside to see that prison is far worse than they 've heard . most people 's idea of what prison must be like comes from the movies .
now , a group of juvenile prisoners in germany are going public with the non-hollywood version of their everyday lives . while their own mobility is rather limited , the internet gives them direct access to an unlimited audience .
the young prisoners create videos and audios behind bars and upload them to their web site podknast.de.
the program , which is sponsored by the state broadcasting authority of the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , has caught on quickly and many view it as an opportunity to educate young people about the realities of life in prison . " this project helps young men come to terms with their crimes and to acquire media skills , " explained inga roy , program coordinator and educator at the siegburg correctional facility . " more importantly , though , our goal is to make a project that will act as a deterrent for other young people , " she said . looking ahead to freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prisoners are allowed more freedom in order to film the podcasts currently four correctional facilities in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia are taking part in the program .
the young men , whose crimes range from driving without a license to assault and even murder , volunteer to participate in the program . on the one hand , the podknast project is designed to retrain prisoners and ease them back into the job market once they have served their time .
the new skills they have acquired while working in this program can all be used on the outside . the podcasts , which are regularly updated on the site , have been produced by the prisoners with the technical help of students from the aachen university of applied sciences .

" but when you are always confined to a cell , you ca n't be as creative .
you need more variety . " the truth about life in prison the online postings have addressed issues like prison violence and the banality of life behind bars .
the young prisoners wanted their podcasts and videos to reflect the fact that prison life is not as glamorous as some believe it to be . " every morning i wake up , work , eat , shower , have some free time , and that 's it .
not even a dog is as confined as i am , " dennis added .
through the podknast project , dennis has had the opportunity to get out of his cell and leave the grey prison compound for short periods of time . the project has proven very popular among young people , parents , and social workers .
to add to its success , more and more schools and police stations have picked up on the production series as a tool to dissuade young people from committing crimes . true identities despite the accolades the site has received , some say the project has allowed criminals a luxury they do not deserve - all at the expense of the taxpayer .
those involved in the project , though , have said they feel more prepared for life after prison and have a greater ability to concentrate . in many of the videos , the prisoners decided against having their faces pixeled in order to make the scenes more realistic .
by being open about their identity , they risk being recognized in the future by potential employers . " i would like to be able to tell my future employer or school students that i took part in this project , " said marcel , a 21-year old serving a sentence for breaking and entering . " if they do n't hire me because of that , that 's just something i will have to learn to accept .

consumer groups in germany have criticized clothing chains h & m and c & a after media reports said the two firms had allegedly used genetically-modified cotton from india in their eco-friendly range . monika buening of the federal consumer affairs agency said the two companies needed to take action fast to limit the damage .
" the fashion chains -lrb- h & m and c & a -rrb- were not vigilant enough , " the frankfurter rundschau newspaper quoted her as saying in its saturday edition .
buening demanded the clothing chains must now " disclose their supply chain " and " inspect their certifiers better , at least by conducting random checks . "
rebecca harms , a member of the european parliament for germany 's green party , called for tighter controls on organic textiles from the developing world .
" consumer fraud " environmental organization greenpeace called for a legal investigation into the matter .
the organization 's agricultural expert , martin hofstetter , told german radio station mdr that some products which had not been organically produced , were being sold as such .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not easy to find out whether organic clothes are really what they claim to be " this is a major malpractice .
it 's consumer fraud , which must be punished , " he said .
the problem with organic cotton from india primarily involves the small structures of the farming sector , hofstetter said .
he pointed out that many small fields in the country were often clustered together in close proximity to each other , cultivating a variety of different crops – organic , conventional and gm .
that often resulted in crop contamination from one field to the other , he said .
on friday , german newspaper financial times deutschland reported that last year , a large volume of gm cotton produced in india had been sold as organic cotton .
the newspaper said indian authorities had discovered the incident in april 2009 .
it quoted the head of the indian agricultural authority , apeda , sanjay dave , saying they were dealing with fraud on " a gigantic scale . "
two european certification companies , responsible for ensuring that producers stick to eco-friendly standards , had awarded the organic label .
the newspaper said it remained unclear whether the certifiers , a dutch and a french company , had knowingly and falsely labeled the cotton as " organic . "
setback to clothing firms a spokeswoman for the swedish clothing chain h & m told news agency afp that the company became aware of the incident last year .
she said it could n't be ruled out that the tainted cotton had landed in h & m 's organic range .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h & m says it 's looking into the incident clothing retailer c & a , which has head offices in brussels and duesseldorf , has announced it planned to carry out a thorough investigation .
the controversy could have serious implications for both firms at a time when companies are trying to profit from jumping on the organic bandwagon .
in fact , h & m is set to launch its spring " garden collection " in march , which the chain says " is made using organic and recycled materials . " rb / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it helps the convicts gain media skills and allows kids on the outside to see that prison is far worse than they 've heard . most people 's idea of what prison must be like comes from the movies .
now , a group of juvenile prisoners in germany are going public with the non-hollywood version of their everyday lives . while their own mobility is rather limited , the internet gives them direct access to an unlimited audience .
the young prisoners create videos and audios behind bars and upload them to their web site podknast.de.
the program , which is sponsored by the state broadcasting authority of the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , has caught on quickly and many view it as an opportunity to educate young people about the realities of life in prison . " this project helps young men come to terms with their crimes and to acquire media skills , " explained inga roy , program coordinator and educator at the siegburg correctional facility . " more importantly , though , our goal is to make a project that will act as a deterrent for other young people , " she said . looking ahead to freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prisoners are allowed more freedom in order to film the podcasts currently four correctional facilities in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia are taking part in the program .
the young men , whose crimes range from driving without a license to assault and even murder , volunteer to participate in the program . on the one hand , the podknast project is designed to retrain prisoners and ease them back into the job market once they have served their time .

" but when you are always confined to a cell , you ca n't be as creative .

the young prisoners wanted their podcasts and videos to reflect the fact that prison life is not as glamorous as some believe it to be . " every morning i wake up , work , eat , shower , have some free time , and that 's it .
not even a dog is as confined as i am , " dennis added .
through the podknast project , dennis has had the opportunity to get out of his cell and leave the grey prison compound for short periods of time . the project has proven very popular among young people , parents , and social workers .
to add to its success , more and more schools and police stations have picked up on the production series as a tool to dissuade young people from committing crimes . true identities despite the accolades the site has received , some say the project has allowed criminals a luxury they do not deserve - all at the expense of the taxpayer .
those involved in the project , though , have said they feel more prepared for life after prison and have a greater ability to concentrate . in many of the videos , the prisoners decided against having their faces pixeled in order to make the scenes more realistic .
by being open about their identity , they risk being recognized in the future by potential employers . " i would like to be able to tell my future employer or school students that i took part in this project , " said marcel , a 21-year old serving a sentence for breaking and entering . " if they do n't hire me because of that , that 's just something i will have to learn to accept .

it helps the convicts gain media skills and allows kids on the outside to see that prison is far worse than they 've heard . most people 's idea of what prison must be like comes from the movies .
now , a group of juvenile prisoners in germany are going public with the non-hollywood version of their everyday lives . while their own mobility is rather limited , the internet gives them direct access to an unlimited audience .
the young prisoners create videos and audios behind bars and upload them to their web site podknast.de.
the program , which is sponsored by the state broadcasting authority of the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , has caught on quickly and many view it as an opportunity to educate young people about the realities of life in prison . " this project helps young men come to terms with their crimes and to acquire media skills , " explained inga roy , program coordinator and educator at the siegburg correctional facility . " more importantly , though , our goal is to make a project that will act as a deterrent for other young people , " she said . looking ahead to freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prisoners are allowed more freedom in order to film the podcasts currently four correctional facilities in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia are taking part in the program .
the young men , whose crimes range from driving without a license to assault and even murder , volunteer to participate in the program . on the one hand , the podknast project is designed to retrain prisoners and ease them back into the job market once they have served their time .
the new skills they have acquired while working in this program can all be used on the outside . the podcasts , which are regularly updated on the site , have been produced by the prisoners with the technical help of students from the aachen university of applied sciences . " you learn how to be a team player , " dennis , a young prisoner who is currently serving a two-year sentence , said of the project .
" but when you are always confined to a cell , you ca n't be as creative .
you need more variety . " the truth about life in prison the online postings have addressed issues like prison violence and the banality of life behind bars .
the young prisoners wanted their podcasts and videos to reflect the fact that prison life is not as glamorous as some believe it to be . " every morning i wake up , work , eat , shower , have some free time , and that 's it .
not even a dog is as confined as i am , " dennis added .
through the podknast project , dennis has had the opportunity to get out of his cell and leave the grey prison compound for short periods of time . the project has proven very popular among young people , parents , and social workers .
to add to its success , more and more schools and police stations have picked up on the production series as a tool to dissuade young people from committing crimes . true identities despite the accolades the site has received , some say the project has allowed criminals a luxury they do not deserve - all at the expense of the taxpayer .
those involved in the project , though , have said they feel more prepared for life after prison and have a greater ability to concentrate . in many of the videos , the prisoners decided against having their faces pixeled in order to make the scenes more realistic .
by being open about their identity , they risk being recognized in the future by potential employers . " i would like to be able to tell my future employer or school students that i took part in this project , " said marcel , a 21-year old serving a sentence for breaking and entering .
