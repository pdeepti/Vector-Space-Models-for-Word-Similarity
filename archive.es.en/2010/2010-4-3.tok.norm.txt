but behind the modernity , promenades off the beaten path recall centuries past and the women who lived , loved - and even killed there . whether you 're particularly interested in women 's history or just looking for something different , cologne 's " rheinauhafen " harbor is at once a pretty walk and a place for female tales of murder , success and the extraordinary . the industrial harbor 's promenades will strike a casual stroller with their contemporary , glass-encased buildings and bridges .

this year , for the first time , polish and russian authorities will commemorate the victims together . seventy years ago , an estimated 22,000 polish soldiers were executed by the soviet union 's secret police , the nkvd , in the katyn forest in russia . on april 7 , russian prime minister vladimir putin and his polish counterpart , donald tusk , will mark the katyn massacre officially for the first time . polish foreign minister radoslav sikorski has described the meeting as " another step towards polish-russian reconciliation . " for years , the soviets blamed german nazis for the killings , and it was only in 1990 that then-kremlin leader mikhail gorbachev admitted his country 's responsibility . gruesome events bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigations into the killings by the us senate in the 1950s blamed the soviets following the division of poland between hitler and stalin , polish officers found themselves in 1939 under soviet captivity .
the russian secret service feared the poles would rise up against moscow , so stalin gave his blessing to a mass execution , which started on april 3 , 1940 . three years later , the germans found parts of the mass graves in katyn near smolensk , and used the find to fuel anti-soviet propaganda .
the exiled polish government , then in london , broke off contact with the kremlin . after of the war , stalin tried to cover up the crime .
in addition to the mass grave in katyn , others were detected in piatykhatky and mednoe .
as the soviets blamed german nazis for the war crimes , the truth was buried for decades . polish-russian tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director andrzej wajda 's film ' katyn ' depicts the executions since gorbachev admitted the soviet responsibility , there has been tension between moscow and warsaw over the katyn massacre .

the result came despite two goals for stefan kiessling who , with kuranyi , is joint top scorer in the league .
selim teber put frankfurt in front with a penalty before kiessling scored his brace .
leverkusen were forced to play almost all of the second half with 10 men after defender daniel schwaab was sent off for a tackle from behind .

kevin grosskreutz and neven subotic both scored first half headers for dortmund , while bremen forward aaron hunt pulled one back for his team half way through the second half .
stuttgart finished up level on points with hamburg after a 2-1 victory against moenchengladbach .
meanwhile there was a 1-1 draw for freiburg and bochum , goals coming from papiss cisse and christoph dabrowski .
bottom club hertha berlin kept their hopes of top-flight survival alive with a 3-0 victory away at cologne . relegation worries for nuremberg were eased with a 2-0 win over mainz courtesy of goals from mike frantz and eric maxim choupo-moting .

despite a good start for the bavarians , the match proved to be a tough test of resolve . bayern munich returned to the top of the german bundesliga by clinching a 2-1 win away from home at the ground of their closest challengers schalke .
bayern had enjoyed a strong lead after frank ribery and thomas mueller netted two goals within two minutes in the first half .
ribery broke the deadlock for the visitors on 25 minutes with a well-placed strike from 10 meters .
bayern doubled their tally immediately afterwards as an assist from croatia international ivica olic allowed mueller to sidefoot the ball into an empty net .
five minutes later schalke hit back with a header from striker kevin kuranyi - just before bayern 's hamit altintop handed the home side a huge advantage .
two men sent off altintop was sent off after he picked up two yellow cards in rapid succession for an altercation with the referee 's assistant and a late tackle on brazilian defender rafinha .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt scored their winner a minute from full time schalke failed to capitalize on their numerical advantage and were themselves left with just ten men when marcelo bordon was dismissed for a second bookable offence .
bayern now have 59 points from their 29 games , compared to 58 for schalke .
" this is a very important win but it was the minimum that we had to do .
the next couple of matches are crucial , " said bayern captain mark van bommel .
leverkusen lose on the road schalke 's fellow title chasers bayer leverkusen lost 3-2 away from home against eintracht frankfurt .
the result came despite two goals for stefan kiessling who , with kuranyi , is joint top scorer in the league .
selim teber put frankfurt in front with a penalty before kiessling scored his brace .
leverkusen were forced to play almost all of the second half with 10 men after defender daniel schwaab was sent off for a tackle from behind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subotic put one of two first-half headers past the keeper caio was able to fire in an unstoppable effort from 30 meters to level the score for frankfurt , who won the game a minute from time with a close-range overhead kick from maik franz .
dortmund tighten hold borussia dortmund strengthened their grip on fourth spot with a 2-1 win against fifth-placed werder bremen .
kevin grosskreutz and neven subotic both scored first half headers for dortmund , while bremen forward aaron hunt pulled one back for his team half way through the second half .
stuttgart finished up level on points with hamburg after a 2-1 victory against moenchengladbach .
meanwhile there was a 1-1 draw for freiburg and bochum , goals coming from papiss cisse and christoph dabrowski .
bottom club hertha berlin kept their hopes of top-flight survival alive with a 3-0 victory away at cologne . relegation worries for nuremberg were eased with a 2-0 win over mainz courtesy of goals from mike frantz and eric maxim choupo-moting .
mainz played the bulk of the match with 10 men after the 4th minute dismissal of andreas ivanschitz . rc / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite a good start for the bavarians , the match proved to be a tough test of resolve . bayern munich returned to the top of the german bundesliga by clinching a 2-1 win away from home at the ground of their closest challengers schalke .
bayern had enjoyed a strong lead after frank ribery and thomas mueller netted two goals within two minutes in the first half .

bayern doubled their tally immediately afterwards as an assist from croatia international ivica olic allowed mueller to sidefoot the ball into an empty net .
five minutes later schalke hit back with a header from striker kevin kuranyi - just before bayern 's hamit altintop handed the home side a huge advantage .

" this is a very important win but it was the minimum that we had to do .
the next couple of matches are crucial , " said bayern captain mark van bommel .
leverkusen lose on the road schalke 's fellow title chasers bayer leverkusen lost 3-2 away from home against eintracht frankfurt .
the result came despite two goals for stefan kiessling who , with kuranyi , is joint top scorer in the league .
selim teber put frankfurt in front with a penalty before kiessling scored his brace .
leverkusen were forced to play almost all of the second half with 10 men after defender daniel schwaab was sent off for a tackle from behind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subotic put one of two first-half headers past the keeper caio was able to fire in an unstoppable effort from 30 meters to level the score for frankfurt , who won the game a minute from time with a close-range overhead kick from maik franz .
dortmund tighten hold borussia dortmund strengthened their grip on fourth spot with a 2-1 win against fifth-placed werder bremen .
kevin grosskreutz and neven subotic both scored first half headers for dortmund , while bremen forward aaron hunt pulled one back for his team half way through the second half .
stuttgart finished up level on points with hamburg after a 2-1 victory against moenchengladbach .
meanwhile there was a 1-1 draw for freiburg and bochum , goals coming from papiss cisse and christoph dabrowski .
bottom club hertha berlin kept their hopes of top-flight survival alive with a 3-0 victory away at cologne . relegation worries for nuremberg were eased with a 2-0 win over mainz courtesy of goals from mike frantz and eric maxim choupo-moting .

but behind the modernity , promenades off the beaten path recall centuries past and the women who lived , loved - and even killed there . whether you 're particularly interested in women 's history or just looking for something different , cologne 's " rheinauhafen " harbor is at once a pretty walk and a place for female tales of murder , success and the extraordinary . the industrial harbor 's promenades will strike a casual stroller with their contemporary , glass-encased buildings and bridges .
but here , just north of cologne 's historic old town , promenades and plazas give clear reference to the past - and the women who shaped it . blood flowed in roman times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agrippina was responsible for making cologne a city female influence on the neighborhood even dates back to roman times and it 's no coincidence that the central road through the southern section of the harbor is called the agrippina dock . " today there is a lot of agrippina in cologne : the agrippina dock , an agrippina shore , and a statue near the historical town hall tower , " said tour guide and cologne architect anna maria bermejo .
agrippina the younger was born in 15 ad in cologne , which was then known as oppidum ubiorum . agrippina later married emperor claudius after he had his own wife assassinated .
in 50 ad , she convinced him to acknowledge oppidum ubiorum and rename it colonia claudia ara agrippinensium . those were ruthless times , indeed .
when claudius refused to recognize agrippina 's son nero from her first marriage as his heir , she had him killed .
nero then demanded the right to rule , but when agrippina refused , her own son had her assassinated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : named after a 19-century philantropist , the laura-von-oelbermann promenade offers a spectacular river view nowadays " there is also an agrippina insurance company that one really could have used back in the day , " bermejo said . leaving their mark in different ways agrippina dock is n't the only location on the rhine harbor named for an important local woman .

despite a good start for the bavarians , the match proved to be a tough test of resolve . bayern munich returned to the top of the german bundesliga by clinching a 2-1 win away from home at the ground of their closest challengers schalke .
bayern had enjoyed a strong lead after frank ribery and thomas mueller netted two goals within two minutes in the first half .
ribery broke the deadlock for the visitors on 25 minutes with a well-placed strike from 10 meters .
bayern doubled their tally immediately afterwards as an assist from croatia international ivica olic allowed mueller to sidefoot the ball into an empty net .
five minutes later schalke hit back with a header from striker kevin kuranyi - just before bayern 's hamit altintop handed the home side a huge advantage .
two men sent off altintop was sent off after he picked up two yellow cards in rapid succession for an altercation with the referee 's assistant and a late tackle on brazilian defender rafinha .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt scored their winner a minute from full time schalke failed to capitalize on their numerical advantage and were themselves left with just ten men when marcelo bordon was dismissed for a second bookable offence .
bayern now have 59 points from their 29 games , compared to 58 for schalke .
" this is a very important win but it was the minimum that we had to do .
the next couple of matches are crucial , " said bayern captain mark van bommel .
leverkusen lose on the road schalke 's fellow title chasers bayer leverkusen lost 3-2 away from home against eintracht frankfurt .
the result came despite two goals for stefan kiessling who , with kuranyi , is joint top scorer in the league .
selim teber put frankfurt in front with a penalty before kiessling scored his brace .
leverkusen were forced to play almost all of the second half with 10 men after defender daniel schwaab was sent off for a tackle from behind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subotic put one of two first-half headers past the keeper caio was able to fire in an unstoppable effort from 30 meters to level the score for frankfurt , who won the game a minute from time with a close-range overhead kick from maik franz .
dortmund tighten hold borussia dortmund strengthened their grip on fourth spot with a 2-1 win against fifth-placed werder bremen .
kevin grosskreutz and neven subotic both scored first half headers for dortmund , while bremen forward aaron hunt pulled one back for his team half way through the second half .
stuttgart finished up level on points with hamburg after a 2-1 victory against moenchengladbach .
meanwhile there was a 1-1 draw for freiburg and bochum , goals coming from papiss cisse and christoph dabrowski .
bottom club hertha berlin kept their hopes of top-flight survival alive with a 3-0 victory away at cologne . relegation worries for nuremberg were eased with a 2-0 win over mainz courtesy of goals from mike frantz and eric maxim choupo-moting .
mainz played the bulk of the match with 10 men after the 4th minute dismissal of andreas ivanschitz . rc / dpa / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we will not take any former prisoners , " saxony premier stanislaw tillich of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- said on saturday in an interview with daily berliner zeitung .
" we do n't see ourselves as having any obligation .
after all , we did not take them prisoner , " he added .
tillich 's comments follow an announcement from german interior minister thomas de maiziere , also cdu , that germany is considering accepting the guantanamo inmates .
joachim herrmann , the bavarian interior minister , has also made his opposition to the proposals clear .
" i 'm not having anyone coming into bavaria , " he said .
alexander dobrindt , general secretary of the bavarian sister party to chancellor merkel 's cdu , was similarly resolute .
" no one could be so naive as to take in potential al qaeda supporters , " he told weekly newsmagazine der spiegel .
opposition in favor of accepting guantanamo inmates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german state leaders say accepting ex-prisoners is too risky greens leader renate kuenast of the opposition dismissed as " pure populism " suggestions that former guantanamo prisoners could have links to al qaeda .
" we germans must be prepared to make a thorough examination of the possibility of accepting former prisoners , " she told the newspaper welt am sonntag .
the deputy leader of the opposition social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , olaf scholz , has called the decision to accept former guantanamo inmates a question of credibility and solidarity .
" anyone who wants guantanamo to be closed has to be prepared , after thorough security checks , to actually take in prisoners , " he said .
berlin in talks with washington so far only germany 's most populous state , north-rhine westphalia , has come out in support of taking guantanamo detainees provided strict conditions were met .
these would include rigorous background checks to ensure that any prisoners taken in would present no security threat .
germany 's interior ministry confirmed last saturday that it had resumed talks with washington over the possibility of taking in selected inmates to be released from the guantanamo bay facility .
any take-up of former guantanamo prisoners would depend on whether they had a connection to germany as well as their potential risk , a government spokesman in berlin said .

despite a good start for the bavarians , the match proved to be a tough test of resolve . bayern munich returned to the top of the german bundesliga by clinching a 2-1 win away from home at the ground of their closest challengers schalke .
bayern had enjoyed a strong lead after frank ribery and thomas mueller netted two goals within two minutes in the first half .
ribery broke the deadlock for the visitors on 25 minutes with a well-placed strike from 10 meters .
bayern doubled their tally immediately afterwards as an assist from croatia international ivica olic allowed mueller to sidefoot the ball into an empty net .
five minutes later schalke hit back with a header from striker kevin kuranyi - just before bayern 's hamit altintop handed the home side a huge advantage .
two men sent off altintop was sent off after he picked up two yellow cards in rapid succession for an altercation with the referee 's assistant and a late tackle on brazilian defender rafinha .

" this is a very important win but it was the minimum that we had to do .
the next couple of matches are crucial , " said bayern captain mark van bommel .
leverkusen lose on the road schalke 's fellow title chasers bayer leverkusen lost 3-2 away from home against eintracht frankfurt .
the result came despite two goals for stefan kiessling who , with kuranyi , is joint top scorer in the league .
selim teber put frankfurt in front with a penalty before kiessling scored his brace .
leverkusen were forced to play almost all of the second half with 10 men after defender daniel schwaab was sent off for a tackle from behind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subotic put one of two first-half headers past the keeper caio was able to fire in an unstoppable effort from 30 meters to level the score for frankfurt , who won the game a minute from time with a close-range overhead kick from maik franz .

despite a good start for the bavarians , the match proved to be a tough test of resolve . bayern munich returned to the top of the german bundesliga by clinching a 2-1 win away from home at the ground of their closest challengers schalke .
bayern had enjoyed a strong lead after frank ribery and thomas mueller netted two goals within two minutes in the first half .
ribery broke the deadlock for the visitors on 25 minutes with a well-placed strike from 10 meters .
bayern doubled their tally immediately afterwards as an assist from croatia international ivica olic allowed mueller to sidefoot the ball into an empty net .
five minutes later schalke hit back with a header from striker kevin kuranyi - just before bayern 's hamit altintop handed the home side a huge advantage .
two men sent off altintop was sent off after he picked up two yellow cards in rapid succession for an altercation with the referee 's assistant and a late tackle on brazilian defender rafinha .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt scored their winner a minute from full time schalke failed to capitalize on their numerical advantage and were themselves left with just ten men when marcelo bordon was dismissed for a second bookable offence .
bayern now have 59 points from their 29 games , compared to 58 for schalke .
" this is a very important win but it was the minimum that we had to do .
the next couple of matches are crucial , " said bayern captain mark van bommel .
leverkusen lose on the road schalke 's fellow title chasers bayer leverkusen lost 3-2 away from home against eintracht frankfurt .
the result came despite two goals for stefan kiessling who , with kuranyi , is joint top scorer in the league .
selim teber put frankfurt in front with a penalty before kiessling scored his brace .
leverkusen were forced to play almost all of the second half with 10 men after defender daniel schwaab was sent off for a tackle from behind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subotic put one of two first-half headers past the keeper caio was able to fire in an unstoppable effort from 30 meters to level the score for frankfurt , who won the game a minute from time with a close-range overhead kick from maik franz .

the attack took place in chardarah , one of six districts that make up kunduz province , said the spokesperson at the german operational headquarters in potsdam near berlin .
the three soldiers who died were shot by the rebels .
the attacks began after a mine went off under a german armored vehicle .
around 200 taliban attackers were reported to have been involved in the battle with german and afghan police forces .
gun battle lasted hours local afghan government chief abdul wahid omar khil said german troops and afghan police exchanged fire with their attackers for about an hour , with fighting resuming three hours later .
omar khil said one taliban fighter was killed and another wounded , but that the germans and the afghan police were unable to use major firepower because the taliban were firing from inside and on top of civilian homes .
german chancellor angela merkel expressed shock at what she called " a despicable and underhanded attack on our soldiers in afghanistan . " german development aid minister dirk niebel , who is currently in afghanistan visiting german troops , called the attack " shameful . " since joining the nato-led isaf mission in 2002 , a total of 39 german soldiers have died in afghanistan , 24 of those in combat .
at present , over 4,300 bundeswehr troops are stationed in the country. td / glb / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop zollitsch hoped that easter would be a new start church has failed victims the head of the german bishops ' conference , archbishop robert zollitsch , had candidly admitted on friday that the church , as an institution , had failed to handle the sex abuse scandal adequately , and that , in the past , too little had been done to help victims of the abuse . but , he continued , he hoped good friday and the easter celebrations would turn the page on a new chapter for the catholic church . however , further trouble soon arose from within the vatican , itself . at a good friday service in st. peter 's basilica in rome , with the pope in attendance , a vatican priest delivered a sermon in which he compared criticism of the catholic church to anti-semitism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the pope address the scandal on easter sunday ?
" church criticism similar to anti-semitism " father raniero cantalamessa , the pope 's personal priest , used his homily to read out a letter from a " jewish friend " expressing the opinion that the way the church was being pilloried by " collective blame " was similar to aspects of anti-semitism . the ill-judged comparison has been seized upon by various international groups , clearly angering many people . david clohessy head of the survivors network of those abused by priests -lrb- snap -rrb- , the largest such support group in the united states , said , " it 's heartbreaking to see yet another high-ranking vatican official making such callous remarks that insult both abuse victims and jewish people , " " shame on father cantalamessa , " said elan steinberg , vice-president of the american gathering of holocaust survivors and their descendants . " the vatican is entitled to defend itself , but the comparison with anti-semitic persecution is offensive and unsustainable .
we are sorely disappointed , " he continued . not official vatican opinion the vatican quickly tried to distance itself from the unfortunate comparison . spokesman father federico lombardi said : " this should not be interpreted as an official position of the vatican . " but , some jewish groups are insisting on a personal apology from the pope for the words delivered by the priest . " these hurtful remarks were made in the presence of the pope and the pope himself should take responsibility and apologise for them , " said rabbi marvin hier of the simon wiesenthal center , the international jewish human rights group . it now seems unlikely that the shadow of shame hanging over the catholic church will clear by the end of this year 's easter celebrations . td / ap / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

most of them operate in provincial reconstruction teams , helping to build up afghanistan 's infrastructure , but have increasingly been subject to attacks . there are currently more than 120,000 nato-led troops in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 03.04.2010 cologne 's rhine harbor tells stories of remarkable women großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agrippina dock in cologne recalls a bloody period of ancient roman history sparkling glass buildings encase the rhine harbor in cologne .
but behind the modernity , promenades off the beaten path recall centuries past and the women who lived , loved - and even killed there . whether you 're particularly interested in women 's history or just looking for something different , cologne 's " rheinauhafen " harbor is at once a pretty walk and a place for female tales of murder , success and the extraordinary . the industrial harbor 's promenades will strike a casual stroller with their contemporary , glass-encased buildings and bridges .
but here , just north of cologne 's historic old town , promenades and plazas give clear reference to the past - and the women who shaped it . blood flowed in roman times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agrippina was responsible for making cologne a city female influence on the neighborhood even dates back to roman times and it 's no coincidence that the central road through the southern section of the harbor is called the agrippina dock . " today there is a lot of agrippina in cologne : the agrippina dock , an agrippina shore , and a statue near the historical town hall tower , " said tour guide and cologne architect anna maria bermejo .
agrippina the younger was born in 15 ad in cologne , which was then known as oppidum ubiorum . agrippina later married emperor claudius after he had his own wife assassinated .
in 50 ad , she convinced him to acknowledge oppidum ubiorum and rename it colonia claudia ara agrippinensium . those were ruthless times , indeed .
when claudius refused to recognize agrippina 's son nero from her first marriage as his heir , she had him killed .
nero then demanded the right to rule , but when agrippina refused , her own son had her assassinated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : named after a 19-century philantropist , the laura-von-oelbermann promenade offers a spectacular river view nowadays " there is also an agrippina insurance company that one really could have used back in the day , " bermejo said . leaving their mark in different ways agrippina dock is n't the only location on the rhine harbor named for an important local woman .
the katharina schauberg promenade , for example , is dedicated to a 19th-century entrepreneur . schauberg co-founded a newspaper , single-handedly ran a bookshop near the publishing house , and also handled all the accounting and advertising for the business .
the newspaper would later become the koelner stadt-anzeiger , the paper with the largest circulation in cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna maria van schurman was a child prodigy laura von oelbermann - for whom a nearby promenade was named - was not quite so fortunate .
she lost her husband and both her sons in world war i. despite her personal tragedy , von oelbermann went on to found a hospital and other organizations that supported women in childbirth , widows , girls and orphans . " not only this , but she visited the poor daily , with up to 15 visits a day , which was very astounding for a woman of her status , " said bermejo .
she had a reputation for being so generous that , after her death , parents would say , " child , i am not that frau oelbermann , " when their children asked them for money . continuing a jewelry tradition another road is named for anna maria van schurman , a 17th-century cologne wunderkind who , by the age of 11 , had mastered painting , engraving , wax sculpting , music , and other art forms .
more than 20 of her works remain .
by the time she was an adult , she spoke nine languages fluently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine bastion was a prussian defense building and later housed the coast guard headquarters along the agrippina dock , the elisabeth treskow plaza is named after a 19th-century goldsmith who taught at a local cologne art college .
she rediscovered an old , etruscan jewelry-making technique and created beautiful pieces , donating a collection to cologne 's museum of applied art . nearby , visitors will find the 19th-century rhine bastion .
continuing the tradition of elizabeth treskow , a modern-day jewelry maker moved into the building in the 1990 's .
goldsmith petra mertenz lives and works inside the rhine bastion , selling the jewelry that she makes right from home .
she chose the solitary , old house for a reason . making jewelry " makes a huge amount of noise when one hammers , and the other reason is that it is simply a beautiful house , " said mertenz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once used for defense , the bavaria tower now serves a completely different purpose not far from the rhine bastion are the remains of the 13th-century bavaria tower , which was originally used for defense purposes .
now it houses the frauenmediaturm -lrb- fmt -rrb- , a feminist archive and documentation center . " i like it when women 's names are noted , " said regina eichenseer , a recent participant in a guided tour given by architecture and guided tours of cologne .

this year , for the first time , polish and russian authorities will commemorate the victims together . seventy years ago , an estimated 22,000 polish soldiers were executed by the soviet union 's secret police , the nkvd , in the katyn forest in russia . on april 7 , russian prime minister vladimir putin and his polish counterpart , donald tusk , will mark the katyn massacre officially for the first time . polish foreign minister radoslav sikorski has described the meeting as " another step towards polish-russian reconciliation . " for years , the soviets blamed german nazis for the killings , and it was only in 1990 that then-kremlin leader mikhail gorbachev admitted his country 's responsibility . gruesome events bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigations into the killings by the us senate in the 1950s blamed the soviets following the division of poland between hitler and stalin , polish officers found themselves in 1939 under soviet captivity .
the russian secret service feared the poles would rise up against moscow , so stalin gave his blessing to a mass execution , which started on april 3 , 1940 . three years later , the germans found parts of the mass graves in katyn near smolensk , and used the find to fuel anti-soviet propaganda .
the exiled polish government , then in london , broke off contact with the kremlin . after of the war , stalin tried to cover up the crime .
in addition to the mass grave in katyn , others were detected in piatykhatky and mednoe .
as the soviets blamed german nazis for the war crimes , the truth was buried for decades . polish-russian tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director andrzej wajda 's film ' katyn ' depicts the executions since gorbachev admitted the soviet responsibility , there has been tension between moscow and warsaw over the katyn massacre .
high-ranking russian officials still claim the murders were not committed by the soviet union . russian justice authorities in 2004 refused to re-open an inquiry into the massacre , claiming part of the documents were a state secret . an oscar-nominated film made in 2007 by a polish director about the massacres has only ever been screened twice in russia .

this year , for the first time , polish and russian authorities will commemorate the victims together . seventy years ago , an estimated 22,000 polish soldiers were executed by the soviet union 's secret police , the nkvd , in the katyn forest in russia . on april 7 , russian prime minister vladimir putin and his polish counterpart , donald tusk , will mark the katyn massacre officially for the first time . polish foreign minister radoslav sikorski has described the meeting as " another step towards polish-russian reconciliation . " for years , the soviets blamed german nazis for the killings , and it was only in 1990 that then-kremlin leader mikhail gorbachev admitted his country 's responsibility . gruesome events bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigations into the killings by the us senate in the 1950s blamed the soviets following the division of poland between hitler and stalin , polish officers found themselves in 1939 under soviet captivity .
the russian secret service feared the poles would rise up against moscow , so stalin gave his blessing to a mass execution , which started on april 3 , 1940 . three years later , the germans found parts of the mass graves in katyn near smolensk , and used the find to fuel anti-soviet propaganda .
the exiled polish government , then in london , broke off contact with the kremlin . after of the war , stalin tried to cover up the crime .
in addition to the mass grave in katyn , others were detected in piatykhatky and mednoe .

high-ranking russian officials still claim the murders were not committed by the soviet union . russian justice authorities in 2004 refused to re-open an inquiry into the massacre , claiming part of the documents were a state secret . an oscar-nominated film made in 2007 by a polish director about the massacres has only ever been screened twice in russia .

the attack took place in chardarah , one of six districts that make up kunduz province , said the spokesperson at the german operational headquarters in potsdam near berlin .
the three soldiers who died were shot by the rebels .
the attacks began after a mine went off under a german armored vehicle .
around 200 taliban attackers were reported to have been involved in the battle with german and afghan police forces .
gun battle lasted hours local afghan government chief abdul wahid omar khil said german troops and afghan police exchanged fire with their attackers for about an hour , with fighting resuming three hours later .
omar khil said one taliban fighter was killed and another wounded , but that the germans and the afghan police were unable to use major firepower because the taliban were firing from inside and on top of civilian homes .
german chancellor angela merkel expressed shock at what she called " a despicable and underhanded attack on our soldiers in afghanistan . " german development aid minister dirk niebel , who is currently in afghanistan visiting german troops , called the attack " shameful .

joachim herrmann , the bavarian interior minister , has also made his opposition to the proposals clear .
" i 'm not having anyone coming into bavaria , " he said .

" the vatican is entitled to defend itself , but the comparison with anti-semitic persecution is offensive and unsustainable .
we are sorely disappointed , " he continued . not official vatican opinion the vatican quickly tried to distance itself from the unfortunate comparison . spokesman father federico lombardi said : " this should not be interpreted as an official position of the vatican . " but , some jewish groups are insisting on a personal apology from the pope for the words delivered by the priest . " these hurtful remarks were made in the presence of the pope and the pope himself should take responsibility and apologise for them , " said rabbi marvin hier of the simon wiesenthal center , the international jewish human rights group . it now seems unlikely that the shadow of shame hanging over the catholic church will clear by the end of this year 's easter celebrations . td / ap / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but behind the modernity , promenades off the beaten path recall centuries past and the women who lived , loved - and even killed there . whether you 're particularly interested in women 's history or just looking for something different , cologne 's " rheinauhafen " harbor is at once a pretty walk and a place for female tales of murder , success and the extraordinary . the industrial harbor 's promenades will strike a casual stroller with their contemporary , glass-encased buildings and bridges .
but here , just north of cologne 's historic old town , promenades and plazas give clear reference to the past - and the women who shaped it . blood flowed in roman times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agrippina was responsible for making cologne a city female influence on the neighborhood even dates back to roman times and it 's no coincidence that the central road through the southern section of the harbor is called the agrippina dock . " today there is a lot of agrippina in cologne : the agrippina dock , an agrippina shore , and a statue near the historical town hall tower , " said tour guide and cologne architect anna maria bermejo .
agrippina the younger was born in 15 ad in cologne , which was then known as oppidum ubiorum . agrippina later married emperor claudius after he had his own wife assassinated .
in 50 ad , she convinced him to acknowledge oppidum ubiorum and rename it colonia claudia ara agrippinensium . those were ruthless times , indeed .
when claudius refused to recognize agrippina 's son nero from her first marriage as his heir , she had him killed .
nero then demanded the right to rule , but when agrippina refused , her own son had her assassinated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : named after a 19-century philantropist , the laura-von-oelbermann promenade offers a spectacular river view nowadays " there is also an agrippina insurance company that one really could have used back in the day , " bermejo said . leaving their mark in different ways agrippina dock is n't the only location on the rhine harbor named for an important local woman .
the katharina schauberg promenade , for example , is dedicated to a 19th-century entrepreneur . schauberg co-founded a newspaper , single-handedly ran a bookshop near the publishing house , and also handled all the accounting and advertising for the business .
the newspaper would later become the koelner stadt-anzeiger , the paper with the largest circulation in cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anna maria van schurman was a child prodigy laura von oelbermann - for whom a nearby promenade was named - was not quite so fortunate .
she lost her husband and both her sons in world war i. despite her personal tragedy , von oelbermann went on to found a hospital and other organizations that supported women in childbirth , widows , girls and orphans . " not only this , but she visited the poor daily , with up to 15 visits a day , which was very astounding for a woman of her status , " said bermejo .
she had a reputation for being so generous that , after her death , parents would say , " child , i am not that frau oelbermann , " when their children asked them for money . continuing a jewelry tradition another road is named for anna maria van schurman , a 17th-century cologne wunderkind who , by the age of 11 , had mastered painting , engraving , wax sculpting , music , and other art forms .
more than 20 of her works remain .
by the time she was an adult , she spoke nine languages fluently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine bastion was a prussian defense building and later housed the coast guard headquarters along the agrippina dock , the elisabeth treskow plaza is named after a 19th-century goldsmith who taught at a local cologne art college .
she rediscovered an old , etruscan jewelry-making technique and created beautiful pieces , donating a collection to cologne 's museum of applied art . nearby , visitors will find the 19th-century rhine bastion .
continuing the tradition of elizabeth treskow , a modern-day jewelry maker moved into the building in the 1990 's .
goldsmith petra mertenz lives and works inside the rhine bastion , selling the jewelry that she makes right from home .
she chose the solitary , old house for a reason . making jewelry " makes a huge amount of noise when one hammers , and the other reason is that it is simply a beautiful house , " said mertenz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once used for defense , the bavaria tower now serves a completely different purpose not far from the rhine bastion are the remains of the 13th-century bavaria tower , which was originally used for defense purposes .
now it houses the frauenmediaturm -lrb- fmt -rrb- , a feminist archive and documentation center . " i like it when women 's names are noted , " said regina eichenseer , a recent participant in a guided tour given by architecture and guided tours of cologne .

the exiled polish government , then in london , broke off contact with the kremlin . after of the war , stalin tried to cover up the crime .

despite a good start for the bavarians , the match proved to be a tough test of resolve . bayern munich returned to the top of the german bundesliga by clinching a 2-1 win away from home at the ground of their closest challengers schalke .
bayern had enjoyed a strong lead after frank ribery and thomas mueller netted two goals within two minutes in the first half .
ribery broke the deadlock for the visitors on 25 minutes with a well-placed strike from 10 meters .
bayern doubled their tally immediately afterwards as an assist from croatia international ivica olic allowed mueller to sidefoot the ball into an empty net .
five minutes later schalke hit back with a header from striker kevin kuranyi - just before bayern 's hamit altintop handed the home side a huge advantage .

" this is a very important win but it was the minimum that we had to do .
the next couple of matches are crucial , " said bayern captain mark van bommel .
leverkusen lose on the road schalke 's fellow title chasers bayer leverkusen lost 3-2 away from home against eintracht frankfurt .
the result came despite two goals for stefan kiessling who , with kuranyi , is joint top scorer in the league .
selim teber put frankfurt in front with a penalty before kiessling scored his brace .
leverkusen were forced to play almost all of the second half with 10 men after defender daniel schwaab was sent off for a tackle from behind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subotic put one of two first-half headers past the keeper caio was able to fire in an unstoppable effort from 30 meters to level the score for frankfurt , who won the game a minute from time with a close-range overhead kick from maik franz .
dortmund tighten hold borussia dortmund strengthened their grip on fourth spot with a 2-1 win against fifth-placed werder bremen .
kevin grosskreutz and neven subotic both scored first half headers for dortmund , while bremen forward aaron hunt pulled one back for his team half way through the second half .
stuttgart finished up level on points with hamburg after a 2-1 victory against moenchengladbach .
meanwhile there was a 1-1 draw for freiburg and bochum , goals coming from papiss cisse and christoph dabrowski .
bottom club hertha berlin kept their hopes of top-flight survival alive with a 3-0 victory away at cologne . relegation worries for nuremberg were eased with a 2-0 win over mainz courtesy of goals from mike frantz and eric maxim choupo-moting .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop zollitsch hoped that easter would be a new start church has failed victims the head of the german bishops ' conference , archbishop robert zollitsch , had candidly admitted on friday that the church , as an institution , had failed to handle the sex abuse scandal adequately , and that , in the past , too little had been done to help victims of the abuse . but , he continued , he hoped good friday and the easter celebrations would turn the page on a new chapter for the catholic church . however , further trouble soon arose from within the vatican , itself . at a good friday service in st. peter 's basilica in rome , with the pope in attendance , a vatican priest delivered a sermon in which he compared criticism of the catholic church to anti-semitism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the pope address the scandal on easter sunday ?
" church criticism similar to anti-semitism " father raniero cantalamessa , the pope 's personal priest , used his homily to read out a letter from a " jewish friend " expressing the opinion that the way the church was being pilloried by " collective blame " was similar to aspects of anti-semitism . the ill-judged comparison has been seized upon by various international groups , clearly angering many people . david clohessy head of the survivors network of those abused by priests -lrb- snap -rrb- , the largest such support group in the united states , said , " it 's heartbreaking to see yet another high-ranking vatican official making such callous remarks that insult both abuse victims and jewish people , " " shame on father cantalamessa , " said elan steinberg , vice-president of the american gathering of holocaust survivors and their descendants . " the vatican is entitled to defend itself , but the comparison with anti-semitic persecution is offensive and unsustainable .
we are sorely disappointed , " he continued . not official vatican opinion the vatican quickly tried to distance itself from the unfortunate comparison . spokesman father federico lombardi said : " this should not be interpreted as an official position of the vatican . " but , some jewish groups are insisting on a personal apology from the pope for the words delivered by the priest . " these hurtful remarks were made in the presence of the pope and the pope himself should take responsibility and apologise for them , " said rabbi marvin hier of the simon wiesenthal center , the international jewish human rights group . it now seems unlikely that the shadow of shame hanging over the catholic church will clear by the end of this year 's easter celebrations . td / ap / afp / reuters editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do n't see ourselves as having any obligation .
after all , we did not take them prisoner , " he added .
tillich 's comments follow an announcement from german interior minister thomas de maiziere , also cdu , that germany is considering accepting the guantanamo inmates .
joachim herrmann , the bavarian interior minister , has also made his opposition to the proposals clear .
" i 'm not having anyone coming into bavaria , " he said .

berlin in talks with washington so far only germany 's most populous state , north-rhine westphalia , has come out in support of taking guantanamo detainees provided strict conditions were met .
these would include rigorous background checks to ensure that any prisoners taken in would present no security threat .
germany 's interior ministry confirmed last saturday that it had resumed talks with washington over the possibility of taking in selected inmates to be released from the guantanamo bay facility .
any take-up of former guantanamo prisoners would depend on whether they had a connection to germany as well as their potential risk , a government spokesman in berlin said .

this year , for the first time , polish and russian authorities will commemorate the victims together . seventy years ago , an estimated 22,000 polish soldiers were executed by the soviet union 's secret police , the nkvd , in the katyn forest in russia . on april 7 , russian prime minister vladimir putin and his polish counterpart , donald tusk , will mark the katyn massacre officially for the first time . polish foreign minister radoslav sikorski has described the meeting as " another step towards polish-russian reconciliation . " for years , the soviets blamed german nazis for the killings , and it was only in 1990 that then-kremlin leader mikhail gorbachev admitted his country 's responsibility . gruesome events bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigations into the killings by the us senate in the 1950s blamed the soviets following the division of poland between hitler and stalin , polish officers found themselves in 1939 under soviet captivity .
the russian secret service feared the poles would rise up against moscow , so stalin gave his blessing to a mass execution , which started on april 3 , 1940 . three years later , the germans found parts of the mass graves in katyn near smolensk , and used the find to fuel anti-soviet propaganda .
the exiled polish government , then in london , broke off contact with the kremlin . after of the war , stalin tried to cover up the crime .
in addition to the mass grave in katyn , others were detected in piatykhatky and mednoe .
as the soviets blamed german nazis for the war crimes , the truth was buried for decades . polish-russian tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director andrzej wajda 's film ' katyn ' depicts the executions since gorbachev admitted the soviet responsibility , there has been tension between moscow and warsaw over the katyn massacre .
high-ranking russian officials still claim the murders were not committed by the soviet union . russian justice authorities in 2004 refused to re-open an inquiry into the massacre , claiming part of the documents were a state secret . an oscar-nominated film made in 2007 by a polish director about the massacres has only ever been screened twice in russia .
the father of the director , andrej wajda , was among those murdered . cb / ns / dpa / afp / epd editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the attack took place in chardarah , one of six districts that make up kunduz province , said the spokesperson at the german operational headquarters in potsdam near berlin .

omar khil said one taliban fighter was killed and another wounded , but that the germans and the afghan police were unable to use major firepower because the taliban were firing from inside and on top of civilian homes .

the attack took place in chardarah , one of six districts that make up kunduz province , said the spokesperson at the german operational headquarters in potsdam near berlin .
the three soldiers who died were shot by the rebels .
the attacks began after a mine went off under a german armored vehicle .
around 200 taliban attackers were reported to have been involved in the battle with german and afghan police forces .
gun battle lasted hours local afghan government chief abdul wahid omar khil said german troops and afghan police exchanged fire with their attackers for about an hour , with fighting resuming three hours later .
omar khil said one taliban fighter was killed and another wounded , but that the germans and the afghan police were unable to use major firepower because the taliban were firing from inside and on top of civilian homes .
german chancellor angela merkel expressed shock at what she called " a despicable and underhanded attack on our soldiers in afghanistan . " german development aid minister dirk niebel , who is currently in afghanistan visiting german troops , called the attack " shameful . " since joining the nato-led isaf mission in 2002 , a total of 39 german soldiers have died in afghanistan , 24 of those in combat .
at present , over 4,300 bundeswehr troops are stationed in the country. td / glb / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year , for the first time , polish and russian authorities will commemorate the victims together . seventy years ago , an estimated 22,000 polish soldiers were executed by the soviet union 's secret police , the nkvd , in the katyn forest in russia . on april 7 , russian prime minister vladimir putin and his polish counterpart , donald tusk , will mark the katyn massacre officially for the first time . polish foreign minister radoslav sikorski has described the meeting as " another step towards polish-russian reconciliation . " for years , the soviets blamed german nazis for the killings , and it was only in 1990 that then-kremlin leader mikhail gorbachev admitted his country 's responsibility . gruesome events bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigations into the killings by the us senate in the 1950s blamed the soviets following the division of poland between hitler and stalin , polish officers found themselves in 1939 under soviet captivity .
the russian secret service feared the poles would rise up against moscow , so stalin gave his blessing to a mass execution , which started on april 3 , 1940 . three years later , the germans found parts of the mass graves in katyn near smolensk , and used the find to fuel anti-soviet propaganda .
the exiled polish government , then in london , broke off contact with the kremlin . after of the war , stalin tried to cover up the crime .
in addition to the mass grave in katyn , others were detected in piatykhatky and mednoe .
as the soviets blamed german nazis for the war crimes , the truth was buried for decades . polish-russian tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director andrzej wajda 's film ' katyn ' depicts the executions since gorbachev admitted the soviet responsibility , there has been tension between moscow and warsaw over the katyn massacre .
high-ranking russian officials still claim the murders were not committed by the soviet union . russian justice authorities in 2004 refused to re-open an inquiry into the massacre , claiming part of the documents were a state secret . an oscar-nominated film made in 2007 by a polish director about the massacres has only ever been screened twice in russia .
the father of the director , andrej wajda , was among those murdered . cb / ns / dpa / afp / epd editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year , for the first time , polish and russian authorities will commemorate the victims together . seventy years ago , an estimated 22,000 polish soldiers were executed by the soviet union 's secret police , the nkvd , in the katyn forest in russia . on april 7 , russian prime minister vladimir putin and his polish counterpart , donald tusk , will mark the katyn massacre officially for the first time . polish foreign minister radoslav sikorski has described the meeting as " another step towards polish-russian reconciliation . " for years , the soviets blamed german nazis for the killings , and it was only in 1990 that then-kremlin leader mikhail gorbachev admitted his country 's responsibility . gruesome events bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigations into the killings by the us senate in the 1950s blamed the soviets following the division of poland between hitler and stalin , polish officers found themselves in 1939 under soviet captivity .
the russian secret service feared the poles would rise up against moscow , so stalin gave his blessing to a mass execution , which started on april 3 , 1940 . three years later , the germans found parts of the mass graves in katyn near smolensk , and used the find to fuel anti-soviet propaganda .
the exiled polish government , then in london , broke off contact with the kremlin . after of the war , stalin tried to cover up the crime .
in addition to the mass grave in katyn , others were detected in piatykhatky and mednoe .
as the soviets blamed german nazis for the war crimes , the truth was buried for decades . polish-russian tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director andrzej wajda 's film ' katyn ' depicts the executions since gorbachev admitted the soviet responsibility , there has been tension between moscow and warsaw over the katyn massacre .
high-ranking russian officials still claim the murders were not committed by the soviet union . russian justice authorities in 2004 refused to re-open an inquiry into the massacre , claiming part of the documents were a state secret . an oscar-nominated film made in 2007 by a polish director about the massacres has only ever been screened twice in russia .
the father of the director , andrej wajda , was among those murdered . cb / ns / dpa / afp / epd editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year , for the first time , polish and russian authorities will commemorate the victims together . seventy years ago , an estimated 22,000 polish soldiers were executed by the soviet union 's secret police , the nkvd , in the katyn forest in russia . on april 7 , russian prime minister vladimir putin and his polish counterpart , donald tusk , will mark the katyn massacre officially for the first time . polish foreign minister radoslav sikorski has described the meeting as " another step towards polish-russian reconciliation . " for years , the soviets blamed german nazis for the killings , and it was only in 1990 that then-kremlin leader mikhail gorbachev admitted his country 's responsibility . gruesome events bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigations into the killings by the us senate in the 1950s blamed the soviets following the division of poland between hitler and stalin , polish officers found themselves in 1939 under soviet captivity .
the russian secret service feared the poles would rise up against moscow , so stalin gave his blessing to a mass execution , which started on april 3 , 1940 . three years later , the germans found parts of the mass graves in katyn near smolensk , and used the find to fuel anti-soviet propaganda .
the exiled polish government , then in london , broke off contact with the kremlin . after of the war , stalin tried to cover up the crime .
in addition to the mass grave in katyn , others were detected in piatykhatky and mednoe .
as the soviets blamed german nazis for the war crimes , the truth was buried for decades . polish-russian tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director andrzej wajda 's film ' katyn ' depicts the executions since gorbachev admitted the soviet responsibility , there has been tension between moscow and warsaw over the katyn massacre .
high-ranking russian officials still claim the murders were not committed by the soviet union . russian justice authorities in 2004 refused to re-open an inquiry into the massacre , claiming part of the documents were a state secret . an oscar-nominated film made in 2007 by a polish director about the massacres has only ever been screened twice in russia .
the father of the director , andrej wajda , was among those murdered . cb / ns / dpa / afp / epd editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year , for the first time , polish and russian authorities will commemorate the victims together . seventy years ago , an estimated 22,000 polish soldiers were executed by the soviet union 's secret police , the nkvd , in the katyn forest in russia . on april 7 , russian prime minister vladimir putin and his polish counterpart , donald tusk , will mark the katyn massacre officially for the first time . polish foreign minister radoslav sikorski has described the meeting as " another step towards polish-russian reconciliation . " for years , the soviets blamed german nazis for the killings , and it was only in 1990 that then-kremlin leader mikhail gorbachev admitted his country 's responsibility . gruesome events bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigations into the killings by the us senate in the 1950s blamed the soviets following the division of poland between hitler and stalin , polish officers found themselves in 1939 under soviet captivity .
the russian secret service feared the poles would rise up against moscow , so stalin gave his blessing to a mass execution , which started on april 3 , 1940 . three years later , the germans found parts of the mass graves in katyn near smolensk , and used the find to fuel anti-soviet propaganda .
the exiled polish government , then in london , broke off contact with the kremlin . after of the war , stalin tried to cover up the crime .
in addition to the mass grave in katyn , others were detected in piatykhatky and mednoe .

high-ranking russian officials still claim the murders were not committed by the soviet union . russian justice authorities in 2004 refused to re-open an inquiry into the massacre , claiming part of the documents were a state secret . an oscar-nominated film made in 2007 by a polish director about the massacres has only ever been screened twice in russia .
the father of the director , andrej wajda , was among those murdered . cb / ns / dpa / afp / epd editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but behind the modernity , promenades off the beaten path recall centuries past and the women who lived , loved - and even killed there . whether you 're particularly interested in women 's history or just looking for something different , cologne 's " rheinauhafen " harbor is at once a pretty walk and a place for female tales of murder , success and the extraordinary . the industrial harbor 's promenades will strike a casual stroller with their contemporary , glass-encased buildings and bridges .
but here , just north of cologne 's historic old town , promenades and plazas give clear reference to the past - and the women who shaped it . blood flowed in roman times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agrippina was responsible for making cologne a city female influence on the neighborhood even dates back to roman times and it 's no coincidence that the central road through the southern section of the harbor is called the agrippina dock .

" the vatican is entitled to defend itself , but the comparison with anti-semitic persecution is offensive and unsustainable .
we are sorely disappointed , " he continued . not official vatican opinion the vatican quickly tried to distance itself from the unfortunate comparison . spokesman father federico lombardi said : " this should not be interpreted as an official position of the vatican . " but , some jewish groups are insisting on a personal apology from the pope for the words delivered by the priest .
