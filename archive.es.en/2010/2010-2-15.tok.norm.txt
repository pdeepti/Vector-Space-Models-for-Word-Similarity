as western troops engage in warfare in the name of freedom in iraq and afghanistan , and a prominent new report reveals worldwide democracy to be on the ebb , analysts ponder where to go from here . " for the fourth consecutive year , global declines in freedom outweighed gains in 2009 . "
such was the opening statement of a report put out by us democracy watchdog freedom house earlier last month .
entitled " freedom in the world 2010 : global erosion of freedom , " the report noted democratic decline in 40 countries in africa , latin america , the middle east and the former soviet union .
assessed for indicators including political and civil liberties , press freedom and rule of law , five countries were added to the ' not free ' list and the number of electoral democracies fell to its lowest level since 1995 .
although 16 of the 194 countries surveyed were deemed to have made progress toward greater freedom for their peoples , and despite the fact that the overall global situation has improved over the past two decades , arch puddington , director of research with freedom house described the findings as " cause for real concern . "
manifold causes speaking to deutsche welle , he said last year 's democratic slow-down was more pronounced than in the three before , a finding he attributed to a wide variety of factors .
bildunterschrift : street protests in iran in summer 2009 following presidential elections " one is an increasing aggressiveness and self-assuredness on the part of some of the leading authoritarian countries - china , russia , iran , venezuela , zimbabwe - which then serve as models for other countries , " puddington said .
among the other issues at work are reactions to some of the democracy gains - such as the orange revolution - of the last decade , cynicism brought on by unfulfilled hopes of prospering in a fair society and initiatives to smother and suppress the growing confidence of civil societies .
democracy by degree but some experts argue that things are not quite as bad as the picture painted by the freedom house report .
michael efler , national spokesperson for german pro-democracy group mehr demokratie , says it 's a matter of perception .
" you have to ask what democracy is , " efler told deutsche welle .
" the liberal western approach taken by freedom house focuses on elections .
so if a country stages a fair ballot it is considered a democracy , but i think that is a limited way of doing things . "
he said that while elections are clearly crucial , it is also important to realize that the western understanding of democracy and human rights is not shared the world over .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein toppling was meant as a symbol for democracy in iraq illustrating his case with the omnipresent examples of iraq and afghanistan , efler said " society is structured differently and individual freedom does n't play anything like as important a role as it does for us . "
which begs the question , do people really want democracy ? " i wish it were a value to which everybody aspired but i do n't think that 's the way it is , " efler said .
" and it 's futile to try and force democracy on people because it wo n't work . "
too poor to consider democracy humphrey hawksley is author of the recently published " democracy kills : what 's so good about having the vote ? "
he told deutsche welle that for about one sixth of the world 's population democracy is not even a flicker on the radar .
" there are a billion or so people in a state of need , they want shelter , security from tribal wars , they want to be able to feed their children and get medicines for the sick , and they do n't have that .
so democracy as such does n't really factor in for them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food first , democracy later and although the need for those very basic life essentials may be conceptually tied to the image of a fair society with an elected democracy , hawksley said the carrot that generally gets voters to the ballot box is not hope for a brighter future , but a chance to oust an existing government .
" that 's the stock argument , " he said .
" but what 's the point of doing that if your hospital is still a mess , if your road is still a mess , if your infant mortality levels are still enormously high ?
what is the point of going through all that rigmarole if at the end of the day it does n't deliver anything to the citizens who cast the vote ? "
that , he says , is the question countries should be asking themselves if they want to create smooth civilized societies .
the question is the answer .
democracy vs. good governance but arch puddington would say there is more to it than that .
he believes the impetus has to come from outside , from the west .
" i think what you have to do is to try to educate people , let them know that large democratic societies are also prosperous societies , so they have the prosperity and they have the freedom . "
for his part , michael efler stresses the importance of creating a public platform for oppressed societies , and meeting with anti-regime activists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say former us president george bush poisoned the word democracy hawksley though , goes a couple of steps further .
he suggests replacing the word democracy , by now intrinsically linked to an ideological form of government opposed by countries such as russia and china , and replacing it with something along the lines of " good governance . "
" if you got together with the un and said ' we want to give these people in this african country good governance and we want to build them schools and so on , ' then you would take away the friction that many places see as the west trying to export their own ideology in order to get business contracts . "
but whether the power of semantics could convince the powers that be is an experiment still waiting to be tried out .

as western troops engage in warfare in the name of freedom in iraq and afghanistan , and a prominent new report reveals worldwide democracy to be on the ebb , analysts ponder where to go from here . " for the fourth consecutive year , global declines in freedom outweighed gains in 2009 . "
such was the opening statement of a report put out by us democracy watchdog freedom house earlier last month .
entitled " freedom in the world 2010 : global erosion of freedom , " the report noted democratic decline in 40 countries in africa , latin america , the middle east and the former soviet union .
assessed for indicators including political and civil liberties , press freedom and rule of law , five countries were added to the ' not free ' list and the number of electoral democracies fell to its lowest level since 1995 .
although 16 of the 194 countries surveyed were deemed to have made progress toward greater freedom for their peoples , and despite the fact that the overall global situation has improved over the past two decades , arch puddington , director of research with freedom house described the findings as " cause for real concern . "
manifold causes speaking to deutsche welle , he said last year 's democratic slow-down was more pronounced than in the three before , a finding he attributed to a wide variety of factors .
bildunterschrift : street protests in iran in summer 2009 following presidential elections " one is an increasing aggressiveness and self-assuredness on the part of some of the leading authoritarian countries - china , russia , iran , venezuela , zimbabwe - which then serve as models for other countries , " puddington said .
among the other issues at work are reactions to some of the democracy gains - such as the orange revolution - of the last decade , cynicism brought on by unfulfilled hopes of prospering in a fair society and initiatives to smother and suppress the growing confidence of civil societies .
democracy by degree but some experts argue that things are not quite as bad as the picture painted by the freedom house report .

that , he says , is the question countries should be asking themselves if they want to create smooth civilized societies .
the question is the answer .
democracy vs. good governance but arch puddington would say there is more to it than that .
he believes the impetus has to come from outside , from the west .
" i think what you have to do is to try to educate people , let them know that large democratic societies are also prosperous societies , so they have the prosperity and they have the freedom . "

" but what 's the point of doing that if your hospital is still a mess , if your road is still a mess , if your infant mortality levels are still enormously high ?
what is the point of going through all that rigmarole if at the end of the day it does n't deliver anything to the citizens who cast the vote ? "
that , he says , is the question countries should be asking themselves if they want to create smooth civilized societies .
the question is the answer .
democracy vs. good governance but arch puddington would say there is more to it than that .
he believes the impetus has to come from outside , from the west .
" i think what you have to do is to try to educate people , let them know that large democratic societies are also prosperous societies , so they have the prosperity and they have the freedom . "
for his part , michael efler stresses the importance of creating a public platform for oppressed societies , and meeting with anti-regime activists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say former us president george bush poisoned the word democracy hawksley though , goes a couple of steps further .
he suggests replacing the word democracy , by now intrinsically linked to an ideological form of government opposed by countries such as russia and china , and replacing it with something along the lines of " good governance . "
" if you got together with the un and said ' we want to give these people in this african country good governance and we want to build them schools and so on , ' then you would take away the friction that many places see as the west trying to export their own ideology in order to get business contracts . "
but whether the power of semantics could convince the powers that be is an experiment still waiting to be tried out .

a review was getting underway on monday as part of a un mechanism intended to hold all member states accountable on a range of rights issues .

the german bakery was launched in 1988 by a local businessman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bomb detonated in a crowded bakery popular with foreigners dnyaneshwar kharose along with his associate woody , a german who had come to the osho ashram in pune .
it was woody 's idea to start a bakery with an international appeal , says dnyaneshwar kharose 's daughter snehal : " foreigners specially found it difficult to find their kind of food in pune .
because osho ashram was close to our place , they started the idea of german bakery .
with that , they came up with the name german bakery , because it was mainly for foreigners .
even indians liked the pastries , cakes and juices . "
since dnyaneshwar 's death in 1999 , his wife smita kharose runs the business , helped now by her daughter snehal .
on a regular day , the german bakery is usually teeming with customers who come for german bakery 's special cakes and health snacks .
deprived now of their only source of income , the kharose family is struggling to come to terms with the tragedy .
destruction of a symbol of friendship the german bakery 's loss is also being strongly felt among its foreign fan base .
one of them is luc didon , director of the indo-french cultural centre in pune , " it 's so full of people of different origins and it 's a symbol of diversity – diversity of languages , of cultures , of thoughts of beliefs .
this is destruction not only of people , but of a symbol of friendship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nine people were killed and dozens injured yet it is this large foreign client base that seems to have made the german bakery a target , similar to the mumbai attacks on november 26 , where the terrorists chose the famous café leopold and luxury hotels frequented by foreigners .
soft target prior to the attacks , security had been tightened around the osho ashram and the jewish chabad house , based on intelligence inputs of a possible terror strike .
these were the two locations surveyed as potential targets by david coleman headley , an operative of the pakistan-based terror group lashkar-e-toiba .
but the german bakery had been considered a soft target , says union minister p chidambaram , denying that there had been an intelligence failure .
while the government has not ruled out pakistani involvement , the leading congress party has so far rejected any demands by right-wing opposition groups to put off the resumption of high-level talks with pakistan planned for next week .

because osho ashram was close to our place , they started the idea of german bakery .
with that , they came up with the name german bakery , because it was mainly for foreigners .
even indians liked the pastries , cakes and juices . "
since dnyaneshwar 's death in 1999 , his wife smita kharose runs the business , helped now by her daughter snehal .
on a regular day , the german bakery is usually teeming with customers who come for german bakery 's special cakes and health snacks .
deprived now of their only source of income , the kharose family is struggling to come to terms with the tragedy .
destruction of a symbol of friendship the german bakery 's loss is also being strongly felt among its foreign fan base .
one of them is luc didon , director of the indo-french cultural centre in pune , " it 's so full of people of different origins and it 's a symbol of diversity – diversity of languages , of cultures , of thoughts of beliefs .
this is destruction not only of people , but of a symbol of friendship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nine people were killed and dozens injured yet it is this large foreign client base that seems to have made the german bakery a target , similar to the mumbai attacks on november 26 , where the terrorists chose the famous café leopold and luxury hotels frequented by foreigners .
soft target prior to the attacks , security had been tightened around the osho ashram and the jewish chabad house , based on intelligence inputs of a possible terror strike .
these were the two locations surveyed as potential targets by david coleman headley , an operative of the pakistan-based terror group lashkar-e-toiba .
but the german bakery had been considered a soft target , says union minister p chidambaram , denying that there had been an intelligence failure .
while the government has not ruled out pakistani involvement , the leading congress party has so far rejected any demands by right-wing opposition groups to put off the resumption of high-level talks with pakistan planned for next week .

four irish bishops have already resigned in the wake of the child sex abuse scandal .
in december , pope benedict expressed his " outrage , shame and profound regret " over the murphy commission 's revelations and said he would take clear measures in response to the situation .
a letter from the pontiff was expected to be published soon after his talks with the irish bishops .
church ' seriously damaged ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scandal has done ' immense damage ' , says irish bishop joseph duffy joseph duffy , the bishop of clogher in ireland , said the role of the pedophile priests had seriously damaged the church .

this has done immense damage to the authority of the church as the mouthpiece of the gospel of jesus christ , and of that there is no doubt .
our business is to try to repair that damage , " bishop duffy said .
the irish crisis comes on the heels of a scandal in germany , where an elite jesuit school in berlin admitted to sexual abuse of teenagers by teachers during the 1970s and 80s .

bishop duffy said that to restore that trust the church would be focusing on the victims .
" we will certainly be keeping the survivors at the top of the list of priorities .
i imagine hardly any bishop will fail to mention survivors as his primary concern in all of this most serious business , " he said .
anti-abuse campaigners , meanwhile , have called on pope benedict to visit ireland to meet the victims of the pedophile scandal .
christine buckley , herself an abuse survivor , said the pope had gone to the united states and australia to apologize and should do the same in ireland .

the murphy commission report detailed a litany of abuse perpetuated by priests against more than 300 victims and strongly criticized the irish church 's handling of the situation .
four irish bishops have already resigned in the wake of the child sex abuse scandal .
in december , pope benedict expressed his " outrage , shame and profound regret " over the murphy commission 's revelations and said he would take clear measures in response to the situation .
a letter from the pontiff was expected to be published soon after his talks with the irish bishops .
church ' seriously damaged ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scandal has done ' immense damage ' , says irish bishop joseph duffy joseph duffy , the bishop of clogher in ireland , said the role of the pedophile priests had seriously damaged the church .
" the church has been seriously wounded and we are in a very serious situation .
this has done immense damage to the authority of the church as the mouthpiece of the gospel of jesus christ , and of that there is no doubt .
our business is to try to repair that damage , " bishop duffy said .
the irish crisis comes on the heels of a scandal in germany , where an elite jesuit school in berlin admitted to sexual abuse of teenagers by teachers during the 1970s and 80s .
revelations of pedophile priests also have rocked the church in recent months after similar scandals in the united states and australia .
vatican warns of ' loss of faith ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damage control is the job of pope benedict -lrb- r -rrb- and the vatican 's secretary of state , tarcisio bertone vatican secretary of state , cardinal tarcisio bertone , said on monday that the scandal could be overcome by faith . but , he warned that the loss of confidence and trust in the church was an " even more dangerous storm " and that people could " lose faith in god , through discouragement and despair . "
bishop duffy said that to restore that trust the church would be focusing on the victims .
" we will certainly be keeping the survivors at the top of the list of priorities .
i imagine hardly any bishop will fail to mention survivors as his primary concern in all of this most serious business , " he said .
anti-abuse campaigners , meanwhile , have called on pope benedict to visit ireland to meet the victims of the pedophile scandal .
christine buckley , herself an abuse survivor , said the pope had gone to the united states and australia to apologize and should do the same in ireland .
she also criticized that many of the accused irish priests had left ireland and gone to countries such as australia and america , where they continued their abuse. gb / dpa / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the operation of individual nuclear power stations will be decided on the basis of current law , " said roettgen .
he added that nuclear power was intended only to be an interim measure until demand can be met from renewable sources .
" we have defined nuclear energy as a ' bridge technology . '
the bridge ends when renewable energies can reliably replace nuclear energy . "
" when we have a goal before our eyes we can achieve it quickly , " he added .

news of the abuse allegations involving around 30 former pupils first surfaced in late january , when a former priest admitted that he forced boys to have sex at the elite canisius college in berlin from 1975 to 1983 .
since the revelation , many more former pupils have come forward with allegations against clerics and laymen at jesuit colleges and other catholic schools across the country .

raue has been asked by the jesuits to investigate the allegations .
cases confirmed across germany the jesuits have since issued an apology , admitting they covered up abuse that had taken place at schools in berlin , hamburg , st. blasien , goettingen and hildesheim in the 1970s and 1980s .
the worldwide order also confirmed cases in spain and chile .
since the most recent of the cases happened more than 20 years ago , it 's still unclear whether or not criminal charges will be brought .

news of the abuse allegations involving around 30 former pupils first surfaced in late january , when a former priest admitted that he forced boys to have sex at the elite canisius college in berlin from 1975 to 1983 .
since the revelation , many more former pupils have come forward with allegations against clerics and laymen at jesuit colleges and other catholic schools across the country .
" the number of people who have contacted me or the canisius college has risen to more than 100 , " lawyer ursula raue told german news agency dpa .
raue has been asked by the jesuits to investigate the allegations .
cases confirmed across germany the jesuits have since issued an apology , admitting they covered up abuse that had taken place at schools in berlin , hamburg , st. blasien , goettingen and hildesheim in the 1970s and 1980s .
the worldwide order also confirmed cases in spain and chile .
since the most recent of the cases happened more than 20 years ago , it 's still unclear whether or not criminal charges will be brought .

norbert roettgen said he 'd stick to an agreement that would see two power plants close in coming months . german environment minister norbert roettgen has rejected calls to immediately extend the operating lifetimes of nuclear power plants .
roettgen said in a newspaper interview that he would not intervene to delay closure dates for reactors in coming months .
he told the weekly tagesspiegel am sonntag that new policy on energy plant life-spans would be decided in autumn , when the government coalition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- would discuss its energy policy .

" the operation of individual nuclear power stations will be decided on the basis of current law , " said roettgen .
he added that nuclear power was intended only to be an interim measure until demand can be met from renewable sources .
" we have defined nuclear energy as a ' bridge technology . '
the bridge ends when renewable energies can reliably replace nuclear energy . "
" when we have a goal before our eyes we can achieve it quickly , " he added .
more pragmatic approach at the same time , german economic minister rainer bruederle warned against " ideological rash reactions " and hinted at a more pragmatic approach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle said that solid facts were needed to decide on an approach the fdp minister told german weekly bild am sonntag that solid facts should shape future policy and that millions would need to be invested in renewable energy .
" if we do n't want electricity prices to go through the roof , we must build a bridge to the renewable age .
for the coalition this bridge is , along with the use of clean coal , nuclear energy . "
but , bruederle added , " one thing is clear .
nobody wants new nuclear power stations in germany . " possibility of extension while roettgen has said that plant life-spans could feasibly be expanded by eight years , his party colleagues in three states have called for a far longer stay of execution .
conservative regional environment ministers markus soeder from bavaria , tanya goeder from baden-wuerttemberg and silke lautenschlaeger from hesse advocate a further 20 years on top of roettgen 's suggestion .

his main aim is to reach agreement on raising the pension age , but the unions are strongly opposed . french president nicolas sarkozy decided to make pension reform the main issue at his country 's third " social summit " on monday .
he and members of his government met with representatives of the unions and employers for what were expected to be difficult talks .
sarkozy said at the end of the meeting that the government would present its proposals in september .
" if we want to save our pension system , we ca n't put off the decisions , " he said .
sarkozy 's office had been at pains to lower expectations ahead of the event , saying that no decisions would be made on fundamental issues , but that the meeting would discuss " the timetable and the methods of work . "
the government said it did n't want to rush things , but " everyone knows the solutions by heart . "
during the meeting , sarkozy was reported to have added that the government did not intend to force a solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been able to push through many unpopular reforms - will he succeed on pensions ?
pension reform is a highly controversial issue .
the budget ministry estimates that the pension system will have a 10.7 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.13 billion -rrb- deficit this year out of a total public deficit of 25 billion .
the labor minister , xavier darcos , told reuters news agency that the growing proportion of elderly people in french society would mean that the cost of the pension system would drive the annual public deficit up to 100 billion euros by 2050 .
longer working life the government would like to solve the problem by raising the retirement age , which , at 60 , is unusually low compared with the rest of europe , where many countries are moving towards 67 .
france has already taken some action in this direction , by increasing to 41 the numbers of years in which contributions have to be paid in order to earn a full pension . this means that people with degrees or elaborate training , who start work later , can not expect to have contributed for 41 years by the time they 're 60 , while unqualified workers are more likely to have done so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is hoping his pension reform will not attract the kind of protest which met the 2003 reform the unions are deeply opposed to any reform .
bernard thibault , head of the cgt union , rejected the government 's figures .
" we will defend the right to retire at 60 , " he said .
he also rejected the idea that " because life expectancy is increasing , it is unavoidable that people should spend a larger part of their lives working . "
the government enters these negotiations at a difficult time .
it had hoped to put off this third reform of the pension system in seven years until after the presidential election in 2012 , but the economic crisis has intervened .
increased unemployment has led to a reduction in contributions to the system .
in addition , the french government needs to do something about its expected deficit of 8.2 percent of gross domestic product this year , caused by its attempts to boost the economy .
the government is not trusted but the voters do not trust the government to deal with the pension crisis .
in a survey conducted for the metro newspaper , only 21 percent said they trusted the government to rescue the pension system , while 69 percent said they trusted the workers themselves or their unions . in another survey , well over half opposed either increasing the pension age or increasing the number of contribution years required for a full pension .
but yet another survey shows that young people still at school or in training do indeed expect to work beyond their 60th birthday .
the government was anxious not to cause uproar .
labor minister darcos said that contribution rates should not go up .
president sarkozy said that pension levels should not go down .
that leaves only the retirement age to play with if france is to deal with its pension challenge .

his main aim is to reach agreement on raising the pension age , but the unions are strongly opposed . french president nicolas sarkozy decided to make pension reform the main issue at his country 's third " social summit " on monday .
he and members of his government met with representatives of the unions and employers for what were expected to be difficult talks .
sarkozy said at the end of the meeting that the government would present its proposals in september .
" if we want to save our pension system , we ca n't put off the decisions , " he said .
sarkozy 's office had been at pains to lower expectations ahead of the event , saying that no decisions would be made on fundamental issues , but that the meeting would discuss " the timetable and the methods of work . "
the government said it did n't want to rush things , but " everyone knows the solutions by heart . "
during the meeting , sarkozy was reported to have added that the government did not intend to force a solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been able to push through many unpopular reforms - will he succeed on pensions ?
pension reform is a highly controversial issue .
the budget ministry estimates that the pension system will have a 10.7 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.13 billion -rrb- deficit this year out of a total public deficit of 25 billion .
the labor minister , xavier darcos , told reuters news agency that the growing proportion of elderly people in french society would mean that the cost of the pension system would drive the annual public deficit up to 100 billion euros by 2050 .
longer working life the government would like to solve the problem by raising the retirement age , which , at 60 , is unusually low compared with the rest of europe , where many countries are moving towards 67 .
france has already taken some action in this direction , by increasing to 41 the numbers of years in which contributions have to be paid in order to earn a full pension . this means that people with degrees or elaborate training , who start work later , can not expect to have contributed for 41 years by the time they 're 60 , while unqualified workers are more likely to have done so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is hoping his pension reform will not attract the kind of protest which met the 2003 reform the unions are deeply opposed to any reform .
bernard thibault , head of the cgt union , rejected the government 's figures .
" we will defend the right to retire at 60 , " he said .
he also rejected the idea that " because life expectancy is increasing , it is unavoidable that people should spend a larger part of their lives working . "
the government enters these negotiations at a difficult time .
it had hoped to put off this third reform of the pension system in seven years until after the presidential election in 2012 , but the economic crisis has intervened .
increased unemployment has led to a reduction in contributions to the system .
in addition , the french government needs to do something about its expected deficit of 8.2 percent of gross domestic product this year , caused by its attempts to boost the economy .
the government is not trusted but the voters do not trust the government to deal with the pension crisis .
in a survey conducted for the metro newspaper , only 21 percent said they trusted the government to rescue the pension system , while 69 percent said they trusted the workers themselves or their unions . in another survey , well over half opposed either increasing the pension age or increasing the number of contribution years required for a full pension .
but yet another survey shows that young people still at school or in training do indeed expect to work beyond their 60th birthday .
the government was anxious not to cause uproar .
labor minister darcos said that contribution rates should not go up .
president sarkozy said that pension levels should not go down .
that leaves only the retirement age to play with if france is to deal with its pension challenge .

in light of growing criticism , tehran claims that the review is being used as a political tool against it by the west . the united nations is investigating iran 's record on human rights as the country comes under growing pressure over the issue .
a review was getting underway on monday as part of a un mechanism intended to hold all member states accountable on a range of rights issues .
the investigation is beginning as european countries , the united states and human rights groups accuse iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's regime of increasingly using mass arrests and detention as a weapon against dissent .
review and debate by the 47 nations that are members of the un human rights council are to include submissions from individual countries and un human rights bodies .
allegations of torture non-governmental organizations will also have an opportunity to have their say on the allegations , which include torture , staging show trials , politically motivated executions and media censorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government of mahmoud ahmadinejad is accused of numerous violations in a report to the council , iran complained that criticism of its record was politically motivated .
" the iranian society is a successful model of brotherly and peaceful coexistence , " it said .
" iran 's human rights situation has consistently been used as a political tool to apply pressure and to advance certain ulterior political motives of specific western countries . "
china and russia to take part all un member states must submit to a review of their record every four years .
the human rights council only has the power to draw up recommendations .
china and russia were due to take part in monday 's debate .

the horsetrading is well underway . the government of chancellor angela merkel has continued its push to have axel weber , the current president of the german central bank , the bundesbank , appointed as the next president of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- .
german daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported that finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was expected to push for weber 's nomination at a meeting with his counterparts from the 15 other eu countries that use the euro currency .
the finance ministers plan to name a replacement for the ecb 's current vice president , lucas papademos , at the two-day gathering starting monday .
schaeuble was expected to press for portuguese central banker vitor manuel ribeiro constancio to take over as new ecb vice president .
the appointment of a southern european to the post would be an important strategic victory for germany .
constancio 's accession to the position would make it more likely that a northern european would be appointed to the ecb 's top post .
that position is currently held by frenchman jean-claude trichet , who steps down in late 2011 .
paris ' support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants weber -lrb- left -rrb- to take over from trichet -lrb- middle -rrb- germany , europe 's largest economy , complained recently that it was underrepresented in the ecb 's leadership , with schaeuble insisting that " in the current composition of the board of directors southern european countries , with three directors from greece , italy and spain , are unusually strongly represented . "
weber 's main opponent for the position of ecb head is bank of italy governor mario draghi .
in an important step towards securing the top post for weber , germany looked to have gained the support of france , which is considered the unofficial leader of the southern european bloc within the central bank .
german weekly die welt am sonntag reported that paris had agreed to support weber 's candidacy in return for berlin 's support for a french representative to become the ecb 's next chief economist , a post currently held by juergen stark , a german. dfm / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as western troops engage in warfare in the name of freedom in iraq and afghanistan , and a prominent new report reveals worldwide democracy to be on the ebb , analysts ponder where to go from here . " for the fourth consecutive year , global declines in freedom outweighed gains in 2009 . "
such was the opening statement of a report put out by us democracy watchdog freedom house earlier last month .
entitled " freedom in the world 2010 : global erosion of freedom , " the report noted democratic decline in 40 countries in africa , latin america , the middle east and the former soviet union .
assessed for indicators including political and civil liberties , press freedom and rule of law , five countries were added to the ' not free ' list and the number of electoral democracies fell to its lowest level since 1995 .
although 16 of the 194 countries surveyed were deemed to have made progress toward greater freedom for their peoples , and despite the fact that the overall global situation has improved over the past two decades , arch puddington , director of research with freedom house described the findings as " cause for real concern . "
manifold causes speaking to deutsche welle , he said last year 's democratic slow-down was more pronounced than in the three before , a finding he attributed to a wide variety of factors .
bildunterschrift : street protests in iran in summer 2009 following presidential elections " one is an increasing aggressiveness and self-assuredness on the part of some of the leading authoritarian countries - china , russia , iran , venezuela , zimbabwe - which then serve as models for other countries , " puddington said .
among the other issues at work are reactions to some of the democracy gains - such as the orange revolution - of the last decade , cynicism brought on by unfulfilled hopes of prospering in a fair society and initiatives to smother and suppress the growing confidence of civil societies .
democracy by degree but some experts argue that things are not quite as bad as the picture painted by the freedom house report .
michael efler , national spokesperson for german pro-democracy group mehr demokratie , says it 's a matter of perception .
" you have to ask what democracy is , " efler told deutsche welle .
" the liberal western approach taken by freedom house focuses on elections .
so if a country stages a fair ballot it is considered a democracy , but i think that is a limited way of doing things . "
he said that while elections are clearly crucial , it is also important to realize that the western understanding of democracy and human rights is not shared the world over .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein toppling was meant as a symbol for democracy in iraq illustrating his case with the omnipresent examples of iraq and afghanistan , efler said " society is structured differently and individual freedom does n't play anything like as important a role as it does for us . "
which begs the question , do people really want democracy ? " i wish it were a value to which everybody aspired but i do n't think that 's the way it is , " efler said .
" and it 's futile to try and force democracy on people because it wo n't work . "
too poor to consider democracy humphrey hawksley is author of the recently published " democracy kills : what 's so good about having the vote ? "
he told deutsche welle that for about one sixth of the world 's population democracy is not even a flicker on the radar .
" there are a billion or so people in a state of need , they want shelter , security from tribal wars , they want to be able to feed their children and get medicines for the sick , and they do n't have that .
so democracy as such does n't really factor in for them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food first , democracy later and although the need for those very basic life essentials may be conceptually tied to the image of a fair society with an elected democracy , hawksley said the carrot that generally gets voters to the ballot box is not hope for a brighter future , but a chance to oust an existing government .
" that 's the stock argument , " he said .
" but what 's the point of doing that if your hospital is still a mess , if your road is still a mess , if your infant mortality levels are still enormously high ?
what is the point of going through all that rigmarole if at the end of the day it does n't deliver anything to the citizens who cast the vote ? "
that , he says , is the question countries should be asking themselves if they want to create smooth civilized societies .
the question is the answer .
democracy vs. good governance but arch puddington would say there is more to it than that .
he believes the impetus has to come from outside , from the west .
" i think what you have to do is to try to educate people , let them know that large democratic societies are also prosperous societies , so they have the prosperity and they have the freedom . "
for his part , michael efler stresses the importance of creating a public platform for oppressed societies , and meeting with anti-regime activists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say former us president george bush poisoned the word democracy hawksley though , goes a couple of steps further .
he suggests replacing the word democracy , by now intrinsically linked to an ideological form of government opposed by countries such as russia and china , and replacing it with something along the lines of " good governance . "

as western troops engage in warfare in the name of freedom in iraq and afghanistan , and a prominent new report reveals worldwide democracy to be on the ebb , analysts ponder where to go from here . " for the fourth consecutive year , global declines in freedom outweighed gains in 2009 . "
such was the opening statement of a report put out by us democracy watchdog freedom house earlier last month .
entitled " freedom in the world 2010 : global erosion of freedom , " the report noted democratic decline in 40 countries in africa , latin america , the middle east and the former soviet union .
assessed for indicators including political and civil liberties , press freedom and rule of law , five countries were added to the ' not free ' list and the number of electoral democracies fell to its lowest level since 1995 .
although 16 of the 194 countries surveyed were deemed to have made progress toward greater freedom for their peoples , and despite the fact that the overall global situation has improved over the past two decades , arch puddington , director of research with freedom house described the findings as " cause for real concern . "
manifold causes speaking to deutsche welle , he said last year 's democratic slow-down was more pronounced than in the three before , a finding he attributed to a wide variety of factors .
bildunterschrift : street protests in iran in summer 2009 following presidential elections " one is an increasing aggressiveness and self-assuredness on the part of some of the leading authoritarian countries - china , russia , iran , venezuela , zimbabwe - which then serve as models for other countries , " puddington said .
among the other issues at work are reactions to some of the democracy gains - such as the orange revolution - of the last decade , cynicism brought on by unfulfilled hopes of prospering in a fair society and initiatives to smother and suppress the growing confidence of civil societies .
democracy by degree but some experts argue that things are not quite as bad as the picture painted by the freedom house report .
michael efler , national spokesperson for german pro-democracy group mehr demokratie , says it 's a matter of perception .
" you have to ask what democracy is , " efler told deutsche welle .
" the liberal western approach taken by freedom house focuses on elections .
so if a country stages a fair ballot it is considered a democracy , but i think that is a limited way of doing things . "
he said that while elections are clearly crucial , it is also important to realize that the western understanding of democracy and human rights is not shared the world over .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein toppling was meant as a symbol for democracy in iraq illustrating his case with the omnipresent examples of iraq and afghanistan , efler said " society is structured differently and individual freedom does n't play anything like as important a role as it does for us . "
which begs the question , do people really want democracy ? " i wish it were a value to which everybody aspired but i do n't think that 's the way it is , " efler said .
" and it 's futile to try and force democracy on people because it wo n't work . "
too poor to consider democracy humphrey hawksley is author of the recently published " democracy kills : what 's so good about having the vote ? "
he told deutsche welle that for about one sixth of the world 's population democracy is not even a flicker on the radar .
" there are a billion or so people in a state of need , they want shelter , security from tribal wars , they want to be able to feed their children and get medicines for the sick , and they do n't have that .
so democracy as such does n't really factor in for them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food first , democracy later and although the need for those very basic life essentials may be conceptually tied to the image of a fair society with an elected democracy , hawksley said the carrot that generally gets voters to the ballot box is not hope for a brighter future , but a chance to oust an existing government .
" that 's the stock argument , " he said .
" but what 's the point of doing that if your hospital is still a mess , if your road is still a mess , if your infant mortality levels are still enormously high ?
what is the point of going through all that rigmarole if at the end of the day it does n't deliver anything to the citizens who cast the vote ? "
that , he says , is the question countries should be asking themselves if they want to create smooth civilized societies .
the question is the answer .
democracy vs. good governance but arch puddington would say there is more to it than that .
he believes the impetus has to come from outside , from the west .
" i think what you have to do is to try to educate people , let them know that large democratic societies are also prosperous societies , so they have the prosperity and they have the freedom . "
for his part , michael efler stresses the importance of creating a public platform for oppressed societies , and meeting with anti-regime activists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say former us president george bush poisoned the word democracy hawksley though , goes a couple of steps further .
he suggests replacing the word democracy , by now intrinsically linked to an ideological form of government opposed by countries such as russia and china , and replacing it with something along the lines of " good governance . "
" if you got together with the un and said ' we want to give these people in this african country good governance and we want to build them schools and so on , ' then you would take away the friction that many places see as the west trying to export their own ideology in order to get business contracts .

as western troops engage in warfare in the name of freedom in iraq and afghanistan , and a prominent new report reveals worldwide democracy to be on the ebb , analysts ponder where to go from here . " for the fourth consecutive year , global declines in freedom outweighed gains in 2009 . "
such was the opening statement of a report put out by us democracy watchdog freedom house earlier last month .
entitled " freedom in the world 2010 : global erosion of freedom , " the report noted democratic decline in 40 countries in africa , latin america , the middle east and the former soviet union .
assessed for indicators including political and civil liberties , press freedom and rule of law , five countries were added to the ' not free ' list and the number of electoral democracies fell to its lowest level since 1995 .
although 16 of the 194 countries surveyed were deemed to have made progress toward greater freedom for their peoples , and despite the fact that the overall global situation has improved over the past two decades , arch puddington , director of research with freedom house described the findings as " cause for real concern . "
manifold causes speaking to deutsche welle , he said last year 's democratic slow-down was more pronounced than in the three before , a finding he attributed to a wide variety of factors .
bildunterschrift : street protests in iran in summer 2009 following presidential elections " one is an increasing aggressiveness and self-assuredness on the part of some of the leading authoritarian countries - china , russia , iran , venezuela , zimbabwe - which then serve as models for other countries , " puddington said .
among the other issues at work are reactions to some of the democracy gains - such as the orange revolution - of the last decade , cynicism brought on by unfulfilled hopes of prospering in a fair society and initiatives to smother and suppress the growing confidence of civil societies .
democracy by degree but some experts argue that things are not quite as bad as the picture painted by the freedom house report .
michael efler , national spokesperson for german pro-democracy group mehr demokratie , says it 's a matter of perception .
" you have to ask what democracy is , " efler told deutsche welle .
" the liberal western approach taken by freedom house focuses on elections .
so if a country stages a fair ballot it is considered a democracy , but i think that is a limited way of doing things . "
he said that while elections are clearly crucial , it is also important to realize that the western understanding of democracy and human rights is not shared the world over .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein toppling was meant as a symbol for democracy in iraq illustrating his case with the omnipresent examples of iraq and afghanistan , efler said " society is structured differently and individual freedom does n't play anything like as important a role as it does for us . "
which begs the question , do people really want democracy ? " i wish it were a value to which everybody aspired but i do n't think that 's the way it is , " efler said .
" and it 's futile to try and force democracy on people because it wo n't work . "
too poor to consider democracy humphrey hawksley is author of the recently published " democracy kills : what 's so good about having the vote ? "
he told deutsche welle that for about one sixth of the world 's population democracy is not even a flicker on the radar .
" there are a billion or so people in a state of need , they want shelter , security from tribal wars , they want to be able to feed their children and get medicines for the sick , and they do n't have that .
so democracy as such does n't really factor in for them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food first , democracy later and although the need for those very basic life essentials may be conceptually tied to the image of a fair society with an elected democracy , hawksley said the carrot that generally gets voters to the ballot box is not hope for a brighter future , but a chance to oust an existing government .
" that 's the stock argument , " he said .
" but what 's the point of doing that if your hospital is still a mess , if your road is still a mess , if your infant mortality levels are still enormously high ?
what is the point of going through all that rigmarole if at the end of the day it does n't deliver anything to the citizens who cast the vote ? "
that , he says , is the question countries should be asking themselves if they want to create smooth civilized societies .
the question is the answer .
democracy vs. good governance but arch puddington would say there is more to it than that .
he believes the impetus has to come from outside , from the west .
" i think what you have to do is to try to educate people , let them know that large democratic societies are also prosperous societies , so they have the prosperity and they have the freedom . "
for his part , michael efler stresses the importance of creating a public platform for oppressed societies , and meeting with anti-regime activists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say former us president george bush poisoned the word democracy hawksley though , goes a couple of steps further .
he suggests replacing the word democracy , by now intrinsically linked to an ideological form of government opposed by countries such as russia and china , and replacing it with something along the lines of " good governance . "
" if you got together with the un and said ' we want to give these people in this african country good governance and we want to build them schools and so on , ' then you would take away the friction that many places see as the west trying to export their own ideology in order to get business contracts . "
but whether the power of semantics could convince the powers that be is an experiment still waiting to be tried out .

as western troops engage in warfare in the name of freedom in iraq and afghanistan , and a prominent new report reveals worldwide democracy to be on the ebb , analysts ponder where to go from here . " for the fourth consecutive year , global declines in freedom outweighed gains in 2009 . "
such was the opening statement of a report put out by us democracy watchdog freedom house earlier last month .
entitled " freedom in the world 2010 : global erosion of freedom , " the report noted democratic decline in 40 countries in africa , latin america , the middle east and the former soviet union .
assessed for indicators including political and civil liberties , press freedom and rule of law , five countries were added to the ' not free ' list and the number of electoral democracies fell to its lowest level since 1995 .
although 16 of the 194 countries surveyed were deemed to have made progress toward greater freedom for their peoples , and despite the fact that the overall global situation has improved over the past two decades , arch puddington , director of research with freedom house described the findings as " cause for real concern . "
manifold causes speaking to deutsche welle , he said last year 's democratic slow-down was more pronounced than in the three before , a finding he attributed to a wide variety of factors .
bildunterschrift : street protests in iran in summer 2009 following presidential elections " one is an increasing aggressiveness and self-assuredness on the part of some of the leading authoritarian countries - china , russia , iran , venezuela , zimbabwe - which then serve as models for other countries , " puddington said .

democracy by degree but some experts argue that things are not quite as bad as the picture painted by the freedom house report .
michael efler , national spokesperson for german pro-democracy group mehr demokratie , says it 's a matter of perception .
" you have to ask what democracy is , " efler told deutsche welle .
" the liberal western approach taken by freedom house focuses on elections .
so if a country stages a fair ballot it is considered a democracy , but i think that is a limited way of doing things . "
he said that while elections are clearly crucial , it is also important to realize that the western understanding of democracy and human rights is not shared the world over .

which begs the question , do people really want democracy ? " i wish it were a value to which everybody aspired but i do n't think that 's the way it is , " efler said .
" and it 's futile to try and force democracy on people because it wo n't work . "

among the other issues at work are reactions to some of the democracy gains - such as the orange revolution - of the last decade , cynicism brought on by unfulfilled hopes of prospering in a fair society and initiatives to smother and suppress the growing confidence of civil societies .
democracy by degree but some experts argue that things are not quite as bad as the picture painted by the freedom house report .
michael efler , national spokesperson for german pro-democracy group mehr demokratie , says it 's a matter of perception .
" you have to ask what democracy is , " efler told deutsche welle .
" the liberal western approach taken by freedom house focuses on elections .
so if a country stages a fair ballot it is considered a democracy , but i think that is a limited way of doing things . "
he said that while elections are clearly crucial , it is also important to realize that the western understanding of democracy and human rights is not shared the world over .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein toppling was meant as a symbol for democracy in iraq illustrating his case with the omnipresent examples of iraq and afghanistan , efler said " society is structured differently and individual freedom does n't play anything like as important a role as it does for us . "
which begs the question , do people really want democracy ? " i wish it were a value to which everybody aspired but i do n't think that 's the way it is , " efler said .
" and it 's futile to try and force democracy on people because it wo n't work . "
too poor to consider democracy humphrey hawksley is author of the recently published " democracy kills : what 's so good about having the vote ? "
he told deutsche welle that for about one sixth of the world 's population democracy is not even a flicker on the radar .
" there are a billion or so people in a state of need , they want shelter , security from tribal wars , they want to be able to feed their children and get medicines for the sick , and they do n't have that .
so democracy as such does n't really factor in for them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food first , democracy later and although the need for those very basic life essentials may be conceptually tied to the image of a fair society with an elected democracy , hawksley said the carrot that generally gets voters to the ballot box is not hope for a brighter future , but a chance to oust an existing government .
" that 's the stock argument , " he said .
" but what 's the point of doing that if your hospital is still a mess , if your road is still a mess , if your infant mortality levels are still enormously high ?
what is the point of going through all that rigmarole if at the end of the day it does n't deliver anything to the citizens who cast the vote ? "
that , he says , is the question countries should be asking themselves if they want to create smooth civilized societies .
the question is the answer .
democracy vs. good governance but arch puddington would say there is more to it than that .
he believes the impetus has to come from outside , from the west .
" i think what you have to do is to try to educate people , let them know that large democratic societies are also prosperous societies , so they have the prosperity and they have the freedom . "
for his part , michael efler stresses the importance of creating a public platform for oppressed societies , and meeting with anti-regime activists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say former us president george bush poisoned the word democracy hawksley though , goes a couple of steps further .
he suggests replacing the word democracy , by now intrinsically linked to an ideological form of government opposed by countries such as russia and china , and replacing it with something along the lines of " good governance . "
" if you got together with the un and said ' we want to give these people in this african country good governance and we want to build them schools and so on , ' then you would take away the friction that many places see as the west trying to export their own ideology in order to get business contracts . "
but whether the power of semantics could convince the powers that be is an experiment still waiting to be tried out .

the murphy commission report detailed a litany of abuse perpetuated by priests against more than 300 victims and strongly criticized the irish church 's handling of the situation .
four irish bishops have already resigned in the wake of the child sex abuse scandal .
in december , pope benedict expressed his " outrage , shame and profound regret " over the murphy commission 's revelations and said he would take clear measures in response to the situation .
a letter from the pontiff was expected to be published soon after his talks with the irish bishops .
church ' seriously damaged ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scandal has done ' immense damage ' , says irish bishop joseph duffy joseph duffy , the bishop of clogher in ireland , said the role of the pedophile priests had seriously damaged the church .
" the church has been seriously wounded and we are in a very serious situation .
this has done immense damage to the authority of the church as the mouthpiece of the gospel of jesus christ , and of that there is no doubt .
our business is to try to repair that damage , " bishop duffy said .
the irish crisis comes on the heels of a scandal in germany , where an elite jesuit school in berlin admitted to sexual abuse of teenagers by teachers during the 1970s and 80s .
revelations of pedophile priests also have rocked the church in recent months after similar scandals in the united states and australia .
vatican warns of ' loss of faith ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damage control is the job of pope benedict -lrb- r -rrb- and the vatican 's secretary of state , tarcisio bertone vatican secretary of state , cardinal tarcisio bertone , said on monday that the scandal could be overcome by faith . but , he warned that the loss of confidence and trust in the church was an " even more dangerous storm " and that people could " lose faith in god , through discouragement and despair . "
bishop duffy said that to restore that trust the church would be focusing on the victims .
" we will certainly be keeping the survivors at the top of the list of priorities .
i imagine hardly any bishop will fail to mention survivors as his primary concern in all of this most serious business , " he said .
anti-abuse campaigners , meanwhile , have called on pope benedict to visit ireland to meet the victims of the pedophile scandal .
christine buckley , herself an abuse survivor , said the pope had gone to the united states and australia to apologize and should do the same in ireland .
she also criticized that many of the accused irish priests had left ireland and gone to countries such as australia and america , where they continued their abuse. gb / dpa / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

because osho ashram was close to our place , they started the idea of german bakery .
with that , they came up with the name german bakery , because it was mainly for foreigners .
even indians liked the pastries , cakes and juices . "
since dnyaneshwar 's death in 1999 , his wife smita kharose runs the business , helped now by her daughter snehal .
on a regular day , the german bakery is usually teeming with customers who come for german bakery 's special cakes and health snacks .
deprived now of their only source of income , the kharose family is struggling to come to terms with the tragedy .
destruction of a symbol of friendship the german bakery 's loss is also being strongly felt among its foreign fan base .
one of them is luc didon , director of the indo-french cultural centre in pune , " it 's so full of people of different origins and it 's a symbol of diversity – diversity of languages , of cultures , of thoughts of beliefs .
this is destruction not only of people , but of a symbol of friendship . "

but the german bakery had been considered a soft target , says union minister p chidambaram , denying that there had been an intelligence failure .
while the government has not ruled out pakistani involvement , the leading congress party has so far rejected any demands by right-wing opposition groups to put off the resumption of high-level talks with pakistan planned for next week .

police are investigating possible links to the pakistan-based terror group lashkar-e-toiba . an abandoned backpack left under a table at the crowded german bakery exploded on saturday night after it was opened by an unsuspecting waiter .
residents worried about security for the residents of pune , the attack has shaken their faith in the safety of their hometown .
donna d 'souza , a student and long-time resident of pune , says : " we always thought it was a peaceful , cosmopolitan city that was accepting of the people who come in .
example of the osho commune , where you have an influx of so many foreign nationals coming in , and there has never been anything like this that ever happened there .
so it 's really shocking .
and we are the kind of people who would also visit there often , so it could have been any of us as well . "
diversity under attack ?
the german bakery was launched in 1988 by a local businessman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bomb detonated in a crowded bakery popular with foreigners dnyaneshwar kharose along with his associate woody , a german who had come to the osho ashram in pune .
it was woody 's idea to start a bakery with an international appeal , says dnyaneshwar kharose 's daughter snehal : " foreigners specially found it difficult to find their kind of food in pune .
because osho ashram was close to our place , they started the idea of german bakery .
with that , they came up with the name german bakery , because it was mainly for foreigners .
even indians liked the pastries , cakes and juices . "
since dnyaneshwar 's death in 1999 , his wife smita kharose runs the business , helped now by her daughter snehal .
on a regular day , the german bakery is usually teeming with customers who come for german bakery 's special cakes and health snacks .
deprived now of their only source of income , the kharose family is struggling to come to terms with the tragedy .
destruction of a symbol of friendship the german bakery 's loss is also being strongly felt among its foreign fan base .
one of them is luc didon , director of the indo-french cultural centre in pune , " it 's so full of people of different origins and it 's a symbol of diversity – diversity of languages , of cultures , of thoughts of beliefs .
this is destruction not only of people , but of a symbol of friendship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nine people were killed and dozens injured yet it is this large foreign client base that seems to have made the german bakery a target , similar to the mumbai attacks on november 26 , where the terrorists chose the famous café leopold and luxury hotels frequented by foreigners .
soft target prior to the attacks , security had been tightened around the osho ashram and the jewish chabad house , based on intelligence inputs of a possible terror strike .
these were the two locations surveyed as potential targets by david coleman headley , an operative of the pakistan-based terror group lashkar-e-toiba .
but the german bakery had been considered a soft target , says union minister p chidambaram , denying that there had been an intelligence failure .
while the government has not ruled out pakistani involvement , the leading congress party has so far rejected any demands by right-wing opposition groups to put off the resumption of high-level talks with pakistan planned for next week .

his main aim is to reach agreement on raising the pension age , but the unions are strongly opposed . french president nicolas sarkozy decided to make pension reform the main issue at his country 's third " social summit " on monday .
he and members of his government met with representatives of the unions and employers for what were expected to be difficult talks .
sarkozy said at the end of the meeting that the government would present its proposals in september .
" if we want to save our pension system , we ca n't put off the decisions , " he said .
sarkozy 's office had been at pains to lower expectations ahead of the event , saying that no decisions would be made on fundamental issues , but that the meeting would discuss " the timetable and the methods of work . "
the government said it did n't want to rush things , but " everyone knows the solutions by heart . "
during the meeting , sarkozy was reported to have added that the government did not intend to force a solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been able to push through many unpopular reforms - will he succeed on pensions ?
pension reform is a highly controversial issue .
the budget ministry estimates that the pension system will have a 10.7 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.13 billion -rrb- deficit this year out of a total public deficit of 25 billion .
the labor minister , xavier darcos , told reuters news agency that the growing proportion of elderly people in french society would mean that the cost of the pension system would drive the annual public deficit up to 100 billion euros by 2050 .
longer working life the government would like to solve the problem by raising the retirement age , which , at 60 , is unusually low compared with the rest of europe , where many countries are moving towards 67 .
france has already taken some action in this direction , by increasing to 41 the numbers of years in which contributions have to be paid in order to earn a full pension . this means that people with degrees or elaborate training , who start work later , can not expect to have contributed for 41 years by the time they 're 60 , while unqualified workers are more likely to have done so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is hoping his pension reform will not attract the kind of protest which met the 2003 reform the unions are deeply opposed to any reform .
bernard thibault , head of the cgt union , rejected the government 's figures .
" we will defend the right to retire at 60 , " he said .
he also rejected the idea that " because life expectancy is increasing , it is unavoidable that people should spend a larger part of their lives working . "
the government enters these negotiations at a difficult time .
it had hoped to put off this third reform of the pension system in seven years until after the presidential election in 2012 , but the economic crisis has intervened .
increased unemployment has led to a reduction in contributions to the system .
in addition , the french government needs to do something about its expected deficit of 8.2 percent of gross domestic product this year , caused by its attempts to boost the economy .
the government is not trusted but the voters do not trust the government to deal with the pension crisis .
in a survey conducted for the metro newspaper , only 21 percent said they trusted the government to rescue the pension system , while 69 percent said they trusted the workers themselves or their unions . in another survey , well over half opposed either increasing the pension age or increasing the number of contribution years required for a full pension .
but yet another survey shows that young people still at school or in training do indeed expect to work beyond their 60th birthday .
the government was anxious not to cause uproar .
labor minister darcos said that contribution rates should not go up .
president sarkozy said that pension levels should not go down .
that leaves only the retirement age to play with if france is to deal with its pension challenge .

his main aim is to reach agreement on raising the pension age , but the unions are strongly opposed . french president nicolas sarkozy decided to make pension reform the main issue at his country 's third " social summit " on monday .
he and members of his government met with representatives of the unions and employers for what were expected to be difficult talks .
sarkozy said at the end of the meeting that the government would present its proposals in september .
" if we want to save our pension system , we ca n't put off the decisions , " he said .
sarkozy 's office had been at pains to lower expectations ahead of the event , saying that no decisions would be made on fundamental issues , but that the meeting would discuss " the timetable and the methods of work . "
the government said it did n't want to rush things , but " everyone knows the solutions by heart . "
during the meeting , sarkozy was reported to have added that the government did not intend to force a solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been able to push through many unpopular reforms - will he succeed on pensions ?
pension reform is a highly controversial issue .
the budget ministry estimates that the pension system will have a 10.7 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.13 billion -rrb- deficit this year out of a total public deficit of 25 billion .
the labor minister , xavier darcos , told reuters news agency that the growing proportion of elderly people in french society would mean that the cost of the pension system would drive the annual public deficit up to 100 billion euros by 2050 .
longer working life the government would like to solve the problem by raising the retirement age , which , at 60 , is unusually low compared with the rest of europe , where many countries are moving towards 67 .
france has already taken some action in this direction , by increasing to 41 the numbers of years in which contributions have to be paid in order to earn a full pension . this means that people with degrees or elaborate training , who start work later , can not expect to have contributed for 41 years by the time they 're 60 , while unqualified workers are more likely to have done so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is hoping his pension reform will not attract the kind of protest which met the 2003 reform the unions are deeply opposed to any reform .
bernard thibault , head of the cgt union , rejected the government 's figures .
" we will defend the right to retire at 60 , " he said .
he also rejected the idea that " because life expectancy is increasing , it is unavoidable that people should spend a larger part of their lives working . "
the government enters these negotiations at a difficult time .
it had hoped to put off this third reform of the pension system in seven years until after the presidential election in 2012 , but the economic crisis has intervened .
increased unemployment has led to a reduction in contributions to the system .
in addition , the french government needs to do something about its expected deficit of 8.2 percent of gross domestic product this year , caused by its attempts to boost the economy .
the government is not trusted but the voters do not trust the government to deal with the pension crisis .
in a survey conducted for the metro newspaper , only 21 percent said they trusted the government to rescue the pension system , while 69 percent said they trusted the workers themselves or their unions . in another survey , well over half opposed either increasing the pension age or increasing the number of contribution years required for a full pension .
but yet another survey shows that young people still at school or in training do indeed expect to work beyond their 60th birthday .
the government was anxious not to cause uproar .
labor minister darcos said that contribution rates should not go up .
president sarkozy said that pension levels should not go down .
that leaves only the retirement age to play with if france is to deal with its pension challenge .

two foreign nationals were also killed in the attack , and several others are among the injured .
it is the first major attack in the country since the series of attacks on the city of mumbai in november 2008 .
police are investigating possible links to the pakistan-based terror group lashkar-e-toiba . an abandoned backpack left under a table at the crowded german bakery exploded on saturday night after it was opened by an unsuspecting waiter .
residents worried about security for the residents of pune , the attack has shaken their faith in the safety of their hometown .

so it 's really shocking .

the german bakery was launched in 1988 by a local businessman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bomb detonated in a crowded bakery popular with foreigners dnyaneshwar kharose along with his associate woody , a german who had come to the osho ashram in pune .
it was woody 's idea to start a bakery with an international appeal , says dnyaneshwar kharose 's daughter snehal : " foreigners specially found it difficult to find their kind of food in pune .
because osho ashram was close to our place , they started the idea of german bakery .
with that , they came up with the name german bakery , because it was mainly for foreigners .
even indians liked the pastries , cakes and juices . "
since dnyaneshwar 's death in 1999 , his wife smita kharose runs the business , helped now by her daughter snehal .
on a regular day , the german bakery is usually teeming with customers who come for german bakery 's special cakes and health snacks .
deprived now of their only source of income , the kharose family is struggling to come to terms with the tragedy .
destruction of a symbol of friendship the german bakery 's loss is also being strongly felt among its foreign fan base .
one of them is luc didon , director of the indo-french cultural centre in pune , " it 's so full of people of different origins and it 's a symbol of diversity – diversity of languages , of cultures , of thoughts of beliefs .
this is destruction not only of people , but of a symbol of friendship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nine people were killed and dozens injured yet it is this large foreign client base that seems to have made the german bakery a target , similar to the mumbai attacks on november 26 , where the terrorists chose the famous café leopold and luxury hotels frequented by foreigners .
soft target prior to the attacks , security had been tightened around the osho ashram and the jewish chabad house , based on intelligence inputs of a possible terror strike .
these were the two locations surveyed as potential targets by david coleman headley , an operative of the pakistan-based terror group lashkar-e-toiba .
but the german bakery had been considered a soft target , says union minister p chidambaram , denying that there had been an intelligence failure .
while the government has not ruled out pakistani involvement , the leading congress party has so far rejected any demands by right-wing opposition groups to put off the resumption of high-level talks with pakistan planned for next week .

diversity under attack ?
the german bakery was launched in 1988 by a local businessman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bomb detonated in a crowded bakery popular with foreigners dnyaneshwar kharose along with his associate woody , a german who had come to the osho ashram in pune .
it was woody 's idea to start a bakery with an international appeal , says dnyaneshwar kharose 's daughter snehal : " foreigners specially found it difficult to find their kind of food in pune .
because osho ashram was close to our place , they started the idea of german bakery .
with that , they came up with the name german bakery , because it was mainly for foreigners .
even indians liked the pastries , cakes and juices . "
since dnyaneshwar 's death in 1999 , his wife smita kharose runs the business , helped now by her daughter snehal .
on a regular day , the german bakery is usually teeming with customers who come for german bakery 's special cakes and health snacks .
deprived now of their only source of income , the kharose family is struggling to come to terms with the tragedy .
destruction of a symbol of friendship the german bakery 's loss is also being strongly felt among its foreign fan base .
one of them is luc didon , director of the indo-french cultural centre in pune , " it 's so full of people of different origins and it 's a symbol of diversity – diversity of languages , of cultures , of thoughts of beliefs .
this is destruction not only of people , but of a symbol of friendship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nine people were killed and dozens injured yet it is this large foreign client base that seems to have made the german bakery a target , similar to the mumbai attacks on november 26 , where the terrorists chose the famous café leopold and luxury hotels frequented by foreigners .
soft target prior to the attacks , security had been tightened around the osho ashram and the jewish chabad house , based on intelligence inputs of a possible terror strike .
these were the two locations surveyed as potential targets by david coleman headley , an operative of the pakistan-based terror group lashkar-e-toiba .
but the german bakery had been considered a soft target , says union minister p chidambaram , denying that there had been an intelligence failure .
while the government has not ruled out pakistani involvement , the leading congress party has so far rejected any demands by right-wing opposition groups to put off the resumption of high-level talks with pakistan planned for next week .

his main aim is to reach agreement on raising the pension age , but the unions are strongly opposed . french president nicolas sarkozy decided to make pension reform the main issue at his country 's third " social summit " on monday .
he and members of his government met with representatives of the unions and employers for what were expected to be difficult talks .
sarkozy said at the end of the meeting that the government would present its proposals in september .
" if we want to save our pension system , we ca n't put off the decisions , " he said .
sarkozy 's office had been at pains to lower expectations ahead of the event , saying that no decisions would be made on fundamental issues , but that the meeting would discuss " the timetable and the methods of work . "
the government said it did n't want to rush things , but " everyone knows the solutions by heart . "
during the meeting , sarkozy was reported to have added that the government did not intend to force a solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been able to push through many unpopular reforms - will he succeed on pensions ?
pension reform is a highly controversial issue .
the budget ministry estimates that the pension system will have a 10.7 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.13 billion -rrb- deficit this year out of a total public deficit of 25 billion .
the labor minister , xavier darcos , told reuters news agency that the growing proportion of elderly people in french society would mean that the cost of the pension system would drive the annual public deficit up to 100 billion euros by 2050 .
longer working life the government would like to solve the problem by raising the retirement age , which , at 60 , is unusually low compared with the rest of europe , where many countries are moving towards 67 .
france has already taken some action in this direction , by increasing to 41 the numbers of years in which contributions have to be paid in order to earn a full pension . this means that people with degrees or elaborate training , who start work later , can not expect to have contributed for 41 years by the time they 're 60 , while unqualified workers are more likely to have done so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is hoping his pension reform will not attract the kind of protest which met the 2003 reform the unions are deeply opposed to any reform .
bernard thibault , head of the cgt union , rejected the government 's figures .
" we will defend the right to retire at 60 , " he said .
he also rejected the idea that " because life expectancy is increasing , it is unavoidable that people should spend a larger part of their lives working . "
the government enters these negotiations at a difficult time .
it had hoped to put off this third reform of the pension system in seven years until after the presidential election in 2012 , but the economic crisis has intervened .
increased unemployment has led to a reduction in contributions to the system .
in addition , the french government needs to do something about its expected deficit of 8.2 percent of gross domestic product this year , caused by its attempts to boost the economy .
the government is not trusted but the voters do not trust the government to deal with the pension crisis .
in a survey conducted for the metro newspaper , only 21 percent said they trusted the government to rescue the pension system , while 69 percent said they trusted the workers themselves or their unions . in another survey , well over half opposed either increasing the pension age or increasing the number of contribution years required for a full pension .
but yet another survey shows that young people still at school or in training do indeed expect to work beyond their 60th birthday .
the government was anxious not to cause uproar .
labor minister darcos said that contribution rates should not go up .
president sarkozy said that pension levels should not go down .
that leaves only the retirement age to play with if france is to deal with its pension challenge .

in a survey conducted for the metro newspaper , only 21 percent said they trusted the government to rescue the pension system , while 69 percent said they trusted the workers themselves or their unions . in another survey , well over half opposed either increasing the pension age or increasing the number of contribution years required for a full pension .
but yet another survey shows that young people still at school or in training do indeed expect to work beyond their 60th birthday .
the government was anxious not to cause uproar .
labor minister darcos said that contribution rates should not go up .
president sarkozy said that pension levels should not go down .
that leaves only the retirement age to play with if france is to deal with its pension challenge .

the horsetrading is well underway . the government of chancellor angela merkel has continued its push to have axel weber , the current president of the german central bank , the bundesbank , appointed as the next president of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- .
german daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported that finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was expected to push for weber 's nomination at a meeting with his counterparts from the 15 other eu countries that use the euro currency .
the finance ministers plan to name a replacement for the ecb 's current vice president , lucas papademos , at the two-day gathering starting monday .
schaeuble was expected to press for portuguese central banker vitor manuel ribeiro constancio to take over as new ecb vice president .
the appointment of a southern european to the post would be an important strategic victory for germany .
constancio 's accession to the position would make it more likely that a northern european would be appointed to the ecb 's top post .
that position is currently held by frenchman jean-claude trichet , who steps down in late 2011 .
paris ' support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants weber -lrb- left -rrb- to take over from trichet -lrb- middle -rrb- germany , europe 's largest economy , complained recently that it was underrepresented in the ecb 's leadership , with schaeuble insisting that " in the current composition of the board of directors southern european countries , with three directors from greece , italy and spain , are unusually strongly represented . "
weber 's main opponent for the position of ecb head is bank of italy governor mario draghi .
in an important step towards securing the top post for weber , germany looked to have gained the support of france , which is considered the unofficial leader of the southern european bloc within the central bank .
german weekly die welt am sonntag reported that paris had agreed to support weber 's candidacy in return for berlin 's support for a french representative to become the ecb 's next chief economist , a post currently held by juergen stark , a german. dfm / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the horsetrading is well underway . the government of chancellor angela merkel has continued its push to have axel weber , the current president of the german central bank , the bundesbank , appointed as the next president of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- .
german daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported that finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was expected to push for weber 's nomination at a meeting with his counterparts from the 15 other eu countries that use the euro currency .
the finance ministers plan to name a replacement for the ecb 's current vice president , lucas papademos , at the two-day gathering starting monday .
schaeuble was expected to press for portuguese central banker vitor manuel ribeiro constancio to take over as new ecb vice president .
the appointment of a southern european to the post would be an important strategic victory for germany .
constancio 's accession to the position would make it more likely that a northern european would be appointed to the ecb 's top post .
that position is currently held by frenchman jean-claude trichet , who steps down in late 2011 .
paris ' support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants weber -lrb- left -rrb- to take over from trichet -lrb- middle -rrb- germany , europe 's largest economy , complained recently that it was underrepresented in the ecb 's leadership , with schaeuble insisting that " in the current composition of the board of directors southern european countries , with three directors from greece , italy and spain , are unusually strongly represented . "
weber 's main opponent for the position of ecb head is bank of italy governor mario draghi .
in an important step towards securing the top post for weber , germany looked to have gained the support of france , which is considered the unofficial leader of the southern european bloc within the central bank .
german weekly die welt am sonntag reported that paris had agreed to support weber 's candidacy in return for berlin 's support for a french representative to become the ecb 's next chief economist , a post currently held by juergen stark , a german. dfm / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

news of the abuse allegations involving around 30 former pupils first surfaced in late january , when a former priest admitted that he forced boys to have sex at the elite canisius college in berlin from 1975 to 1983 .
since the revelation , many more former pupils have come forward with allegations against clerics and laymen at jesuit colleges and other catholic schools across the country .
" the number of people who have contacted me or the canisius college has risen to more than 100 , " lawyer ursula raue told german news agency dpa .
raue has been asked by the jesuits to investigate the allegations .
cases confirmed across germany the jesuits have since issued an apology , admitting they covered up abuse that had taken place at schools in berlin , hamburg , st. blasien , goettingen and hildesheim in the 1970s and 1980s .
the worldwide order also confirmed cases in spain and chile .
since the most recent of the cases happened more than 20 years ago , it 's still unclear whether or not criminal charges will be brought .

news of the abuse allegations involving around 30 former pupils first surfaced in late january , when a former priest admitted that he forced boys to have sex at the elite canisius college in berlin from 1975 to 1983 .
since the revelation , many more former pupils have come forward with allegations against clerics and laymen at jesuit colleges and other catholic schools across the country .
" the number of people who have contacted me or the canisius college has risen to more than 100 , " lawyer ursula raue told german news agency dpa .
raue has been asked by the jesuits to investigate the allegations .
cases confirmed across germany the jesuits have since issued an apology , admitting they covered up abuse that had taken place at schools in berlin , hamburg , st. blasien , goettingen and hildesheim in the 1970s and 1980s .
the worldwide order also confirmed cases in spain and chile .
since the most recent of the cases happened more than 20 years ago , it 's still unclear whether or not criminal charges will be brought .
raue is working on a report on the allegations with canisius headmaster father klaus mertes and expects to send an interim report to the german headquarters of the jesuit order in munich later this week. cmk / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported that finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was expected to push for weber 's nomination at a meeting with his counterparts from the 15 other eu countries that use the euro currency .
the finance ministers plan to name a replacement for the ecb 's current vice president , lucas papademos , at the two-day gathering starting monday .
schaeuble was expected to press for portuguese central banker vitor manuel ribeiro constancio to take over as new ecb vice president .

the murphy commission report detailed a litany of abuse perpetuated by priests against more than 300 victims and strongly criticized the irish church 's handling of the situation .
four irish bishops have already resigned in the wake of the child sex abuse scandal .
in december , pope benedict expressed his " outrage , shame and profound regret " over the murphy commission 's revelations and said he would take clear measures in response to the situation .
a letter from the pontiff was expected to be published soon after his talks with the irish bishops .
church ' seriously damaged ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scandal has done ' immense damage ' , says irish bishop joseph duffy joseph duffy , the bishop of clogher in ireland , said the role of the pedophile priests had seriously damaged the church .
" the church has been seriously wounded and we are in a very serious situation .
this has done immense damage to the authority of the church as the mouthpiece of the gospel of jesus christ , and of that there is no doubt .
our business is to try to repair that damage , " bishop duffy said .
the irish crisis comes on the heels of a scandal in germany , where an elite jesuit school in berlin admitted to sexual abuse of teenagers by teachers during the 1970s and 80s .
revelations of pedophile priests also have rocked the church in recent months after similar scandals in the united states and australia .

"
bishop duffy said that to restore that trust the church would be focusing on the victims .
" we will certainly be keeping the survivors at the top of the list of priorities .
i imagine hardly any bishop will fail to mention survivors as his primary concern in all of this most serious business , " he said .
anti-abuse campaigners , meanwhile , have called on pope benedict to visit ireland to meet the victims of the pedophile scandal .
christine buckley , herself an abuse survivor , said the pope had gone to the united states and australia to apologize and should do the same in ireland .
she also criticized that many of the accused irish priests had left ireland and gone to countries such as australia and america , where they continued their abuse. gb / dpa / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the horsetrading is well underway . the government of chancellor angela merkel has continued its push to have axel weber , the current president of the german central bank , the bundesbank , appointed as the next president of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- .
german daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported that finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was expected to push for weber 's nomination at a meeting with his counterparts from the 15 other eu countries that use the euro currency .
the finance ministers plan to name a replacement for the ecb 's current vice president , lucas papademos , at the two-day gathering starting monday .
schaeuble was expected to press for portuguese central banker vitor manuel ribeiro constancio to take over as new ecb vice president .
the appointment of a southern european to the post would be an important strategic victory for germany .
constancio 's accession to the position would make it more likely that a northern european would be appointed to the ecb 's top post .
that position is currently held by frenchman jean-claude trichet , who steps down in late 2011 .
paris ' support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants weber -lrb- left -rrb- to take over from trichet -lrb- middle -rrb- germany , europe 's largest economy , complained recently that it was underrepresented in the ecb 's leadership , with schaeuble insisting that " in the current composition of the board of directors southern european countries , with three directors from greece , italy and spain , are unusually strongly represented . "
weber 's main opponent for the position of ecb head is bank of italy governor mario draghi .
in an important step towards securing the top post for weber , germany looked to have gained the support of france , which is considered the unofficial leader of the southern european bloc within the central bank .
german weekly die welt am sonntag reported that paris had agreed to support weber 's candidacy in return for berlin 's support for a french representative to become the ecb 's next chief economist , a post currently held by juergen stark , a german. dfm / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the horsetrading is well underway . the government of chancellor angela merkel has continued its push to have axel weber , the current president of the german central bank , the bundesbank , appointed as the next president of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- .
german daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported that finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was expected to push for weber 's nomination at a meeting with his counterparts from the 15 other eu countries that use the euro currency .
the finance ministers plan to name a replacement for the ecb 's current vice president , lucas papademos , at the two-day gathering starting monday .
schaeuble was expected to press for portuguese central banker vitor manuel ribeiro constancio to take over as new ecb vice president .
the appointment of a southern european to the post would be an important strategic victory for germany .
constancio 's accession to the position would make it more likely that a northern european would be appointed to the ecb 's top post .
that position is currently held by frenchman jean-claude trichet , who steps down in late 2011 .
paris ' support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants weber -lrb- left -rrb- to take over from trichet -lrb- middle -rrb- germany , europe 's largest economy , complained recently that it was underrepresented in the ecb 's leadership , with schaeuble insisting that " in the current composition of the board of directors southern european countries , with three directors from greece , italy and spain , are unusually strongly represented . "
weber 's main opponent for the position of ecb head is bank of italy governor mario draghi .
in an important step towards securing the top post for weber , germany looked to have gained the support of france , which is considered the unofficial leader of the southern european bloc within the central bank .
german weekly die welt am sonntag reported that paris had agreed to support weber 's candidacy in return for berlin 's support for a french representative to become the ecb 's next chief economist , a post currently held by juergen stark , a german. dfm / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

diversity under attack ?
the german bakery was launched in 1988 by a local businessman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bomb detonated in a crowded bakery popular with foreigners dnyaneshwar kharose along with his associate woody , a german who had come to the osho ashram in pune .
it was woody 's idea to start a bakery with an international appeal , says dnyaneshwar kharose 's daughter snehal : " foreigners specially found it difficult to find their kind of food in pune .
because osho ashram was close to our place , they started the idea of german bakery .
with that , they came up with the name german bakery , because it was mainly for foreigners .
even indians liked the pastries , cakes and juices . "
since dnyaneshwar 's death in 1999 , his wife smita kharose runs the business , helped now by her daughter snehal .
on a regular day , the german bakery is usually teeming with customers who come for german bakery 's special cakes and health snacks .
deprived now of their only source of income , the kharose family is struggling to come to terms with the tragedy .
destruction of a symbol of friendship the german bakery 's loss is also being strongly felt among its foreign fan base .
one of them is luc didon , director of the indo-french cultural centre in pune , " it 's so full of people of different origins and it 's a symbol of diversity – diversity of languages , of cultures , of thoughts of beliefs .
this is destruction not only of people , but of a symbol of friendship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nine people were killed and dozens injured yet it is this large foreign client base that seems to have made the german bakery a target , similar to the mumbai attacks on november 26 , where the terrorists chose the famous café leopold and luxury hotels frequented by foreigners .
soft target prior to the attacks , security had been tightened around the osho ashram and the jewish chabad house , based on intelligence inputs of a possible terror strike .
these were the two locations surveyed as potential targets by david coleman headley , an operative of the pakistan-based terror group lashkar-e-toiba .
but the german bakery had been considered a soft target , says union minister p chidambaram , denying that there had been an intelligence failure .
while the government has not ruled out pakistani involvement , the leading congress party has so far rejected any demands by right-wing opposition groups to put off the resumption of high-level talks with pakistan planned for next week .

these were the two locations surveyed as potential targets by david coleman headley , an operative of the pakistan-based terror group lashkar-e-toiba .
but the german bakery had been considered a soft target , says union minister p chidambaram , denying that there had been an intelligence failure .
while the government has not ruled out pakistani involvement , the leading congress party has so far rejected any demands by right-wing opposition groups to put off the resumption of high-level talks with pakistan planned for next week .

norbert roettgen said he 'd stick to an agreement that would see two power plants close in coming months . german environment minister norbert roettgen has rejected calls to immediately extend the operating lifetimes of nuclear power plants .
roettgen said in a newspaper interview that he would not intervene to delay closure dates for reactors in coming months .
he told the weekly tagesspiegel am sonntag that new policy on energy plant life-spans would be decided in autumn , when the government coalition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- would discuss its energy policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen wants to adhere to existing policy in the meantime , the cdu minister said , current energy policy would dictate the fate of nuclear power stations set for closure .

the biblis a nuclear plant in hesse is earmarked for closure in summer .
" the operation of individual nuclear power stations will be decided on the basis of current law , " said roettgen .
he added that nuclear power was intended only to be an interim measure until demand can be met from renewable sources .
" we have defined nuclear energy as a ' bridge technology . '
the bridge ends when renewable energies can reliably replace nuclear energy . "
" when we have a goal before our eyes we can achieve it quickly , " he added .
more pragmatic approach at the same time , german economic minister rainer bruederle warned against " ideological rash reactions " and hinted at a more pragmatic approach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle said that solid facts were needed to decide on an approach the fdp minister told german weekly bild am sonntag that solid facts should shape future policy and that millions would need to be invested in renewable energy .
" if we do n't want electricity prices to go through the roof , we must build a bridge to the renewable age .
for the coalition this bridge is , along with the use of clean coal , nuclear energy . "
but , bruederle added , " one thing is clear .
nobody wants new nuclear power stations in germany . " possibility of extension while roettgen has said that plant life-spans could feasibly be expanded by eight years , his party colleagues in three states have called for a far longer stay of execution .
conservative regional environment ministers markus soeder from bavaria , tanya goeder from baden-wuerttemberg and silke lautenschlaeger from hesse advocate a further 20 years on top of roettgen 's suggestion .
the three represent german states with nuclear power plants and argue that renewable energy will not be ready to replace atomic power in time to realize roettgen 's proposal. rc / apn / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his main aim is to reach agreement on raising the pension age , but the unions are strongly opposed . french president nicolas sarkozy decided to make pension reform the main issue at his country 's third " social summit " on monday .
he and members of his government met with representatives of the unions and employers for what were expected to be difficult talks .
sarkozy said at the end of the meeting that the government would present its proposals in september .
" if we want to save our pension system , we ca n't put off the decisions , " he said .
sarkozy 's office had been at pains to lower expectations ahead of the event , saying that no decisions would be made on fundamental issues , but that the meeting would discuss " the timetable and the methods of work . "
the government said it did n't want to rush things , but " everyone knows the solutions by heart . "
during the meeting , sarkozy was reported to have added that the government did not intend to force a solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been able to push through many unpopular reforms - will he succeed on pensions ?
pension reform is a highly controversial issue .
the budget ministry estimates that the pension system will have a 10.7 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.13 billion -rrb- deficit this year out of a total public deficit of 25 billion .
the labor minister , xavier darcos , told reuters news agency that the growing proportion of elderly people in french society would mean that the cost of the pension system would drive the annual public deficit up to 100 billion euros by 2050 .
longer working life the government would like to solve the problem by raising the retirement age , which , at 60 , is unusually low compared with the rest of europe , where many countries are moving towards 67 .
france has already taken some action in this direction , by increasing to 41 the numbers of years in which contributions have to be paid in order to earn a full pension . this means that people with degrees or elaborate training , who start work later , can not expect to have contributed for 41 years by the time they 're 60 , while unqualified workers are more likely to have done so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is hoping his pension reform will not attract the kind of protest which met the 2003 reform the unions are deeply opposed to any reform .
bernard thibault , head of the cgt union , rejected the government 's figures .
" we will defend the right to retire at 60 , " he said .
he also rejected the idea that " because life expectancy is increasing , it is unavoidable that people should spend a larger part of their lives working . "
the government enters these negotiations at a difficult time .
it had hoped to put off this third reform of the pension system in seven years until after the presidential election in 2012 , but the economic crisis has intervened .
increased unemployment has led to a reduction in contributions to the system .
in addition , the french government needs to do something about its expected deficit of 8.2 percent of gross domestic product this year , caused by its attempts to boost the economy .
the government is not trusted but the voters do not trust the government to deal with the pension crisis .
in a survey conducted for the metro newspaper , only 21 percent said they trusted the government to rescue the pension system , while 69 percent said they trusted the workers themselves or their unions . in another survey , well over half opposed either increasing the pension age or increasing the number of contribution years required for a full pension .
but yet another survey shows that young people still at school or in training do indeed expect to work beyond their 60th birthday .
the government was anxious not to cause uproar .
labor minister darcos said that contribution rates should not go up .
president sarkozy said that pension levels should not go down .
that leaves only the retirement age to play with if france is to deal with its pension challenge .

in a survey conducted for the metro newspaper , only 21 percent said they trusted the government to rescue the pension system , while 69 percent said they trusted the workers themselves or their unions . in another survey , well over half opposed either increasing the pension age or increasing the number of contribution years required for a full pension .
but yet another survey shows that young people still at school or in training do indeed expect to work beyond their 60th birthday .
the government was anxious not to cause uproar .
labor minister darcos said that contribution rates should not go up .
president sarkozy said that pension levels should not go down .
that leaves only the retirement age to play with if france is to deal with its pension challenge .

norbert roettgen said he 'd stick to an agreement that would see two power plants close in coming months . german environment minister norbert roettgen has rejected calls to immediately extend the operating lifetimes of nuclear power plants .
roettgen said in a newspaper interview that he would not intervene to delay closure dates for reactors in coming months .
he told the weekly tagesspiegel am sonntag that new policy on energy plant life-spans would be decided in autumn , when the government coalition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- would discuss its energy policy .

" the operation of individual nuclear power stations will be decided on the basis of current law , " said roettgen .
he added that nuclear power was intended only to be an interim measure until demand can be met from renewable sources .
" we have defined nuclear energy as a ' bridge technology . '
the bridge ends when renewable energies can reliably replace nuclear energy . "
" when we have a goal before our eyes we can achieve it quickly , " he added .
more pragmatic approach at the same time , german economic minister rainer bruederle warned against " ideological rash reactions " and hinted at a more pragmatic approach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle said that solid facts were needed to decide on an approach the fdp minister told german weekly bild am sonntag that solid facts should shape future policy and that millions would need to be invested in renewable energy .
" if we do n't want electricity prices to go through the roof , we must build a bridge to the renewable age .
for the coalition this bridge is , along with the use of clean coal , nuclear energy . "
but , bruederle added , " one thing is clear .
nobody wants new nuclear power stations in germany . " possibility of extension while roettgen has said that plant life-spans could feasibly be expanded by eight years , his party colleagues in three states have called for a far longer stay of execution .
conservative regional environment ministers markus soeder from bavaria , tanya goeder from baden-wuerttemberg and silke lautenschlaeger from hesse advocate a further 20 years on top of roettgen 's suggestion .
the three represent german states with nuclear power plants and argue that renewable energy will not be ready to replace atomic power in time to realize roettgen 's proposal. rc / apn / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

roettgen said in a newspaper interview that he would not intervene to delay closure dates for reactors in coming months .
he told the weekly tagesspiegel am sonntag that new policy on energy plant life-spans would be decided in autumn , when the government coalition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- would discuss its energy policy .

" the operation of individual nuclear power stations will be decided on the basis of current law , " said roettgen .

" we have defined nuclear energy as a ' bridge technology . '
the bridge ends when renewable energies can reliably replace nuclear energy . "
" when we have a goal before our eyes we can achieve it quickly , " he added .

his main aim is to reach agreement on raising the pension age , but the unions are strongly opposed . french president nicolas sarkozy decided to make pension reform the main issue at his country 's third " social summit " on monday .
he and members of his government met with representatives of the unions and employers for what were expected to be difficult talks .
sarkozy said at the end of the meeting that the government would present its proposals in september .
" if we want to save our pension system , we ca n't put off the decisions , " he said .
sarkozy 's office had been at pains to lower expectations ahead of the event , saying that no decisions would be made on fundamental issues , but that the meeting would discuss " the timetable and the methods of work . "
the government said it did n't want to rush things , but " everyone knows the solutions by heart . "
during the meeting , sarkozy was reported to have added that the government did not intend to force a solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been able to push through many unpopular reforms - will he succeed on pensions ?
pension reform is a highly controversial issue .
the budget ministry estimates that the pension system will have a 10.7 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.13 billion -rrb- deficit this year out of a total public deficit of 25 billion .
the labor minister , xavier darcos , told reuters news agency that the growing proportion of elderly people in french society would mean that the cost of the pension system would drive the annual public deficit up to 100 billion euros by 2050 .
longer working life the government would like to solve the problem by raising the retirement age , which , at 60 , is unusually low compared with the rest of europe , where many countries are moving towards 67 .
france has already taken some action in this direction , by increasing to 41 the numbers of years in which contributions have to be paid in order to earn a full pension . this means that people with degrees or elaborate training , who start work later , can not expect to have contributed for 41 years by the time they 're 60 , while unqualified workers are more likely to have done so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is hoping his pension reform will not attract the kind of protest which met the 2003 reform the unions are deeply opposed to any reform .
bernard thibault , head of the cgt union , rejected the government 's figures .
" we will defend the right to retire at 60 , " he said .
he also rejected the idea that " because life expectancy is increasing , it is unavoidable that people should spend a larger part of their lives working . "
the government enters these negotiations at a difficult time .
it had hoped to put off this third reform of the pension system in seven years until after the presidential election in 2012 , but the economic crisis has intervened .
increased unemployment has led to a reduction in contributions to the system .
in addition , the french government needs to do something about its expected deficit of 8.2 percent of gross domestic product this year , caused by its attempts to boost the economy .
the government is not trusted but the voters do not trust the government to deal with the pension crisis .
in a survey conducted for the metro newspaper , only 21 percent said they trusted the government to rescue the pension system , while 69 percent said they trusted the workers themselves or their unions . in another survey , well over half opposed either increasing the pension age or increasing the number of contribution years required for a full pension .
but yet another survey shows that young people still at school or in training do indeed expect to work beyond their 60th birthday .
the government was anxious not to cause uproar .
labor minister darcos said that contribution rates should not go up .
president sarkozy said that pension levels should not go down .
that leaves only the retirement age to play with if france is to deal with its pension challenge .

norbert roettgen said he 'd stick to an agreement that would see two power plants close in coming months . german environment minister norbert roettgen has rejected calls to immediately extend the operating lifetimes of nuclear power plants .
roettgen said in a newspaper interview that he would not intervene to delay closure dates for reactors in coming months .
he told the weekly tagesspiegel am sonntag that new policy on energy plant life-spans would be decided in autumn , when the government coalition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- would discuss its energy policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen wants to adhere to existing policy in the meantime , the cdu minister said , current energy policy would dictate the fate of nuclear power stations set for closure .
plants set for closure according to present rules , the neckarwestheim power plant is set to shutdown in may .
the biblis a nuclear plant in hesse is earmarked for closure in summer .
" the operation of individual nuclear power stations will be decided on the basis of current law , " said roettgen .
he added that nuclear power was intended only to be an interim measure until demand can be met from renewable sources .
" we have defined nuclear energy as a ' bridge technology . '
the bridge ends when renewable energies can reliably replace nuclear energy . "
" when we have a goal before our eyes we can achieve it quickly , " he added .
more pragmatic approach at the same time , german economic minister rainer bruederle warned against " ideological rash reactions " and hinted at a more pragmatic approach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle said that solid facts were needed to decide on an approach the fdp minister told german weekly bild am sonntag that solid facts should shape future policy and that millions would need to be invested in renewable energy .
" if we do n't want electricity prices to go through the roof , we must build a bridge to the renewable age .
for the coalition this bridge is , along with the use of clean coal , nuclear energy . "
but , bruederle added , " one thing is clear .
nobody wants new nuclear power stations in germany . " possibility of extension while roettgen has said that plant life-spans could feasibly be expanded by eight years , his party colleagues in three states have called for a far longer stay of execution .
conservative regional environment ministers markus soeder from bavaria , tanya goeder from baden-wuerttemberg and silke lautenschlaeger from hesse advocate a further 20 years on top of roettgen 's suggestion .
the three represent german states with nuclear power plants and argue that renewable energy will not be ready to replace atomic power in time to realize roettgen 's proposal. rc / apn / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the horsetrading is well underway . the government of chancellor angela merkel has continued its push to have axel weber , the current president of the german central bank , the bundesbank , appointed as the next president of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- .
german daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported that finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was expected to push for weber 's nomination at a meeting with his counterparts from the 15 other eu countries that use the euro currency .
the finance ministers plan to name a replacement for the ecb 's current vice president , lucas papademos , at the two-day gathering starting monday .
schaeuble was expected to press for portuguese central banker vitor manuel ribeiro constancio to take over as new ecb vice president .
the appointment of a southern european to the post would be an important strategic victory for germany .
constancio 's accession to the position would make it more likely that a northern european would be appointed to the ecb 's top post .

"
weber 's main opponent for the position of ecb head is bank of italy governor mario draghi .
in an important step towards securing the top post for weber , germany looked to have gained the support of france , which is considered the unofficial leader of the southern european bloc within the central bank .
german weekly die welt am sonntag reported that paris had agreed to support weber 's candidacy in return for berlin 's support for a french representative to become the ecb 's next chief economist , a post currently held by juergen stark , a german. dfm / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the church has been seriously wounded and we are in a very serious situation .
this has done immense damage to the authority of the church as the mouthpiece of the gospel of jesus christ , and of that there is no doubt .
our business is to try to repair that damage , " bishop duffy said .
the irish crisis comes on the heels of a scandal in germany , where an elite jesuit school in berlin admitted to sexual abuse of teenagers by teachers during the 1970s and 80s .
revelations of pedophile priests also have rocked the church in recent months after similar scandals in the united states and australia .
vatican warns of ' loss of faith ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damage control is the job of pope benedict -lrb- r -rrb- and the vatican 's secretary of state , tarcisio bertone vatican secretary of state , cardinal tarcisio bertone , said on monday that the scandal could be overcome by faith . but , he warned that the loss of confidence and trust in the church was an " even more dangerous storm " and that people could " lose faith in god , through discouragement and despair . "
bishop duffy said that to restore that trust the church would be focusing on the victims .
" we will certainly be keeping the survivors at the top of the list of priorities .
i imagine hardly any bishop will fail to mention survivors as his primary concern in all of this most serious business , " he said .
anti-abuse campaigners , meanwhile , have called on pope benedict to visit ireland to meet the victims of the pedophile scandal .
christine buckley , herself an abuse survivor , said the pope had gone to the united states and australia to apologize and should do the same in ireland .
she also criticized that many of the accused irish priests had left ireland and gone to countries such as australia and america , where they continued their abuse. gb / dpa / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

news of the abuse allegations involving around 30 former pupils first surfaced in late january , when a former priest admitted that he forced boys to have sex at the elite canisius college in berlin from 1975 to 1983 .
since the revelation , many more former pupils have come forward with allegations against clerics and laymen at jesuit colleges and other catholic schools across the country .
" the number of people who have contacted me or the canisius college has risen to more than 100 , " lawyer ursula raue told german news agency dpa .
raue has been asked by the jesuits to investigate the allegations .
cases confirmed across germany the jesuits have since issued an apology , admitting they covered up abuse that had taken place at schools in berlin , hamburg , st. blasien , goettingen and hildesheim in the 1970s and 1980s .
the worldwide order also confirmed cases in spain and chile .
since the most recent of the cases happened more than 20 years ago , it 's still unclear whether or not criminal charges will be brought .
raue is working on a report on the allegations with canisius headmaster father klaus mertes and expects to send an interim report to the german headquarters of the jesuit order in munich later this week. cmk / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german-sponsored film fund aims to bring new perspectives to the big screen by financing projects from developing countries . a young woman finds a way to deal with the rape of her mother in the peruvian civil war ; a family 's life in the philippines during us occupation : these are stories not often seen in hollywood blockbusters but rather in low-budget , independent films that are not always easy to find . for over five years , the berlin-based world cinema fund has supported such independent productions from around the world , and its backing is crucial for filmmakers from countries with little film-industry aid . the 2009 peru film " la teta asustada " -lrb- " the milk of sorrow " -rrb- , a film about peru 's civil war , is one such movie .
director claudia llosa , who last year won a golden bear , the top prize awarded at the berlin film festival , tells the story of a daughter who inherits her mother 's pain and fear , and gives voice to that pain through songs sung in quechua , the language of the indigenous people of peru . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin -lrb- right -rrb- directed the film " independencia " about a family living in the us-occupied philippines " when we started the world cinema fund five years ago , there was a need to become active in countries where cinematography is not fully developed , and where there is only little money , " said berlin film festival director dieter kosslick . " it 's not that we in europe have too much money to make movies , but i think we can really share some of it , " he added . the search for authentic , local stories the fund 's recipients hail mostly from latin america , africa and the middle east , and it has helped diverse projects from countries including mexico , kyrgyzstan , indonesia and algeria .
more than 70 films , both fiction and documentary , have benefited from the world cinema fund so far .
each production receives up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 68,700 -rrb- , with additional support for distribution , including subtitles and advertising to help the films make it into german cinemas . " we feel a bit like pearl divers , " said sonja heinen , a member of the world cinema fund jury .
" we are looking for strong authentic stories originating in the region where they are going to be filmed ; they should be rooted there . " however , that does n't mean that the films must have a political storyline , she added .
the films are meant to be independent cinema , not mainstream , with innovative visual ideas , artistically sophisticated concepts and new forms of aesthetics . " films that dare to do something new , " said heinen . few strings attached bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " paradise now , " an independent film by hany abu-assad was nominated for an ooscar in 2006 money provided through the world cinema fund can be spent entirely in the country in which the film is being shot , boosting local film industries , and there are few restrictions on how the money may be spent .
filipino director raya martin , who directed the film " independencia " about the us-occupied philippines , said he appreciated the freedom . " these films wo n't be getting support from private institutions and very little from the government , " he said .
" the wcf is one of the few funders that really respect what the filmmaker wants to do . " it 's very hard to find something like the world cinema fund nowadays , he added , since a lot of the institutions that support films impose their own ideas about the country onto the production . martin said he was surprised that the world cinema fund was not better known , given that many films it has supported have gone on to receive prestigious awards and nominations .
the palestinian film " paradise now , " was nominated for an oscar , and others were screened at the cannes and venice film festivals . money always an issue but according to michael weber , who has co-produced several world cinema fund films , while festival glamour is all well and good , it 's also important that the films are financial successes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cinema fund was founded by the berlinale and the german government 's culture fund " it would be nice if i could say we 're only doing that for artistic reasons , and because there are such great directors out there , and it 's great to be a patron of the arts .
but that 's not the case , " he said . weber has sold the rights for his film , " the milk of sorrow , " to more than 30 countries , which is unusual for such a small art-house production .
films selected for partial funding by the world cinema fund are more attractive to producers as they present less of a financial risk than films without backing , weber said . nevertheless , it 's unclear how much longer the fund will be able to support productions like " the milk of sorrow , " since it currently receives most of its financial support from the german federal cultural foundation , and that support is only guaranteed until next year .
the fund is now on the lookout for new partners . " everyone who gets involved in something like this hopes of course that a little jewel that comes into existence somewhere - which no one knows about at the beginning and which the wcf supports - will become a huge success , " weber said . author : aygul cizmecioglu -lrb- ad -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his main aim is to reach agreement on raising the pension age , but the unions are strongly opposed . french president nicolas sarkozy decided to make pension reform the main issue at his country 's third " social summit " on monday .
he and members of his government met with representatives of the unions and employers for what were expected to be difficult talks .
sarkozy said at the end of the meeting that the government would present its proposals in september .
" if we want to save our pension system , we ca n't put off the decisions , " he said .
sarkozy 's office had been at pains to lower expectations ahead of the event , saying that no decisions would be made on fundamental issues , but that the meeting would discuss " the timetable and the methods of work . "
the government said it did n't want to rush things , but " everyone knows the solutions by heart . "
during the meeting , sarkozy was reported to have added that the government did not intend to force a solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been able to push through many unpopular reforms - will he succeed on pensions ?
pension reform is a highly controversial issue .
the budget ministry estimates that the pension system will have a 10.7 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.13 billion -rrb- deficit this year out of a total public deficit of 25 billion .
the labor minister , xavier darcos , told reuters news agency that the growing proportion of elderly people in french society would mean that the cost of the pension system would drive the annual public deficit up to 100 billion euros by 2050 .
longer working life the government would like to solve the problem by raising the retirement age , which , at 60 , is unusually low compared with the rest of europe , where many countries are moving towards 67 .
france has already taken some action in this direction , by increasing to 41 the numbers of years in which contributions have to be paid in order to earn a full pension . this means that people with degrees or elaborate training , who start work later , can not expect to have contributed for 41 years by the time they 're 60 , while unqualified workers are more likely to have done so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is hoping his pension reform will not attract the kind of protest which met the 2003 reform the unions are deeply opposed to any reform .
bernard thibault , head of the cgt union , rejected the government 's figures .
" we will defend the right to retire at 60 , " he said .
he also rejected the idea that " because life expectancy is increasing , it is unavoidable that people should spend a larger part of their lives working . "
the government enters these negotiations at a difficult time .
it had hoped to put off this third reform of the pension system in seven years until after the presidential election in 2012 , but the economic crisis has intervened .
increased unemployment has led to a reduction in contributions to the system .
in addition , the french government needs to do something about its expected deficit of 8.2 percent of gross domestic product this year , caused by its attempts to boost the economy .
the government is not trusted but the voters do not trust the government to deal with the pension crisis .
in a survey conducted for the metro newspaper , only 21 percent said they trusted the government to rescue the pension system , while 69 percent said they trusted the workers themselves or their unions . in another survey , well over half opposed either increasing the pension age or increasing the number of contribution years required for a full pension .
but yet another survey shows that young people still at school or in training do indeed expect to work beyond their 60th birthday .
the government was anxious not to cause uproar .
labor minister darcos said that contribution rates should not go up .
president sarkozy said that pension levels should not go down .
that leaves only the retirement age to play with if france is to deal with its pension challenge .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the 60th berlin film festival opinion : berlin film festival should drop the fluff and aim higher films from war-torn regions set somber tone at berlinale berlinale reaches climax with awards ceremony movie industry debate says hollywood is n't going anywhere film -pipe- 15.02.2010 world cinema fund gives filmmakers outside of hollywood a voice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the milk of sorrow " look at inherited suffering there 's much more to cinema than hollywood blockbusters .
a german-sponsored film fund aims to bring new perspectives to the big screen by financing projects from developing countries . a young woman finds a way to deal with the rape of her mother in the peruvian civil war ; a family 's life in the philippines during us occupation : these are stories not often seen in hollywood blockbusters but rather in low-budget , independent films that are not always easy to find . for over five years , the berlin-based world cinema fund has supported such independent productions from around the world , and its backing is crucial for filmmakers from countries with little film-industry aid . the 2009 peru film " la teta asustada " -lrb- " the milk of sorrow " -rrb- , a film about peru 's civil war , is one such movie .
director claudia llosa , who last year won a golden bear , the top prize awarded at the berlin film festival , tells the story of a daughter who inherits her mother 's pain and fear , and gives voice to that pain through songs sung in quechua , the language of the indigenous people of peru . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin -lrb- right -rrb- directed the film " independencia " about a family living in the us-occupied philippines " when we started the world cinema fund five years ago , there was a need to become active in countries where cinematography is not fully developed , and where there is only little money , " said berlin film festival director dieter kosslick . " it 's not that we in europe have too much money to make movies , but i think we can really share some of it , " he added . the search for authentic , local stories the fund 's recipients hail mostly from latin america , africa and the middle east , and it has helped diverse projects from countries including mexico , kyrgyzstan , indonesia and algeria .
more than 70 films , both fiction and documentary , have benefited from the world cinema fund so far .
each production receives up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 68,700 -rrb- , with additional support for distribution , including subtitles and advertising to help the films make it into german cinemas . " we feel a bit like pearl divers , " said sonja heinen , a member of the world cinema fund jury .
" we are looking for strong authentic stories originating in the region where they are going to be filmed ; they should be rooted there . " however , that does n't mean that the films must have a political storyline , she added .
the films are meant to be independent cinema , not mainstream , with innovative visual ideas , artistically sophisticated concepts and new forms of aesthetics . " films that dare to do something new , " said heinen . few strings attached bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " paradise now , " an independent film by hany abu-assad was nominated for an ooscar in 2006 money provided through the world cinema fund can be spent entirely in the country in which the film is being shot , boosting local film industries , and there are few restrictions on how the money may be spent .
filipino director raya martin , who directed the film " independencia " about the us-occupied philippines , said he appreciated the freedom . " these films wo n't be getting support from private institutions and very little from the government , " he said .
" the wcf is one of the few funders that really respect what the filmmaker wants to do . " it 's very hard to find something like the world cinema fund nowadays , he added , since a lot of the institutions that support films impose their own ideas about the country onto the production . martin said he was surprised that the world cinema fund was not better known , given that many films it has supported have gone on to receive prestigious awards and nominations .
the palestinian film " paradise now , " was nominated for an oscar , and others were screened at the cannes and venice film festivals . money always an issue but according to michael weber , who has co-produced several world cinema fund films , while festival glamour is all well and good , it 's also important that the films are financial successes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cinema fund was founded by the berlinale and the german government 's culture fund " it would be nice if i could say we 're only doing that for artistic reasons , and because there are such great directors out there , and it 's great to be a patron of the arts .
but that 's not the case , " he said . weber has sold the rights for his film , " the milk of sorrow , " to more than 30 countries , which is unusual for such a small art-house production .
films selected for partial funding by the world cinema fund are more attractive to producers as they present less of a financial risk than films without backing , weber said . nevertheless , it 's unclear how much longer the fund will be able to support productions like " the milk of sorrow , " since it currently receives most of its financial support from the german federal cultural foundation , and that support is only guaranteed until next year .
the fund is now on the lookout for new partners . " everyone who gets involved in something like this hopes of course that a little jewel that comes into existence somewhere - which no one knows about at the beginning and which the wcf supports - will become a huge success , " weber said . author : aygul cizmecioglu -lrb- ad -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german-sponsored film fund aims to bring new perspectives to the big screen by financing projects from developing countries . a young woman finds a way to deal with the rape of her mother in the peruvian civil war ; a family 's life in the philippines during us occupation : these are stories not often seen in hollywood blockbusters but rather in low-budget , independent films that are not always easy to find . for over five years , the berlin-based world cinema fund has supported such independent productions from around the world , and its backing is crucial for filmmakers from countries with little film-industry aid . the 2009 peru film " la teta asustada " -lrb- " the milk of sorrow " -rrb- , a film about peru 's civil war , is one such movie .
director claudia llosa , who last year won a golden bear , the top prize awarded at the berlin film festival , tells the story of a daughter who inherits her mother 's pain and fear , and gives voice to that pain through songs sung in quechua , the language of the indigenous people of peru . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin -lrb- right -rrb- directed the film " independencia " about a family living in the us-occupied philippines " when we started the world cinema fund five years ago , there was a need to become active in countries where cinematography is not fully developed , and where there is only little money , " said berlin film festival director dieter kosslick . " it 's not that we in europe have too much money to make movies , but i think we can really share some of it , " he added . the search for authentic , local stories the fund 's recipients hail mostly from latin america , africa and the middle east , and it has helped diverse projects from countries including mexico , kyrgyzstan , indonesia and algeria .
more than 70 films , both fiction and documentary , have benefited from the world cinema fund so far .
each production receives up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 68,700 -rrb- , with additional support for distribution , including subtitles and advertising to help the films make it into german cinemas . " we feel a bit like pearl divers , " said sonja heinen , a member of the world cinema fund jury .
" we are looking for strong authentic stories originating in the region where they are going to be filmed ; they should be rooted there . " however , that does n't mean that the films must have a political storyline , she added .
the films are meant to be independent cinema , not mainstream , with innovative visual ideas , artistically sophisticated concepts and new forms of aesthetics .

filipino director raya martin , who directed the film " independencia " about the us-occupied philippines , said he appreciated the freedom . " these films wo n't be getting support from private institutions and very little from the government , " he said .
" the wcf is one of the few funders that really respect what the filmmaker wants to do . " it 's very hard to find something like the world cinema fund nowadays , he added , since a lot of the institutions that support films impose their own ideas about the country onto the production . martin said he was surprised that the world cinema fund was not better known , given that many films it has supported have gone on to receive prestigious awards and nominations .
the palestinian film " paradise now , " was nominated for an oscar , and others were screened at the cannes and venice film festivals . money always an issue but according to michael weber , who has co-produced several world cinema fund films , while festival glamour is all well and good , it 's also important that the films are financial successes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cinema fund was founded by the berlinale and the german government 's culture fund " it would be nice if i could say we 're only doing that for artistic reasons , and because there are such great directors out there , and it 's great to be a patron of the arts .
but that 's not the case , " he said . weber has sold the rights for his film , " the milk of sorrow , " to more than 30 countries , which is unusual for such a small art-house production .
films selected for partial funding by the world cinema fund are more attractive to producers as they present less of a financial risk than films without backing , weber said . nevertheless , it 's unclear how much longer the fund will be able to support productions like " the milk of sorrow , " since it currently receives most of its financial support from the german federal cultural foundation , and that support is only guaranteed until next year .
the fund is now on the lookout for new partners .

news of the abuse allegations involving around 30 former pupils first surfaced in late january , when a former priest admitted that he forced boys to have sex at the elite canisius college in berlin from 1975 to 1983 .
since the revelation , many more former pupils have come forward with allegations against clerics and laymen at jesuit colleges and other catholic schools across the country .
" the number of people who have contacted me or the canisius college has risen to more than 100 , " lawyer ursula raue told german news agency dpa .
raue has been asked by the jesuits to investigate the allegations .
cases confirmed across germany the jesuits have since issued an apology , admitting they covered up abuse that had taken place at schools in berlin , hamburg , st. blasien , goettingen and hildesheim in the 1970s and 1980s .
the worldwide order also confirmed cases in spain and chile .
since the most recent of the cases happened more than 20 years ago , it 's still unclear whether or not criminal charges will be brought .
raue is working on a report on the allegations with canisius headmaster father klaus mertes and expects to send an interim report to the german headquarters of the jesuit order in munich later this week. cmk / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

news of the abuse allegations involving around 30 former pupils first surfaced in late january , when a former priest admitted that he forced boys to have sex at the elite canisius college in berlin from 1975 to 1983 .
since the revelation , many more former pupils have come forward with allegations against clerics and laymen at jesuit colleges and other catholic schools across the country .

raue has been asked by the jesuits to investigate the allegations .
cases confirmed across germany the jesuits have since issued an apology , admitting they covered up abuse that had taken place at schools in berlin , hamburg , st. blasien , goettingen and hildesheim in the 1970s and 1980s .

since the most recent of the cases happened more than 20 years ago , it 's still unclear whether or not criminal charges will be brought .

two foreign nationals were also killed in the attack , and several others are among the injured .
it is the first major attack in the country since the series of attacks on the city of mumbai in november 2008 .
police are investigating possible links to the pakistan-based terror group lashkar-e-toiba . an abandoned backpack left under a table at the crowded german bakery exploded on saturday night after it was opened by an unsuspecting waiter .
residents worried about security for the residents of pune , the attack has shaken their faith in the safety of their hometown .
donna d 'souza , a student and long-time resident of pune , says : " we always thought it was a peaceful , cosmopolitan city that was accepting of the people who come in .
example of the osho commune , where you have an influx of so many foreign nationals coming in , and there has never been anything like this that ever happened there .
so it 's really shocking .
and we are the kind of people who would also visit there often , so it could have been any of us as well . "
diversity under attack ?
the german bakery was launched in 1988 by a local businessman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bomb detonated in a crowded bakery popular with foreigners dnyaneshwar kharose along with his associate woody , a german who had come to the osho ashram in pune .
it was woody 's idea to start a bakery with an international appeal , says dnyaneshwar kharose 's daughter snehal : " foreigners specially found it difficult to find their kind of food in pune .
because osho ashram was close to our place , they started the idea of german bakery .
with that , they came up with the name german bakery , because it was mainly for foreigners .
even indians liked the pastries , cakes and juices . "
since dnyaneshwar 's death in 1999 , his wife smita kharose runs the business , helped now by her daughter snehal .
on a regular day , the german bakery is usually teeming with customers who come for german bakery 's special cakes and health snacks .
deprived now of their only source of income , the kharose family is struggling to come to terms with the tragedy .
destruction of a symbol of friendship the german bakery 's loss is also being strongly felt among its foreign fan base .
one of them is luc didon , director of the indo-french cultural centre in pune , " it 's so full of people of different origins and it 's a symbol of diversity – diversity of languages , of cultures , of thoughts of beliefs .
this is destruction not only of people , but of a symbol of friendship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nine people were killed and dozens injured yet it is this large foreign client base that seems to have made the german bakery a target , similar to the mumbai attacks on november 26 , where the terrorists chose the famous café leopold and luxury hotels frequented by foreigners .
soft target prior to the attacks , security had been tightened around the osho ashram and the jewish chabad house , based on intelligence inputs of a possible terror strike .
these were the two locations surveyed as potential targets by david coleman headley , an operative of the pakistan-based terror group lashkar-e-toiba .
but the german bakery had been considered a soft target , says union minister p chidambaram , denying that there had been an intelligence failure .
while the government has not ruled out pakistani involvement , the leading congress party has so far rejected any demands by right-wing opposition groups to put off the resumption of high-level talks with pakistan planned for next week .

donna d 'souza , a student and long-time resident of pune , says : " we always thought it was a peaceful , cosmopolitan city that was accepting of the people who come in .

so it 's really shocking .

diversity under attack ?
the german bakery was launched in 1988 by a local businessman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bomb detonated in a crowded bakery popular with foreigners dnyaneshwar kharose along with his associate woody , a german who had come to the osho ashram in pune .
it was woody 's idea to start a bakery with an international appeal , says dnyaneshwar kharose 's daughter snehal : " foreigners specially found it difficult to find their kind of food in pune .
because osho ashram was close to our place , they started the idea of german bakery .
with that , they came up with the name german bakery , because it was mainly for foreigners .
even indians liked the pastries , cakes and juices . "
since dnyaneshwar 's death in 1999 , his wife smita kharose runs the business , helped now by her daughter snehal .
on a regular day , the german bakery is usually teeming with customers who come for german bakery 's special cakes and health snacks .
deprived now of their only source of income , the kharose family is struggling to come to terms with the tragedy .
destruction of a symbol of friendship the german bakery 's loss is also being strongly felt among its foreign fan base .
one of them is luc didon , director of the indo-french cultural centre in pune , " it 's so full of people of different origins and it 's a symbol of diversity – diversity of languages , of cultures , of thoughts of beliefs .
this is destruction not only of people , but of a symbol of friendship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nine people were killed and dozens injured yet it is this large foreign client base that seems to have made the german bakery a target , similar to the mumbai attacks on november 26 , where the terrorists chose the famous café leopold and luxury hotels frequented by foreigners .
soft target prior to the attacks , security had been tightened around the osho ashram and the jewish chabad house , based on intelligence inputs of a possible terror strike .
these were the two locations surveyed as potential targets by david coleman headley , an operative of the pakistan-based terror group lashkar-e-toiba .
but the german bakery had been considered a soft target , says union minister p chidambaram , denying that there had been an intelligence failure .
while the government has not ruled out pakistani involvement , the leading congress party has so far rejected any demands by right-wing opposition groups to put off the resumption of high-level talks with pakistan planned for next week .

news of the abuse allegations involving around 30 former pupils first surfaced in late january , when a former priest admitted that he forced boys to have sex at the elite canisius college in berlin from 1975 to 1983 .
since the revelation , many more former pupils have come forward with allegations against clerics and laymen at jesuit colleges and other catholic schools across the country .
" the number of people who have contacted me or the canisius college has risen to more than 100 , " lawyer ursula raue told german news agency dpa .
raue has been asked by the jesuits to investigate the allegations .
cases confirmed across germany the jesuits have since issued an apology , admitting they covered up abuse that had taken place at schools in berlin , hamburg , st. blasien , goettingen and hildesheim in the 1970s and 1980s .
the worldwide order also confirmed cases in spain and chile .
since the most recent of the cases happened more than 20 years ago , it 's still unclear whether or not criminal charges will be brought .

news of the abuse allegations involving around 30 former pupils first surfaced in late january , when a former priest admitted that he forced boys to have sex at the elite canisius college in berlin from 1975 to 1983 .
since the revelation , many more former pupils have come forward with allegations against clerics and laymen at jesuit colleges and other catholic schools across the country .
" the number of people who have contacted me or the canisius college has risen to more than 100 , " lawyer ursula raue told german news agency dpa .
raue has been asked by the jesuits to investigate the allegations .
cases confirmed across germany the jesuits have since issued an apology , admitting they covered up abuse that had taken place at schools in berlin , hamburg , st. blasien , goettingen and hildesheim in the 1970s and 1980s .
the worldwide order also confirmed cases in spain and chile .
since the most recent of the cases happened more than 20 years ago , it 's still unclear whether or not criminal charges will be brought .
raue is working on a report on the allegations with canisius headmaster father klaus mertes and expects to send an interim report to the german headquarters of the jesuit order in munich later this week. cmk / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

norbert roettgen said he 'd stick to an agreement that would see two power plants close in coming months . german environment minister norbert roettgen has rejected calls to immediately extend the operating lifetimes of nuclear power plants .
roettgen said in a newspaper interview that he would not intervene to delay closure dates for reactors in coming months .
he told the weekly tagesspiegel am sonntag that new policy on energy plant life-spans would be decided in autumn , when the government coalition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- would discuss its energy policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen wants to adhere to existing policy in the meantime , the cdu minister said , current energy policy would dictate the fate of nuclear power stations set for closure .

the biblis a nuclear plant in hesse is earmarked for closure in summer .
" the operation of individual nuclear power stations will be decided on the basis of current law , " said roettgen .
he added that nuclear power was intended only to be an interim measure until demand can be met from renewable sources .
" we have defined nuclear energy as a ' bridge technology . '
the bridge ends when renewable energies can reliably replace nuclear energy . "
" when we have a goal before our eyes we can achieve it quickly , " he added .
more pragmatic approach at the same time , german economic minister rainer bruederle warned against " ideological rash reactions " and hinted at a more pragmatic approach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle said that solid facts were needed to decide on an approach the fdp minister told german weekly bild am sonntag that solid facts should shape future policy and that millions would need to be invested in renewable energy .
" if we do n't want electricity prices to go through the roof , we must build a bridge to the renewable age .
for the coalition this bridge is , along with the use of clean coal , nuclear energy . "
but , bruederle added , " one thing is clear .
nobody wants new nuclear power stations in germany . " possibility of extension while roettgen has said that plant life-spans could feasibly be expanded by eight years , his party colleagues in three states have called for a far longer stay of execution .
conservative regional environment ministers markus soeder from bavaria , tanya goeder from baden-wuerttemberg and silke lautenschlaeger from hesse advocate a further 20 years on top of roettgen 's suggestion .
the three represent german states with nuclear power plants and argue that renewable energy will not be ready to replace atomic power in time to realize roettgen 's proposal. rc / apn / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the 60th berlin film festival opinion : berlin film festival should drop the fluff and aim higher films from war-torn regions set somber tone at berlinale berlinale reaches climax with awards ceremony movie industry debate says hollywood is n't going anywhere film -pipe- 15.02.2010 world cinema fund gives filmmakers outside of hollywood a voice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the milk of sorrow " look at inherited suffering there 's much more to cinema than hollywood blockbusters .
a german-sponsored film fund aims to bring new perspectives to the big screen by financing projects from developing countries . a young woman finds a way to deal with the rape of her mother in the peruvian civil war ; a family 's life in the philippines during us occupation : these are stories not often seen in hollywood blockbusters but rather in low-budget , independent films that are not always easy to find . for over five years , the berlin-based world cinema fund has supported such independent productions from around the world , and its backing is crucial for filmmakers from countries with little film-industry aid . the 2009 peru film " la teta asustada " -lrb- " the milk of sorrow " -rrb- , a film about peru 's civil war , is one such movie .
director claudia llosa , who last year won a golden bear , the top prize awarded at the berlin film festival , tells the story of a daughter who inherits her mother 's pain and fear , and gives voice to that pain through songs sung in quechua , the language of the indigenous people of peru . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin -lrb- right -rrb- directed the film " independencia " about a family living in the us-occupied philippines " when we started the world cinema fund five years ago , there was a need to become active in countries where cinematography is not fully developed , and where there is only little money , " said berlin film festival director dieter kosslick . " it 's not that we in europe have too much money to make movies , but i think we can really share some of it , " he added . the search for authentic , local stories the fund 's recipients hail mostly from latin america , africa and the middle east , and it has helped diverse projects from countries including mexico , kyrgyzstan , indonesia and algeria .
more than 70 films , both fiction and documentary , have benefited from the world cinema fund so far .
each production receives up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 68,700 -rrb- , with additional support for distribution , including subtitles and advertising to help the films make it into german cinemas . " we feel a bit like pearl divers , " said sonja heinen , a member of the world cinema fund jury .
" we are looking for strong authentic stories originating in the region where they are going to be filmed ; they should be rooted there . " however , that does n't mean that the films must have a political storyline , she added .
the films are meant to be independent cinema , not mainstream , with innovative visual ideas , artistically sophisticated concepts and new forms of aesthetics . " films that dare to do something new , " said heinen . few strings attached bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " paradise now , " an independent film by hany abu-assad was nominated for an ooscar in 2006 money provided through the world cinema fund can be spent entirely in the country in which the film is being shot , boosting local film industries , and there are few restrictions on how the money may be spent .
filipino director raya martin , who directed the film " independencia " about the us-occupied philippines , said he appreciated the freedom . " these films wo n't be getting support from private institutions and very little from the government , " he said .
" the wcf is one of the few funders that really respect what the filmmaker wants to do . " it 's very hard to find something like the world cinema fund nowadays , he added , since a lot of the institutions that support films impose their own ideas about the country onto the production . martin said he was surprised that the world cinema fund was not better known , given that many films it has supported have gone on to receive prestigious awards and nominations .
the palestinian film " paradise now , " was nominated for an oscar , and others were screened at the cannes and venice film festivals . money always an issue but according to michael weber , who has co-produced several world cinema fund films , while festival glamour is all well and good , it 's also important that the films are financial successes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cinema fund was founded by the berlinale and the german government 's culture fund " it would be nice if i could say we 're only doing that for artistic reasons , and because there are such great directors out there , and it 's great to be a patron of the arts .
but that 's not the case , " he said . weber has sold the rights for his film , " the milk of sorrow , " to more than 30 countries , which is unusual for such a small art-house production .
films selected for partial funding by the world cinema fund are more attractive to producers as they present less of a financial risk than films without backing , weber said . nevertheless , it 's unclear how much longer the fund will be able to support productions like " the milk of sorrow , " since it currently receives most of its financial support from the german federal cultural foundation , and that support is only guaranteed until next year .
the fund is now on the lookout for new partners . " everyone who gets involved in something like this hopes of course that a little jewel that comes into existence somewhere - which no one knows about at the beginning and which the wcf supports - will become a huge success , " weber said . author : aygul cizmecioglu -lrb- ad -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the murphy commission report detailed a litany of abuse perpetuated by priests against more than 300 victims and strongly criticized the irish church 's handling of the situation .
four irish bishops have already resigned in the wake of the child sex abuse scandal .
in december , pope benedict expressed his " outrage , shame and profound regret " over the murphy commission 's revelations and said he would take clear measures in response to the situation .
a letter from the pontiff was expected to be published soon after his talks with the irish bishops .
church ' seriously damaged ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scandal has done ' immense damage ' , says irish bishop joseph duffy joseph duffy , the bishop of clogher in ireland , said the role of the pedophile priests had seriously damaged the church .
" the church has been seriously wounded and we are in a very serious situation .
this has done immense damage to the authority of the church as the mouthpiece of the gospel of jesus christ , and of that there is no doubt .
our business is to try to repair that damage , " bishop duffy said .
the irish crisis comes on the heels of a scandal in germany , where an elite jesuit school in berlin admitted to sexual abuse of teenagers by teachers during the 1970s and 80s .
revelations of pedophile priests also have rocked the church in recent months after similar scandals in the united states and australia .

"
bishop duffy said that to restore that trust the church would be focusing on the victims .
" we will certainly be keeping the survivors at the top of the list of priorities .
i imagine hardly any bishop will fail to mention survivors as his primary concern in all of this most serious business , " he said .
anti-abuse campaigners , meanwhile , have called on pope benedict to visit ireland to meet the victims of the pedophile scandal .
christine buckley , herself an abuse survivor , said the pope had gone to the united states and australia to apologize and should do the same in ireland .
she also criticized that many of the accused irish priests had left ireland and gone to countries such as australia and america , where they continued their abuse. gb / dpa / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the murphy commission report detailed a litany of abuse perpetuated by priests against more than 300 victims and strongly criticized the irish church 's handling of the situation .
four irish bishops have already resigned in the wake of the child sex abuse scandal .
in december , pope benedict expressed his " outrage , shame and profound regret " over the murphy commission 's revelations and said he would take clear measures in response to the situation .
a letter from the pontiff was expected to be published soon after his talks with the irish bishops .
church ' seriously damaged ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scandal has done ' immense damage ' , says irish bishop joseph duffy joseph duffy , the bishop of clogher in ireland , said the role of the pedophile priests had seriously damaged the church .
" the church has been seriously wounded and we are in a very serious situation .
this has done immense damage to the authority of the church as the mouthpiece of the gospel of jesus christ , and of that there is no doubt .
our business is to try to repair that damage , " bishop duffy said .
the irish crisis comes on the heels of a scandal in germany , where an elite jesuit school in berlin admitted to sexual abuse of teenagers by teachers during the 1970s and 80s .
revelations of pedophile priests also have rocked the church in recent months after similar scandals in the united states and australia .

"
bishop duffy said that to restore that trust the church would be focusing on the victims .
" we will certainly be keeping the survivors at the top of the list of priorities .
i imagine hardly any bishop will fail to mention survivors as his primary concern in all of this most serious business , " he said .
anti-abuse campaigners , meanwhile , have called on pope benedict to visit ireland to meet the victims of the pedophile scandal .
christine buckley , herself an abuse survivor , said the pope had gone to the united states and australia to apologize and should do the same in ireland .
she also criticized that many of the accused irish priests had left ireland and gone to countries such as australia and america , where they continued their abuse. gb / dpa / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the murphy commission report detailed a litany of abuse perpetuated by priests against more than 300 victims and strongly criticized the irish church 's handling of the situation .
four irish bishops have already resigned in the wake of the child sex abuse scandal .
in december , pope benedict expressed his " outrage , shame and profound regret " over the murphy commission 's revelations and said he would take clear measures in response to the situation .
a letter from the pontiff was expected to be published soon after his talks with the irish bishops .
church ' seriously damaged ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scandal has done ' immense damage ' , says irish bishop joseph duffy joseph duffy , the bishop of clogher in ireland , said the role of the pedophile priests had seriously damaged the church .
" the church has been seriously wounded and we are in a very serious situation .
this has done immense damage to the authority of the church as the mouthpiece of the gospel of jesus christ , and of that there is no doubt .
our business is to try to repair that damage , " bishop duffy said .
the irish crisis comes on the heels of a scandal in germany , where an elite jesuit school in berlin admitted to sexual abuse of teenagers by teachers during the 1970s and 80s .
revelations of pedophile priests also have rocked the church in recent months after similar scandals in the united states and australia .
vatican warns of ' loss of faith ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damage control is the job of pope benedict -lrb- r -rrb- and the vatican 's secretary of state , tarcisio bertone vatican secretary of state , cardinal tarcisio bertone , said on monday that the scandal could be overcome by faith . but , he warned that the loss of confidence and trust in the church was an " even more dangerous storm " and that people could " lose faith in god , through discouragement and despair . "
bishop duffy said that to restore that trust the church would be focusing on the victims .
" we will certainly be keeping the survivors at the top of the list of priorities .
i imagine hardly any bishop will fail to mention survivors as his primary concern in all of this most serious business , " he said .
anti-abuse campaigners , meanwhile , have called on pope benedict to visit ireland to meet the victims of the pedophile scandal .
christine buckley , herself an abuse survivor , said the pope had gone to the united states and australia to apologize and should do the same in ireland .
she also criticized that many of the accused irish priests had left ireland and gone to countries such as australia and america , where they continued their abuse. gb / dpa / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

roettgen said in a newspaper interview that he would not intervene to delay closure dates for reactors in coming months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the 60th berlin film festival opinion : berlin film festival should drop the fluff and aim higher films from war-torn regions set somber tone at berlinale berlinale reaches climax with awards ceremony movie industry debate says hollywood is n't going anywhere film -pipe- 15.02.2010 world cinema fund gives filmmakers outside of hollywood a voice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the milk of sorrow " look at inherited suffering there 's much more to cinema than hollywood blockbusters .
a german-sponsored film fund aims to bring new perspectives to the big screen by financing projects from developing countries . a young woman finds a way to deal with the rape of her mother in the peruvian civil war ; a family 's life in the philippines during us occupation : these are stories not often seen in hollywood blockbusters but rather in low-budget , independent films that are not always easy to find . for over five years , the berlin-based world cinema fund has supported such independent productions from around the world , and its backing is crucial for filmmakers from countries with little film-industry aid . the 2009 peru film " la teta asustada " -lrb- " the milk of sorrow " -rrb- , a film about peru 's civil war , is one such movie .
director claudia llosa , who last year won a golden bear , the top prize awarded at the berlin film festival , tells the story of a daughter who inherits her mother 's pain and fear , and gives voice to that pain through songs sung in quechua , the language of the indigenous people of peru . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin -lrb- right -rrb- directed the film " independencia " about a family living in the us-occupied philippines " when we started the world cinema fund five years ago , there was a need to become active in countries where cinematography is not fully developed , and where there is only little money , " said berlin film festival director dieter kosslick . " it 's not that we in europe have too much money to make movies , but i think we can really share some of it , " he added . the search for authentic , local stories the fund 's recipients hail mostly from latin america , africa and the middle east , and it has helped diverse projects from countries including mexico , kyrgyzstan , indonesia and algeria .
more than 70 films , both fiction and documentary , have benefited from the world cinema fund so far .
each production receives up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 68,700 -rrb- , with additional support for distribution , including subtitles and advertising to help the films make it into german cinemas . " we feel a bit like pearl divers , " said sonja heinen , a member of the world cinema fund jury .
" we are looking for strong authentic stories originating in the region where they are going to be filmed ; they should be rooted there . " however , that does n't mean that the films must have a political storyline , she added .
the films are meant to be independent cinema , not mainstream , with innovative visual ideas , artistically sophisticated concepts and new forms of aesthetics . " films that dare to do something new , " said heinen . few strings attached bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " paradise now , " an independent film by hany abu-assad was nominated for an ooscar in 2006 money provided through the world cinema fund can be spent entirely in the country in which the film is being shot , boosting local film industries , and there are few restrictions on how the money may be spent .
filipino director raya martin , who directed the film " independencia " about the us-occupied philippines , said he appreciated the freedom . " these films wo n't be getting support from private institutions and very little from the government , " he said .
" the wcf is one of the few funders that really respect what the filmmaker wants to do . " it 's very hard to find something like the world cinema fund nowadays , he added , since a lot of the institutions that support films impose their own ideas about the country onto the production . martin said he was surprised that the world cinema fund was not better known , given that many films it has supported have gone on to receive prestigious awards and nominations .
the palestinian film " paradise now , " was nominated for an oscar , and others were screened at the cannes and venice film festivals . money always an issue but according to michael weber , who has co-produced several world cinema fund films , while festival glamour is all well and good , it 's also important that the films are financial successes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cinema fund was founded by the berlinale and the german government 's culture fund " it would be nice if i could say we 're only doing that for artistic reasons , and because there are such great directors out there , and it 's great to be a patron of the arts .
but that 's not the case , " he said . weber has sold the rights for his film , " the milk of sorrow , " to more than 30 countries , which is unusual for such a small art-house production .
films selected for partial funding by the world cinema fund are more attractive to producers as they present less of a financial risk than films without backing , weber said . nevertheless , it 's unclear how much longer the fund will be able to support productions like " the milk of sorrow , " since it currently receives most of its financial support from the german federal cultural foundation , and that support is only guaranteed until next year .
the fund is now on the lookout for new partners . " everyone who gets involved in something like this hopes of course that a little jewel that comes into existence somewhere - which no one knows about at the beginning and which the wcf supports - will become a huge success , " weber said . author : aygul cizmecioglu -lrb- ad -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his main aim is to reach agreement on raising the pension age , but the unions are strongly opposed . french president nicolas sarkozy decided to make pension reform the main issue at his country 's third " social summit " on monday .
he and members of his government met with representatives of the unions and employers for what were expected to be difficult talks .
sarkozy said at the end of the meeting that the government would present its proposals in september .
" if we want to save our pension system , we ca n't put off the decisions , " he said .
sarkozy 's office had been at pains to lower expectations ahead of the event , saying that no decisions would be made on fundamental issues , but that the meeting would discuss " the timetable and the methods of work . "
the government said it did n't want to rush things , but " everyone knows the solutions by heart . "
during the meeting , sarkozy was reported to have added that the government did not intend to force a solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been able to push through many unpopular reforms - will he succeed on pensions ?
pension reform is a highly controversial issue .
the budget ministry estimates that the pension system will have a 10.7 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.13 billion -rrb- deficit this year out of a total public deficit of 25 billion .
the labor minister , xavier darcos , told reuters news agency that the growing proportion of elderly people in french society would mean that the cost of the pension system would drive the annual public deficit up to 100 billion euros by 2050 .
longer working life the government would like to solve the problem by raising the retirement age , which , at 60 , is unusually low compared with the rest of europe , where many countries are moving towards 67 .
france has already taken some action in this direction , by increasing to 41 the numbers of years in which contributions have to be paid in order to earn a full pension . this means that people with degrees or elaborate training , who start work later , can not expect to have contributed for 41 years by the time they 're 60 , while unqualified workers are more likely to have done so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is hoping his pension reform will not attract the kind of protest which met the 2003 reform the unions are deeply opposed to any reform .
bernard thibault , head of the cgt union , rejected the government 's figures .
" we will defend the right to retire at 60 , " he said .
he also rejected the idea that " because life expectancy is increasing , it is unavoidable that people should spend a larger part of their lives working . "
the government enters these negotiations at a difficult time .
it had hoped to put off this third reform of the pension system in seven years until after the presidential election in 2012 , but the economic crisis has intervened .
increased unemployment has led to a reduction in contributions to the system .
in addition , the french government needs to do something about its expected deficit of 8.2 percent of gross domestic product this year , caused by its attempts to boost the economy .
the government is not trusted but the voters do not trust the government to deal with the pension crisis .
in a survey conducted for the metro newspaper , only 21 percent said they trusted the government to rescue the pension system , while 69 percent said they trusted the workers themselves or their unions . in another survey , well over half opposed either increasing the pension age or increasing the number of contribution years required for a full pension .
but yet another survey shows that young people still at school or in training do indeed expect to work beyond their 60th birthday .
the government was anxious not to cause uproar .
labor minister darcos said that contribution rates should not go up .
president sarkozy said that pension levels should not go down .
that leaves only the retirement age to play with if france is to deal with its pension challenge .

his main aim is to reach agreement on raising the pension age , but the unions are strongly opposed . french president nicolas sarkozy decided to make pension reform the main issue at his country 's third " social summit " on monday .
he and members of his government met with representatives of the unions and employers for what were expected to be difficult talks .
sarkozy said at the end of the meeting that the government would present its proposals in september .
" if we want to save our pension system , we ca n't put off the decisions , " he said .
sarkozy 's office had been at pains to lower expectations ahead of the event , saying that no decisions would be made on fundamental issues , but that the meeting would discuss " the timetable and the methods of work . "
the government said it did n't want to rush things , but " everyone knows the solutions by heart . "
during the meeting , sarkozy was reported to have added that the government did not intend to force a solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been able to push through many unpopular reforms - will he succeed on pensions ?
pension reform is a highly controversial issue .
the budget ministry estimates that the pension system will have a 10.7 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.13 billion -rrb- deficit this year out of a total public deficit of 25 billion .
the labor minister , xavier darcos , told reuters news agency that the growing proportion of elderly people in french society would mean that the cost of the pension system would drive the annual public deficit up to 100 billion euros by 2050 .
longer working life the government would like to solve the problem by raising the retirement age , which , at 60 , is unusually low compared with the rest of europe , where many countries are moving towards 67 .
france has already taken some action in this direction , by increasing to 41 the numbers of years in which contributions have to be paid in order to earn a full pension . this means that people with degrees or elaborate training , who start work later , can not expect to have contributed for 41 years by the time they 're 60 , while unqualified workers are more likely to have done so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is hoping his pension reform will not attract the kind of protest which met the 2003 reform the unions are deeply opposed to any reform .
bernard thibault , head of the cgt union , rejected the government 's figures .
" we will defend the right to retire at 60 , " he said .
he also rejected the idea that " because life expectancy is increasing , it is unavoidable that people should spend a larger part of their lives working . "
the government enters these negotiations at a difficult time .
it had hoped to put off this third reform of the pension system in seven years until after the presidential election in 2012 , but the economic crisis has intervened .
increased unemployment has led to a reduction in contributions to the system .
in addition , the french government needs to do something about its expected deficit of 8.2 percent of gross domestic product this year , caused by its attempts to boost the economy .
the government is not trusted but the voters do not trust the government to deal with the pension crisis .
in a survey conducted for the metro newspaper , only 21 percent said they trusted the government to rescue the pension system , while 69 percent said they trusted the workers themselves or their unions . in another survey , well over half opposed either increasing the pension age or increasing the number of contribution years required for a full pension .
but yet another survey shows that young people still at school or in training do indeed expect to work beyond their 60th birthday .
the government was anxious not to cause uproar .
labor minister darcos said that contribution rates should not go up .
president sarkozy said that pension levels should not go down .
that leaves only the retirement age to play with if france is to deal with its pension challenge .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the 60th berlin film festival opinion : berlin film festival should drop the fluff and aim higher films from war-torn regions set somber tone at berlinale berlinale reaches climax with awards ceremony movie industry debate says hollywood is n't going anywhere film -pipe- 15.02.2010 world cinema fund gives filmmakers outside of hollywood a voice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the milk of sorrow " look at inherited suffering there 's much more to cinema than hollywood blockbusters .
a german-sponsored film fund aims to bring new perspectives to the big screen by financing projects from developing countries . a young woman finds a way to deal with the rape of her mother in the peruvian civil war ; a family 's life in the philippines during us occupation : these are stories not often seen in hollywood blockbusters but rather in low-budget , independent films that are not always easy to find . for over five years , the berlin-based world cinema fund has supported such independent productions from around the world , and its backing is crucial for filmmakers from countries with little film-industry aid . the 2009 peru film " la teta asustada " -lrb- " the milk of sorrow " -rrb- , a film about peru 's civil war , is one such movie .
director claudia llosa , who last year won a golden bear , the top prize awarded at the berlin film festival , tells the story of a daughter who inherits her mother 's pain and fear , and gives voice to that pain through songs sung in quechua , the language of the indigenous people of peru . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin -lrb- right -rrb- directed the film " independencia " about a family living in the us-occupied philippines " when we started the world cinema fund five years ago , there was a need to become active in countries where cinematography is not fully developed , and where there is only little money , " said berlin film festival director dieter kosslick . " it 's not that we in europe have too much money to make movies , but i think we can really share some of it , " he added . the search for authentic , local stories the fund 's recipients hail mostly from latin america , africa and the middle east , and it has helped diverse projects from countries including mexico , kyrgyzstan , indonesia and algeria .
more than 70 films , both fiction and documentary , have benefited from the world cinema fund so far .
each production receives up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 68,700 -rrb- , with additional support for distribution , including subtitles and advertising to help the films make it into german cinemas . " we feel a bit like pearl divers , " said sonja heinen , a member of the world cinema fund jury .
" we are looking for strong authentic stories originating in the region where they are going to be filmed ; they should be rooted there . " however , that does n't mean that the films must have a political storyline , she added .
the films are meant to be independent cinema , not mainstream , with innovative visual ideas , artistically sophisticated concepts and new forms of aesthetics . " films that dare to do something new , " said heinen . few strings attached bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " paradise now , " an independent film by hany abu-assad was nominated for an ooscar in 2006 money provided through the world cinema fund can be spent entirely in the country in which the film is being shot , boosting local film industries , and there are few restrictions on how the money may be spent .
filipino director raya martin , who directed the film " independencia " about the us-occupied philippines , said he appreciated the freedom . " these films wo n't be getting support from private institutions and very little from the government , " he said .
" the wcf is one of the few funders that really respect what the filmmaker wants to do . " it 's very hard to find something like the world cinema fund nowadays , he added , since a lot of the institutions that support films impose their own ideas about the country onto the production . martin said he was surprised that the world cinema fund was not better known , given that many films it has supported have gone on to receive prestigious awards and nominations .
the palestinian film " paradise now , " was nominated for an oscar , and others were screened at the cannes and venice film festivals . money always an issue but according to michael weber , who has co-produced several world cinema fund films , while festival glamour is all well and good , it 's also important that the films are financial successes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cinema fund was founded by the berlinale and the german government 's culture fund " it would be nice if i could say we 're only doing that for artistic reasons , and because there are such great directors out there , and it 's great to be a patron of the arts .
but that 's not the case , " he said . weber has sold the rights for his film , " the milk of sorrow , " to more than 30 countries , which is unusual for such a small art-house production .
films selected for partial funding by the world cinema fund are more attractive to producers as they present less of a financial risk than films without backing , weber said . nevertheless , it 's unclear how much longer the fund will be able to support productions like " the milk of sorrow , " since it currently receives most of its financial support from the german federal cultural foundation , and that support is only guaranteed until next year .
the fund is now on the lookout for new partners . " everyone who gets involved in something like this hopes of course that a little jewel that comes into existence somewhere - which no one knows about at the beginning and which the wcf supports - will become a huge success , " weber said . author : aygul cizmecioglu -lrb- ad -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more than 70 films , both fiction and documentary , have benefited from the world cinema fund so far .

a german-sponsored film fund aims to bring new perspectives to the big screen by financing projects from developing countries . a young woman finds a way to deal with the rape of her mother in the peruvian civil war ; a family 's life in the philippines during us occupation : these are stories not often seen in hollywood blockbusters but rather in low-budget , independent films that are not always easy to find . for over five years , the berlin-based world cinema fund has supported such independent productions from around the world , and its backing is crucial for filmmakers from countries with little film-industry aid . the 2009 peru film " la teta asustada " -lrb- " the milk of sorrow " -rrb- , a film about peru 's civil war , is one such movie .

a german-sponsored film fund aims to bring new perspectives to the big screen by financing projects from developing countries . a young woman finds a way to deal with the rape of her mother in the peruvian civil war ; a family 's life in the philippines during us occupation : these are stories not often seen in hollywood blockbusters but rather in low-budget , independent films that are not always easy to find . for over five years , the berlin-based world cinema fund has supported such independent productions from around the world , and its backing is crucial for filmmakers from countries with little film-industry aid . the 2009 peru film " la teta asustada " -lrb- " the milk of sorrow " -rrb- , a film about peru 's civil war , is one such movie .
director claudia llosa , who last year won a golden bear , the top prize awarded at the berlin film festival , tells the story of a daughter who inherits her mother 's pain and fear , and gives voice to that pain through songs sung in quechua , the language of the indigenous people of peru . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin -lrb- right -rrb- directed the film " independencia " about a family living in the us-occupied philippines " when we started the world cinema fund five years ago , there was a need to become active in countries where cinematography is not fully developed , and where there is only little money , " said berlin film festival director dieter kosslick . " it 's not that we in europe have too much money to make movies , but i think we can really share some of it , " he added . the search for authentic , local stories the fund 's recipients hail mostly from latin america , africa and the middle east , and it has helped diverse projects from countries including mexico , kyrgyzstan , indonesia and algeria .
more than 70 films , both fiction and documentary , have benefited from the world cinema fund so far .
each production receives up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 68,700 -rrb- , with additional support for distribution , including subtitles and advertising to help the films make it into german cinemas . " we feel a bit like pearl divers , " said sonja heinen , a member of the world cinema fund jury .
" we are looking for strong authentic stories originating in the region where they are going to be filmed ; they should be rooted there . " however , that does n't mean that the films must have a political storyline , she added .
the films are meant to be independent cinema , not mainstream , with innovative visual ideas , artistically sophisticated concepts and new forms of aesthetics . " films that dare to do something new , " said heinen . few strings attached bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " paradise now , " an independent film by hany abu-assad was nominated for an ooscar in 2006 money provided through the world cinema fund can be spent entirely in the country in which the film is being shot , boosting local film industries , and there are few restrictions on how the money may be spent .
filipino director raya martin , who directed the film " independencia " about the us-occupied philippines , said he appreciated the freedom . " these films wo n't be getting support from private institutions and very little from the government , " he said .
" the wcf is one of the few funders that really respect what the filmmaker wants to do . " it 's very hard to find something like the world cinema fund nowadays , he added , since a lot of the institutions that support films impose their own ideas about the country onto the production . martin said he was surprised that the world cinema fund was not better known , given that many films it has supported have gone on to receive prestigious awards and nominations .
the palestinian film " paradise now , " was nominated for an oscar , and others were screened at the cannes and venice film festivals . money always an issue but according to michael weber , who has co-produced several world cinema fund films , while festival glamour is all well and good , it 's also important that the films are financial successes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cinema fund was founded by the berlinale and the german government 's culture fund " it would be nice if i could say we 're only doing that for artistic reasons , and because there are such great directors out there , and it 's great to be a patron of the arts .
but that 's not the case , " he said . weber has sold the rights for his film , " the milk of sorrow , " to more than 30 countries , which is unusual for such a small art-house production .
films selected for partial funding by the world cinema fund are more attractive to producers as they present less of a financial risk than films without backing , weber said . nevertheless , it 's unclear how much longer the fund will be able to support productions like " the milk of sorrow , " since it currently receives most of its financial support from the german federal cultural foundation , and that support is only guaranteed until next year .
the fund is now on the lookout for new partners . " everyone who gets involved in something like this hopes of course that a little jewel that comes into existence somewhere - which no one knows about at the beginning and which the wcf supports - will become a huge success , " weber said . author : aygul cizmecioglu -lrb- ad -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more than 70 films , both fiction and documentary , have benefited from the world cinema fund so far .

the palestinian film " paradise now , " was nominated for an oscar , and others were screened at the cannes and venice film festivals . money always an issue but according to michael weber , who has co-produced several world cinema fund films , while festival glamour is all well and good , it 's also important that the films are financial successes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cinema fund was founded by the berlinale and the german government 's culture fund " it would be nice if i could say we 're only doing that for artistic reasons , and because there are such great directors out there , and it 's great to be a patron of the arts .
but that 's not the case , " he said . weber has sold the rights for his film , " the milk of sorrow , " to more than 30 countries , which is unusual for such a small art-house production .
films selected for partial funding by the world cinema fund are more attractive to producers as they present less of a financial risk than films without backing , weber said . nevertheless , it 's unclear how much longer the fund will be able to support productions like " the milk of sorrow , " since it currently receives most of its financial support from the german federal cultural foundation , and that support is only guaranteed until next year .

a german-sponsored film fund aims to bring new perspectives to the big screen by financing projects from developing countries . a young woman finds a way to deal with the rape of her mother in the peruvian civil war ; a family 's life in the philippines during us occupation : these are stories not often seen in hollywood blockbusters but rather in low-budget , independent films that are not always easy to find . for over five years , the berlin-based world cinema fund has supported such independent productions from around the world , and its backing is crucial for filmmakers from countries with little film-industry aid . the 2009 peru film " la teta asustada " -lrb- " the milk of sorrow " -rrb- , a film about peru 's civil war , is one such movie .
director claudia llosa , who last year won a golden bear , the top prize awarded at the berlin film festival , tells the story of a daughter who inherits her mother 's pain and fear , and gives voice to that pain through songs sung in quechua , the language of the indigenous people of peru . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin -lrb- right -rrb- directed the film " independencia " about a family living in the us-occupied philippines " when we started the world cinema fund five years ago , there was a need to become active in countries where cinematography is not fully developed , and where there is only little money , " said berlin film festival director dieter kosslick . " it 's not that we in europe have too much money to make movies , but i think we can really share some of it , " he added . the search for authentic , local stories the fund 's recipients hail mostly from latin america , africa and the middle east , and it has helped diverse projects from countries including mexico , kyrgyzstan , indonesia and algeria .
more than 70 films , both fiction and documentary , have benefited from the world cinema fund so far .
each production receives up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 68,700 -rrb- , with additional support for distribution , including subtitles and advertising to help the films make it into german cinemas . " we feel a bit like pearl divers , " said sonja heinen , a member of the world cinema fund jury .
" we are looking for strong authentic stories originating in the region where they are going to be filmed ; they should be rooted there . " however , that does n't mean that the films must have a political storyline , she added .
the films are meant to be independent cinema , not mainstream , with innovative visual ideas , artistically sophisticated concepts and new forms of aesthetics . " films that dare to do something new , " said heinen . few strings attached bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " paradise now , " an independent film by hany abu-assad was nominated for an ooscar in 2006 money provided through the world cinema fund can be spent entirely in the country in which the film is being shot , boosting local film industries , and there are few restrictions on how the money may be spent .

norbert roettgen said he 'd stick to an agreement that would see two power plants close in coming months . german environment minister norbert roettgen has rejected calls to immediately extend the operating lifetimes of nuclear power plants .
roettgen said in a newspaper interview that he would not intervene to delay closure dates for reactors in coming months .
he told the weekly tagesspiegel am sonntag that new policy on energy plant life-spans would be decided in autumn , when the government coalition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- would discuss its energy policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen wants to adhere to existing policy in the meantime , the cdu minister said , current energy policy would dictate the fate of nuclear power stations set for closure .

the biblis a nuclear plant in hesse is earmarked for closure in summer .
" the operation of individual nuclear power stations will be decided on the basis of current law , " said roettgen .
he added that nuclear power was intended only to be an interim measure until demand can be met from renewable sources .
" we have defined nuclear energy as a ' bridge technology . '
the bridge ends when renewable energies can reliably replace nuclear energy . "
" when we have a goal before our eyes we can achieve it quickly , " he added .
more pragmatic approach at the same time , german economic minister rainer bruederle warned against " ideological rash reactions " and hinted at a more pragmatic approach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle said that solid facts were needed to decide on an approach the fdp minister told german weekly bild am sonntag that solid facts should shape future policy and that millions would need to be invested in renewable energy .
" if we do n't want electricity prices to go through the roof , we must build a bridge to the renewable age .
for the coalition this bridge is , along with the use of clean coal , nuclear energy . "
but , bruederle added , " one thing is clear .
nobody wants new nuclear power stations in germany . " possibility of extension while roettgen has said that plant life-spans could feasibly be expanded by eight years , his party colleagues in three states have called for a far longer stay of execution .
conservative regional environment ministers markus soeder from bavaria , tanya goeder from baden-wuerttemberg and silke lautenschlaeger from hesse advocate a further 20 years on top of roettgen 's suggestion .
the three represent german states with nuclear power plants and argue that renewable energy will not be ready to replace atomic power in time to realize roettgen 's proposal. rc / apn / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two foreign nationals were also killed in the attack , and several others are among the injured .
it is the first major attack in the country since the series of attacks on the city of mumbai in november 2008 .
police are investigating possible links to the pakistan-based terror group lashkar-e-toiba . an abandoned backpack left under a table at the crowded german bakery exploded on saturday night after it was opened by an unsuspecting waiter .
residents worried about security for the residents of pune , the attack has shaken their faith in the safety of their hometown .
donna d 'souza , a student and long-time resident of pune , says : " we always thought it was a peaceful , cosmopolitan city that was accepting of the people who come in .
example of the osho commune , where you have an influx of so many foreign nationals coming in , and there has never been anything like this that ever happened there .
so it 's really shocking .
and we are the kind of people who would also visit there often , so it could have been any of us as well . "
diversity under attack ?
the german bakery was launched in 1988 by a local businessman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bomb detonated in a crowded bakery popular with foreigners dnyaneshwar kharose along with his associate woody , a german who had come to the osho ashram in pune .
it was woody 's idea to start a bakery with an international appeal , says dnyaneshwar kharose 's daughter snehal : " foreigners specially found it difficult to find their kind of food in pune .
because osho ashram was close to our place , they started the idea of german bakery .
with that , they came up with the name german bakery , because it was mainly for foreigners .
even indians liked the pastries , cakes and juices . "
since dnyaneshwar 's death in 1999 , his wife smita kharose runs the business , helped now by her daughter snehal .
on a regular day , the german bakery is usually teeming with customers who come for german bakery 's special cakes and health snacks .
deprived now of their only source of income , the kharose family is struggling to come to terms with the tragedy .
destruction of a symbol of friendship the german bakery 's loss is also being strongly felt among its foreign fan base .
one of them is luc didon , director of the indo-french cultural centre in pune , " it 's so full of people of different origins and it 's a symbol of diversity – diversity of languages , of cultures , of thoughts of beliefs .
this is destruction not only of people , but of a symbol of friendship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nine people were killed and dozens injured yet it is this large foreign client base that seems to have made the german bakery a target , similar to the mumbai attacks on november 26 , where the terrorists chose the famous café leopold and luxury hotels frequented by foreigners .
soft target prior to the attacks , security had been tightened around the osho ashram and the jewish chabad house , based on intelligence inputs of a possible terror strike .
these were the two locations surveyed as potential targets by david coleman headley , an operative of the pakistan-based terror group lashkar-e-toiba .
but the german bakery had been considered a soft target , says union minister p chidambaram , denying that there had been an intelligence failure .
while the government has not ruled out pakistani involvement , the leading congress party has so far rejected any demands by right-wing opposition groups to put off the resumption of high-level talks with pakistan planned for next week .

his main aim is to reach agreement on raising the pension age , but the unions are strongly opposed . french president nicolas sarkozy decided to make pension reform the main issue at his country 's third " social summit " on monday .
he and members of his government met with representatives of the unions and employers for what were expected to be difficult talks .
sarkozy said at the end of the meeting that the government would present its proposals in september .
" if we want to save our pension system , we ca n't put off the decisions , " he said .
sarkozy 's office had been at pains to lower expectations ahead of the event , saying that no decisions would be made on fundamental issues , but that the meeting would discuss " the timetable and the methods of work . "
the government said it did n't want to rush things , but " everyone knows the solutions by heart . "
during the meeting , sarkozy was reported to have added that the government did not intend to force a solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been able to push through many unpopular reforms - will he succeed on pensions ?
pension reform is a highly controversial issue .
the budget ministry estimates that the pension system will have a 10.7 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.13 billion -rrb- deficit this year out of a total public deficit of 25 billion .
the labor minister , xavier darcos , told reuters news agency that the growing proportion of elderly people in french society would mean that the cost of the pension system would drive the annual public deficit up to 100 billion euros by 2050 .
longer working life the government would like to solve the problem by raising the retirement age , which , at 60 , is unusually low compared with the rest of europe , where many countries are moving towards 67 .
france has already taken some action in this direction , by increasing to 41 the numbers of years in which contributions have to be paid in order to earn a full pension . this means that people with degrees or elaborate training , who start work later , can not expect to have contributed for 41 years by the time they 're 60 , while unqualified workers are more likely to have done so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is hoping his pension reform will not attract the kind of protest which met the 2003 reform the unions are deeply opposed to any reform .
bernard thibault , head of the cgt union , rejected the government 's figures .
" we will defend the right to retire at 60 , " he said .
he also rejected the idea that " because life expectancy is increasing , it is unavoidable that people should spend a larger part of their lives working . "
the government enters these negotiations at a difficult time .
it had hoped to put off this third reform of the pension system in seven years until after the presidential election in 2012 , but the economic crisis has intervened .
increased unemployment has led to a reduction in contributions to the system .
in addition , the french government needs to do something about its expected deficit of 8.2 percent of gross domestic product this year , caused by its attempts to boost the economy .
the government is not trusted but the voters do not trust the government to deal with the pension crisis .
in a survey conducted for the metro newspaper , only 21 percent said they trusted the government to rescue the pension system , while 69 percent said they trusted the workers themselves or their unions . in another survey , well over half opposed either increasing the pension age or increasing the number of contribution years required for a full pension .
but yet another survey shows that young people still at school or in training do indeed expect to work beyond their 60th birthday .
the government was anxious not to cause uproar .
labor minister darcos said that contribution rates should not go up .
president sarkozy said that pension levels should not go down .
that leaves only the retirement age to play with if france is to deal with its pension challenge .

more than 70 films , both fiction and documentary , have benefited from the world cinema fund so far .
each production receives up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 68,700 -rrb- , with additional support for distribution , including subtitles and advertising to help the films make it into german cinemas . " we feel a bit like pearl divers , " said sonja heinen , a member of the world cinema fund jury .

norbert roettgen said he 'd stick to an agreement that would see two power plants close in coming months . german environment minister norbert roettgen has rejected calls to immediately extend the operating lifetimes of nuclear power plants .
roettgen said in a newspaper interview that he would not intervene to delay closure dates for reactors in coming months .
he told the weekly tagesspiegel am sonntag that new policy on energy plant life-spans would be decided in autumn , when the government coalition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- would discuss its energy policy .

the biblis a nuclear plant in hesse is earmarked for closure in summer .
" the operation of individual nuclear power stations will be decided on the basis of current law , " said roettgen .
he added that nuclear power was intended only to be an interim measure until demand can be met from renewable sources .
" we have defined nuclear energy as a ' bridge technology . '
the bridge ends when renewable energies can reliably replace nuclear energy . "
" when we have a goal before our eyes we can achieve it quickly , " he added .
more pragmatic approach at the same time , german economic minister rainer bruederle warned against " ideological rash reactions " and hinted at a more pragmatic approach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle said that solid facts were needed to decide on an approach the fdp minister told german weekly bild am sonntag that solid facts should shape future policy and that millions would need to be invested in renewable energy .
" if we do n't want electricity prices to go through the roof , we must build a bridge to the renewable age .
for the coalition this bridge is , along with the use of clean coal , nuclear energy . "
but , bruederle added , " one thing is clear .
nobody wants new nuclear power stations in germany . " possibility of extension while roettgen has said that plant life-spans could feasibly be expanded by eight years , his party colleagues in three states have called for a far longer stay of execution .
conservative regional environment ministers markus soeder from bavaria , tanya goeder from baden-wuerttemberg and silke lautenschlaeger from hesse advocate a further 20 years on top of roettgen 's suggestion .
the three represent german states with nuclear power plants and argue that renewable energy will not be ready to replace atomic power in time to realize roettgen 's proposal. rc / apn / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as western troops engage in warfare in the name of freedom in iraq and afghanistan , and a prominent new report reveals worldwide democracy to be on the ebb , analysts ponder where to go from here . " for the fourth consecutive year , global declines in freedom outweighed gains in 2009 . "
such was the opening statement of a report put out by us democracy watchdog freedom house earlier last month .
entitled " freedom in the world 2010 : global erosion of freedom , " the report noted democratic decline in 40 countries in africa , latin america , the middle east and the former soviet union .
assessed for indicators including political and civil liberties , press freedom and rule of law , five countries were added to the ' not free ' list and the number of electoral democracies fell to its lowest level since 1995 .
although 16 of the 194 countries surveyed were deemed to have made progress toward greater freedom for their peoples , and despite the fact that the overall global situation has improved over the past two decades , arch puddington , director of research with freedom house described the findings as " cause for real concern . "
manifold causes speaking to deutsche welle , he said last year 's democratic slow-down was more pronounced than in the three before , a finding he attributed to a wide variety of factors .
bildunterschrift : street protests in iran in summer 2009 following presidential elections " one is an increasing aggressiveness and self-assuredness on the part of some of the leading authoritarian countries - china , russia , iran , venezuela , zimbabwe - which then serve as models for other countries , " puddington said .
among the other issues at work are reactions to some of the democracy gains - such as the orange revolution - of the last decade , cynicism brought on by unfulfilled hopes of prospering in a fair society and initiatives to smother and suppress the growing confidence of civil societies .
democracy by degree but some experts argue that things are not quite as bad as the picture painted by the freedom house report .
michael efler , national spokesperson for german pro-democracy group mehr demokratie , says it 's a matter of perception .
" you have to ask what democracy is , " efler told deutsche welle .
" the liberal western approach taken by freedom house focuses on elections .
so if a country stages a fair ballot it is considered a democracy , but i think that is a limited way of doing things . "
he said that while elections are clearly crucial , it is also important to realize that the western understanding of democracy and human rights is not shared the world over .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein toppling was meant as a symbol for democracy in iraq illustrating his case with the omnipresent examples of iraq and afghanistan , efler said " society is structured differently and individual freedom does n't play anything like as important a role as it does for us . "
which begs the question , do people really want democracy ? " i wish it were a value to which everybody aspired but i do n't think that 's the way it is , " efler said .
" and it 's futile to try and force democracy on people because it wo n't work . "
too poor to consider democracy humphrey hawksley is author of the recently published " democracy kills : what 's so good about having the vote ? "
he told deutsche welle that for about one sixth of the world 's population democracy is not even a flicker on the radar .
" there are a billion or so people in a state of need , they want shelter , security from tribal wars , they want to be able to feed their children and get medicines for the sick , and they do n't have that .
so democracy as such does n't really factor in for them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food first , democracy later and although the need for those very basic life essentials may be conceptually tied to the image of a fair society with an elected democracy , hawksley said the carrot that generally gets voters to the ballot box is not hope for a brighter future , but a chance to oust an existing government .
" that 's the stock argument , " he said .
" but what 's the point of doing that if your hospital is still a mess , if your road is still a mess , if your infant mortality levels are still enormously high ?
what is the point of going through all that rigmarole if at the end of the day it does n't deliver anything to the citizens who cast the vote ? "
that , he says , is the question countries should be asking themselves if they want to create smooth civilized societies .
the question is the answer .
democracy vs. good governance but arch puddington would say there is more to it than that .
he believes the impetus has to come from outside , from the west .
" i think what you have to do is to try to educate people , let them know that large democratic societies are also prosperous societies , so they have the prosperity and they have the freedom . "
for his part , michael efler stresses the importance of creating a public platform for oppressed societies , and meeting with anti-regime activists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say former us president george bush poisoned the word democracy hawksley though , goes a couple of steps further .
he suggests replacing the word democracy , by now intrinsically linked to an ideological form of government opposed by countries such as russia and china , and replacing it with something along the lines of " good governance . "
" if you got together with the un and said ' we want to give these people in this african country good governance and we want to build them schools and so on , ' then you would take away the friction that many places see as the west trying to export their own ideology in order to get business contracts . "
but whether the power of semantics could convince the powers that be is an experiment still waiting to be tried out .

as western troops engage in warfare in the name of freedom in iraq and afghanistan , and a prominent new report reveals worldwide democracy to be on the ebb , analysts ponder where to go from here . " for the fourth consecutive year , global declines in freedom outweighed gains in 2009 . "
such was the opening statement of a report put out by us democracy watchdog freedom house earlier last month .
entitled " freedom in the world 2010 : global erosion of freedom , " the report noted democratic decline in 40 countries in africa , latin america , the middle east and the former soviet union .
assessed for indicators including political and civil liberties , press freedom and rule of law , five countries were added to the ' not free ' list and the number of electoral democracies fell to its lowest level since 1995 .
although 16 of the 194 countries surveyed were deemed to have made progress toward greater freedom for their peoples , and despite the fact that the overall global situation has improved over the past two decades , arch puddington , director of research with freedom house described the findings as " cause for real concern . "
manifold causes speaking to deutsche welle , he said last year 's democratic slow-down was more pronounced than in the three before , a finding he attributed to a wide variety of factors .
bildunterschrift : street protests in iran in summer 2009 following presidential elections " one is an increasing aggressiveness and self-assuredness on the part of some of the leading authoritarian countries - china , russia , iran , venezuela , zimbabwe - which then serve as models for other countries , " puddington said .
among the other issues at work are reactions to some of the democracy gains - such as the orange revolution - of the last decade , cynicism brought on by unfulfilled hopes of prospering in a fair society and initiatives to smother and suppress the growing confidence of civil societies .
democracy by degree but some experts argue that things are not quite as bad as the picture painted by the freedom house report .
michael efler , national spokesperson for german pro-democracy group mehr demokratie , says it 's a matter of perception .
" you have to ask what democracy is , " efler told deutsche welle .
" the liberal western approach taken by freedom house focuses on elections .
so if a country stages a fair ballot it is considered a democracy , but i think that is a limited way of doing things . "
he said that while elections are clearly crucial , it is also important to realize that the western understanding of democracy and human rights is not shared the world over .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein toppling was meant as a symbol for democracy in iraq illustrating his case with the omnipresent examples of iraq and afghanistan , efler said " society is structured differently and individual freedom does n't play anything like as important a role as it does for us . "
which begs the question , do people really want democracy ? " i wish it were a value to which everybody aspired but i do n't think that 's the way it is , " efler said .
" and it 's futile to try and force democracy on people because it wo n't work . "
too poor to consider democracy humphrey hawksley is author of the recently published " democracy kills : what 's so good about having the vote ? "
he told deutsche welle that for about one sixth of the world 's population democracy is not even a flicker on the radar .
" there are a billion or so people in a state of need , they want shelter , security from tribal wars , they want to be able to feed their children and get medicines for the sick , and they do n't have that .
so democracy as such does n't really factor in for them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food first , democracy later and although the need for those very basic life essentials may be conceptually tied to the image of a fair society with an elected democracy , hawksley said the carrot that generally gets voters to the ballot box is not hope for a brighter future , but a chance to oust an existing government .
" that 's the stock argument , " he said .
" but what 's the point of doing that if your hospital is still a mess , if your road is still a mess , if your infant mortality levels are still enormously high ?
what is the point of going through all that rigmarole if at the end of the day it does n't deliver anything to the citizens who cast the vote ? "
that , he says , is the question countries should be asking themselves if they want to create smooth civilized societies .
the question is the answer .
democracy vs. good governance but arch puddington would say there is more to it than that .
he believes the impetus has to come from outside , from the west .

at the weekend , one of the most eagerly awaited asian stars stopped in berlin : bollywood hero shah rukh khan . ever since german television started showing his movies , the indian actor has countless fans in germany - who already turned out in large crowds at his first berlinale appearance two years ago .
and this time was n't any different .
there 's something special about the relationship between shah rukh khan and his german fans , the actor confessed : " i love all the guys , the men , they are very sweet … but honestly speaking – i can not lie when i 'm in germany – and normally i 'm very honest : i love the girls !
they 're beautiful , i think ... ”
his screaming female fans definitely felt the same for him .
“ i 'm so happy i see shahrukh , that 's my dream , he 's charming , he 's sexy … ” , one said .
shah rukh khan would n't contradict them on this .
“ i just keep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood actor shah rukh khan charms the camera getting better-looking every year … i ca n't control it , ” he quipped .
controversial movie but the " king of bollywood " had n't just come for flirting , he also brought a movie to the berlinale .
tickets for all viewings of his film “ my name is khan ” were sold out within minutes , being as the film is not due to come out officially in germany until spring , many had queued up for hours in the cold to get one .
the story features a muslim with asperger syndrome who faces anti-muslim prejudices in the united states after 9/11 .
misunderstandings , says khan , have also led to him and eventually the movie being embroiled in a controversy in india .
shah rukh khan had expressed his frustration that pakistani cricket players were denied the chance to play in the indian league , and called pakistan a “ great neighbor ” .
after that , right-wing hindu groups called for a boycott of his film and attacked theaters in india .

norbert roettgen said he 'd stick to an agreement that would see two power plants close in coming months . german environment minister norbert roettgen has rejected calls to immediately extend the operating lifetimes of nuclear power plants .
roettgen said in a newspaper interview that he would not intervene to delay closure dates for reactors in coming months .
he told the weekly tagesspiegel am sonntag that new policy on energy plant life-spans would be decided in autumn , when the government coalition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- would discuss its energy policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen wants to adhere to existing policy in the meantime , the cdu minister said , current energy policy would dictate the fate of nuclear power stations set for closure .
plants set for closure according to present rules , the neckarwestheim power plant is set to shutdown in may .
the biblis a nuclear plant in hesse is earmarked for closure in summer .
" the operation of individual nuclear power stations will be decided on the basis of current law , " said roettgen .
he added that nuclear power was intended only to be an interim measure until demand can be met from renewable sources .
" we have defined nuclear energy as a ' bridge technology . '
the bridge ends when renewable energies can reliably replace nuclear energy . "
" when we have a goal before our eyes we can achieve it quickly , " he added .
more pragmatic approach at the same time , german economic minister rainer bruederle warned against " ideological rash reactions " and hinted at a more pragmatic approach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle said that solid facts were needed to decide on an approach the fdp minister told german weekly bild am sonntag that solid facts should shape future policy and that millions would need to be invested in renewable energy .
" if we do n't want electricity prices to go through the roof , we must build a bridge to the renewable age .
for the coalition this bridge is , along with the use of clean coal , nuclear energy . "
but , bruederle added , " one thing is clear .
nobody wants new nuclear power stations in germany . " possibility of extension while roettgen has said that plant life-spans could feasibly be expanded by eight years , his party colleagues in three states have called for a far longer stay of execution .
conservative regional environment ministers markus soeder from bavaria , tanya goeder from baden-wuerttemberg and silke lautenschlaeger from hesse advocate a further 20 years on top of roettgen 's suggestion .
the three represent german states with nuclear power plants and argue that renewable energy will not be ready to replace atomic power in time to realize roettgen 's proposal. rc / apn / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in light of growing criticism , tehran claims that the review is being used as a political tool against it by the west . the united nations is investigating iran 's record on human rights as the country comes under growing pressure over the issue .
a review was getting underway on monday as part of a un mechanism intended to hold all member states accountable on a range of rights issues .
the investigation is beginning as european countries , the united states and human rights groups accuse iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's regime of increasingly using mass arrests and detention as a weapon against dissent .
review and debate by the 47 nations that are members of the un human rights council are to include submissions from individual countries and un human rights bodies .
allegations of torture non-governmental organizations will also have an opportunity to have their say on the allegations , which include torture , staging show trials , politically motivated executions and media censorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government of mahmoud ahmadinejad is accused of numerous violations in a report to the council , iran complained that criticism of its record was politically motivated .
" the iranian society is a successful model of brotherly and peaceful coexistence , " it said .
" iran 's human rights situation has consistently been used as a political tool to apply pressure and to advance certain ulterior political motives of specific western countries . "
china and russia to take part all un member states must submit to a review of their record every four years .
the human rights council only has the power to draw up recommendations .
china and russia were due to take part in monday 's debate .
human rights group amnesty international has urged countries to hold iran to account rather than siding with it against the west .
" the iranian authorities seem to have lost touch with reality or are unwilling to acknowledge it , " said amnesty 's deputy middle east director hassiba hadj sahraoui .
" complacency or misplaced solidarity with iran should not stand in the way of demands for iran to fulfill its human rights obligations , " she added .
amnesty listed further human rights infringements on the part of iran as being the abuse of women 's rights , discrimination against minorities and interference with the country 's judiciary .

his main aim is to reach agreement on raising the pension age , but the unions are strongly opposed . french president nicolas sarkozy decided to make pension reform the main issue at his country 's third " social summit " on monday .
he and members of his government met with representatives of the unions and employers for what were expected to be difficult talks .
sarkozy said at the end of the meeting that the government would present its proposals in september .
" if we want to save our pension system , we ca n't put off the decisions , " he said .
sarkozy 's office had been at pains to lower expectations ahead of the event , saying that no decisions would be made on fundamental issues , but that the meeting would discuss " the timetable and the methods of work . "
the government said it did n't want to rush things , but " everyone knows the solutions by heart . "
during the meeting , sarkozy was reported to have added that the government did not intend to force a solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been able to push through many unpopular reforms - will he succeed on pensions ?
pension reform is a highly controversial issue .
the budget ministry estimates that the pension system will have a 10.7 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.13 billion -rrb- deficit this year out of a total public deficit of 25 billion .
the labor minister , xavier darcos , told reuters news agency that the growing proportion of elderly people in french society would mean that the cost of the pension system would drive the annual public deficit up to 100 billion euros by 2050 .
longer working life the government would like to solve the problem by raising the retirement age , which , at 60 , is unusually low compared with the rest of europe , where many countries are moving towards 67 .
france has already taken some action in this direction , by increasing to 41 the numbers of years in which contributions have to be paid in order to earn a full pension . this means that people with degrees or elaborate training , who start work later , can not expect to have contributed for 41 years by the time they 're 60 , while unqualified workers are more likely to have done so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is hoping his pension reform will not attract the kind of protest which met the 2003 reform the unions are deeply opposed to any reform .
bernard thibault , head of the cgt union , rejected the government 's figures .
" we will defend the right to retire at 60 , " he said .
he also rejected the idea that " because life expectancy is increasing , it is unavoidable that people should spend a larger part of their lives working . "
the government enters these negotiations at a difficult time .
it had hoped to put off this third reform of the pension system in seven years until after the presidential election in 2012 , but the economic crisis has intervened .
increased unemployment has led to a reduction in contributions to the system .
in addition , the french government needs to do something about its expected deficit of 8.2 percent of gross domestic product this year , caused by its attempts to boost the economy .
the government is not trusted but the voters do not trust the government to deal with the pension crisis .
in a survey conducted for the metro newspaper , only 21 percent said they trusted the government to rescue the pension system , while 69 percent said they trusted the workers themselves or their unions . in another survey , well over half opposed either increasing the pension age or increasing the number of contribution years required for a full pension .
but yet another survey shows that young people still at school or in training do indeed expect to work beyond their 60th birthday .
the government was anxious not to cause uproar .
labor minister darcos said that contribution rates should not go up .
president sarkozy said that pension levels should not go down .
that leaves only the retirement age to play with if france is to deal with its pension challenge .

his main aim is to reach agreement on raising the pension age , but the unions are strongly opposed . french president nicolas sarkozy decided to make pension reform the main issue at his country 's third " social summit " on monday .
he and members of his government met with representatives of the unions and employers for what were expected to be difficult talks .
sarkozy said at the end of the meeting that the government would present its proposals in september .
" if we want to save our pension system , we ca n't put off the decisions , " he said .
sarkozy 's office had been at pains to lower expectations ahead of the event , saying that no decisions would be made on fundamental issues , but that the meeting would discuss " the timetable and the methods of work . "
the government said it did n't want to rush things , but " everyone knows the solutions by heart . "
during the meeting , sarkozy was reported to have added that the government did not intend to force a solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been able to push through many unpopular reforms - will he succeed on pensions ?
pension reform is a highly controversial issue .
the budget ministry estimates that the pension system will have a 10.7 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.13 billion -rrb- deficit this year out of a total public deficit of 25 billion .
the labor minister , xavier darcos , told reuters news agency that the growing proportion of elderly people in french society would mean that the cost of the pension system would drive the annual public deficit up to 100 billion euros by 2050 .
longer working life the government would like to solve the problem by raising the retirement age , which , at 60 , is unusually low compared with the rest of europe , where many countries are moving towards 67 .
france has already taken some action in this direction , by increasing to 41 the numbers of years in which contributions have to be paid in order to earn a full pension . this means that people with degrees or elaborate training , who start work later , can not expect to have contributed for 41 years by the time they 're 60 , while unqualified workers are more likely to have done so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is hoping his pension reform will not attract the kind of protest which met the 2003 reform the unions are deeply opposed to any reform .
bernard thibault , head of the cgt union , rejected the government 's figures .
" we will defend the right to retire at 60 , " he said .
he also rejected the idea that " because life expectancy is increasing , it is unavoidable that people should spend a larger part of their lives working . "
the government enters these negotiations at a difficult time .
it had hoped to put off this third reform of the pension system in seven years until after the presidential election in 2012 , but the economic crisis has intervened .
increased unemployment has led to a reduction in contributions to the system .
in addition , the french government needs to do something about its expected deficit of 8.2 percent of gross domestic product this year , caused by its attempts to boost the economy .
the government is not trusted but the voters do not trust the government to deal with the pension crisis .
in a survey conducted for the metro newspaper , only 21 percent said they trusted the government to rescue the pension system , while 69 percent said they trusted the workers themselves or their unions . in another survey , well over half opposed either increasing the pension age or increasing the number of contribution years required for a full pension .
but yet another survey shows that young people still at school or in training do indeed expect to work beyond their 60th birthday .
the government was anxious not to cause uproar .
labor minister darcos said that contribution rates should not go up .
president sarkozy said that pension levels should not go down .
that leaves only the retirement age to play with if france is to deal with its pension challenge .

the murphy commission report detailed a litany of abuse perpetuated by priests against more than 300 victims and strongly criticized the irish church 's handling of the situation .
four irish bishops have already resigned in the wake of the child sex abuse scandal .
in december , pope benedict expressed his " outrage , shame and profound regret " over the murphy commission 's revelations and said he would take clear measures in response to the situation .
a letter from the pontiff was expected to be published soon after his talks with the irish bishops .
church ' seriously damaged ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scandal has done ' immense damage ' , says irish bishop joseph duffy joseph duffy , the bishop of clogher in ireland , said the role of the pedophile priests had seriously damaged the church .
" the church has been seriously wounded and we are in a very serious situation .
this has done immense damage to the authority of the church as the mouthpiece of the gospel of jesus christ , and of that there is no doubt .
our business is to try to repair that damage , " bishop duffy said .
the irish crisis comes on the heels of a scandal in germany , where an elite jesuit school in berlin admitted to sexual abuse of teenagers by teachers during the 1970s and 80s .
revelations of pedophile priests also have rocked the church in recent months after similar scandals in the united states and australia .

"
bishop duffy said that to restore that trust the church would be focusing on the victims .
" we will certainly be keeping the survivors at the top of the list of priorities .
i imagine hardly any bishop will fail to mention survivors as his primary concern in all of this most serious business , " he said .
anti-abuse campaigners , meanwhile , have called on pope benedict to visit ireland to meet the victims of the pedophile scandal .
christine buckley , herself an abuse survivor , said the pope had gone to the united states and australia to apologize and should do the same in ireland .
she also criticized that many of the accused irish priests had left ireland and gone to countries such as australia and america , where they continued their abuse. gb / dpa / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the murphy commission report detailed a litany of abuse perpetuated by priests against more than 300 victims and strongly criticized the irish church 's handling of the situation .
four irish bishops have already resigned in the wake of the child sex abuse scandal .

a letter from the pontiff was expected to be published soon after his talks with the irish bishops .
church ' seriously damaged ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scandal has done ' immense damage ' , says irish bishop joseph duffy joseph duffy , the bishop of clogher in ireland , said the role of the pedophile priests had seriously damaged the church .

the irish crisis comes on the heels of a scandal in germany , where an elite jesuit school in berlin admitted to sexual abuse of teenagers by teachers during the 1970s and 80s .
revelations of pedophile priests also have rocked the church in recent months after similar scandals in the united states and australia .

at the weekend , one of the most eagerly awaited asian stars stopped in berlin : bollywood hero shah rukh khan . ever since german television started showing his movies , the indian actor has countless fans in germany - who already turned out in large crowds at his first berlinale appearance two years ago .
and this time was n't any different .
there 's something special about the relationship between shah rukh khan and his german fans , the actor confessed : " i love all the guys , the men , they are very sweet … but honestly speaking – i can not lie when i 'm in germany – and normally i 'm very honest : i love the girls !
they 're beautiful , i think ... ”
his screaming female fans definitely felt the same for him .
“ i 'm so happy i see shahrukh , that 's my dream , he 's charming , he 's sexy … ” , one said .
shah rukh khan would n't contradict them on this .
“ i just keep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood actor shah rukh khan charms the camera getting better-looking every year … i ca n't control it , ” he quipped .
controversial movie but the " king of bollywood " had n't just come for flirting , he also brought a movie to the berlinale .
tickets for all viewings of his film “ my name is khan ” were sold out within minutes , being as the film is not due to come out officially in germany until spring , many had queued up for hours in the cold to get one .
the story features a muslim with asperger syndrome who faces anti-muslim prejudices in the united states after 9/11 .
misunderstandings , says khan , have also led to him and eventually the movie being embroiled in a controversy in india .
shah rukh khan had expressed his frustration that pakistani cricket players were denied the chance to play in the indian league , and called pakistan a “ great neighbor ” .
after that , right-wing hindu groups called for a boycott of his film and attacked theaters in india .
many cinema owners got scared and did not show the movie when it was released on friday .
tension on the wane in india in berlin , khan said : " i get very disturbed and scared and emotionally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite difficulties , shah rukh khan still smiling at the 60th berlinale hurt over things like this happening .
and i have no problems meeting up anyone , having a chat with them , saying : listen , it 's just a film !
enjoy yourself , have a good laugh , and have fun !
and i hope that happens , insha 'allah , by the time i get back it should be sorted out ! ”
in india , the movie has done well over the weekend , as more and more cinemas started screening it .
interestingly , it has also become the largest bollywood weekend grosser in the united states , where the story is set , earning almost 1.9 million us dollars and attracting positive reviews .

a german-sponsored film fund aims to bring new perspectives to the big screen by financing projects from developing countries . a young woman finds a way to deal with the rape of her mother in the peruvian civil war ; a family 's life in the philippines during us occupation : these are stories not often seen in hollywood blockbusters but rather in low-budget , independent films that are not always easy to find . for over five years , the berlin-based world cinema fund has supported such independent productions from around the world , and its backing is crucial for filmmakers from countries with little film-industry aid . the 2009 peru film " la teta asustada " -lrb- " the milk of sorrow " -rrb- , a film about peru 's civil war , is one such movie .
director claudia llosa , who last year won a golden bear , the top prize awarded at the berlin film festival , tells the story of a daughter who inherits her mother 's pain and fear , and gives voice to that pain through songs sung in quechua , the language of the indigenous people of peru . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin -lrb- right -rrb- directed the film " independencia " about a family living in the us-occupied philippines " when we started the world cinema fund five years ago , there was a need to become active in countries where cinematography is not fully developed , and where there is only little money , " said berlin film festival director dieter kosslick . " it 's not that we in europe have too much money to make movies , but i think we can really share some of it , " he added . the search for authentic , local stories the fund 's recipients hail mostly from latin america , africa and the middle east , and it has helped diverse projects from countries including mexico , kyrgyzstan , indonesia and algeria .
more than 70 films , both fiction and documentary , have benefited from the world cinema fund so far .
each production receives up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 68,700 -rrb- , with additional support for distribution , including subtitles and advertising to help the films make it into german cinemas . " we feel a bit like pearl divers , " said sonja heinen , a member of the world cinema fund jury .
" we are looking for strong authentic stories originating in the region where they are going to be filmed ; they should be rooted there . " however , that does n't mean that the films must have a political storyline , she added .
the films are meant to be independent cinema , not mainstream , with innovative visual ideas , artistically sophisticated concepts and new forms of aesthetics .

filipino director raya martin , who directed the film " independencia " about the us-occupied philippines , said he appreciated the freedom . " these films wo n't be getting support from private institutions and very little from the government , " he said .
" the wcf is one of the few funders that really respect what the filmmaker wants to do . " it 's very hard to find something like the world cinema fund nowadays , he added , since a lot of the institutions that support films impose their own ideas about the country onto the production . martin said he was surprised that the world cinema fund was not better known , given that many films it has supported have gone on to receive prestigious awards and nominations .
the palestinian film " paradise now , " was nominated for an oscar , and others were screened at the cannes and venice film festivals . money always an issue but according to michael weber , who has co-produced several world cinema fund films , while festival glamour is all well and good , it 's also important that the films are financial successes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cinema fund was founded by the berlinale and the german government 's culture fund " it would be nice if i could say we 're only doing that for artistic reasons , and because there are such great directors out there , and it 's great to be a patron of the arts .
but that 's not the case , " he said . weber has sold the rights for his film , " the milk of sorrow , " to more than 30 countries , which is unusual for such a small art-house production .
films selected for partial funding by the world cinema fund are more attractive to producers as they present less of a financial risk than films without backing , weber said . nevertheless , it 's unclear how much longer the fund will be able to support productions like " the milk of sorrow , " since it currently receives most of its financial support from the german federal cultural foundation , and that support is only guaranteed until next year .
the fund is now on the lookout for new partners .

two foreign nationals were also killed in the attack , and several others are among the injured .
it is the first major attack in the country since the series of attacks on the city of mumbai in november 2008 .
police are investigating possible links to the pakistan-based terror group lashkar-e-toiba . an abandoned backpack left under a table at the crowded german bakery exploded on saturday night after it was opened by an unsuspecting waiter .
residents worried about security for the residents of pune , the attack has shaken their faith in the safety of their hometown .
donna d 'souza , a student and long-time resident of pune , says : " we always thought it was a peaceful , cosmopolitan city that was accepting of the people who come in .
example of the osho commune , where you have an influx of so many foreign nationals coming in , and there has never been anything like this that ever happened there .
so it 's really shocking .
and we are the kind of people who would also visit there often , so it could have been any of us as well . "
diversity under attack ?
the german bakery was launched in 1988 by a local businessman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bomb detonated in a crowded bakery popular with foreigners dnyaneshwar kharose along with his associate woody , a german who had come to the osho ashram in pune .
it was woody 's idea to start a bakery with an international appeal , says dnyaneshwar kharose 's daughter snehal : " foreigners specially found it difficult to find their kind of food in pune .
because osho ashram was close to our place , they started the idea of german bakery .
with that , they came up with the name german bakery , because it was mainly for foreigners .
even indians liked the pastries , cakes and juices . "
since dnyaneshwar 's death in 1999 , his wife smita kharose runs the business , helped now by her daughter snehal .
on a regular day , the german bakery is usually teeming with customers who come for german bakery 's special cakes and health snacks .
deprived now of their only source of income , the kharose family is struggling to come to terms with the tragedy .
destruction of a symbol of friendship the german bakery 's loss is also being strongly felt among its foreign fan base .
one of them is luc didon , director of the indo-french cultural centre in pune , " it 's so full of people of different origins and it 's a symbol of diversity – diversity of languages , of cultures , of thoughts of beliefs .
this is destruction not only of people , but of a symbol of friendship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nine people were killed and dozens injured yet it is this large foreign client base that seems to have made the german bakery a target , similar to the mumbai attacks on november 26 , where the terrorists chose the famous café leopold and luxury hotels frequented by foreigners .
soft target prior to the attacks , security had been tightened around the osho ashram and the jewish chabad house , based on intelligence inputs of a possible terror strike .
these were the two locations surveyed as potential targets by david coleman headley , an operative of the pakistan-based terror group lashkar-e-toiba .
but the german bakery had been considered a soft target , says union minister p chidambaram , denying that there had been an intelligence failure .
while the government has not ruled out pakistani involvement , the leading congress party has so far rejected any demands by right-wing opposition groups to put off the resumption of high-level talks with pakistan planned for next week .

a german-sponsored film fund aims to bring new perspectives to the big screen by financing projects from developing countries . a young woman finds a way to deal with the rape of her mother in the peruvian civil war ; a family 's life in the philippines during us occupation : these are stories not often seen in hollywood blockbusters but rather in low-budget , independent films that are not always easy to find . for over five years , the berlin-based world cinema fund has supported such independent productions from around the world , and its backing is crucial for filmmakers from countries with little film-industry aid . the 2009 peru film " la teta asustada " -lrb- " the milk of sorrow " -rrb- , a film about peru 's civil war , is one such movie .
director claudia llosa , who last year won a golden bear , the top prize awarded at the berlin film festival , tells the story of a daughter who inherits her mother 's pain and fear , and gives voice to that pain through songs sung in quechua , the language of the indigenous people of peru . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin -lrb- right -rrb- directed the film " independencia " about a family living in the us-occupied philippines " when we started the world cinema fund five years ago , there was a need to become active in countries where cinematography is not fully developed , and where there is only little money , " said berlin film festival director dieter kosslick . " it 's not that we in europe have too much money to make movies , but i think we can really share some of it , " he added . the search for authentic , local stories the fund 's recipients hail mostly from latin america , africa and the middle east , and it has helped diverse projects from countries including mexico , kyrgyzstan , indonesia and algeria .
more than 70 films , both fiction and documentary , have benefited from the world cinema fund so far .
each production receives up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 68,700 -rrb- , with additional support for distribution , including subtitles and advertising to help the films make it into german cinemas . " we feel a bit like pearl divers , " said sonja heinen , a member of the world cinema fund jury .
" we are looking for strong authentic stories originating in the region where they are going to be filmed ; they should be rooted there . " however , that does n't mean that the films must have a political storyline , she added .
the films are meant to be independent cinema , not mainstream , with innovative visual ideas , artistically sophisticated concepts and new forms of aesthetics . " films that dare to do something new , " said heinen . few strings attached bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " paradise now , " an independent film by hany abu-assad was nominated for an ooscar in 2006 money provided through the world cinema fund can be spent entirely in the country in which the film is being shot , boosting local film industries , and there are few restrictions on how the money may be spent .
filipino director raya martin , who directed the film " independencia " about the us-occupied philippines , said he appreciated the freedom . " these films wo n't be getting support from private institutions and very little from the government , " he said .
" the wcf is one of the few funders that really respect what the filmmaker wants to do .

the german bakery was launched in 1988 by a local businessman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bomb detonated in a crowded bakery popular with foreigners dnyaneshwar kharose along with his associate woody , a german who had come to the osho ashram in pune .
it was woody 's idea to start a bakery with an international appeal , says dnyaneshwar kharose 's daughter snehal : " foreigners specially found it difficult to find their kind of food in pune .
because osho ashram was close to our place , they started the idea of german bakery .
with that , they came up with the name german bakery , because it was mainly for foreigners .
even indians liked the pastries , cakes and juices . "
since dnyaneshwar 's death in 1999 , his wife smita kharose runs the business , helped now by her daughter snehal .
on a regular day , the german bakery is usually teeming with customers who come for german bakery 's special cakes and health snacks .
deprived now of their only source of income , the kharose family is struggling to come to terms with the tragedy .
destruction of a symbol of friendship the german bakery 's loss is also being strongly felt among its foreign fan base .
one of them is luc didon , director of the indo-french cultural centre in pune , " it 's so full of people of different origins and it 's a symbol of diversity – diversity of languages , of cultures , of thoughts of beliefs .
this is destruction not only of people , but of a symbol of friendship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nine people were killed and dozens injured yet it is this large foreign client base that seems to have made the german bakery a target , similar to the mumbai attacks on november 26 , where the terrorists chose the famous café leopold and luxury hotels frequented by foreigners .
soft target prior to the attacks , security had been tightened around the osho ashram and the jewish chabad house , based on intelligence inputs of a possible terror strike .
these were the two locations surveyed as potential targets by david coleman headley , an operative of the pakistan-based terror group lashkar-e-toiba .
but the german bakery had been considered a soft target , says union minister p chidambaram , denying that there had been an intelligence failure .
while the government has not ruled out pakistani involvement , the leading congress party has so far rejected any demands by right-wing opposition groups to put off the resumption of high-level talks with pakistan planned for next week .

news of the abuse allegations involving around 30 former pupils first surfaced in late january , when a former priest admitted that he forced boys to have sex at the elite canisius college in berlin from 1975 to 1983 .
since the revelation , many more former pupils have come forward with allegations against clerics and laymen at jesuit colleges and other catholic schools across the country .
" the number of people who have contacted me or the canisius college has risen to more than 100 , " lawyer ursula raue told german news agency dpa .
raue has been asked by the jesuits to investigate the allegations .
cases confirmed across germany the jesuits have since issued an apology , admitting they covered up abuse that had taken place at schools in berlin , hamburg , st. blasien , goettingen and hildesheim in the 1970s and 1980s .
the worldwide order also confirmed cases in spain and chile .
since the most recent of the cases happened more than 20 years ago , it 's still unclear whether or not criminal charges will be brought .
raue is working on a report on the allegations with canisius headmaster father klaus mertes and expects to send an interim report to the german headquarters of the jesuit order in munich later this week. cmk / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

norbert roettgen said he 'd stick to an agreement that would see two power plants close in coming months . german environment minister norbert roettgen has rejected calls to immediately extend the operating lifetimes of nuclear power plants .
roettgen said in a newspaper interview that he would not intervene to delay closure dates for reactors in coming months .
he told the weekly tagesspiegel am sonntag that new policy on energy plant life-spans would be decided in autumn , when the government coalition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- would discuss its energy policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen wants to adhere to existing policy in the meantime , the cdu minister said , current energy policy would dictate the fate of nuclear power stations set for closure .
plants set for closure according to present rules , the neckarwestheim power plant is set to shutdown in may .
the biblis a nuclear plant in hesse is earmarked for closure in summer .
" the operation of individual nuclear power stations will be decided on the basis of current law , " said roettgen .
he added that nuclear power was intended only to be an interim measure until demand can be met from renewable sources .
" we have defined nuclear energy as a ' bridge technology . '
the bridge ends when renewable energies can reliably replace nuclear energy . "
" when we have a goal before our eyes we can achieve it quickly , " he added .
more pragmatic approach at the same time , german economic minister rainer bruederle warned against " ideological rash reactions " and hinted at a more pragmatic approach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle said that solid facts were needed to decide on an approach the fdp minister told german weekly bild am sonntag that solid facts should shape future policy and that millions would need to be invested in renewable energy .
" if we do n't want electricity prices to go through the roof , we must build a bridge to the renewable age .
for the coalition this bridge is , along with the use of clean coal , nuclear energy . "
but , bruederle added , " one thing is clear .
nobody wants new nuclear power stations in germany . " possibility of extension while roettgen has said that plant life-spans could feasibly be expanded by eight years , his party colleagues in three states have called for a far longer stay of execution .
conservative regional environment ministers markus soeder from bavaria , tanya goeder from baden-wuerttemberg and silke lautenschlaeger from hesse advocate a further 20 years on top of roettgen 's suggestion .
the three represent german states with nuclear power plants and argue that renewable energy will not be ready to replace atomic power in time to realize roettgen 's proposal. rc / apn / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as western troops engage in warfare in the name of freedom in iraq and afghanistan , and a prominent new report reveals worldwide democracy to be on the ebb , analysts ponder where to go from here . " for the fourth consecutive year , global declines in freedom outweighed gains in 2009 . "
such was the opening statement of a report put out by us democracy watchdog freedom house earlier last month .
entitled " freedom in the world 2010 : global erosion of freedom , " the report noted democratic decline in 40 countries in africa , latin america , the middle east and the former soviet union .
assessed for indicators including political and civil liberties , press freedom and rule of law , five countries were added to the ' not free ' list and the number of electoral democracies fell to its lowest level since 1995 .
although 16 of the 194 countries surveyed were deemed to have made progress toward greater freedom for their peoples , and despite the fact that the overall global situation has improved over the past two decades , arch puddington , director of research with freedom house described the findings as " cause for real concern . "
manifold causes speaking to deutsche welle , he said last year 's democratic slow-down was more pronounced than in the three before , a finding he attributed to a wide variety of factors .
bildunterschrift : street protests in iran in summer 2009 following presidential elections " one is an increasing aggressiveness and self-assuredness on the part of some of the leading authoritarian countries - china , russia , iran , venezuela , zimbabwe - which then serve as models for other countries , " puddington said .
among the other issues at work are reactions to some of the democracy gains - such as the orange revolution - of the last decade , cynicism brought on by unfulfilled hopes of prospering in a fair society and initiatives to smother and suppress the growing confidence of civil societies .
democracy by degree but some experts argue that things are not quite as bad as the picture painted by the freedom house report .
michael efler , national spokesperson for german pro-democracy group mehr demokratie , says it 's a matter of perception .
" you have to ask what democracy is , " efler told deutsche welle .
" the liberal western approach taken by freedom house focuses on elections .
so if a country stages a fair ballot it is considered a democracy , but i think that is a limited way of doing things . "
he said that while elections are clearly crucial , it is also important to realize that the western understanding of democracy and human rights is not shared the world over .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein toppling was meant as a symbol for democracy in iraq illustrating his case with the omnipresent examples of iraq and afghanistan , efler said " society is structured differently and individual freedom does n't play anything like as important a role as it does for us . "
which begs the question , do people really want democracy ? " i wish it were a value to which everybody aspired but i do n't think that 's the way it is , " efler said .
" and it 's futile to try and force democracy on people because it wo n't work . "
too poor to consider democracy humphrey hawksley is author of the recently published " democracy kills : what 's so good about having the vote ? "
he told deutsche welle that for about one sixth of the world 's population democracy is not even a flicker on the radar .
" there are a billion or so people in a state of need , they want shelter , security from tribal wars , they want to be able to feed their children and get medicines for the sick , and they do n't have that .
so democracy as such does n't really factor in for them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food first , democracy later and although the need for those very basic life essentials may be conceptually tied to the image of a fair society with an elected democracy , hawksley said the carrot that generally gets voters to the ballot box is not hope for a brighter future , but a chance to oust an existing government .
" that 's the stock argument , " he said .
" but what 's the point of doing that if your hospital is still a mess , if your road is still a mess , if your infant mortality levels are still enormously high ?
what is the point of going through all that rigmarole if at the end of the day it does n't deliver anything to the citizens who cast the vote ? "
that , he says , is the question countries should be asking themselves if they want to create smooth civilized societies .
the question is the answer .
democracy vs. good governance but arch puddington would say there is more to it than that .
he believes the impetus has to come from outside , from the west .
" i think what you have to do is to try to educate people , let them know that large democratic societies are also prosperous societies , so they have the prosperity and they have the freedom . "
for his part , michael efler stresses the importance of creating a public platform for oppressed societies , and meeting with anti-regime activists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say former us president george bush poisoned the word democracy hawksley though , goes a couple of steps further .
he suggests replacing the word democracy , by now intrinsically linked to an ideological form of government opposed by countries such as russia and china , and replacing it with something along the lines of " good governance . "
" if you got together with the un and said ' we want to give these people in this african country good governance and we want to build them schools and so on , ' then you would take away the friction that many places see as the west trying to export their own ideology in order to get business contracts .

as western troops engage in warfare in the name of freedom in iraq and afghanistan , and a prominent new report reveals worldwide democracy to be on the ebb , analysts ponder where to go from here . " for the fourth consecutive year , global declines in freedom outweighed gains in 2009 . "
such was the opening statement of a report put out by us democracy watchdog freedom house earlier last month .
entitled " freedom in the world 2010 : global erosion of freedom , " the report noted democratic decline in 40 countries in africa , latin america , the middle east and the former soviet union .
assessed for indicators including political and civil liberties , press freedom and rule of law , five countries were added to the ' not free ' list and the number of electoral democracies fell to its lowest level since 1995 .
although 16 of the 194 countries surveyed were deemed to have made progress toward greater freedom for their peoples , and despite the fact that the overall global situation has improved over the past two decades , arch puddington , director of research with freedom house described the findings as " cause for real concern . "
manifold causes speaking to deutsche welle , he said last year 's democratic slow-down was more pronounced than in the three before , a finding he attributed to a wide variety of factors .
bildunterschrift : street protests in iran in summer 2009 following presidential elections " one is an increasing aggressiveness and self-assuredness on the part of some of the leading authoritarian countries - china , russia , iran , venezuela , zimbabwe - which then serve as models for other countries , " puddington said .
among the other issues at work are reactions to some of the democracy gains - such as the orange revolution - of the last decade , cynicism brought on by unfulfilled hopes of prospering in a fair society and initiatives to smother and suppress the growing confidence of civil societies .
democracy by degree but some experts argue that things are not quite as bad as the picture painted by the freedom house report .
michael efler , national spokesperson for german pro-democracy group mehr demokratie , says it 's a matter of perception .
" you have to ask what democracy is , " efler told deutsche welle .
" the liberal western approach taken by freedom house focuses on elections .
so if a country stages a fair ballot it is considered a democracy , but i think that is a limited way of doing things . "
he said that while elections are clearly crucial , it is also important to realize that the western understanding of democracy and human rights is not shared the world over .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein toppling was meant as a symbol for democracy in iraq illustrating his case with the omnipresent examples of iraq and afghanistan , efler said " society is structured differently and individual freedom does n't play anything like as important a role as it does for us . "
which begs the question , do people really want democracy ? " i wish it were a value to which everybody aspired but i do n't think that 's the way it is , " efler said .
" and it 's futile to try and force democracy on people because it wo n't work . "
too poor to consider democracy humphrey hawksley is author of the recently published " democracy kills : what 's so good about having the vote ? "
he told deutsche welle that for about one sixth of the world 's population democracy is not even a flicker on the radar .
" there are a billion or so people in a state of need , they want shelter , security from tribal wars , they want to be able to feed their children and get medicines for the sick , and they do n't have that .

" but what 's the point of doing that if your hospital is still a mess , if your road is still a mess , if your infant mortality levels are still enormously high ?

that , he says , is the question countries should be asking themselves if they want to create smooth civilized societies .
the question is the answer .
democracy vs. good governance but arch puddington would say there is more to it than that .

as western troops engage in warfare in the name of freedom in iraq and afghanistan , and a prominent new report reveals worldwide democracy to be on the ebb , analysts ponder where to go from here . " for the fourth consecutive year , global declines in freedom outweighed gains in 2009 . "
such was the opening statement of a report put out by us democracy watchdog freedom house earlier last month .
entitled " freedom in the world 2010 : global erosion of freedom , " the report noted democratic decline in 40 countries in africa , latin america , the middle east and the former soviet union .
assessed for indicators including political and civil liberties , press freedom and rule of law , five countries were added to the ' not free ' list and the number of electoral democracies fell to its lowest level since 1995 .
although 16 of the 194 countries surveyed were deemed to have made progress toward greater freedom for their peoples , and despite the fact that the overall global situation has improved over the past two decades , arch puddington , director of research with freedom house described the findings as " cause for real concern . "
manifold causes speaking to deutsche welle , he said last year 's democratic slow-down was more pronounced than in the three before , a finding he attributed to a wide variety of factors .
bildunterschrift : street protests in iran in summer 2009 following presidential elections " one is an increasing aggressiveness and self-assuredness on the part of some of the leading authoritarian countries - china , russia , iran , venezuela , zimbabwe - which then serve as models for other countries , " puddington said .
among the other issues at work are reactions to some of the democracy gains - such as the orange revolution - of the last decade , cynicism brought on by unfulfilled hopes of prospering in a fair society and initiatives to smother and suppress the growing confidence of civil societies .
democracy by degree but some experts argue that things are not quite as bad as the picture painted by the freedom house report .
michael efler , national spokesperson for german pro-democracy group mehr demokratie , says it 's a matter of perception .
" you have to ask what democracy is , " efler told deutsche welle .
" the liberal western approach taken by freedom house focuses on elections .
so if a country stages a fair ballot it is considered a democracy , but i think that is a limited way of doing things . "
he said that while elections are clearly crucial , it is also important to realize that the western understanding of democracy and human rights is not shared the world over .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein toppling was meant as a symbol for democracy in iraq illustrating his case with the omnipresent examples of iraq and afghanistan , efler said " society is structured differently and individual freedom does n't play anything like as important a role as it does for us . "
which begs the question , do people really want democracy ? " i wish it were a value to which everybody aspired but i do n't think that 's the way it is , " efler said .
" and it 's futile to try and force democracy on people because it wo n't work . "
too poor to consider democracy humphrey hawksley is author of the recently published " democracy kills : what 's so good about having the vote ? "
he told deutsche welle that for about one sixth of the world 's population democracy is not even a flicker on the radar .
" there are a billion or so people in a state of need , they want shelter , security from tribal wars , they want to be able to feed their children and get medicines for the sick , and they do n't have that .
so democracy as such does n't really factor in for them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food first , democracy later and although the need for those very basic life essentials may be conceptually tied to the image of a fair society with an elected democracy , hawksley said the carrot that generally gets voters to the ballot box is not hope for a brighter future , but a chance to oust an existing government .
" that 's the stock argument , " he said .
" but what 's the point of doing that if your hospital is still a mess , if your road is still a mess , if your infant mortality levels are still enormously high ?
what is the point of going through all that rigmarole if at the end of the day it does n't deliver anything to the citizens who cast the vote ? "
that , he says , is the question countries should be asking themselves if they want to create smooth civilized societies .
the question is the answer .
democracy vs. good governance but arch puddington would say there is more to it than that .
he believes the impetus has to come from outside , from the west .
" i think what you have to do is to try to educate people , let them know that large democratic societies are also prosperous societies , so they have the prosperity and they have the freedom . "
for his part , michael efler stresses the importance of creating a public platform for oppressed societies , and meeting with anti-regime activists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say former us president george bush poisoned the word democracy hawksley though , goes a couple of steps further .
he suggests replacing the word democracy , by now intrinsically linked to an ideological form of government opposed by countries such as russia and china , and replacing it with something along the lines of " good governance . "

as western troops engage in warfare in the name of freedom in iraq and afghanistan , and a prominent new report reveals worldwide democracy to be on the ebb , analysts ponder where to go from here . " for the fourth consecutive year , global declines in freedom outweighed gains in 2009 . "
such was the opening statement of a report put out by us democracy watchdog freedom house earlier last month .
entitled " freedom in the world 2010 : global erosion of freedom , " the report noted democratic decline in 40 countries in africa , latin america , the middle east and the former soviet union .
assessed for indicators including political and civil liberties , press freedom and rule of law , five countries were added to the ' not free ' list and the number of electoral democracies fell to its lowest level since 1995 .
although 16 of the 194 countries surveyed were deemed to have made progress toward greater freedom for their peoples , and despite the fact that the overall global situation has improved over the past two decades , arch puddington , director of research with freedom house described the findings as " cause for real concern . "
manifold causes speaking to deutsche welle , he said last year 's democratic slow-down was more pronounced than in the three before , a finding he attributed to a wide variety of factors .
bildunterschrift : street protests in iran in summer 2009 following presidential elections " one is an increasing aggressiveness and self-assuredness on the part of some of the leading authoritarian countries - china , russia , iran , venezuela , zimbabwe - which then serve as models for other countries , " puddington said .
among the other issues at work are reactions to some of the democracy gains - such as the orange revolution - of the last decade , cynicism brought on by unfulfilled hopes of prospering in a fair society and initiatives to smother and suppress the growing confidence of civil societies .
democracy by degree but some experts argue that things are not quite as bad as the picture painted by the freedom house report .
michael efler , national spokesperson for german pro-democracy group mehr demokratie , says it 's a matter of perception .
" you have to ask what democracy is , " efler told deutsche welle .
" the liberal western approach taken by freedom house focuses on elections .
so if a country stages a fair ballot it is considered a democracy , but i think that is a limited way of doing things . "
he said that while elections are clearly crucial , it is also important to realize that the western understanding of democracy and human rights is not shared the world over .

"
which begs the question , do people really want democracy ? " i wish it were a value to which everybody aspired but i do n't think that 's the way it is , " efler said .

too poor to consider democracy humphrey hawksley is author of the recently published " democracy kills : what 's so good about having the vote ? "
he told deutsche welle that for about one sixth of the world 's population democracy is not even a flicker on the radar .

his main aim is to reach agreement on raising the pension age , but the unions are strongly opposed . french president nicolas sarkozy decided to make pension reform the main issue at his country 's third " social summit " on monday .
he and members of his government met with representatives of the unions and employers for what were expected to be difficult talks .
sarkozy said at the end of the meeting that the government would present its proposals in september .
" if we want to save our pension system , we ca n't put off the decisions , " he said .
sarkozy 's office had been at pains to lower expectations ahead of the event , saying that no decisions would be made on fundamental issues , but that the meeting would discuss " the timetable and the methods of work . "
the government said it did n't want to rush things , but " everyone knows the solutions by heart . "
during the meeting , sarkozy was reported to have added that the government did not intend to force a solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been able to push through many unpopular reforms - will he succeed on pensions ?
pension reform is a highly controversial issue .
the budget ministry estimates that the pension system will have a 10.7 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.13 billion -rrb- deficit this year out of a total public deficit of 25 billion .
the labor minister , xavier darcos , told reuters news agency that the growing proportion of elderly people in french society would mean that the cost of the pension system would drive the annual public deficit up to 100 billion euros by 2050 .
longer working life the government would like to solve the problem by raising the retirement age , which , at 60 , is unusually low compared with the rest of europe , where many countries are moving towards 67 .
france has already taken some action in this direction , by increasing to 41 the numbers of years in which contributions have to be paid in order to earn a full pension . this means that people with degrees or elaborate training , who start work later , can not expect to have contributed for 41 years by the time they 're 60 , while unqualified workers are more likely to have done so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is hoping his pension reform will not attract the kind of protest which met the 2003 reform the unions are deeply opposed to any reform .
bernard thibault , head of the cgt union , rejected the government 's figures .
" we will defend the right to retire at 60 , " he said .
he also rejected the idea that " because life expectancy is increasing , it is unavoidable that people should spend a larger part of their lives working . "
the government enters these negotiations at a difficult time .
it had hoped to put off this third reform of the pension system in seven years until after the presidential election in 2012 , but the economic crisis has intervened .
increased unemployment has led to a reduction in contributions to the system .
in addition , the french government needs to do something about its expected deficit of 8.2 percent of gross domestic product this year , caused by its attempts to boost the economy .
the government is not trusted but the voters do not trust the government to deal with the pension crisis .
in a survey conducted for the metro newspaper , only 21 percent said they trusted the government to rescue the pension system , while 69 percent said they trusted the workers themselves or their unions . in another survey , well over half opposed either increasing the pension age or increasing the number of contribution years required for a full pension .
but yet another survey shows that young people still at school or in training do indeed expect to work beyond their 60th birthday .
the government was anxious not to cause uproar .
labor minister darcos said that contribution rates should not go up .
president sarkozy said that pension levels should not go down .
that leaves only the retirement age to play with if france is to deal with its pension challenge .

his main aim is to reach agreement on raising the pension age , but the unions are strongly opposed . french president nicolas sarkozy decided to make pension reform the main issue at his country 's third " social summit " on monday .
he and members of his government met with representatives of the unions and employers for what were expected to be difficult talks .
sarkozy said at the end of the meeting that the government would present its proposals in september .
" if we want to save our pension system , we ca n't put off the decisions , " he said .
sarkozy 's office had been at pains to lower expectations ahead of the event , saying that no decisions would be made on fundamental issues , but that the meeting would discuss " the timetable and the methods of work . "
the government said it did n't want to rush things , but " everyone knows the solutions by heart . "
during the meeting , sarkozy was reported to have added that the government did not intend to force a solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been able to push through many unpopular reforms - will he succeed on pensions ?
pension reform is a highly controversial issue .
the budget ministry estimates that the pension system will have a 10.7 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.13 billion -rrb- deficit this year out of a total public deficit of 25 billion .
the labor minister , xavier darcos , told reuters news agency that the growing proportion of elderly people in french society would mean that the cost of the pension system would drive the annual public deficit up to 100 billion euros by 2050 .
longer working life the government would like to solve the problem by raising the retirement age , which , at 60 , is unusually low compared with the rest of europe , where many countries are moving towards 67 .
france has already taken some action in this direction , by increasing to 41 the numbers of years in which contributions have to be paid in order to earn a full pension . this means that people with degrees or elaborate training , who start work later , can not expect to have contributed for 41 years by the time they 're 60 , while unqualified workers are more likely to have done so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is hoping his pension reform will not attract the kind of protest which met the 2003 reform the unions are deeply opposed to any reform .
bernard thibault , head of the cgt union , rejected the government 's figures .
" we will defend the right to retire at 60 , " he said .
he also rejected the idea that " because life expectancy is increasing , it is unavoidable that people should spend a larger part of their lives working . "
the government enters these negotiations at a difficult time .
it had hoped to put off this third reform of the pension system in seven years until after the presidential election in 2012 , but the economic crisis has intervened .
increased unemployment has led to a reduction in contributions to the system .
in addition , the french government needs to do something about its expected deficit of 8.2 percent of gross domestic product this year , caused by its attempts to boost the economy .
the government is not trusted but the voters do not trust the government to deal with the pension crisis .
in a survey conducted for the metro newspaper , only 21 percent said they trusted the government to rescue the pension system , while 69 percent said they trusted the workers themselves or their unions . in another survey , well over half opposed either increasing the pension age or increasing the number of contribution years required for a full pension .
but yet another survey shows that young people still at school or in training do indeed expect to work beyond their 60th birthday .
the government was anxious not to cause uproar .
labor minister darcos said that contribution rates should not go up .
president sarkozy said that pension levels should not go down .
that leaves only the retirement age to play with if france is to deal with its pension challenge .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 15.02.2010 pope meets irish bishops over pedophile scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vatican has been hit hard by irish sex abuse scandal pope benedict xvi began talks on monday with a delegation of irish bishops summoned to the vatican to discuss a child sex abuse scandal , which has shaken the catholic church in ireland . the talks , which are to last two days , stem from a report last november about unchecked child abuse in the archdiocese of dublin over a period of nearly 30 years .
the murphy commission report detailed a litany of abuse perpetuated by priests against more than 300 victims and strongly criticized the irish church 's handling of the situation .
four irish bishops have already resigned in the wake of the child sex abuse scandal .
in december , pope benedict expressed his " outrage , shame and profound regret " over the murphy commission 's revelations and said he would take clear measures in response to the situation .
a letter from the pontiff was expected to be published soon after his talks with the irish bishops .
church ' seriously damaged ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scandal has done ' immense damage ' , says irish bishop joseph duffy joseph duffy , the bishop of clogher in ireland , said the role of the pedophile priests had seriously damaged the church .
" the church has been seriously wounded and we are in a very serious situation .
this has done immense damage to the authority of the church as the mouthpiece of the gospel of jesus christ , and of that there is no doubt .
our business is to try to repair that damage , " bishop duffy said .
the irish crisis comes on the heels of a scandal in germany , where an elite jesuit school in berlin admitted to sexual abuse of teenagers by teachers during the 1970s and 80s .
revelations of pedophile priests also have rocked the church in recent months after similar scandals in the united states and australia .
vatican warns of ' loss of faith ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damage control is the job of pope benedict -lrb- r -rrb- and the vatican 's secretary of state , tarcisio bertone vatican secretary of state , cardinal tarcisio bertone , said on monday that the scandal could be overcome by faith . but , he warned that the loss of confidence and trust in the church was an " even more dangerous storm " and that people could " lose faith in god , through discouragement and despair . "
bishop duffy said that to restore that trust the church would be focusing on the victims .
" we will certainly be keeping the survivors at the top of the list of priorities .
i imagine hardly any bishop will fail to mention survivors as his primary concern in all of this most serious business , " he said .
anti-abuse campaigners , meanwhile , have called on pope benedict to visit ireland to meet the victims of the pedophile scandal .
christine buckley , herself an abuse survivor , said the pope had gone to the united states and australia to apologize and should do the same in ireland .
she also criticized that many of the accused irish priests had left ireland and gone to countries such as australia and america , where they continued their abuse. gb / dpa / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the murphy commission report detailed a litany of abuse perpetuated by priests against more than 300 victims and strongly criticized the irish church 's handling of the situation .
four irish bishops have already resigned in the wake of the child sex abuse scandal .
in december , pope benedict expressed his " outrage , shame and profound regret " over the murphy commission 's revelations and said he would take clear measures in response to the situation .
a letter from the pontiff was expected to be published soon after his talks with the irish bishops .
church ' seriously damaged ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scandal has done ' immense damage ' , says irish bishop joseph duffy joseph duffy , the bishop of clogher in ireland , said the role of the pedophile priests had seriously damaged the church .
" the church has been seriously wounded and we are in a very serious situation .
this has done immense damage to the authority of the church as the mouthpiece of the gospel of jesus christ , and of that there is no doubt .
our business is to try to repair that damage , " bishop duffy said .
the irish crisis comes on the heels of a scandal in germany , where an elite jesuit school in berlin admitted to sexual abuse of teenagers by teachers during the 1970s and 80s .
revelations of pedophile priests also have rocked the church in recent months after similar scandals in the united states and australia .
vatican warns of ' loss of faith ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damage control is the job of pope benedict -lrb- r -rrb- and the vatican 's secretary of state , tarcisio bertone vatican secretary of state , cardinal tarcisio bertone , said on monday that the scandal could be overcome by faith . but , he warned that the loss of confidence and trust in the church was an " even more dangerous storm " and that people could " lose faith in god , through discouragement and despair . "
bishop duffy said that to restore that trust the church would be focusing on the victims .
" we will certainly be keeping the survivors at the top of the list of priorities .
i imagine hardly any bishop will fail to mention survivors as his primary concern in all of this most serious business , " he said .
anti-abuse campaigners , meanwhile , have called on pope benedict to visit ireland to meet the victims of the pedophile scandal .
christine buckley , herself an abuse survivor , said the pope had gone to the united states and australia to apologize and should do the same in ireland .
she also criticized that many of the accused irish priests had left ireland and gone to countries such as australia and america , where they continued their abuse. gb / dpa / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the weekend , one of the most eagerly awaited asian stars stopped in berlin : bollywood hero shah rukh khan . ever since german television started showing his movies , the indian actor has countless fans in germany - who already turned out in large crowds at his first berlinale appearance two years ago .
and this time was n't any different .
there 's something special about the relationship between shah rukh khan and his german fans , the actor confessed : " i love all the guys , the men , they are very sweet … but honestly speaking – i can not lie when i 'm in germany – and normally i 'm very honest : i love the girls !
they 're beautiful , i think ... ”
his screaming female fans definitely felt the same for him .
“ i 'm so happy i see shahrukh , that 's my dream , he 's charming , he 's sexy … ” , one said .
shah rukh khan would n't contradict them on this .
“ i just keep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood actor shah rukh khan charms the camera getting better-looking every year … i ca n't control it , ” he quipped .

tickets for all viewings of his film “ my name is khan ” were sold out within minutes , being as the film is not due to come out officially in germany until spring , many had queued up for hours in the cold to get one .
the story features a muslim with asperger syndrome who faces anti-muslim prejudices in the united states after 9/11 .
misunderstandings , says khan , have also led to him and eventually the movie being embroiled in a controversy in india .
shah rukh khan had expressed his frustration that pakistani cricket players were denied the chance to play in the indian league , and called pakistan a “ great neighbor ” .
after that , right-wing hindu groups called for a boycott of his film and attacked theaters in india .
many cinema owners got scared and did not show the movie when it was released on friday .

and i have no problems meeting up anyone , having a chat with them , saying : listen , it 's just a film !
enjoy yourself , have a good laugh , and have fun !
and i hope that happens , insha 'allah , by the time i get back it should be sorted out ! ”
in india , the movie has done well over the weekend , as more and more cinemas started screening it .
interestingly , it has also become the largest bollywood weekend grosser in the united states , where the story is set , earning almost 1.9 million us dollars and attracting positive reviews .
so , after all the anger settles down , it might finally be possible to simply appreciate the movie … author : thomas bärthlein editor : disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

news of the abuse allegations involving around 30 former pupils first surfaced in late january , when a former priest admitted that he forced boys to have sex at the elite canisius college in berlin from 1975 to 1983 .
since the revelation , many more former pupils have come forward with allegations against clerics and laymen at jesuit colleges and other catholic schools across the country .
" the number of people who have contacted me or the canisius college has risen to more than 100 , " lawyer ursula raue told german news agency dpa .
raue has been asked by the jesuits to investigate the allegations .
cases confirmed across germany the jesuits have since issued an apology , admitting they covered up abuse that had taken place at schools in berlin , hamburg , st. blasien , goettingen and hildesheim in the 1970s and 1980s .
the worldwide order also confirmed cases in spain and chile .
since the most recent of the cases happened more than 20 years ago , it 's still unclear whether or not criminal charges will be brought .
raue is working on a report on the allegations with canisius headmaster father klaus mertes and expects to send an interim report to the german headquarters of the jesuit order in munich later this week. cmk / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

news of the abuse allegations involving around 30 former pupils first surfaced in late january , when a former priest admitted that he forced boys to have sex at the elite canisius college in berlin from 1975 to 1983 .
since the revelation , many more former pupils have come forward with allegations against clerics and laymen at jesuit colleges and other catholic schools across the country .

raue has been asked by the jesuits to investigate the allegations .
cases confirmed across germany the jesuits have since issued an apology , admitting they covered up abuse that had taken place at schools in berlin , hamburg , st. blasien , goettingen and hildesheim in the 1970s and 1980s .

since the most recent of the cases happened more than 20 years ago , it 's still unclear whether or not criminal charges will be brought .

at the weekend , one of the most eagerly awaited asian stars stopped in berlin : bollywood hero shah rukh khan . ever since german television started showing his movies , the indian actor has countless fans in germany - who already turned out in large crowds at his first berlinale appearance two years ago .
and this time was n't any different .
there 's something special about the relationship between shah rukh khan and his german fans , the actor confessed : " i love all the guys , the men , they are very sweet … but honestly speaking – i can not lie when i 'm in germany – and normally i 'm very honest : i love the girls !
they 're beautiful , i think ... ”
his screaming female fans definitely felt the same for him .
“ i 'm so happy i see shahrukh , that 's my dream , he 's charming , he 's sexy … ” , one said .
shah rukh khan would n't contradict them on this .
“ i just keep bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood actor shah rukh khan charms the camera getting better-looking every year … i ca n't control it , ” he quipped .

the story features a muslim with asperger syndrome who faces anti-muslim prejudices in the united states after 9/11 .
misunderstandings , says khan , have also led to him and eventually the movie being embroiled in a controversy in india .
shah rukh khan had expressed his frustration that pakistani cricket players were denied the chance to play in the indian league , and called pakistan a “ great neighbor ” .
after that , right-wing hindu groups called for a boycott of his film and attacked theaters in india .
many cinema owners got scared and did not show the movie when it was released on friday .
tension on the wane in india in berlin , khan said : " i get very disturbed and scared and emotionally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite difficulties , shah rukh khan still smiling at the 60th berlinale hurt over things like this happening .
and i have no problems meeting up anyone , having a chat with them , saying : listen , it 's just a film !
enjoy yourself , have a good laugh , and have fun !
and i hope that happens , insha 'allah , by the time i get back it should be sorted out ! ”
in india , the movie has done well over the weekend , as more and more cinemas started screening it .
interestingly , it has also become the largest bollywood weekend grosser in the united states , where the story is set , earning almost 1.9 million us dollars and attracting positive reviews .
so , after all the anger settles down , it might finally be possible to simply appreciate the movie … author : thomas bärthlein editor : disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german bakery was launched in 1988 by a local businessman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bomb detonated in a crowded bakery popular with foreigners dnyaneshwar kharose along with his associate woody , a german who had come to the osho ashram in pune .
it was woody 's idea to start a bakery with an international appeal , says dnyaneshwar kharose 's daughter snehal : " foreigners specially found it difficult to find their kind of food in pune .
because osho ashram was close to our place , they started the idea of german bakery .
with that , they came up with the name german bakery , because it was mainly for foreigners .
even indians liked the pastries , cakes and juices . "
since dnyaneshwar 's death in 1999 , his wife smita kharose runs the business , helped now by her daughter snehal .
on a regular day , the german bakery is usually teeming with customers who come for german bakery 's special cakes and health snacks .
deprived now of their only source of income , the kharose family is struggling to come to terms with the tragedy .
destruction of a symbol of friendship the german bakery 's loss is also being strongly felt among its foreign fan base .
one of them is luc didon , director of the indo-french cultural centre in pune , " it 's so full of people of different origins and it 's a symbol of diversity – diversity of languages , of cultures , of thoughts of beliefs .
this is destruction not only of people , but of a symbol of friendship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nine people were killed and dozens injured yet it is this large foreign client base that seems to have made the german bakery a target , similar to the mumbai attacks on november 26 , where the terrorists chose the famous café leopold and luxury hotels frequented by foreigners .
soft target prior to the attacks , security had been tightened around the osho ashram and the jewish chabad house , based on intelligence inputs of a possible terror strike .
these were the two locations surveyed as potential targets by david coleman headley , an operative of the pakistan-based terror group lashkar-e-toiba .
but the german bakery had been considered a soft target , says union minister p chidambaram , denying that there had been an intelligence failure .
while the government has not ruled out pakistani involvement , the leading congress party has so far rejected any demands by right-wing opposition groups to put off the resumption of high-level talks with pakistan planned for next week .

the german bakery was launched in 1988 by a local businessman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bomb detonated in a crowded bakery popular with foreigners dnyaneshwar kharose along with his associate woody , a german who had come to the osho ashram in pune .
it was woody 's idea to start a bakery with an international appeal , says dnyaneshwar kharose 's daughter snehal : " foreigners specially found it difficult to find their kind of food in pune .
because osho ashram was close to our place , they started the idea of german bakery .
with that , they came up with the name german bakery , because it was mainly for foreigners .
even indians liked the pastries , cakes and juices . "
since dnyaneshwar 's death in 1999 , his wife smita kharose runs the business , helped now by her daughter snehal .
on a regular day , the german bakery is usually teeming with customers who come for german bakery 's special cakes and health snacks .
deprived now of their only source of income , the kharose family is struggling to come to terms with the tragedy .
destruction of a symbol of friendship the german bakery 's loss is also being strongly felt among its foreign fan base .
one of them is luc didon , director of the indo-french cultural centre in pune , " it 's so full of people of different origins and it 's a symbol of diversity – diversity of languages , of cultures , of thoughts of beliefs .
this is destruction not only of people , but of a symbol of friendship . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nine people were killed and dozens injured yet it is this large foreign client base that seems to have made the german bakery a target , similar to the mumbai attacks on november 26 , where the terrorists chose the famous café leopold and luxury hotels frequented by foreigners .
soft target prior to the attacks , security had been tightened around the osho ashram and the jewish chabad house , based on intelligence inputs of a possible terror strike .
these were the two locations surveyed as potential targets by david coleman headley , an operative of the pakistan-based terror group lashkar-e-toiba .
but the german bakery had been considered a soft target , says union minister p chidambaram , denying that there had been an intelligence failure .
while the government has not ruled out pakistani involvement , the leading congress party has so far rejected any demands by right-wing opposition groups to put off the resumption of high-level talks with pakistan planned for next week .

his main aim is to reach agreement on raising the pension age , but the unions are strongly opposed . french president nicolas sarkozy decided to make pension reform the main issue at his country 's third " social summit " on monday .
he and members of his government met with representatives of the unions and employers for what were expected to be difficult talks .
sarkozy said at the end of the meeting that the government would present its proposals in september .
" if we want to save our pension system , we ca n't put off the decisions , " he said .
sarkozy 's office had been at pains to lower expectations ahead of the event , saying that no decisions would be made on fundamental issues , but that the meeting would discuss " the timetable and the methods of work . "
the government said it did n't want to rush things , but " everyone knows the solutions by heart . "
during the meeting , sarkozy was reported to have added that the government did not intend to force a solution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has been able to push through many unpopular reforms - will he succeed on pensions ?
pension reform is a highly controversial issue .
the budget ministry estimates that the pension system will have a 10.7 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.13 billion -rrb- deficit this year out of a total public deficit of 25 billion .
the labor minister , xavier darcos , told reuters news agency that the growing proportion of elderly people in french society would mean that the cost of the pension system would drive the annual public deficit up to 100 billion euros by 2050 .
longer working life the government would like to solve the problem by raising the retirement age , which , at 60 , is unusually low compared with the rest of europe , where many countries are moving towards 67 .
france has already taken some action in this direction , by increasing to 41 the numbers of years in which contributions have to be paid in order to earn a full pension . this means that people with degrees or elaborate training , who start work later , can not expect to have contributed for 41 years by the time they 're 60 , while unqualified workers are more likely to have done so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is hoping his pension reform will not attract the kind of protest which met the 2003 reform the unions are deeply opposed to any reform .
bernard thibault , head of the cgt union , rejected the government 's figures .
" we will defend the right to retire at 60 , " he said .
he also rejected the idea that " because life expectancy is increasing , it is unavoidable that people should spend a larger part of their lives working . "
the government enters these negotiations at a difficult time .
it had hoped to put off this third reform of the pension system in seven years until after the presidential election in 2012 , but the economic crisis has intervened .
increased unemployment has led to a reduction in contributions to the system .
in addition , the french government needs to do something about its expected deficit of 8.2 percent of gross domestic product this year , caused by its attempts to boost the economy .
the government is not trusted but the voters do not trust the government to deal with the pension crisis .
in a survey conducted for the metro newspaper , only 21 percent said they trusted the government to rescue the pension system , while 69 percent said they trusted the workers themselves or their unions . in another survey , well over half opposed either increasing the pension age or increasing the number of contribution years required for a full pension .
but yet another survey shows that young people still at school or in training do indeed expect to work beyond their 60th birthday .
the government was anxious not to cause uproar .
labor minister darcos said that contribution rates should not go up .
president sarkozy said that pension levels should not go down .
that leaves only the retirement age to play with if france is to deal with its pension challenge .

norbert roettgen said he 'd stick to an agreement that would see two power plants close in coming months . german environment minister norbert roettgen has rejected calls to immediately extend the operating lifetimes of nuclear power plants .
roettgen said in a newspaper interview that he would not intervene to delay closure dates for reactors in coming months .
he told the weekly tagesspiegel am sonntag that new policy on energy plant life-spans would be decided in autumn , when the government coalition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- would discuss its energy policy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen wants to adhere to existing policy in the meantime , the cdu minister said , current energy policy would dictate the fate of nuclear power stations set for closure .
plants set for closure according to present rules , the neckarwestheim power plant is set to shutdown in may .
the biblis a nuclear plant in hesse is earmarked for closure in summer .
" the operation of individual nuclear power stations will be decided on the basis of current law , " said roettgen .
he added that nuclear power was intended only to be an interim measure until demand can be met from renewable sources .
" we have defined nuclear energy as a ' bridge technology . '
the bridge ends when renewable energies can reliably replace nuclear energy . "
" when we have a goal before our eyes we can achieve it quickly , " he added .
more pragmatic approach at the same time , german economic minister rainer bruederle warned against " ideological rash reactions " and hinted at a more pragmatic approach .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle said that solid facts were needed to decide on an approach the fdp minister told german weekly bild am sonntag that solid facts should shape future policy and that millions would need to be invested in renewable energy .
" if we do n't want electricity prices to go through the roof , we must build a bridge to the renewable age .
for the coalition this bridge is , along with the use of clean coal , nuclear energy . "
but , bruederle added , " one thing is clear .
nobody wants new nuclear power stations in germany . " possibility of extension while roettgen has said that plant life-spans could feasibly be expanded by eight years , his party colleagues in three states have called for a far longer stay of execution .
conservative regional environment ministers markus soeder from bavaria , tanya goeder from baden-wuerttemberg and silke lautenschlaeger from hesse advocate a further 20 years on top of roettgen 's suggestion .
the three represent german states with nuclear power plants and argue that renewable energy will not be ready to replace atomic power in time to realize roettgen 's proposal. rc / apn / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

roettgen said in a newspaper interview that he would not intervene to delay closure dates for reactors in coming months .
he told the weekly tagesspiegel am sonntag that new policy on energy plant life-spans would be decided in autumn , when the government coalition of christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- would discuss its energy policy .

" the operation of individual nuclear power stations will be decided on the basis of current law , " said roettgen .
he added that nuclear power was intended only to be an interim measure until demand can be met from renewable sources .
" we have defined nuclear energy as a ' bridge technology . '
the bridge ends when renewable energies can reliably replace nuclear energy . "
" when we have a goal before our eyes we can achieve it quickly , " he added .

conservative regional environment ministers markus soeder from bavaria , tanya goeder from baden-wuerttemberg and silke lautenschlaeger from hesse advocate a further 20 years on top of roettgen 's suggestion .
