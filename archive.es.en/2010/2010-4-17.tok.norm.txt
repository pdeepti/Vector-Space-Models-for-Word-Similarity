more than 20 countries have closed their airspace with some countries calling off all flights until monday morning . european flights remained grounded on saturday due to a vast cloud of volcanic ash from iceland that has covered much of europe and has spread as far east as russia .
britain , ireland , switzerland , and belgium all extended their flight bans on saturday .
more than 20 european countries grounded flights because of the ash cloud .
the disruption hit german chancellor angela merkel who was trying to return to berlin from the united states on friday when her plane was diverted to lisbon .
she flew to rome on saturday , having to spend the night in italy . the chancellor will therefore be unable to attend the funeral of polish president lech kaczynski on sunday .
in addition , flights bringing home the bodies of german soldiers killed in afghanistan along with soldiers wounded in the country were redirected to turkey .
bildunterschrift : the last time the volcano erupted , in the 19th century , it continued sporadically for over a year things could get worse volcanic ash can terminally damage the engines and windows of jetliners .
the national air traffic services , which oversees british airspace , said the situation from the cloud is getting worse . experts tracking the volcano beneath the eyjafjallajokull glacier said there were no signs of reduced activity on friday .
after a relatively minor eruption one month ago , the volcano erupted again on wednesday , with these two incidents breaking almost 200 years of dormancy .
that last recorded eruption continued - with varying levels of severity and intermittent periods of inactivity - for almost 18 months between 1821 and 1823 .
" we have no prediction on how long -lsb- the eruption -rsb- will last , " said geophysicist bergthora thorbjnardottir at the iceland meteorological office .
hundreds of thousands stranded westerly and north-westerly winds have blown the ash across swathes of northern and central europe , grounding some 17,000 flights on friday , after around 6,000 were cancelled on thursday .
the disruption is costing airlines over 148 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- per day .
currently , only emergency flights are permitted into and out of the affected regions in europe .
all 16 international airports in germany were closed on saturday with no flights set to take off until at least 2pm on sunday .

" we have a lot more people booking tickets , and are putting every train at our disposal into action , " a bahn spokesman told german public broadcaster ard .
" everything that can run is running . "
the eurostar train service linking britain and mainland europe via the channel tunnel is fully booked , with the company reporting 38,000 travelers on friday , 10,000 more than average .
international coach services also claimed to be running at five times their usual capacity due to a surge in demand .
rental car companies reported a similar phenomenon , with some passengers even electing to drive long journeys to foreign destinations .

the minister left the isaf camp in masar-i-sharif after the disruption to european airspace had already begun , but guttenberg hoped he would nonetheless make it back to germany . the defense minister was travelling with five bundeswehr soldiers wounded in a taliban attack in northern afghanistan on thursday . the group was first taken to a german military base in uzbekistan to board a medical transport carrier heading towards europe .
the soldiers were meant to be brought to military hospitals in germany to ensure that they would receive optimal care . with the plane redirected to turkey , the soldiers have spent the night at a us hospital in istanbul and are to continue to germany only at a later stage .
guttenberg on saturday continued his way back to germany albeit it remained unclear by which means of transportation . an ash cloud from a volcanic eruption in iceland on friday spread over most of europe , leading to more than half of all flights being cancelled .
germany 's entire airspace is affected by the problem , which has caused all major airports to be shut down . funeral for fallen soldiers set for sunday guttenberg had been scheduled to return to germany on thursday after a two-day visit to afghanistan . while in transit in uzbekistan , however , he was notified of the bloody attack - which killed four bundeswehr soldiers .
the minister subsequently returned to afghanistan with the bundeswehr 's chief of staff , volker wieker .
guttenberg visited the wounded soldiers at the german military base in masar-i-sharif on friday as they waited for a military aircraft equipped with proper medical equipment to bring them back to germany .
bundeswehr officials report that the wounded troops are all in stable condition .
while four of the five soldiers have sustained serious injuries , these are not believed to be life-threatening .
wieker is scheduled to stay on in afghanistan to attend the funeral service for the four soldiers , which is planned for sunday in the masar-i-sharif camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's funeral would follow a service held just last week explosive , not rocket , triggered thursday 's ambush the latest german casualties came after a bundeswehr patrol came under attack travelling between kunduz and baghlan on thursday .
after initially reporting that the deadly ambush began when a german armored vehicle was struck by a rocket close to pol-i-khomri camp , germany 's defense ministry on friday corrected this , saying the attackers used a remotely detonated explosive device .
three bundeswehr soldiers died in the initial explosion , with the fourth killed in an ensuing battle , in which the isaf troops are believed to have come under mortar and gunfire .
a total of 43 german soldiers have now been killed in afghanistan since the bundeswehr mission began in 2002 .
of those , 26 have been killed in firefights or insurgent attacks .
in recent weeks , taliban insurgents have stepped up pressure on the german troops based in the northern province of kunduz .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 17.04.2010 un troops unlikely to pull out from congo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monuc troops on patrol in kinshasa - the congolese capital in march , the congolese government asked the un mission to withdraw all its troops .
but the recent violence raises questions as to whether the government can actually secure the country without international help . next month , france is due to present a draft of a new resolution on the un mandate for the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- to the un security council . many observers are already asking how the recent violence in mbandaka in the northwestern province of equateur , where rebels seized an airport and killed 13 people , will affect the future of the un 's involvement .
with more than 20,000 troops , the un mission -lrb- monuc -rrb- is the largest and most expensive on the planet .
monuc arrived in drc in 1999 when what is now known as the second congo war involved seven other african countries : zimbabwe , angola , chad , namibia , burundi , rwanda , and uganda .
the countries supported opposing sides - laurent kabila 's government or rebel groups in eastern congo - for different reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobutu was toppled by laurent kabila in the first congo war -lrb- 1996 - 97 -rrb- angola supported kabila because he defeated mobutu sese seko , who had helped jonas savimbi 's unita in angola 's civil war which spanned over two decades .
on the other hand , rwanda helped the rally for congolese democracy -lrb- rcd -rrb- to support tutsis in drc against hutu militias .
but rwanda , much like uganda , has been part of the war also to exploit natural resources - especially diamonds - in eastern congo .
more than 5 million people have died since 1998 as a result of the conflict .
and those who have not died directly continue to die from malnutrition or preventable diseases like cholera while thousands of women , especially in the kivu region , have been raped and many infected with hiv .
monuc and congolese army not on the same page monuc was sent to strengthen the congolese national forces and protect the population .
but many feel that it has not helped .
in fact , in " killings in kiwanja : the un 's inability to protect civilians , " human rights watch reports that monuc has failed to protect the population .
it says that monuc 's failure led to the massacre of 150 people in kiwanja in december 2008 , and that un troops have raped girls and women in eastern congo .
james paul , executive director of the global policy forum , agrees that un forces have failed to protect the population .
in part , because they were expected to work with the congolese forces which have also been accused of human rights violations , including the rape of thousands of women .
" there have been problems in the relationship between the peacekeepers and the congolese army because of concern that the un has been identified with the violations , " paul said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of women and girls have been raped by rebels as a result , instead of working with the congolese army as it should have , monuc has distanced itself from the congolese army so as not to be complicit in the latter 's actions .
" the relations between monuc and the congolese government have deteriorated extremely over the last couple of years because they do n't see eye to eye on many issues , " denis tull , a research fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
next year 's election ups the stakes last month 's announcement by the congolese government that it wanted all un troops to leave the country by august 2011 should have come as no surprise .
but its timing was strategic .
" with the upcoming 50th anniversary of congo 's independence in june , the government does not want to see a permanent presence of the un , " tull said .
observers say the government wants to take credit for the achievements that have taken place since monuc arrived in 1999 . this would put it in good light for the presidential elections in 2011 .
in spite of the criticism against monuc , it has helped to reduce the extent of the conflict and helped congo hold its first democratic elections in over four decades in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president joseph kabila won the elections in 2006 " president kabila wants to be able to say to the congolese people that he made the un mission leave because there is peace in the country , " tull said .
fabienne hara , the vice-president of multilateral relations at the international crisis group , agrees .
she told deutsche welle that " one of the reasons why the congolese government wants to see monuc withdraw is that they also want to be in charge of their own elections . "
un troops withdrawal unlikely however , it is unlikely that the congolese government will get exactly what it wants .
even though 2,000 un troops are to leave congo by june 30th , a report in march by un secretary general ban ki-moon , recommends that troops remain in the more unstable eastern congo .
also , the recent violence in equateur will very likely affect the future of the un mission .
" this new episode in equateur shows that even western congo is not completely stable despite what the government is saying .
there 's still some serious sources of tensions elsewhere in the congo , " hara said .
the un security council delegation visiting the democratic republic of congo over the next few days will most certainly take the recent violence in equateur into consideration , and un troops are expected to remain in the eastern part of the country because " any withdrawal from eastern congo would be a major catastrophe for the civilian population , " tull said .

it 's also caused major financial losses for airlines and sent their stocks tumbling . airlines were reeling saturday as flights and passengers remained grounded for a third straight day due to the icelandic volcanic ash cloud hovering over much of europe .
large flag carriers and no-frills airlines alike saw their shares dip on friday . the eurocontrol air traffic agency in brussels estimates that nearly 60 per cent of the region 's 28,000 daily flights , have been affected by the volcanic ash . british airways shares closed down more than 3 per cent on friday , while in ireland budget airline ryanair was down 2.3 per cent .
europe 's largest airline by revenue , lufthansa , ended the day down 4 per cent , while air france-klm slid by 3.4 per cent .
the disruption in travel is costing airliners roughly 148 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- in lost revenues per day .
after friday , about 16,000 flights were cancelled , making it the largest airspace shutdown since the second world war .
" in addition to lost revenues , airlines will incur added costs for re-routing of aircraft , care for stranded passengers and stranded aircraft at various ports , " the aviation industry body iata said in a statement on friday .
the association of european airlines estimated that the european economy had lost about one billion euros so far from flight bans across the continent .
however , airline reinsurers played down the potential of the ash cloud to greatly disturb business , hurt agriculture , or cause property damage .
" as long as the restriction to air travel remains temporary as is now expected , there should be no measureable impact for the broader economy , " said reinsurer munich re in a statement .
" it 's just an issue for the airlines to handle . "
airlines are typically not insured against cancellations .

the cloud has even affected the hotel industry throughout asia , as dozens of cancelled european flights have left hotels struggling to accommodate thousands of passengers .
but according to energy company officials , oil , gas , and electricity production in europe is not likely to suffer .
the one direct effect from the ash cloud is that offshore workers in the north sea will have to wait longer for replacements , as helicopters were also grounded as part of the flight ban .
flight bans have been imposed by more than 15 european countries .

but now this pristine winemaking region is threatened by a bridge that is to span the valley , against the wishes of many locals and winemakers . the moselle valley in western germany is known for its picturesque views and world-famous moselle riesling wine .
the region thrives on the wine industry and the tourism that it brings .
in an effort to boost access to the valley , the national and state government have launched a project to build a bridge across the moselle valley .
supporters of the project say it will boost tourism in the region by shortening the travel time between neighboring belgium and luxembourg .
they say traffic congestion will be relieved for locals , and commercial connections to nearby airports will be improved .
but not everyone in the valley is convinced that building the bridge is worth it .
they 're afraid the damage to the landscape and the environment will outweigh the benefits .
pro-moselle bildunterschrift : pictures from pro-moselle showing the valley as it is and what will change with the bridge a group of citizens in the valley have formed a group called pro-moselle .
they are against the construction of the bridge , and have started a number of initiatives to try to stop construction .
last spring the group stopped tractors from digging at the official groundbreaking ceremony of the bridge , and a petition against the bridge can be signed on the group 's web site or at one of their regularly scheduled sunday demonstrations .
on sundays , members of the group meet in the town of bernkastel to gather signatures .
they hold two panoramic photographs : one shows how the valley looks now , while the other shows the same image but with the proposed bridge added in .
" these pictures alone say it all , " a woman visiting from moenchengladbach who signed the petition told deutsche welle .
" we 're enjoying the landscape here as tourists , without a bridge .
with a bridge , it is unthinkable . "
wine allies plans for the bridge have been on the books since the late 1960s , but it was n't until late 2008 that the project was given the green light .
most of the 270 million euros -lrb- $ 366 million -rrb- budgeted for the project is coming from the federal government , with the government of the state of rhineland-palatinate chipping in 20 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wine expert hugh johnson says moselle riesling is one of a kind the pro-moselle group has gained support from german politicians and leaders in the wine world .
former foreign minister joschka fisher and the co-leader of the greens ' parliamentary party , renate kuenast , are on board , as is hugh johnson , a world-renowned wine writer from britain .
johnson calls the planned bridge a ' road on stilts . '
in a video posted on the pro-moselle website , he calls on the citizens of the area to stand up and fight for the moselle valley and its one-of-a-kind wine .
" i can tell you that the whole world has nothing comparable to a moselle riesling .
you can imitate the wine of bordeaux in the napa valley , " johnson said .
" you can even imitate the wine of burgundy in certain places .
but there is nothing that even starts to imitate great moselle riesling . "
a long tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus berres markus berres runs the c.h. berres winery in uerzig , a town that will basically fall under the shadow of the bridge once it is completed .
his family has been in the business for 500 years , and the 31-year-old winemaker is part of the 21st generation to run the family business in the moselle valley .
he fears that tourists will be driven away once the bridge is built .
" this region lives from tourism and winemaking , " berres said in an interview with deutsche welle , " but who wants to take their holiday under a bridge ?
nobody .
so i do n't see any advantage to building the bridge . "
the state 's transportation minister , hendrik hering , announced that 35 million euros would be reinvested in the environment as a measure of compensation .
however , winemakers are still worried about the bridge 's effect on the water supply for the grapes growing on the slopes of the valley , or how the grapes will react to the additional car exhaust .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although it is years from completion , signs of the bridge are apparent " the vines will be growing with the bridge or without the bridge , " said markus berres .
" the question is , how high will the quality be ? "
too late to be stopped ?
preparation work is already underway on the bridge .
a receding tree line and dirt access roads are starting to give an indication of what the area will look like once the bridge is complete .
pro-moselle insists that as long as construction has not started , the bridge can still be stopped .
markus berres predicts that many people will move away from the valley if the bridge is completed .
in either case , berres says he 'll stay .
his family has made its living in the moselle valley for centuries , and berres plans to keep the tradition alive .
but for him , making germany 's famous moselle riesling wine just wo n't be the same in the shadow of a bridge .

but the recent violence raises questions as to whether the government can actually secure the country without international help . next month , france is due to present a draft of a new resolution on the un mandate for the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- to the un security council . many observers are already asking how the recent violence in mbandaka in the northwestern province of equateur , where rebels seized an airport and killed 13 people , will affect the future of the un 's involvement .
with more than 20,000 troops , the un mission -lrb- monuc -rrb- is the largest and most expensive on the planet .
monuc arrived in drc in 1999 when what is now known as the second congo war involved seven other african countries : zimbabwe , angola , chad , namibia , burundi , rwanda , and uganda .
the countries supported opposing sides - laurent kabila 's government or rebel groups in eastern congo - for different reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobutu was toppled by laurent kabila in the first congo war -lrb- 1996 - 97 -rrb- angola supported kabila because he defeated mobutu sese seko , who had helped jonas savimbi 's unita in angola 's civil war which spanned over two decades .
on the other hand , rwanda helped the rally for congolese democracy -lrb- rcd -rrb- to support tutsis in drc against hutu militias .
but rwanda , much like uganda , has been part of the war also to exploit natural resources - especially diamonds - in eastern congo .
more than 5 million people have died since 1998 as a result of the conflict .
and those who have not died directly continue to die from malnutrition or preventable diseases like cholera while thousands of women , especially in the kivu region , have been raped and many infected with hiv .
monuc and congolese army not on the same page monuc was sent to strengthen the congolese national forces and protect the population .
but many feel that it has not helped .
in fact , in " killings in kiwanja : the un 's inability to protect civilians , " human rights watch reports that monuc has failed to protect the population .
it says that monuc 's failure led to the massacre of 150 people in kiwanja in december 2008 , and that un troops have raped girls and women in eastern congo .
james paul , executive director of the global policy forum , agrees that un forces have failed to protect the population .
in part , because they were expected to work with the congolese forces which have also been accused of human rights violations , including the rape of thousands of women .
" there have been problems in the relationship between the peacekeepers and the congolese army because of concern that the un has been identified with the violations , " paul said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of women and girls have been raped by rebels as a result , instead of working with the congolese army as it should have , monuc has distanced itself from the congolese army so as not to be complicit in the latter 's actions .
" the relations between monuc and the congolese government have deteriorated extremely over the last couple of years because they do n't see eye to eye on many issues , " denis tull , a research fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
next year 's election ups the stakes last month 's announcement by the congolese government that it wanted all un troops to leave the country by august 2011 should have come as no surprise .
but its timing was strategic .
" with the upcoming 50th anniversary of congo 's independence in june , the government does not want to see a permanent presence of the un , " tull said .
observers say the government wants to take credit for the achievements that have taken place since monuc arrived in 1999 . this would put it in good light for the presidential elections in 2011 .
in spite of the criticism against monuc , it has helped to reduce the extent of the conflict and helped congo hold its first democratic elections in over four decades in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president joseph kabila won the elections in 2006 " president kabila wants to be able to say to the congolese people that he made the un mission leave because there is peace in the country , " tull said .
fabienne hara , the vice-president of multilateral relations at the international crisis group , agrees .
she told deutsche welle that " one of the reasons why the congolese government wants to see monuc withdraw is that they also want to be in charge of their own elections . "
un troops withdrawal unlikely however , it is unlikely that the congolese government will get exactly what it wants .
even though 2,000 un troops are to leave congo by june 30th , a report in march by un secretary general ban ki-moon , recommends that troops remain in the more unstable eastern congo .
also , the recent violence in equateur will very likely affect the future of the un mission .
" this new episode in equateur shows that even western congo is not completely stable despite what the government is saying .
there 's still some serious sources of tensions elsewhere in the congo , " hara said .

just ask chancellor angela merkel ... on saturday , german chancellor angela merkel took an armoured limousine from rome to bolzano , in northeast italy , on the next stage of an increasingly complicated return trip from the the united states .
she was already travelling for 36 hours trying to get to from san francisco to berlin with an entourage of some 60 officials and reporters following close behind in a bus .
merkel 's plane was diverted to portugal on friday , enabling her to spend a night in lisbon due to the cloud of ash from iceland that has brought hundreds of flights across europe to a halt .
she flew as far as rome on saturday but could get no further by air .
a surprisingly cool merkel was quoted after arriving in rome as saying she would " take things as they come . "
merkel will spend the night in bolzano and is to continue her journey home on sunday .
a deputy government spokeswoman said on saturday that the chancellor would " regrettably " not be able to attend the funeral of president lech kacynski and his wife , which is planned for krakow on sunday. glb / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 17.04.2010 last-second heroics clinch pole for vettel in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel has been dominating in qualifying this season sebastian vettel will start sunday 's chinese formula one grand prix on pole position , after another stunning qualifying performance .
it 's vettel 's third pole in four races this season . sebastian vettel claimed a last-gasp pole position in shanghai on saturday , and will line up at the head of the field for formula one 's chinese grand prix .
it 's vettel 's third pole position in four races , with his red bull teammate mark webber qualifying second .
vettel had appeared to be struggling over the course of the weekend . yet when it mattered most , in the dying moments of the final segment of qualifying -lrb- " q3 " -rrb- , he found another gear and laid down comfortably the fastest lap of the entire weekend .
" how do you do that ? "
vettel 's bewildered race engineer asked over team radio , immediately after the german lit up the timing screens .
" woohoo !
yes , baby ! " replied the 22-year old .
red bull have dominated qualifying this season , with one of their cars starting at the front for every race so far .
however , in china it looked like mclaren 's lewis hamilton had the upper hand , especially in the high-speed sections of the circuit .
" what a qualifying session , it was pretty incredible , " vettel said in the press conference afterwards .
" at the start of the session i was n't entirely happy , especially in the first sector of the lap , but by the end i was totally satisfied with the car , and was the quickest driver across almost the entire lap . "
" i want to say thanks to the mechanics , they certainly did n't get a lunch break today !
they had to work flat out between practice and qualifying to fix the problems we were having with the car but , as always , they did a great job . "
if vettel - who won the last race in malaysia - can convert his qualifying performance into another win on sunday , he would be guaranteed to take the lead in the world championship , regardless of where his competition finishes .
mixed fortunes at mercedes behind the red bull duo , ferrari 's spanish double world champion , fernando alonso , secured third place , with mercedes driver nico rosberg an impressive fourth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosberg has been overshadowing veteran teammate schumacher " i 'd say i 'm pretty happy , " rosberg told german television .
" this morning it looked much worse for us , but now we 're really close to the front .
red bull seems to have a bit of an advantage , but then there 's us and ferrari not far behind . "
however , mercedes ' other german driver , seven-time champion michael schumacher , qualified far behind his teammate in ninth , seven tenths of a second -lrb- a deceptively long time in formula one terms -rrb- adrift of rosberg .
" i know where i lost those seven tenths , so i can handle it , " schumacher said .
" but of course it 's a pity .
nico has a well set-up car , and he got the best out of it , and obviously i would have liked to achieve the same .
i shall try to do so in the race tomorrow . "
so far , either through reliability problems or a lack of speed , the highly anticipated return of schumacher to f1 after three years away has not delivered impressive results - with qualifying pace arguably his biggest problem .
sutil impresses again germany 's other strong qualifier was adrian sutil , driving for the relatively small force india team .
the 27-year old , who has never scored a top three finish in his career , starts just behind f1 's most successful driver schumacher in tenth position .
sutil has been in the top ten at the start of every race this year , by far the best performance of his career to date , but the other cars ahead of him are likely to prove too strong in the race on sunday .
the mclaren drivers jenson button and lewis hamilton - who were tipped to shine in shanghai - line up fifth and sixth , ferrari 's felipe massa starts seventh , and robert kubica grabbed eighth place for renault .
germany 's rookie nico hulkenberg is a rather disappointing sixteenth on the grid for williams , with countryman timo glock nineteenth in his virgin racing car .
glock wins the dubious honor , once again , of being the fastest driver at any of formula one 's three new teams - all of whom have been well adrift of the rest of the field so far this season .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 17.04.2010 french supermarkets tap rising demand for halal food großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : halal fast food has finally caught on in france with an estimated five million muslims , france has the biggest islamic population in europe .
they 've been in the country for decades , but the mainstream food industry is only just starting to cater to them . customers walking through the aisles of some paris area supermarkets are now likely to find halal meat and processed foods .
whether it 's spicy ready-to-eat chicken wings , halal pate , or mock ham made from turkey , halal products are increasingly making their way into mainstream shopping venues .
it may not seem like much , but for france this marks a striking change .
this was made evident last summer when the zakia food brand aired the first nationally broadcast television commercial for halal food .
it turned enough heads to make it into french newscasts .
halal means legal or lawful in arabic and refers to foods that are sanctioned by islamic authorities .
pork , blood and alcohol are not halal .
food industry observers say supermarkets and the rest of the food industry are just following the money trail .
" five and a half billion euros are going to be spent on these kinds of products this year in france , " said abbas bendali , the head of solis , a market research firm specialized in ethnic niches .
" there are five million potential customers .
so this is more than a niche , this is a real consumer segment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french food companies are shedding their misconceptions about halal meat new generation of customers a few years ago , halal foods could only be found in small shops in low-rent immigrant neighborhoods .
now france 's second largest supermarket chain , casino , has hired abderrahman bouzid to manage the halal and traditional muslim foods sold in its 10,000 stores .
he said the market is growing thanks to a new generation of french muslims .
" those under the age of 40 do n't have any hang-ups about affirming who they are ; they want to be taken into consideration , " bouzid said , explaining that muslim consumers are perfectly aware of their buying power and will prefer retailers that offer halal products .
" they 're saying ' if you are dismissive of my needs , by ignoring my customs and my preferences , i wo n't shop in your business ' , " he added .
casino has even created its own halal product line , which it markets under the name wassila .
others in the food industry are following suit .
international brands such as knorr , maggi , liebig and french firms like duc and fleury michon have all started selling halal options .
they now compete with established halal brands such as zakia , isla delice and medina .
attitudes shift some of these brands and others recently attended a halal trade show in paris , where visitors could find everything from halal foie gras and faux-bacon cheese burgers to microwaveable halal meals such as lasagna and chicken curry with rice .
antoine bonnel started the fair six years ago , when it attracted far fewer exhibitors .
this year , 100 companies participated .
bonnel said he has noticed an attitude shift in the food industry .
in the past , mainstream brands did n't want to be associates with halal because it was considered low-brow , he said , adding that french muslims had little money and unenviable social positions .
" these people came from a very poor immigrant background , " bonnel said .
" so the global image was a cheap image . "
there were also misconceptions about the ritual slaughter of animals required for meat to be considered halal .
and there were rumors that some of the taxes for this ritual could be funneled to questionable foreign causes .
bildunterschrift : young muslims represent a significant consumer segment some of this unease came to the surface earlier this year , when fast food chain quick revealed it had made eight of its 362 restaurants halal .
several french politicians criticized the move and the extreme-right national front highlighted the company in its anti-immigrant rhetoric .
but from a business perspective , the new buying power and improved social status of the young muslim generation are sweeping misgivings to the side .
sweeter than champagne the upcoming french launch of a non-alcoholic sparkling wine is just one example of that .
the drink , called " night orient , " is sold in what looks like a champagne bottle and provides people with the satisfying pop that comes with opening a bottle of real champagne .
" we decided to launch a festive drink for muslims , completely alcohol free , " said arnaud jacquemin , one of the drink 's creators .
" for weddings , for birthdays or the end of the year they have to drink orange juice , or soda , which is n't festive . "
jacquemin is n't himself muslim , but while working in the beverage industry , he saw sales of non-alcoholic drinks consistently rise and realized this market was largely untapped .
night orient tastes far sweeter than real champagne .
focus group testing showed the version initially developed was a little too dry for consumers unaccustomed to drinking wine .
so the formula was changed to better appeal to the muslim palate .
the beverage had a successful test run in some paris area supermarkets .
the small company has since signed deals with four national retail chains to officially launch the beverage in france during ramadan later this year .

it 's also caused major financial losses for airlines and sent their stocks tumbling . airlines were reeling saturday as flights and passengers remained grounded for a third straight day due to the icelandic volcanic ash cloud hovering over much of europe .
large flag carriers and no-frills airlines alike saw their shares dip on friday . the eurocontrol air traffic agency in brussels estimates that nearly 60 per cent of the region 's 28,000 daily flights , have been affected by the volcanic ash . british airways shares closed down more than 3 per cent on friday , while in ireland budget airline ryanair was down 2.3 per cent .
europe 's largest airline by revenue , lufthansa , ended the day down 4 per cent , while air france-klm slid by 3.4 per cent .
the disruption in travel is costing airliners roughly 148 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- in lost revenues per day .
after friday , about 16,000 flights were cancelled , making it the largest airspace shutdown since the second world war .
" in addition to lost revenues , airlines will incur added costs for re-routing of aircraft , care for stranded passengers and stranded aircraft at various ports , " the aviation industry body iata said in a statement on friday .
the association of european airlines estimated that the european economy had lost about one billion euros so far from flight bans across the continent .
however , airline reinsurers played down the potential of the ash cloud to greatly disturb business , hurt agriculture , or cause property damage .
" as long as the restriction to air travel remains temporary as is now expected , there should be no measureable impact for the broader economy , " said reinsurer munich re in a statement .
" it 's just an issue for the airlines to handle . "
airlines are typically not insured against cancellations .
other industries affected deutsche post , europe 's largest mail and express delivery company , said the cloud has disrupted delivery by air and the company has switched to land transport where possible .
the cloud has even affected the hotel industry throughout asia , as dozens of cancelled european flights have left hotels struggling to accommodate thousands of passengers .
but according to energy company officials , oil , gas , and electricity production in europe is not likely to suffer .
the one direct effect from the ash cloud is that offshore workers in the north sea will have to wait longer for replacements , as helicopters were also grounded as part of the flight ban .
flight bans have been imposed by more than 15 european countries .
britain , germany , finland , slovakia , estonia and denmark have extended their bans until sunday. mk / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more than 20 countries have closed their airspace with some countries calling off all flights until monday morning . european flights remained grounded on saturday due to a vast cloud of volcanic ash from iceland that has covered much of europe and has spread as far east as russia .
britain , ireland , switzerland , and belgium all extended their flight bans on saturday .
more than 20 european countries grounded flights because of the ash cloud .
the disruption hit german chancellor angela merkel who was trying to return to berlin from the united states on friday when her plane was diverted to lisbon .
she flew to rome on saturday , having to spend the night in italy . the chancellor will therefore be unable to attend the funeral of polish president lech kaczynski on sunday .
in addition , flights bringing home the bodies of german soldiers killed in afghanistan along with soldiers wounded in the country were redirected to turkey .
bildunterschrift : the last time the volcano erupted , in the 19th century , it continued sporadically for over a year things could get worse volcanic ash can terminally damage the engines and windows of jetliners .
the national air traffic services , which oversees british airspace , said the situation from the cloud is getting worse . experts tracking the volcano beneath the eyjafjallajokull glacier said there were no signs of reduced activity on friday .
after a relatively minor eruption one month ago , the volcano erupted again on wednesday , with these two incidents breaking almost 200 years of dormancy .
that last recorded eruption continued - with varying levels of severity and intermittent periods of inactivity - for almost 18 months between 1821 and 1823 .
" we have no prediction on how long -lsb- the eruption -rsb- will last , " said geophysicist bergthora thorbjnardottir at the iceland meteorological office .
hundreds of thousands stranded westerly and north-westerly winds have blown the ash across swathes of northern and central europe , grounding some 17,000 flights on friday , after around 6,000 were cancelled on thursday .
the disruption is costing airlines over 148 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- per day .
currently , only emergency flights are permitted into and out of the affected regions in europe .
all 16 international airports in germany were closed on saturday with no flights set to take off until at least 2pm on sunday .

it 's vettel 's third pole position in four races , with his red bull teammate mark webber qualifying second .
vettel had appeared to be struggling over the course of the weekend . yet when it mattered most , in the dying moments of the final segment of qualifying -lrb- " q3 " -rrb- , he found another gear and laid down comfortably the fastest lap of the entire weekend .
" how do you do that ? "
vettel 's bewildered race engineer asked over team radio , immediately after the german lit up the timing screens .
" woohoo !
yes , baby ! " replied the 22-year old .
red bull have dominated qualifying this season , with one of their cars starting at the front for every race so far .
however , in china it looked like mclaren 's lewis hamilton had the upper hand , especially in the high-speed sections of the circuit .
" what a qualifying session , it was pretty incredible , " vettel said in the press conference afterwards .
" at the start of the session i was n't entirely happy , especially in the first sector of the lap , but by the end i was totally satisfied with the car , and was the quickest driver across almost the entire lap . "
" i want to say thanks to the mechanics , they certainly did n't get a lunch break today !
they had to work flat out between practice and qualifying to fix the problems we were having with the car but , as always , they did a great job . "
if vettel - who won the last race in malaysia - can convert his qualifying performance into another win on sunday , he would be guaranteed to take the lead in the world championship , regardless of where his competition finishes .

red bull seems to have a bit of an advantage , but then there 's us and ferrari not far behind . "
however , mercedes ' other german driver , seven-time champion michael schumacher , qualified far behind his teammate in ninth , seven tenths of a second -lrb- a deceptively long time in formula one terms -rrb- adrift of rosberg .
" i know where i lost those seven tenths , so i can handle it , " schumacher said .
" but of course it 's a pity .
nico has a well set-up car , and he got the best out of it , and obviously i would have liked to achieve the same .
i shall try to do so in the race tomorrow . "
so far , either through reliability problems or a lack of speed , the highly anticipated return of schumacher to f1 after three years away has not delivered impressive results - with qualifying pace arguably his biggest problem .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 17.04.2010 airlines suffer financial blow after ash cloud großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the volanic ash has shut down airports and hit airlines financially a plume of volcanic ash drifting across europe from iceland has not just sparked travel chaos .
it 's also caused major financial losses for airlines and sent their stocks tumbling . airlines were reeling saturday as flights and passengers remained grounded for a third straight day due to the icelandic volcanic ash cloud hovering over much of europe .
large flag carriers and no-frills airlines alike saw their shares dip on friday . the eurocontrol air traffic agency in brussels estimates that nearly 60 per cent of the region 's 28,000 daily flights , have been affected by the volcanic ash . british airways shares closed down more than 3 per cent on friday , while in ireland budget airline ryanair was down 2.3 per cent .
europe 's largest airline by revenue , lufthansa , ended the day down 4 per cent , while air france-klm slid by 3.4 per cent .
the disruption in travel is costing airliners roughly 148 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- in lost revenues per day .
after friday , about 16,000 flights were cancelled , making it the largest airspace shutdown since the second world war .
" in addition to lost revenues , airlines will incur added costs for re-routing of aircraft , care for stranded passengers and stranded aircraft at various ports , " the aviation industry body iata said in a statement on friday .
the association of european airlines estimated that the european economy had lost about one billion euros so far from flight bans across the continent .
however , airline reinsurers played down the potential of the ash cloud to greatly disturb business , hurt agriculture , or cause property damage .
" as long as the restriction to air travel remains temporary as is now expected , there should be no measureable impact for the broader economy , " said reinsurer munich re in a statement .
" it 's just an issue for the airlines to handle . "
airlines are typically not insured against cancellations .
other industries affected deutsche post , europe 's largest mail and express delivery company , said the cloud has disrupted delivery by air and the company has switched to land transport where possible .
the cloud has even affected the hotel industry throughout asia , as dozens of cancelled european flights have left hotels struggling to accommodate thousands of passengers .
but according to energy company officials , oil , gas , and electricity production in europe is not likely to suffer .
the one direct effect from the ash cloud is that offshore workers in the north sea will have to wait longer for replacements , as helicopters were also grounded as part of the flight ban .
flight bans have been imposed by more than 15 european countries .
britain , germany , finland , slovakia , estonia and denmark have extended their bans until sunday. mk / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's also caused major financial losses for airlines and sent their stocks tumbling . airlines were reeling saturday as flights and passengers remained grounded for a third straight day due to the icelandic volcanic ash cloud hovering over much of europe .
large flag carriers and no-frills airlines alike saw their shares dip on friday . the eurocontrol air traffic agency in brussels estimates that nearly 60 per cent of the region 's 28,000 daily flights , have been affected by the volcanic ash . british airways shares closed down more than 3 per cent on friday , while in ireland budget airline ryanair was down 2.3 per cent .
europe 's largest airline by revenue , lufthansa , ended the day down 4 per cent , while air france-klm slid by 3.4 per cent .
the disruption in travel is costing airliners roughly 148 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- in lost revenues per day .
after friday , about 16,000 flights were cancelled , making it the largest airspace shutdown since the second world war .
" in addition to lost revenues , airlines will incur added costs for re-routing of aircraft , care for stranded passengers and stranded aircraft at various ports , " the aviation industry body iata said in a statement on friday .
the association of european airlines estimated that the european economy had lost about one billion euros so far from flight bans across the continent .
however , airline reinsurers played down the potential of the ash cloud to greatly disturb business , hurt agriculture , or cause property damage .
" as long as the restriction to air travel remains temporary as is now expected , there should be no measureable impact for the broader economy , " said reinsurer munich re in a statement .
" it 's just an issue for the airlines to handle . "
airlines are typically not insured against cancellations .
other industries affected deutsche post , europe 's largest mail and express delivery company , said the cloud has disrupted delivery by air and the company has switched to land transport where possible .
the cloud has even affected the hotel industry throughout asia , as dozens of cancelled european flights have left hotels struggling to accommodate thousands of passengers .
but according to energy company officials , oil , gas , and electricity production in europe is not likely to suffer .
the one direct effect from the ash cloud is that offshore workers in the north sea will have to wait longer for replacements , as helicopters were also grounded as part of the flight ban .
flight bans have been imposed by more than 15 european countries .

more than 20 countries have closed their airspace with some countries calling off all flights until monday morning . european flights remained grounded on saturday due to a vast cloud of volcanic ash from iceland that has covered much of europe and has spread as far east as russia .
britain , ireland , switzerland , and belgium all extended their flight bans on saturday .
more than 20 european countries grounded flights because of the ash cloud .
the disruption hit german chancellor angela merkel who was trying to return to berlin from the united states on friday when her plane was diverted to lisbon .
she flew to rome on saturday , having to spend the night in italy . the chancellor will therefore be unable to attend the funeral of polish president lech kaczynski on sunday .
in addition , flights bringing home the bodies of german soldiers killed in afghanistan along with soldiers wounded in the country were redirected to turkey .
bildunterschrift : the last time the volcano erupted , in the 19th century , it continued sporadically for over a year things could get worse volcanic ash can terminally damage the engines and windows of jetliners .
the national air traffic services , which oversees british airspace , said the situation from the cloud is getting worse . experts tracking the volcano beneath the eyjafjallajokull glacier said there were no signs of reduced activity on friday .
after a relatively minor eruption one month ago , the volcano erupted again on wednesday , with these two incidents breaking almost 200 years of dormancy .
that last recorded eruption continued - with varying levels of severity and intermittent periods of inactivity - for almost 18 months between 1821 and 1823 .
" we have no prediction on how long -lsb- the eruption -rsb- will last , " said geophysicist bergthora thorbjnardottir at the iceland meteorological office .
hundreds of thousands stranded westerly and north-westerly winds have blown the ash across swathes of northern and central europe , grounding some 17,000 flights on friday , after around 6,000 were cancelled on thursday .
the disruption is costing airlines over 148 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- per day .
currently , only emergency flights are permitted into and out of the affected regions in europe .
all 16 international airports in germany were closed on saturday with no flights set to take off until at least 2pm on sunday .

the eurostar train service linking britain and mainland europe via the channel tunnel is fully booked , with the company reporting 38,000 travelers on friday , 10,000 more than average .

more than 20 countries have closed their airspace with some countries calling off all flights until monday morning . european flights remained grounded on saturday due to a vast cloud of volcanic ash from iceland that has covered much of europe and has spread as far east as russia .
britain , ireland , switzerland , and belgium all extended their flight bans on saturday .
more than 20 european countries grounded flights because of the ash cloud .
the disruption hit german chancellor angela merkel who was trying to return to berlin from the united states on friday when her plane was diverted to lisbon .
she flew to rome on saturday , having to spend the night in italy . the chancellor will therefore be unable to attend the funeral of polish president lech kaczynski on sunday .
in addition , flights bringing home the bodies of german soldiers killed in afghanistan along with soldiers wounded in the country were redirected to turkey .
bildunterschrift : the last time the volcano erupted , in the 19th century , it continued sporadically for over a year things could get worse volcanic ash can terminally damage the engines and windows of jetliners .
the national air traffic services , which oversees british airspace , said the situation from the cloud is getting worse . experts tracking the volcano beneath the eyjafjallajokull glacier said there were no signs of reduced activity on friday .
after a relatively minor eruption one month ago , the volcano erupted again on wednesday , with these two incidents breaking almost 200 years of dormancy .
that last recorded eruption continued - with varying levels of severity and intermittent periods of inactivity - for almost 18 months between 1821 and 1823 .
" we have no prediction on how long -lsb- the eruption -rsb- will last , " said geophysicist bergthora thorbjnardottir at the iceland meteorological office .
hundreds of thousands stranded westerly and north-westerly winds have blown the ash across swathes of northern and central europe , grounding some 17,000 flights on friday , after around 6,000 were cancelled on thursday .
the disruption is costing airlines over 148 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- per day .
currently , only emergency flights are permitted into and out of the affected regions in europe .
all 16 international airports in germany were closed on saturday with no flights set to take off until at least 2pm on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train operators and others are getting extra business germany 's national rail service , deutsche bahn , has reported a surge in demand as travellers look for another way to reach their destination .
" we have a lot more people booking tickets , and are putting every train at our disposal into action , " a bahn spokesman told german public broadcaster ard .
" everything that can run is running . "

more than 20 countries have closed their airspace with some countries calling off all flights until monday morning . european flights remained grounded on saturday due to a vast cloud of volcanic ash from iceland that has covered much of europe and has spread as far east as russia .
britain , ireland , switzerland , and belgium all extended their flight bans on saturday .
more than 20 european countries grounded flights because of the ash cloud .
the disruption hit german chancellor angela merkel who was trying to return to berlin from the united states on friday when her plane was diverted to lisbon .
she flew to rome on saturday , having to spend the night in italy . the chancellor will therefore be unable to attend the funeral of polish president lech kaczynski on sunday .
in addition , flights bringing home the bodies of german soldiers killed in afghanistan along with soldiers wounded in the country were redirected to turkey .
bildunterschrift : the last time the volcano erupted , in the 19th century , it continued sporadically for over a year things could get worse volcanic ash can terminally damage the engines and windows of jetliners .
the national air traffic services , which oversees british airspace , said the situation from the cloud is getting worse . experts tracking the volcano beneath the eyjafjallajokull glacier said there were no signs of reduced activity on friday .
after a relatively minor eruption one month ago , the volcano erupted again on wednesday , with these two incidents breaking almost 200 years of dormancy .
that last recorded eruption continued - with varying levels of severity and intermittent periods of inactivity - for almost 18 months between 1821 and 1823 .
" we have no prediction on how long -lsb- the eruption -rsb- will last , " said geophysicist bergthora thorbjnardottir at the iceland meteorological office .
hundreds of thousands stranded westerly and north-westerly winds have blown the ash across swathes of northern and central europe , grounding some 17,000 flights on friday , after around 6,000 were cancelled on thursday .
the disruption is costing airlines over 148 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- per day .
currently , only emergency flights are permitted into and out of the affected regions in europe .
all 16 international airports in germany were closed on saturday with no flights set to take off until at least 2pm on sunday .

it 's vettel 's third pole in four races this season . sebastian vettel claimed a last-gasp pole position in shanghai on saturday , and will line up at the head of the field for formula one 's chinese grand prix .
it 's vettel 's third pole position in four races , with his red bull teammate mark webber qualifying second .
vettel had appeared to be struggling over the course of the weekend . yet when it mattered most , in the dying moments of the final segment of qualifying -lrb- " q3 " -rrb- , he found another gear and laid down comfortably the fastest lap of the entire weekend .
" how do you do that ? "
vettel 's bewildered race engineer asked over team radio , immediately after the german lit up the timing screens .
" woohoo !
yes , baby ! " replied the 22-year old .
red bull have dominated qualifying this season , with one of their cars starting at the front for every race so far .
however , in china it looked like mclaren 's lewis hamilton had the upper hand , especially in the high-speed sections of the circuit .
" what a qualifying session , it was pretty incredible , " vettel said in the press conference afterwards .
" at the start of the session i was n't entirely happy , especially in the first sector of the lap , but by the end i was totally satisfied with the car , and was the quickest driver across almost the entire lap . "
" i want to say thanks to the mechanics , they certainly did n't get a lunch break today !
they had to work flat out between practice and qualifying to fix the problems we were having with the car but , as always , they did a great job . "
if vettel - who won the last race in malaysia - can convert his qualifying performance into another win on sunday , he would be guaranteed to take the lead in the world championship , regardless of where his competition finishes .
mixed fortunes at mercedes behind the red bull duo , ferrari 's spanish double world champion , fernando alonso , secured third place , with mercedes driver nico rosberg an impressive fourth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosberg has been overshadowing veteran teammate schumacher " i 'd say i 'm pretty happy , " rosberg told german television .
" this morning it looked much worse for us , but now we 're really close to the front .
red bull seems to have a bit of an advantage , but then there 's us and ferrari not far behind . "
however , mercedes ' other german driver , seven-time champion michael schumacher , qualified far behind his teammate in ninth , seven tenths of a second -lrb- a deceptively long time in formula one terms -rrb- adrift of rosberg .
" i know where i lost those seven tenths , so i can handle it , " schumacher said .
" but of course it 's a pity .
nico has a well set-up car , and he got the best out of it , and obviously i would have liked to achieve the same .
i shall try to do so in the race tomorrow . "
so far , either through reliability problems or a lack of speed , the highly anticipated return of schumacher to f1 after three years away has not delivered impressive results - with qualifying pace arguably his biggest problem .
sutil impresses again germany 's other strong qualifier was adrian sutil , driving for the relatively small force india team .
the 27-year old , who has never scored a top three finish in his career , starts just behind f1 's most successful driver schumacher in tenth position .
sutil has been in the top ten at the start of every race this year , by far the best performance of his career to date , but the other cars ahead of him are likely to prove too strong in the race on sunday .
the mclaren drivers jenson button and lewis hamilton - who were tipped to shine in shanghai - line up fifth and sixth , ferrari 's felipe massa starts seventh , and robert kubica grabbed eighth place for renault .
germany 's rookie nico hulkenberg is a rather disappointing sixteenth on the grid for williams , with countryman timo glock nineteenth in his virgin racing car .
glock wins the dubious honor , once again , of being the fastest driver at any of formula one 's three new teams - all of whom have been well adrift of the rest of the field so far this season .

it 's also caused major financial losses for airlines and sent their stocks tumbling . airlines were reeling saturday as flights and passengers remained grounded for a third straight day due to the icelandic volcanic ash cloud hovering over much of europe .
large flag carriers and no-frills airlines alike saw their shares dip on friday . the eurocontrol air traffic agency in brussels estimates that nearly 60 per cent of the region 's 28,000 daily flights , have been affected by the volcanic ash . british airways shares closed down more than 3 per cent on friday , while in ireland budget airline ryanair was down 2.3 per cent .
europe 's largest airline by revenue , lufthansa , ended the day down 4 per cent , while air france-klm slid by 3.4 per cent .
the disruption in travel is costing airliners roughly 148 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- in lost revenues per day .
after friday , about 16,000 flights were cancelled , making it the largest airspace shutdown since the second world war .
" in addition to lost revenues , airlines will incur added costs for re-routing of aircraft , care for stranded passengers and stranded aircraft at various ports , " the aviation industry body iata said in a statement on friday .
the association of european airlines estimated that the european economy had lost about one billion euros so far from flight bans across the continent .
however , airline reinsurers played down the potential of the ash cloud to greatly disturb business , hurt agriculture , or cause property damage .
" as long as the restriction to air travel remains temporary as is now expected , there should be no measureable impact for the broader economy , " said reinsurer munich re in a statement .
" it 's just an issue for the airlines to handle . "
airlines are typically not insured against cancellations .

the cloud has even affected the hotel industry throughout asia , as dozens of cancelled european flights have left hotels struggling to accommodate thousands of passengers .
but according to energy company officials , oil , gas , and electricity production in europe is not likely to suffer .
the one direct effect from the ash cloud is that offshore workers in the north sea will have to wait longer for replacements , as helicopters were also grounded as part of the flight ban .

large flag carriers and no-frills airlines alike saw their shares dip on friday . the eurocontrol air traffic agency in brussels estimates that nearly 60 per cent of the region 's 28,000 daily flights , have been affected by the volcanic ash . british airways shares closed down more than 3 per cent on friday , while in ireland budget airline ryanair was down 2.3 per cent .
europe 's largest airline by revenue , lufthansa , ended the day down 4 per cent , while air france-klm slid by 3.4 per cent .
the disruption in travel is costing airliners roughly 148 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- in lost revenues per day .
after friday , about 16,000 flights were cancelled , making it the largest airspace shutdown since the second world war .
" in addition to lost revenues , airlines will incur added costs for re-routing of aircraft , care for stranded passengers and stranded aircraft at various ports , " the aviation industry body iata said in a statement on friday .
the association of european airlines estimated that the european economy had lost about one billion euros so far from flight bans across the continent .
however , airline reinsurers played down the potential of the ash cloud to greatly disturb business , hurt agriculture , or cause property damage .
" as long as the restriction to air travel remains temporary as is now expected , there should be no measureable impact for the broader economy , " said reinsurer munich re in a statement .
" it 's just an issue for the airlines to handle . "
airlines are typically not insured against cancellations .
other industries affected deutsche post , europe 's largest mail and express delivery company , said the cloud has disrupted delivery by air and the company has switched to land transport where possible .
the cloud has even affected the hotel industry throughout asia , as dozens of cancelled european flights have left hotels struggling to accommodate thousands of passengers .
but according to energy company officials , oil , gas , and electricity production in europe is not likely to suffer .
the one direct effect from the ash cloud is that offshore workers in the north sea will have to wait longer for replacements , as helicopters were also grounded as part of the flight ban .
flight bans have been imposed by more than 15 european countries .
britain , germany , finland , slovakia , estonia and denmark have extended their bans until sunday. mk / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 17.04.2010 un troops unlikely to pull out from congo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monuc troops on patrol in kinshasa - the congolese capital in march , the congolese government asked the un mission to withdraw all its troops .
but the recent violence raises questions as to whether the government can actually secure the country without international help . next month , france is due to present a draft of a new resolution on the un mandate for the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- to the un security council . many observers are already asking how the recent violence in mbandaka in the northwestern province of equateur , where rebels seized an airport and killed 13 people , will affect the future of the un 's involvement .
with more than 20,000 troops , the un mission -lrb- monuc -rrb- is the largest and most expensive on the planet .
monuc arrived in drc in 1999 when what is now known as the second congo war involved seven other african countries : zimbabwe , angola , chad , namibia , burundi , rwanda , and uganda .
the countries supported opposing sides - laurent kabila 's government or rebel groups in eastern congo - for different reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobutu was toppled by laurent kabila in the first congo war -lrb- 1996 - 97 -rrb- angola supported kabila because he defeated mobutu sese seko , who had helped jonas savimbi 's unita in angola 's civil war which spanned over two decades .
on the other hand , rwanda helped the rally for congolese democracy -lrb- rcd -rrb- to support tutsis in drc against hutu militias .
but rwanda , much like uganda , has been part of the war also to exploit natural resources - especially diamonds - in eastern congo .
more than 5 million people have died since 1998 as a result of the conflict .
and those who have not died directly continue to die from malnutrition or preventable diseases like cholera while thousands of women , especially in the kivu region , have been raped and many infected with hiv .
monuc and congolese army not on the same page monuc was sent to strengthen the congolese national forces and protect the population .
but many feel that it has not helped .
in fact , in " killings in kiwanja : the un 's inability to protect civilians , " human rights watch reports that monuc has failed to protect the population .
it says that monuc 's failure led to the massacre of 150 people in kiwanja in december 2008 , and that un troops have raped girls and women in eastern congo .
james paul , executive director of the global policy forum , agrees that un forces have failed to protect the population .
in part , because they were expected to work with the congolese forces which have also been accused of human rights violations , including the rape of thousands of women .
" there have been problems in the relationship between the peacekeepers and the congolese army because of concern that the un has been identified with the violations , " paul said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of women and girls have been raped by rebels as a result , instead of working with the congolese army as it should have , monuc has distanced itself from the congolese army so as not to be complicit in the latter 's actions .
" the relations between monuc and the congolese government have deteriorated extremely over the last couple of years because they do n't see eye to eye on many issues , " denis tull , a research fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
next year 's election ups the stakes last month 's announcement by the congolese government that it wanted all un troops to leave the country by august 2011 should have come as no surprise .
but its timing was strategic .
" with the upcoming 50th anniversary of congo 's independence in june , the government does not want to see a permanent presence of the un , " tull said .
observers say the government wants to take credit for the achievements that have taken place since monuc arrived in 1999 . this would put it in good light for the presidential elections in 2011 .
in spite of the criticism against monuc , it has helped to reduce the extent of the conflict and helped congo hold its first democratic elections in over four decades in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president joseph kabila won the elections in 2006 " president kabila wants to be able to say to the congolese people that he made the un mission leave because there is peace in the country , " tull said .
fabienne hara , the vice-president of multilateral relations at the international crisis group , agrees .
she told deutsche welle that " one of the reasons why the congolese government wants to see monuc withdraw is that they also want to be in charge of their own elections . "
un troops withdrawal unlikely however , it is unlikely that the congolese government will get exactly what it wants .
even though 2,000 un troops are to leave congo by june 30th , a report in march by un secretary general ban ki-moon , recommends that troops remain in the more unstable eastern congo .
also , the recent violence in equateur will very likely affect the future of the un mission .
" this new episode in equateur shows that even western congo is not completely stable despite what the government is saying .
there 's still some serious sources of tensions elsewhere in the congo , " hara said .
the un security council delegation visiting the democratic republic of congo over the next few days will most certainly take the recent violence in equateur into consideration , and un troops are expected to remain in the eastern part of the country because " any withdrawal from eastern congo would be a major catastrophe for the civilian population , " tull said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 17.04.2010 un troops unlikely to pull out from congo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monuc troops on patrol in kinshasa - the congolese capital in march , the congolese government asked the un mission to withdraw all its troops .
but the recent violence raises questions as to whether the government can actually secure the country without international help . next month , france is due to present a draft of a new resolution on the un mandate for the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- to the un security council . many observers are already asking how the recent violence in mbandaka in the northwestern province of equateur , where rebels seized an airport and killed 13 people , will affect the future of the un 's involvement .
with more than 20,000 troops , the un mission -lrb- monuc -rrb- is the largest and most expensive on the planet .
monuc arrived in drc in 1999 when what is now known as the second congo war involved seven other african countries : zimbabwe , angola , chad , namibia , burundi , rwanda , and uganda .
the countries supported opposing sides - laurent kabila 's government or rebel groups in eastern congo - for different reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobutu was toppled by laurent kabila in the first congo war -lrb- 1996 - 97 -rrb- angola supported kabila because he defeated mobutu sese seko , who had helped jonas savimbi 's unita in angola 's civil war which spanned over two decades .
on the other hand , rwanda helped the rally for congolese democracy -lrb- rcd -rrb- to support tutsis in drc against hutu militias .
but rwanda , much like uganda , has been part of the war also to exploit natural resources - especially diamonds - in eastern congo .
more than 5 million people have died since 1998 as a result of the conflict .
and those who have not died directly continue to die from malnutrition or preventable diseases like cholera while thousands of women , especially in the kivu region , have been raped and many infected with hiv .
monuc and congolese army not on the same page monuc was sent to strengthen the congolese national forces and protect the population .
but many feel that it has not helped .
in fact , in " killings in kiwanja : the un 's inability to protect civilians , " human rights watch reports that monuc has failed to protect the population .
it says that monuc 's failure led to the massacre of 150 people in kiwanja in december 2008 , and that un troops have raped girls and women in eastern congo .
james paul , executive director of the global policy forum , agrees that un forces have failed to protect the population .
in part , because they were expected to work with the congolese forces which have also been accused of human rights violations , including the rape of thousands of women .
" there have been problems in the relationship between the peacekeepers and the congolese army because of concern that the un has been identified with the violations , " paul said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of women and girls have been raped by rebels as a result , instead of working with the congolese army as it should have , monuc has distanced itself from the congolese army so as not to be complicit in the latter 's actions .
" the relations between monuc and the congolese government have deteriorated extremely over the last couple of years because they do n't see eye to eye on many issues , " denis tull , a research fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
next year 's election ups the stakes last month 's announcement by the congolese government that it wanted all un troops to leave the country by august 2011 should have come as no surprise .
but its timing was strategic .
" with the upcoming 50th anniversary of congo 's independence in june , the government does not want to see a permanent presence of the un , " tull said .
observers say the government wants to take credit for the achievements that have taken place since monuc arrived in 1999 . this would put it in good light for the presidential elections in 2011 .
in spite of the criticism against monuc , it has helped to reduce the extent of the conflict and helped congo hold its first democratic elections in over four decades in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president joseph kabila won the elections in 2006 " president kabila wants to be able to say to the congolese people that he made the un mission leave because there is peace in the country , " tull said .
fabienne hara , the vice-president of multilateral relations at the international crisis group , agrees .
she told deutsche welle that " one of the reasons why the congolese government wants to see monuc withdraw is that they also want to be in charge of their own elections . "
un troops withdrawal unlikely however , it is unlikely that the congolese government will get exactly what it wants .
even though 2,000 un troops are to leave congo by june 30th , a report in march by un secretary general ban ki-moon , recommends that troops remain in the more unstable eastern congo .
also , the recent violence in equateur will very likely affect the future of the un mission .
" this new episode in equateur shows that even western congo is not completely stable despite what the government is saying .
there 's still some serious sources of tensions elsewhere in the congo , " hara said .
the un security council delegation visiting the democratic republic of congo over the next few days will most certainly take the recent violence in equateur into consideration , and un troops are expected to remain in the eastern part of the country because " any withdrawal from eastern congo would be a major catastrophe for the civilian population , " tull said .

they 've been in the country for decades , but the mainstream food industry is only just starting to cater to them . customers walking through the aisles of some paris area supermarkets are now likely to find halal meat and processed foods .
whether it 's spicy ready-to-eat chicken wings , halal pate , or mock ham made from turkey , halal products are increasingly making their way into mainstream shopping venues .
it may not seem like much , but for france this marks a striking change .
this was made evident last summer when the zakia food brand aired the first nationally broadcast television commercial for halal food .
it turned enough heads to make it into french newscasts .
halal means legal or lawful in arabic and refers to foods that are sanctioned by islamic authorities .
pork , blood and alcohol are not halal .
food industry observers say supermarkets and the rest of the food industry are just following the money trail .
" five and a half billion euros are going to be spent on these kinds of products this year in france , " said abbas bendali , the head of solis , a market research firm specialized in ethnic niches .
" there are five million potential customers .
so this is more than a niche , this is a real consumer segment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french food companies are shedding their misconceptions about halal meat new generation of customers a few years ago , halal foods could only be found in small shops in low-rent immigrant neighborhoods .
now france 's second largest supermarket chain , casino , has hired abderrahman bouzid to manage the halal and traditional muslim foods sold in its 10,000 stores .
he said the market is growing thanks to a new generation of french muslims .
" those under the age of 40 do n't have any hang-ups about affirming who they are ; they want to be taken into consideration , " bouzid said , explaining that muslim consumers are perfectly aware of their buying power and will prefer retailers that offer halal products .
" they 're saying ' if you are dismissive of my needs , by ignoring my customs and my preferences , i wo n't shop in your business ' , " he added .
casino has even created its own halal product line , which it markets under the name wassila .
others in the food industry are following suit .
international brands such as knorr , maggi , liebig and french firms like duc and fleury michon have all started selling halal options .
they now compete with established halal brands such as zakia , isla delice and medina .
attitudes shift some of these brands and others recently attended a halal trade show in paris , where visitors could find everything from halal foie gras and faux-bacon cheese burgers to microwaveable halal meals such as lasagna and chicken curry with rice .
antoine bonnel started the fair six years ago , when it attracted far fewer exhibitors .
this year , 100 companies participated .
bonnel said he has noticed an attitude shift in the food industry .
in the past , mainstream brands did n't want to be associates with halal because it was considered low-brow , he said , adding that french muslims had little money and unenviable social positions .
" these people came from a very poor immigrant background , " bonnel said .
" so the global image was a cheap image . "
there were also misconceptions about the ritual slaughter of animals required for meat to be considered halal .
and there were rumors that some of the taxes for this ritual could be funneled to questionable foreign causes .
bildunterschrift : young muslims represent a significant consumer segment some of this unease came to the surface earlier this year , when fast food chain quick revealed it had made eight of its 362 restaurants halal .
several french politicians criticized the move and the extreme-right national front highlighted the company in its anti-immigrant rhetoric .
but from a business perspective , the new buying power and improved social status of the young muslim generation are sweeping misgivings to the side .
sweeter than champagne the upcoming french launch of a non-alcoholic sparkling wine is just one example of that .
the drink , called " night orient , " is sold in what looks like a champagne bottle and provides people with the satisfying pop that comes with opening a bottle of real champagne .
" we decided to launch a festive drink for muslims , completely alcohol free , " said arnaud jacquemin , one of the drink 's creators .
" for weddings , for birthdays or the end of the year they have to drink orange juice , or soda , which is n't festive . "
jacquemin is n't himself muslim , but while working in the beverage industry , he saw sales of non-alcoholic drinks consistently rise and realized this market was largely untapped .
night orient tastes far sweeter than real champagne .
focus group testing showed the version initially developed was a little too dry for consumers unaccustomed to drinking wine .
so the formula was changed to better appeal to the muslim palate .
the beverage had a successful test run in some paris area supermarkets .
the small company has since signed deals with four national retail chains to officially launch the beverage in france during ramadan later this year .

but now this pristine winemaking region is threatened by a bridge that is to span the valley , against the wishes of many locals and winemakers . the moselle valley in western germany is known for its picturesque views and world-famous moselle riesling wine .
the region thrives on the wine industry and the tourism that it brings .
in an effort to boost access to the valley , the national and state government have launched a project to build a bridge across the moselle valley .
supporters of the project say it will boost tourism in the region by shortening the travel time between neighboring belgium and luxembourg .
they say traffic congestion will be relieved for locals , and commercial connections to nearby airports will be improved .
but not everyone in the valley is convinced that building the bridge is worth it .
they 're afraid the damage to the landscape and the environment will outweigh the benefits .
pro-moselle bildunterschrift : pictures from pro-moselle showing the valley as it is and what will change with the bridge a group of citizens in the valley have formed a group called pro-moselle .
they are against the construction of the bridge , and have started a number of initiatives to try to stop construction .
last spring the group stopped tractors from digging at the official groundbreaking ceremony of the bridge , and a petition against the bridge can be signed on the group 's web site or at one of their regularly scheduled sunday demonstrations .
on sundays , members of the group meet in the town of bernkastel to gather signatures .
they hold two panoramic photographs : one shows how the valley looks now , while the other shows the same image but with the proposed bridge added in .
" these pictures alone say it all , " a woman visiting from moenchengladbach who signed the petition told deutsche welle .
" we 're enjoying the landscape here as tourists , without a bridge .
with a bridge , it is unthinkable . "
wine allies plans for the bridge have been on the books since the late 1960s , but it was n't until late 2008 that the project was given the green light .
most of the 270 million euros -lrb- $ 366 million -rrb- budgeted for the project is coming from the federal government , with the government of the state of rhineland-palatinate chipping in 20 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wine expert hugh johnson says moselle riesling is one of a kind the pro-moselle group has gained support from german politicians and leaders in the wine world .
former foreign minister joschka fisher and the co-leader of the greens ' parliamentary party , renate kuenast , are on board , as is hugh johnson , a world-renowned wine writer from britain .
johnson calls the planned bridge a ' road on stilts . '
in a video posted on the pro-moselle website , he calls on the citizens of the area to stand up and fight for the moselle valley and its one-of-a-kind wine .
" i can tell you that the whole world has nothing comparable to a moselle riesling .
you can imitate the wine of bordeaux in the napa valley , " johnson said .
" you can even imitate the wine of burgundy in certain places .
but there is nothing that even starts to imitate great moselle riesling . "
a long tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus berres markus berres runs the c.h. berres winery in uerzig , a town that will basically fall under the shadow of the bridge once it is completed .
his family has been in the business for 500 years , and the 31-year-old winemaker is part of the 21st generation to run the family business in the moselle valley .
he fears that tourists will be driven away once the bridge is built .
" this region lives from tourism and winemaking , " berres said in an interview with deutsche welle , " but who wants to take their holiday under a bridge ?
nobody .
so i do n't see any advantage to building the bridge . "
the state 's transportation minister , hendrik hering , announced that 35 million euros would be reinvested in the environment as a measure of compensation .
however , winemakers are still worried about the bridge 's effect on the water supply for the grapes growing on the slopes of the valley , or how the grapes will react to the additional car exhaust .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although it is years from completion , signs of the bridge are apparent " the vines will be growing with the bridge or without the bridge , " said markus berres .
" the question is , how high will the quality be ? "
too late to be stopped ?
preparation work is already underway on the bridge .
a receding tree line and dirt access roads are starting to give an indication of what the area will look like once the bridge is complete .
pro-moselle insists that as long as construction has not started , the bridge can still be stopped .
markus berres predicts that many people will move away from the valley if the bridge is completed .
in either case , berres says he 'll stay .
his family has made its living in the moselle valley for centuries , and berres plans to keep the tradition alive .
but for him , making germany 's famous moselle riesling wine just wo n't be the same in the shadow of a bridge .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 17.04.2010 french supermarkets tap rising demand for halal food großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : halal fast food has finally caught on in france with an estimated five million muslims , france has the biggest islamic population in europe .
they 've been in the country for decades , but the mainstream food industry is only just starting to cater to them . customers walking through the aisles of some paris area supermarkets are now likely to find halal meat and processed foods .
whether it 's spicy ready-to-eat chicken wings , halal pate , or mock ham made from turkey , halal products are increasingly making their way into mainstream shopping venues .
it may not seem like much , but for france this marks a striking change .
this was made evident last summer when the zakia food brand aired the first nationally broadcast television commercial for halal food .
it turned enough heads to make it into french newscasts .
halal means legal or lawful in arabic and refers to foods that are sanctioned by islamic authorities .
pork , blood and alcohol are not halal .
food industry observers say supermarkets and the rest of the food industry are just following the money trail .
" five and a half billion euros are going to be spent on these kinds of products this year in france , " said abbas bendali , the head of solis , a market research firm specialized in ethnic niches .
" there are five million potential customers .
so this is more than a niche , this is a real consumer segment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french food companies are shedding their misconceptions about halal meat new generation of customers a few years ago , halal foods could only be found in small shops in low-rent immigrant neighborhoods .
now france 's second largest supermarket chain , casino , has hired abderrahman bouzid to manage the halal and traditional muslim foods sold in its 10,000 stores .
he said the market is growing thanks to a new generation of french muslims .
" those under the age of 40 do n't have any hang-ups about affirming who they are ; they want to be taken into consideration , " bouzid said , explaining that muslim consumers are perfectly aware of their buying power and will prefer retailers that offer halal products .
" they 're saying ' if you are dismissive of my needs , by ignoring my customs and my preferences , i wo n't shop in your business ' , " he added .
casino has even created its own halal product line , which it markets under the name wassila .
others in the food industry are following suit .
international brands such as knorr , maggi , liebig and french firms like duc and fleury michon have all started selling halal options .
they now compete with established halal brands such as zakia , isla delice and medina .
attitudes shift some of these brands and others recently attended a halal trade show in paris , where visitors could find everything from halal foie gras and faux-bacon cheese burgers to microwaveable halal meals such as lasagna and chicken curry with rice .
antoine bonnel started the fair six years ago , when it attracted far fewer exhibitors .
this year , 100 companies participated .
bonnel said he has noticed an attitude shift in the food industry .
in the past , mainstream brands did n't want to be associates with halal because it was considered low-brow , he said , adding that french muslims had little money and unenviable social positions .
" these people came from a very poor immigrant background , " bonnel said .
" so the global image was a cheap image . "
there were also misconceptions about the ritual slaughter of animals required for meat to be considered halal .
and there were rumors that some of the taxes for this ritual could be funneled to questionable foreign causes .
bildunterschrift : young muslims represent a significant consumer segment some of this unease came to the surface earlier this year , when fast food chain quick revealed it had made eight of its 362 restaurants halal .
several french politicians criticized the move and the extreme-right national front highlighted the company in its anti-immigrant rhetoric .
but from a business perspective , the new buying power and improved social status of the young muslim generation are sweeping misgivings to the side .
sweeter than champagne the upcoming french launch of a non-alcoholic sparkling wine is just one example of that .
the drink , called " night orient , " is sold in what looks like a champagne bottle and provides people with the satisfying pop that comes with opening a bottle of real champagne .
" we decided to launch a festive drink for muslims , completely alcohol free , " said arnaud jacquemin , one of the drink 's creators .
" for weddings , for birthdays or the end of the year they have to drink orange juice , or soda , which is n't festive . "
jacquemin is n't himself muslim , but while working in the beverage industry , he saw sales of non-alcoholic drinks consistently rise and realized this market was largely untapped .
night orient tastes far sweeter than real champagne .
focus group testing showed the version initially developed was a little too dry for consumers unaccustomed to drinking wine .
so the formula was changed to better appeal to the muslim palate .
the beverage had a successful test run in some paris area supermarkets .
the small company has since signed deals with four national retail chains to officially launch the beverage in france during ramadan later this year .

the minister left the isaf camp in masar-i-sharif after the disruption to european airspace had already begun , but guttenberg hoped he would nonetheless make it back to germany . the defense minister was travelling with five bundeswehr soldiers wounded in a taliban attack in northern afghanistan on thursday . the group was first taken to a german military base in uzbekistan to board a medical transport carrier heading towards europe .
the soldiers were meant to be brought to military hospitals in germany to ensure that they would receive optimal care . with the plane redirected to turkey , the soldiers have spent the night at a us hospital in istanbul and are to continue to germany only at a later stage .
guttenberg on saturday continued his way back to germany albeit it remained unclear by which means of transportation . an ash cloud from a volcanic eruption in iceland on friday spread over most of europe , leading to more than half of all flights being cancelled .
germany 's entire airspace is affected by the problem , which has caused all major airports to be shut down . funeral for fallen soldiers set for sunday guttenberg had been scheduled to return to germany on thursday after a two-day visit to afghanistan . while in transit in uzbekistan , however , he was notified of the bloody attack - which killed four bundeswehr soldiers .
the minister subsequently returned to afghanistan with the bundeswehr 's chief of staff , volker wieker .
guttenberg visited the wounded soldiers at the german military base in masar-i-sharif on friday as they waited for a military aircraft equipped with proper medical equipment to bring them back to germany .
bundeswehr officials report that the wounded troops are all in stable condition .
while four of the five soldiers have sustained serious injuries , these are not believed to be life-threatening .
wieker is scheduled to stay on in afghanistan to attend the funeral service for the four soldiers , which is planned for sunday in the masar-i-sharif camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's funeral would follow a service held just last week explosive , not rocket , triggered thursday 's ambush the latest german casualties came after a bundeswehr patrol came under attack travelling between kunduz and baghlan on thursday .
after initially reporting that the deadly ambush began when a german armored vehicle was struck by a rocket close to pol-i-khomri camp , germany 's defense ministry on friday corrected this , saying the attackers used a remotely detonated explosive device .
three bundeswehr soldiers died in the initial explosion , with the fourth killed in an ensuing battle , in which the isaf troops are believed to have come under mortar and gunfire .
a total of 43 german soldiers have now been killed in afghanistan since the bundeswehr mission began in 2002 .
of those , 26 have been killed in firefights or insurgent attacks .
in recent weeks , taliban insurgents have stepped up pressure on the german troops based in the northern province of kunduz .

but now this pristine winemaking region is threatened by a bridge that is to span the valley , against the wishes of many locals and winemakers . the mosel valley in western germany is known for its picturesque views and world-famous mosel riesling wine .
the region thrives on the wine industry and the tourism that it brings .
in an effort to boost access to the valley , the national and state government have launched a project to build a bridge across the mosel valley .
supporters of the project say it will boost tourism in the region by shortening the travel time between neighbouring belgium and luxembourg .
they say traffic congestion will be relieved for locals , and commercial connections to nearby airports will be improved .
but not everyone in the mosel valley is convinced that building the bridge is worth it .
they 're afraid the damage to the landscape and the environment will outweigh the benefits .
pro-mosel bildunterschrift : pictures from pro-mosel showing the mosel valley as it is and what will change with the bridge a group of citizens in the valley have formed a group called pro-mosel .
they are against the construction of the bridge , and have started a number of initiatives to try to stop construction .
last spring the group stopped tractors from digging at the official groundbreaking ceremony of the bridge , and a petition against the bridge can be signed on the group 's web site or at one of their regularly scheduled sunday demonstrations .
on sundays , members of the group meet in the town of bernkastel to gather signatures .
they hold two panoramic photographs : one shows how the valley looks now , while the other shows the same image but with the proposed bridge added in .
" these pictures alone say it all , " a german woman visiting from moenchengladbach who signed the petition told deutsche welle .
" we 're enjoying the landscape here as tourists , without a bridge .
with a bridge , it is unthinkable . "
wine allies plans for the bridge have been on the books since the late 1960s , but it was n't until late 2008 that the project was given the green light .
most of the 270 million euros -lrb- $ 366 million -rrb- budgeted for the project is coming from the federal government , with the government of the state of rhineland palatinate chipping in 20 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wine expert high johnson says mosel riesling is one of a kind the pro-mosel group has gained support against the bridge from german politicians and leaders in the wine world .
former foreign minister joschka fisher and the co-leader of the greens ' parliamentary party , renate kuenast , are on board , as is hugh johnson , a world-renowned wine writer from britain .
johnson calls the planned bridge a ' road on stilts . '
in a video posted on the pro-mosel web site , he calls on the citizens of the area to stand up and fight for the mosel valley and its one-of-a-kind wine .
" i can tell you that the whole world has nothing comparable to a mosel riesling .
you can imitate the wine of bordeaux in the napa valley , " johnson said .
" you can even imitate the wine of burgundy in certain places .
but there is nothing that even starts to imitate great mosel riesling . "
a long tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus berres markus berres runs the c.h. berres winery in uerzig , a town that will basically fall under the shadow of the bridge once it is completed .
his family has been in the business for 500 years , and the 31-year-old winemaker is part of the 21st generation to run the family business in the mosel valley .
he fears that tourists will be driven away once the bridge is built .
" this region lives from tourism and winemaking , " berres said in an interview with deutsche welle , " but who wants to take their holiday under a bridge ?
nobody .
so i do n't see any advantage to building the bridge . "
the state 's transportation minister , hendrik hering , announced that 35 million euros would be reinvested in the environment as a measure of compensation .
however , winemakers are still worried about the bridge 's effect on the water supply for the grapes growing on the slopes of the valley , or how the grapes will react to the additional car exhaust .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although it is years from completion , signs of the bridge are apparent " the vines will be growing with the bridge or without the bridge , " said markus berres .
" the question is , how high will the quality be ? "
too late to be stopped ?
preparation work is already underway on the bridge .
a receding tree line and dirt access roads are starting to give an indication of what the area will look like once the bridge is complete .
pro-mosel insists that as long as construction has not started , the bridge can still be stopped .
markus berres predicts that many people will move away from the mosel valley if the bridge is completed .
in either case , berres says he 'll stay .
his family has made its living in the mosel valley for centuries , and berres plans to keep the tradition alive .
but for him , making germany 's famous mosel riesling wine just wo n't be the same in the shadow of a bridge .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 17.04.2010 french supermarkets tap rising demand for halal food großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : halal fast food has finally caught on in france with an estimated five million muslims , france has the biggest islamic population in europe .
they 've been in the country for decades , but the mainstream food industry is only just starting to cater to them . customers walking through the aisles of some paris area supermarkets are now likely to find halal meat and processed foods .
whether it 's spicy ready-to-eat chicken wings , halal pate , or mock ham made from turkey , halal products are increasingly making their way into mainstream shopping venues .
it may not seem like much , but for france this marks a striking change .
this was made evident last summer when the zakia food brand aired the first nationally broadcast television commercial for halal food .
it turned enough heads to make it into french newscasts .
halal means legal or lawful in arabic and refers to foods that are sanctioned by islamic authorities .
pork , blood and alcohol are not halal .
food industry observers say supermarkets and the rest of the food industry are just following the money trail .
" five and a half billion euros are going to be spent on these kinds of products this year in france , " said abbas bendali , the head of solis , a market research firm specialized in ethnic niches .
" there are five million potential customers .
so this is more than a niche , this is a real consumer segment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french food companies are shedding their misconceptions about halal meat new generation of customers a few years ago , halal foods could only be found in small shops in low-rent immigrant neighborhoods .
now france 's second largest supermarket chain , casino , has hired abderrahman bouzid to manage the halal and traditional muslim foods sold in its 10,000 stores .
he said the market is growing thanks to a new generation of french muslims .
" those under the age of 40 do n't have any hang-ups about affirming who they are ; they want to be taken into consideration , " bouzid said , explaining that muslim consumers are perfectly aware of their buying power and will prefer retailers that offer halal products .
" they 're saying ' if you are dismissive of my needs , by ignoring my customs and my preferences , i wo n't shop in your business ' , " he added .
casino has even created its own halal product line , which it markets under the name wassila .
others in the food industry are following suit .
international brands such as knorr , maggi , liebig and french firms like duc and fleury michon have all started selling halal options .
they now compete with established halal brands such as zakia , isla delice and medina .
attitudes shift some of these brands and others recently attended a halal trade show in paris , where visitors could find everything from halal foie gras and faux-bacon cheese burgers to microwaveable halal meals such as lasagna and chicken curry with rice .
antoine bonnel started the fair six years ago , when it attracted far fewer exhibitors .
this year , 100 companies participated .
bonnel said he has noticed an attitude shift in the food industry .
in the past , mainstream brands did n't want to be associates with halal because it was considered low-brow , he said , adding that french muslims had little money and unenviable social positions .
" these people came from a very poor immigrant background , " bonnel said .
" so the global image was a cheap image . "
there were also misconceptions about the ritual slaughter of animals required for meat to be considered halal .
and there were rumors that some of the taxes for this ritual could be funneled to questionable foreign causes .
bildunterschrift : young muslims represent a significant consumer segment some of this unease came to the surface earlier this year , when fast food chain quick revealed it had made eight of its 362 restaurants halal .
several french politicians criticized the move and the extreme-right national front highlighted the company in its anti-immigrant rhetoric .
but from a business perspective , the new buying power and improved social status of the young muslim generation are sweeping misgivings to the side .
sweeter than champagne the upcoming french launch of a non-alcoholic sparkling wine is just one example of that .
the drink , called " night orient , " is sold in what looks like a champagne bottle and provides people with the satisfying pop that comes with opening a bottle of real champagne .
" we decided to launch a festive drink for muslims , completely alcohol free , " said arnaud jacquemin , one of the drink 's creators .
" for weddings , for birthdays or the end of the year they have to drink orange juice , or soda , which is n't festive . "
jacquemin is n't himself muslim , but while working in the beverage industry , he saw sales of non-alcoholic drinks consistently rise and realized this market was largely untapped .
night orient tastes far sweeter than real champagne .
focus group testing showed the version initially developed was a little too dry for consumers unaccustomed to drinking wine .
so the formula was changed to better appeal to the muslim palate .
the beverage had a successful test run in some paris area supermarkets .
the small company has since signed deals with four national retail chains to officially launch the beverage in france during ramadan later this year .

they 've been in the country for decades , but the mainstream food industry is only just starting to cater to them . customers walking through the aisles of some paris area supermarkets are now likely to find halal meat and processed foods .
whether it 's spicy ready-to-eat chicken wings , halal pate , or mock ham made from turkey , halal products are increasingly making their way into mainstream shopping venues .
it may not seem like much , but for france this marks a striking change .
this was made evident last summer when the zakia food brand aired the first nationally broadcast television commercial for halal food .
it turned enough heads to make it into french newscasts .
halal means legal or lawful in arabic and refers to foods that are sanctioned by islamic authorities .
pork , blood and alcohol are not halal .
food industry observers say supermarkets and the rest of the food industry are just following the money trail .
" five and a half billion euros are going to be spent on these kinds of products this year in france , " said abbas bendali , the head of solis , a market research firm specialized in ethnic niches .

now france 's second largest supermarket chain , casino , has hired abderrahman bouzid to manage the halal and traditional muslim foods sold in its 10,000 stores .
he said the market is growing thanks to a new generation of french muslims .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 17.04.2010 german minister , wounded soldiers stranded in istanbul großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg said saturday that two of the soldiers were being operated upon in istanbul german defense minister guttenberg has been stranded in istanbul along with five wounded soldiers as their flight from afghanistan to germany was redirected amid widespread travel chaos in europe . returning from afghanistan on friday , germany defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg had his plane redirected to istanbul .
the minister left the isaf camp in masar-i-sharif after the disruption to european airspace had already begun , but guttenberg hoped he would nonetheless make it back to germany . the defense minister was travelling with five bundeswehr soldiers wounded in a taliban attack in northern afghanistan on thursday . the group was first taken to a german military base in uzbekistan to board a medical transport carrier heading towards europe .
the soldiers were meant to be brought to military hospitals in germany to ensure that they would receive optimal care . with the plane redirected to turkey , the soldiers have spent the night at a us hospital in istanbul and are to continue to germany only at a later stage .
guttenberg on saturday continued his way back to germany albeit it remained unclear by which means of transportation . an ash cloud from a volcanic eruption in iceland on friday spread over most of europe , leading to more than half of all flights being cancelled .
germany 's entire airspace is affected by the problem , which has caused all major airports to be shut down . funeral for fallen soldiers set for sunday guttenberg had been scheduled to return to germany on thursday after a two-day visit to afghanistan . while in transit in uzbekistan , however , he was notified of the bloody attack - which killed four bundeswehr soldiers .
the minister subsequently returned to afghanistan with the bundeswehr 's chief of staff , volker wieker .
guttenberg visited the wounded soldiers at the german military base in masar-i-sharif on friday as they waited for a military aircraft equipped with proper medical equipment to bring them back to germany .
bundeswehr officials report that the wounded troops are all in stable condition .
while four of the five soldiers have sustained serious injuries , these are not believed to be life-threatening .
wieker is scheduled to stay on in afghanistan to attend the funeral service for the four soldiers , which is planned for sunday in the masar-i-sharif camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's funeral would follow a service held just last week explosive , not rocket , triggered thursday 's ambush the latest german casualties came after a bundeswehr patrol came under attack travelling between kunduz and baghlan on thursday .
after initially reporting that the deadly ambush began when a german armored vehicle was struck by a rocket close to pol-i-khomri camp , germany 's defense ministry on friday corrected this , saying the attackers used a remotely detonated explosive device .
three bundeswehr soldiers died in the initial explosion , with the fourth killed in an ensuing battle , in which the isaf troops are believed to have come under mortar and gunfire .
a total of 43 german soldiers have now been killed in afghanistan since the bundeswehr mission began in 2002 .
of those , 26 have been killed in firefights or insurgent attacks .
in recent weeks , taliban insurgents have stepped up pressure on the german troops based in the northern province of kunduz .
on april 2 , three german soldiers were killed during a mine-clearing expedition. ai / glb / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : young muslims represent a significant consumer segment some of this unease came to the surface earlier this year , when fast food chain quick revealed it had made eight of its 362 restaurants halal .
several french politicians criticized the move and the extreme-right national front highlighted the company in its anti-immigrant rhetoric .
but from a business perspective , the new buying power and improved social status of the young muslim generation are sweeping misgivings to the side .
sweeter than champagne the upcoming french launch of a non-alcoholic sparkling wine is just one example of that .
the drink , called " night orient , " is sold in what looks like a champagne bottle and provides people with the satisfying pop that comes with opening a bottle of real champagne .
" we decided to launch a festive drink for muslims , completely alcohol free , " said arnaud jacquemin , one of the drink 's creators .
" for weddings , for birthdays or the end of the year they have to drink orange juice , or soda , which is n't festive . "
jacquemin is n't himself muslim , but while working in the beverage industry , he saw sales of non-alcoholic drinks consistently rise and realized this market was largely untapped .
night orient tastes far sweeter than real champagne .
focus group testing showed the version initially developed was a little too dry for consumers unaccustomed to drinking wine .
so the formula was changed to better appeal to the muslim palate .
the beverage had a successful test run in some paris area supermarkets .
the small company has since signed deals with four national retail chains to officially launch the beverage in france during ramadan later this year .

they 've been in the country for decades , but the mainstream food industry is only just starting to cater to them . customers walking through the aisles of some paris area supermarkets are now likely to find halal meat and processed foods .
whether it 's spicy ready-to-eat chicken wings , halal pate , or mock ham made from turkey , halal products are increasingly making their way into mainstream shopping venues .
it may not seem like much , but for france this marks a striking change .
this was made evident last summer when the zakia food brand aired the first nationally broadcast television commercial for halal food .
it turned enough heads to make it into french newscasts .
halal means legal or lawful in arabic and refers to foods that are sanctioned by islamic authorities .
pork , blood and alcohol are not halal .
food industry observers say supermarkets and the rest of the food industry are just following the money trail .
" five and a half billion euros are going to be spent on these kinds of products this year in france , " said abbas bendali , the head of solis , a market research firm specialized in ethnic niches .
" there are five million potential customers .
so this is more than a niche , this is a real consumer segment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french food companies are shedding their misconceptions about halal meat new generation of customers a few years ago , halal foods could only be found in small shops in low-rent immigrant neighborhoods .
now france 's second largest supermarket chain , casino , has hired abderrahman bouzid to manage the halal and traditional muslim foods sold in its 10,000 stores .
he said the market is growing thanks to a new generation of french muslims .
" those under the age of 40 do n't have any hang-ups about affirming who they are ; they want to be taken into consideration , " bouzid said , explaining that muslim consumers are perfectly aware of their buying power and will prefer retailers that offer halal products .
" they 're saying ' if you are dismissive of my needs , by ignoring my customs and my preferences , i wo n't shop in your business ' , " he added .
casino has even created its own halal product line , which it markets under the name wassila .
others in the food industry are following suit .
international brands such as knorr , maggi , liebig and french firms like duc and fleury michon have all started selling halal options .
they now compete with established halal brands such as zakia , isla delice and medina .
attitudes shift some of these brands and others recently attended a halal trade show in paris , where visitors could find everything from halal foie gras and faux-bacon cheese burgers to microwaveable halal meals such as lasagna and chicken curry with rice .
antoine bonnel started the fair six years ago , when it attracted far fewer exhibitors .
this year , 100 companies participated .
bonnel said he has noticed an attitude shift in the food industry .
in the past , mainstream brands did n't want to be associates with halal because it was considered low-brow , he said , adding that french muslims had little money and unenviable social positions .
" these people came from a very poor immigrant background , " bonnel said .
" so the global image was a cheap image . "
there were also misconceptions about the ritual slaughter of animals required for meat to be considered halal .
and there were rumors that some of the taxes for this ritual could be funneled to questionable foreign causes .
bildunterschrift : young muslims represent a significant consumer segment some of this unease came to the surface earlier this year , when fast food chain quick revealed it had made eight of its 362 restaurants halal .
several french politicians criticized the move and the extreme-right national front highlighted the company in its anti-immigrant rhetoric .
but from a business perspective , the new buying power and improved social status of the young muslim generation are sweeping misgivings to the side .
sweeter than champagne the upcoming french launch of a non-alcoholic sparkling wine is just one example of that .
the drink , called " night orient , " is sold in what looks like a champagne bottle and provides people with the satisfying pop that comes with opening a bottle of real champagne .
" we decided to launch a festive drink for muslims , completely alcohol free , " said arnaud jacquemin , one of the drink 's creators .
" for weddings , for birthdays or the end of the year they have to drink orange juice , or soda , which is n't festive . "
jacquemin is n't himself muslim , but while working in the beverage industry , he saw sales of non-alcoholic drinks consistently rise and realized this market was largely untapped .
night orient tastes far sweeter than real champagne .
focus group testing showed the version initially developed was a little too dry for consumers unaccustomed to drinking wine .
so the formula was changed to better appeal to the muslim palate .
the beverage had a successful test run in some paris area supermarkets .
the small company has since signed deals with four national retail chains to officially launch the beverage in france during ramadan later this year .

the minister left the isaf camp in masar-i-sharif after the disruption to european airspace had already begun , but guttenberg hoped he would nonetheless make it back to germany . the defense minister was travelling with five bundeswehr soldiers wounded in a taliban attack in northern afghanistan on thursday . the group was first taken to a german military base in uzbekistan to board a medical transport carrier heading towards europe .
the soldiers were meant to be brought to military hospitals in germany to ensure that they would receive optimal care . with the plane redirected to turkey , the soldiers have spent the night at a us hospital in istanbul and are to continue to germany only at a later stage .
guttenberg on saturday continued his way back to germany albeit it remained unclear by which means of transportation . an ash cloud from a volcanic eruption in iceland on friday spread over most of europe , leading to more than half of all flights being cancelled .
germany 's entire airspace is affected by the problem , which has caused all major airports to be shut down . funeral for fallen soldiers set for sunday guttenberg had been scheduled to return to germany on thursday after a two-day visit to afghanistan . while in transit in uzbekistan , however , he was notified of the bloody attack - which killed four bundeswehr soldiers .
the minister subsequently returned to afghanistan with the bundeswehr 's chief of staff , volker wieker .
guttenberg visited the wounded soldiers at the german military base in masar-i-sharif on friday as they waited for a military aircraft equipped with proper medical equipment to bring them back to germany .
bundeswehr officials report that the wounded troops are all in stable condition .
while four of the five soldiers have sustained serious injuries , these are not believed to be life-threatening .
wieker is scheduled to stay on in afghanistan to attend the funeral service for the four soldiers , which is planned for sunday in the masar-i-sharif camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's funeral would follow a service held just last week explosive , not rocket , triggered thursday 's ambush the latest german casualties came after a bundeswehr patrol came under attack travelling between kunduz and baghlan on thursday .

but now this pristine winemaking region is threatened by a bridge that is to span the valley , against the wishes of many locals and winemakers . the moselle valley in western germany is known for its picturesque views and world-famous moselle riesling wine .
the region thrives on the wine industry and the tourism that it brings .
in an effort to boost access to the valley , the national and state government have launched a project to build a bridge across the moselle valley .
supporters of the project say it will boost tourism in the region by shortening the travel time between neighboring belgium and luxembourg .
they say traffic congestion will be relieved for locals , and commercial connections to nearby airports will be improved .
but not everyone in the valley is convinced that building the bridge is worth it .
they 're afraid the damage to the landscape and the environment will outweigh the benefits .
pro-moselle bildunterschrift : pictures from pro-moselle showing the valley as it is and what will change with the bridge a group of citizens in the valley have formed a group called pro-moselle .
they are against the construction of the bridge , and have started a number of initiatives to try to stop construction .
last spring the group stopped tractors from digging at the official groundbreaking ceremony of the bridge , and a petition against the bridge can be signed on the group 's web site or at one of their regularly scheduled sunday demonstrations .
on sundays , members of the group meet in the town of bernkastel to gather signatures .
they hold two panoramic photographs : one shows how the valley looks now , while the other shows the same image but with the proposed bridge added in .
" these pictures alone say it all , " a woman visiting from moenchengladbach who signed the petition told deutsche welle .
" we 're enjoying the landscape here as tourists , without a bridge .
with a bridge , it is unthinkable . "
wine allies plans for the bridge have been on the books since the late 1960s , but it was n't until late 2008 that the project was given the green light .
most of the 270 million euros -lrb- $ 366 million -rrb- budgeted for the project is coming from the federal government , with the government of the state of rhineland-palatinate chipping in 20 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wine expert hugh johnson says moselle riesling is one of a kind the pro-moselle group has gained support from german politicians and leaders in the wine world .
former foreign minister joschka fisher and the co-leader of the greens ' parliamentary party , renate kuenast , are on board , as is hugh johnson , a world-renowned wine writer from britain .
johnson calls the planned bridge a ' road on stilts . '
in a video posted on the pro-moselle website , he calls on the citizens of the area to stand up and fight for the moselle valley and its one-of-a-kind wine .
" i can tell you that the whole world has nothing comparable to a moselle riesling .
you can imitate the wine of bordeaux in the napa valley , " johnson said .
" you can even imitate the wine of burgundy in certain places .
but there is nothing that even starts to imitate great moselle riesling . "
a long tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus berres markus berres runs the c.h. berres winery in uerzig , a town that will basically fall under the shadow of the bridge once it is completed .
his family has been in the business for 500 years , and the 31-year-old winemaker is part of the 21st generation to run the family business in the moselle valley .
he fears that tourists will be driven away once the bridge is built .
" this region lives from tourism and winemaking , " berres said in an interview with deutsche welle , " but who wants to take their holiday under a bridge ?
nobody .
so i do n't see any advantage to building the bridge . "
the state 's transportation minister , hendrik hering , announced that 35 million euros would be reinvested in the environment as a measure of compensation .
however , winemakers are still worried about the bridge 's effect on the water supply for the grapes growing on the slopes of the valley , or how the grapes will react to the additional car exhaust .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although it is years from completion , signs of the bridge are apparent " the vines will be growing with the bridge or without the bridge , " said markus berres .
" the question is , how high will the quality be ? "
too late to be stopped ?
preparation work is already underway on the bridge .
a receding tree line and dirt access roads are starting to give an indication of what the area will look like once the bridge is complete .
pro-moselle insists that as long as construction has not started , the bridge can still be stopped .
markus berres predicts that many people will move away from the valley if the bridge is completed .
in either case , berres says he 'll stay .
his family has made its living in the moselle valley for centuries , and berres plans to keep the tradition alive .
but for him , making germany 's famous moselle riesling wine just wo n't be the same in the shadow of a bridge .

the minister left the isaf camp in masar-i-sharif after the disruption to european airspace had already begun , but guttenberg hoped he would nonetheless make it back to germany . the defense minister was travelling with five bundeswehr soldiers wounded in a taliban attack in northern afghanistan on thursday . the group was first taken to a german military base in uzbekistan to board a medical transport carrier heading towards europe .
the soldiers were meant to be brought to military hospitals in germany to ensure that they would receive optimal care . with the plane redirected to turkey , the soldiers have spent the night at a us hospital in istanbul and are to continue to germany only at a later stage .
guttenberg on saturday continued his way back to germany albeit it remained unclear by which means of transportation . an ash cloud from a volcanic eruption in iceland on friday spread over most of europe , leading to more than half of all flights being cancelled .

the minister subsequently returned to afghanistan with the bundeswehr 's chief of staff , volker wieker .
guttenberg visited the wounded soldiers at the german military base in masar-i-sharif on friday as they waited for a military aircraft equipped with proper medical equipment to bring them back to germany .
bundeswehr officials report that the wounded troops are all in stable condition .
while four of the five soldiers have sustained serious injuries , these are not believed to be life-threatening .
wieker is scheduled to stay on in afghanistan to attend the funeral service for the four soldiers , which is planned for sunday in the masar-i-sharif camp .

the soldiers were meant to be brought to military hospitals in germany to ensure that they would receive optimal care . with the plane redirected to turkey , the soldiers have spent the night at a us hospital in istanbul and are to continue to germany only at a later stage .
guttenberg on saturday continued his way back to germany albeit it remained unclear by which means of transportation . an ash cloud from a volcanic eruption in iceland on friday spread over most of europe , leading to more than half of all flights being cancelled .
germany 's entire airspace is affected by the problem , which has caused all major airports to be shut down . funeral for fallen soldiers set for sunday guttenberg had been scheduled to return to germany on thursday after a two-day visit to afghanistan . while in transit in uzbekistan , however , he was notified of the bloody attack - which killed four bundeswehr soldiers .
the minister subsequently returned to afghanistan with the bundeswehr 's chief of staff , volker wieker .
guttenberg visited the wounded soldiers at the german military base in masar-i-sharif on friday as they waited for a military aircraft equipped with proper medical equipment to bring them back to germany .
bundeswehr officials report that the wounded troops are all in stable condition .
while four of the five soldiers have sustained serious injuries , these are not believed to be life-threatening .
wieker is scheduled to stay on in afghanistan to attend the funeral service for the four soldiers , which is planned for sunday in the masar-i-sharif camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's funeral would follow a service held just last week explosive , not rocket , triggered thursday 's ambush the latest german casualties came after a bundeswehr patrol came under attack travelling between kunduz and baghlan on thursday .
after initially reporting that the deadly ambush began when a german armored vehicle was struck by a rocket close to pol-i-khomri camp , germany 's defense ministry on friday corrected this , saying the attackers used a remotely detonated explosive device .
three bundeswehr soldiers died in the initial explosion , with the fourth killed in an ensuing battle , in which the isaf troops are believed to have come under mortar and gunfire .
a total of 43 german soldiers have now been killed in afghanistan since the bundeswehr mission began in 2002 .
of those , 26 have been killed in firefights or insurgent attacks .
in recent weeks , taliban insurgents have stepped up pressure on the german troops based in the northern province of kunduz .
on april 2 , three german soldiers were killed during a mine-clearing expedition. ai / glb / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now this pristine winemaking region is threatened by a bridge that is to span the valley , against the wishes of many locals and winemakers . the moselle valley in western germany is known for its picturesque views and world-famous moselle riesling wine .
the region thrives on the wine industry and the tourism that it brings .
in an effort to boost access to the valley , the national and state government have launched a project to build a bridge across the moselle valley .
supporters of the project say it will boost tourism in the region by shortening the travel time between neighboring belgium and luxembourg .
they say traffic congestion will be relieved for locals , and commercial connections to nearby airports will be improved .
but not everyone in the valley is convinced that building the bridge is worth it .
they 're afraid the damage to the landscape and the environment will outweigh the benefits .
pro-moselle bildunterschrift : pictures from pro-moselle showing the valley as it is and what will change with the bridge a group of citizens in the valley have formed a group called pro-moselle .
they are against the construction of the bridge , and have started a number of initiatives to try to stop construction .
last spring the group stopped tractors from digging at the official groundbreaking ceremony of the bridge , and a petition against the bridge can be signed on the group 's web site or at one of their regularly scheduled sunday demonstrations .
on sundays , members of the group meet in the town of bernkastel to gather signatures .
they hold two panoramic photographs : one shows how the valley looks now , while the other shows the same image but with the proposed bridge added in .
" these pictures alone say it all , " a woman visiting from moenchengladbach who signed the petition told deutsche welle .
" we 're enjoying the landscape here as tourists , without a bridge .
with a bridge , it is unthinkable . "
wine allies plans for the bridge have been on the books since the late 1960s , but it was n't until late 2008 that the project was given the green light .
most of the 270 million euros -lrb- $ 366 million -rrb- budgeted for the project is coming from the federal government , with the government of the state of rhineland-palatinate chipping in 20 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wine expert hugh johnson says moselle riesling is one of a kind the pro-moselle group has gained support from german politicians and leaders in the wine world .
former foreign minister joschka fisher and the co-leader of the greens ' parliamentary party , renate kuenast , are on board , as is hugh johnson , a world-renowned wine writer from britain .
johnson calls the planned bridge a ' road on stilts . '
in a video posted on the pro-moselle website , he calls on the citizens of the area to stand up and fight for the moselle valley and its one-of-a-kind wine .
" i can tell you that the whole world has nothing comparable to a moselle riesling .
you can imitate the wine of bordeaux in the napa valley , " johnson said .
" you can even imitate the wine of burgundy in certain places .
but there is nothing that even starts to imitate great moselle riesling . "
a long tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus berres markus berres runs the c.h. berres winery in uerzig , a town that will basically fall under the shadow of the bridge once it is completed .
his family has been in the business for 500 years , and the 31-year-old winemaker is part of the 21st generation to run the family business in the moselle valley .
he fears that tourists will be driven away once the bridge is built .
" this region lives from tourism and winemaking , " berres said in an interview with deutsche welle , " but who wants to take their holiday under a bridge ?
nobody .
so i do n't see any advantage to building the bridge . "
the state 's transportation minister , hendrik hering , announced that 35 million euros would be reinvested in the environment as a measure of compensation .
however , winemakers are still worried about the bridge 's effect on the water supply for the grapes growing on the slopes of the valley , or how the grapes will react to the additional car exhaust .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although it is years from completion , signs of the bridge are apparent " the vines will be growing with the bridge or without the bridge , " said markus berres .
" the question is , how high will the quality be ? "
too late to be stopped ?
preparation work is already underway on the bridge .
a receding tree line and dirt access roads are starting to give an indication of what the area will look like once the bridge is complete .
pro-moselle insists that as long as construction has not started , the bridge can still be stopped .
markus berres predicts that many people will move away from the valley if the bridge is completed .
in either case , berres says he 'll stay .
his family has made its living in the moselle valley for centuries , and berres plans to keep the tradition alive .
but for him , making germany 's famous moselle riesling wine just wo n't be the same in the shadow of a bridge .

it 's also caused major financial losses for airlines and sent their stocks tumbling . airlines were reeling saturday as flights and passengers remained grounded for a third straight day due to the icelandic volcanic ash cloud hovering over much of europe .
large flag carriers and no-frills airlines alike saw their shares dip on friday . the eurocontrol air traffic agency in brussels estimates that nearly 60 per cent of the region 's 28,000 daily flights , have been affected by the volcanic ash . british airways shares closed down more than 3 per cent on friday , while in ireland budget airline ryanair was down 2.3 per cent .
europe 's largest airline by revenue , lufthansa , ended the day down 4 per cent , while air france-klm slid by 3.4 per cent .
the disruption in travel is costing airliners roughly 148 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- in lost revenues per day .
after friday , about 16,000 flights were cancelled , making it the largest airspace shutdown since the second world war .
" in addition to lost revenues , airlines will incur added costs for re-routing of aircraft , care for stranded passengers and stranded aircraft at various ports , " the aviation industry body iata said in a statement on friday .
the association of european airlines estimated that the european economy had lost about one billion euros so far from flight bans across the continent .
however , airline reinsurers played down the potential of the ash cloud to greatly disturb business , hurt agriculture , or cause property damage .
" as long as the restriction to air travel remains temporary as is now expected , there should be no measureable impact for the broader economy , " said reinsurer munich re in a statement .
" it 's just an issue for the airlines to handle . "
airlines are typically not insured against cancellations .
other industries affected deutsche post , europe 's largest mail and express delivery company , said the cloud has disrupted delivery by air and the company has switched to land transport where possible .
the cloud has even affected the hotel industry throughout asia , as dozens of cancelled european flights have left hotels struggling to accommodate thousands of passengers .
but according to energy company officials , oil , gas , and electricity production in europe is not likely to suffer .
the one direct effect from the ash cloud is that offshore workers in the north sea will have to wait longer for replacements , as helicopters were also grounded as part of the flight ban .
flight bans have been imposed by more than 15 european countries .
britain , germany , finland , slovakia , estonia and denmark have extended their bans until sunday. mk / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 17.04.2010 last-second heroics clinch pole for vettel in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel has been dominating in qualifying this season sebastian vettel will start sunday 's chinese formula one grand prix on pole position , after another stunning qualifying performance .
it 's vettel 's third pole in four races this season . sebastian vettel claimed a last-gasp pole position in shanghai on saturday , and will line up at the head of the field for formula one 's chinese grand prix .
it 's vettel 's third pole position in four races , with his red bull teammate mark webber qualifying second .
vettel had appeared to be struggling over the course of the weekend . yet when it mattered most , in the dying moments of the final segment of qualifying -lrb- " q3 " -rrb- , he found another gear and laid down comfortably the fastest lap of the entire weekend .
" how do you do that ? "
vettel 's bewildered race engineer asked over team radio , immediately after the german lit up the timing screens .
" woohoo !
yes , baby ! " replied the 22-year old .
red bull have dominated qualifying this season , with one of their cars starting at the front for every race so far .
however , in china it looked like mclaren 's lewis hamilton had the upper hand , especially in the high-speed sections of the circuit .
" what a qualifying session , it was pretty incredible , " vettel said in the press conference afterwards .
" at the start of the session i was n't entirely happy , especially in the first sector of the lap , but by the end i was totally satisfied with the car , and was the quickest driver across almost the entire lap . "
" i want to say thanks to the mechanics , they certainly did n't get a lunch break today !
they had to work flat out between practice and qualifying to fix the problems we were having with the car but , as always , they did a great job . "
if vettel - who won the last race in malaysia - can convert his qualifying performance into another win on sunday , he would be guaranteed to take the lead in the world championship , regardless of where his competition finishes .
mixed fortunes at mercedes behind the red bull duo , ferrari 's spanish double world champion , fernando alonso , secured third place , with mercedes driver nico rosberg an impressive fourth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosberg has been overshadowing veteran teammate schumacher " i 'd say i 'm pretty happy , " rosberg told german television .
" this morning it looked much worse for us , but now we 're really close to the front .
red bull seems to have a bit of an advantage , but then there 's us and ferrari not far behind . "
however , mercedes ' other german driver , seven-time champion michael schumacher , qualified far behind his teammate in ninth , seven tenths of a second -lrb- a deceptively long time in formula one terms -rrb- adrift of rosberg .
" i know where i lost those seven tenths , so i can handle it , " schumacher said .
" but of course it 's a pity .
nico has a well set-up car , and he got the best out of it , and obviously i would have liked to achieve the same .
i shall try to do so in the race tomorrow . "
so far , either through reliability problems or a lack of speed , the highly anticipated return of schumacher to f1 after three years away has not delivered impressive results - with qualifying pace arguably his biggest problem .
sutil impresses again germany 's other strong qualifier was adrian sutil , driving for the relatively small force india team .
the 27-year old , who has never scored a top three finish in his career , starts just behind f1 's most successful driver schumacher in tenth position .
sutil has been in the top ten at the start of every race this year , by far the best performance of his career to date , but the other cars ahead of him are likely to prove too strong in the race on sunday .
the mclaren drivers jenson button and lewis hamilton - who were tipped to shine in shanghai - line up fifth and sixth , ferrari 's felipe massa starts seventh , and robert kubica grabbed eighth place for renault .
germany 's rookie nico hulkenberg is a rather disappointing sixteenth on the grid for williams , with countryman timo glock nineteenth in his virgin racing car .
glock wins the dubious honor , once again , of being the fastest driver at any of formula one 's three new teams - all of whom have been well adrift of the rest of the field so far this season .

it 's vettel 's third pole in four races this season . sebastian vettel claimed a last-gasp pole position in shanghai on saturday , and will line up at the head of the field for formula one 's chinese grand prix .
it 's vettel 's third pole position in four races , with his red bull teammate mark webber qualifying second .
vettel had appeared to be struggling over the course of the weekend . yet when it mattered most , in the dying moments of the final segment of qualifying -lrb- " q3 " -rrb- , he found another gear and laid down comfortably the fastest lap of the entire weekend .
" how do you do that ? "
vettel 's bewildered race engineer asked over team radio , immediately after the german lit up the timing screens .
" woohoo !
yes , baby ! " replied the 22-year old .
red bull have dominated qualifying this season , with one of their cars starting at the front for every race so far .
however , in china it looked like mclaren 's lewis hamilton had the upper hand , especially in the high-speed sections of the circuit .
" what a qualifying session , it was pretty incredible , " vettel said in the press conference afterwards .
" at the start of the session i was n't entirely happy , especially in the first sector of the lap , but by the end i was totally satisfied with the car , and was the quickest driver across almost the entire lap . "
" i want to say thanks to the mechanics , they certainly did n't get a lunch break today !
they had to work flat out between practice and qualifying to fix the problems we were having with the car but , as always , they did a great job . "
if vettel - who won the last race in malaysia - can convert his qualifying performance into another win on sunday , he would be guaranteed to take the lead in the world championship , regardless of where his competition finishes .
mixed fortunes at mercedes behind the red bull duo , ferrari 's spanish double world champion , fernando alonso , secured third place , with mercedes driver nico rosberg an impressive fourth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosberg has been overshadowing veteran teammate schumacher " i 'd say i 'm pretty happy , " rosberg told german television .
" this morning it looked much worse for us , but now we 're really close to the front .
red bull seems to have a bit of an advantage , but then there 's us and ferrari not far behind . "
however , mercedes ' other german driver , seven-time champion michael schumacher , qualified far behind his teammate in ninth , seven tenths of a second -lrb- a deceptively long time in formula one terms -rrb- adrift of rosberg .
" i know where i lost those seven tenths , so i can handle it , " schumacher said .
" but of course it 's a pity .
nico has a well set-up car , and he got the best out of it , and obviously i would have liked to achieve the same .
i shall try to do so in the race tomorrow . "
so far , either through reliability problems or a lack of speed , the highly anticipated return of schumacher to f1 after three years away has not delivered impressive results - with qualifying pace arguably his biggest problem .
sutil impresses again germany 's other strong qualifier was adrian sutil , driving for the relatively small force india team .
the 27-year old , who has never scored a top three finish in his career , starts just behind f1 's most successful driver schumacher in tenth position .
sutil has been in the top ten at the start of every race this year , by far the best performance of his career to date , but the other cars ahead of him are likely to prove too strong in the race on sunday .

more than 20 countries have closed their airspace with some countries calling off all flights until monday morning . european flights remained grounded on saturday due to a vast cloud of volcanic ash from iceland that has covered much of europe and has spread as far east as russia .
britain , ireland , switzerland , and belgium all extended their flight bans on saturday .
more than 20 european countries grounded flights because of the ash cloud .
the disruption hit german chancellor angela merkel who was trying to return to berlin from the united states on friday when her plane was diverted to lisbon .
she flew to rome on saturday , having to spend the night in italy . the chancellor will therefore be unable to attend the funeral of polish president lech kaczynski on sunday .
in addition , flights bringing home the bodies of german soldiers killed in afghanistan along with soldiers wounded in the country were redirected to turkey .
bildunterschrift : the last time the volcano erupted , in the 19th century , it continued sporadically for over a year things could get worse volcanic ash can terminally damage the engines and windows of jetliners .
the national air traffic services , which oversees british airspace , said the situation from the cloud is getting worse . experts tracking the volcano beneath the eyjafjallajokull glacier said there were no signs of reduced activity on friday .
after a relatively minor eruption one month ago , the volcano erupted again on wednesday , with these two incidents breaking almost 200 years of dormancy .
that last recorded eruption continued - with varying levels of severity and intermittent periods of inactivity - for almost 18 months between 1821 and 1823 .
" we have no prediction on how long -lsb- the eruption -rsb- will last , " said geophysicist bergthora thorbjnardottir at the iceland meteorological office .
hundreds of thousands stranded westerly and north-westerly winds have blown the ash across swathes of northern and central europe , grounding some 17,000 flights on friday , after around 6,000 were cancelled on thursday .
the disruption is costing airlines over 148 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- per day .
currently , only emergency flights are permitted into and out of the affected regions in europe .
all 16 international airports in germany were closed on saturday with no flights set to take off until at least 2pm on sunday .

it 's also caused major financial losses for airlines and sent their stocks tumbling . airlines were reeling saturday as flights and passengers remained grounded for a third straight day due to the icelandic volcanic ash cloud hovering over much of europe .
large flag carriers and no-frills airlines alike saw their shares dip on friday . the eurocontrol air traffic agency in brussels estimates that nearly 60 per cent of the region 's 28,000 daily flights , have been affected by the volcanic ash . british airways shares closed down more than 3 per cent on friday , while in ireland budget airline ryanair was down 2.3 per cent .
europe 's largest airline by revenue , lufthansa , ended the day down 4 per cent , while air france-klm slid by 3.4 per cent .
the disruption in travel is costing airliners roughly 148 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- in lost revenues per day .
after friday , about 16,000 flights were cancelled , making it the largest airspace shutdown since the second world war .
" in addition to lost revenues , airlines will incur added costs for re-routing of aircraft , care for stranded passengers and stranded aircraft at various ports , " the aviation industry body iata said in a statement on friday .
the association of european airlines estimated that the european economy had lost about one billion euros so far from flight bans across the continent .
however , airline reinsurers played down the potential of the ash cloud to greatly disturb business , hurt agriculture , or cause property damage .
" as long as the restriction to air travel remains temporary as is now expected , there should be no measureable impact for the broader economy , " said reinsurer munich re in a statement .
" it 's just an issue for the airlines to handle . "
airlines are typically not insured against cancellations .
other industries affected deutsche post , europe 's largest mail and express delivery company , said the cloud has disrupted delivery by air and the company has switched to land transport where possible .
the cloud has even affected the hotel industry throughout asia , as dozens of cancelled european flights have left hotels struggling to accommodate thousands of passengers .
but according to energy company officials , oil , gas , and electricity production in europe is not likely to suffer .
the one direct effect from the ash cloud is that offshore workers in the north sea will have to wait longer for replacements , as helicopters were also grounded as part of the flight ban .
flight bans have been imposed by more than 15 european countries .
britain , germany , finland , slovakia , estonia and denmark have extended their bans until sunday. mk / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mass on a specially designed stage in the shape of a staircase was celebrated by polish bishops and the vatican envoy , cardinal angelo sodano " things like this never happen ; they are impossible .
it is the greatest tragedy in the history of poland since world war ii , " prime minister donald tusk told the assembled mourners . " they all had their dreams and hopes for the future of their homeland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 17.04.2010 airlines suffer financial blow after ash cloud großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the volanic ash has shut down airports and hit airlines financially a plume of volcanic ash drifting across europe from iceland has not just sparked travel chaos .
it 's also caused major financial losses for airlines and sent their stocks tumbling . airlines were reeling saturday as flights and passengers remained grounded for a third straight day due to the icelandic volcanic ash cloud hovering over much of europe .
large flag carriers and no-frills airlines alike saw their shares dip on friday . the eurocontrol air traffic agency in brussels estimates that nearly 60 per cent of the region 's 28,000 daily flights , have been affected by the volcanic ash . british airways shares closed down more than 3 per cent on friday , while in ireland budget airline ryanair was down 2.3 per cent .
europe 's largest airline by revenue , lufthansa , ended the day down 4 per cent , while air france-klm slid by 3.4 per cent .
the disruption in travel is costing airliners roughly 148 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- in lost revenues per day .
after friday , about 16,000 flights were cancelled , making it the largest airspace shutdown since the second world war .
" in addition to lost revenues , airlines will incur added costs for re-routing of aircraft , care for stranded passengers and stranded aircraft at various ports , " the aviation industry body iata said in a statement on friday .
the association of european airlines estimated that the european economy had lost about one billion euros so far from flight bans across the continent .
however , airline reinsurers played down the potential of the ash cloud to greatly disturb business , hurt agriculture , or cause property damage .
" as long as the restriction to air travel remains temporary as is now expected , there should be no measureable impact for the broader economy , " said reinsurer munich re in a statement .
" it 's just an issue for the airlines to handle . "
airlines are typically not insured against cancellations .
other industries affected deutsche post , europe 's largest mail and express delivery company , said the cloud has disrupted delivery by air and the company has switched to land transport where possible .
the cloud has even affected the hotel industry throughout asia , as dozens of cancelled european flights have left hotels struggling to accommodate thousands of passengers .
but according to energy company officials , oil , gas , and electricity production in europe is not likely to suffer .
the one direct effect from the ash cloud is that offshore workers in the north sea will have to wait longer for replacements , as helicopters were also grounded as part of the flight ban .
flight bans have been imposed by more than 15 european countries .
britain , germany , finland , slovakia , estonia and denmark have extended their bans until sunday. mk / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's also caused major financial losses for airlines and sent their stocks tumbling . airlines were reeling saturday as flights and passengers remained grounded for a third straight day due to the icelandic volcanic ash cloud hovering over much of europe .
large flag carriers and no-frills airlines alike saw their shares dip on friday . the eurocontrol air traffic agency in brussels estimates that nearly 60 per cent of the region 's 28,000 daily flights , have been affected by the volcanic ash . british airways shares closed down more than 3 per cent on friday , while in ireland budget airline ryanair was down 2.3 per cent .
europe 's largest airline by revenue , lufthansa , ended the day down 4 per cent , while air france-klm slid by 3.4 per cent .
the disruption in travel is costing airliners roughly 148 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- in lost revenues per day .
after friday , about 16,000 flights were cancelled , making it the largest airspace shutdown since the second world war .
" in addition to lost revenues , airlines will incur added costs for re-routing of aircraft , care for stranded passengers and stranded aircraft at various ports , " the aviation industry body iata said in a statement on friday .
the association of european airlines estimated that the european economy had lost about one billion euros so far from flight bans across the continent .
however , airline reinsurers played down the potential of the ash cloud to greatly disturb business , hurt agriculture , or cause property damage .
" as long as the restriction to air travel remains temporary as is now expected , there should be no measureable impact for the broader economy , " said reinsurer munich re in a statement .
" it 's just an issue for the airlines to handle . "
airlines are typically not insured against cancellations .
other industries affected deutsche post , europe 's largest mail and express delivery company , said the cloud has disrupted delivery by air and the company has switched to land transport where possible .
the cloud has even affected the hotel industry throughout asia , as dozens of cancelled european flights have left hotels struggling to accommodate thousands of passengers .
but according to energy company officials , oil , gas , and electricity production in europe is not likely to suffer .
the one direct effect from the ash cloud is that offshore workers in the north sea will have to wait longer for replacements , as helicopters were also grounded as part of the flight ban .
flight bans have been imposed by more than 15 european countries .
britain , germany , finland , slovakia , estonia and denmark have extended their bans until sunday. mk / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the recent violence raises questions as to whether the government can actually secure the country without international help . next month , france is due to present a draft of a new resolution on the un mandate for the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- to the un security council . many observers are already asking how the recent violence in mbandaka in the northwestern province of equateur , where rebels seized an airport and killed 13 people , will affect the future of the un 's involvement .
with more than 20,000 troops , the un mission -lrb- monuc -rrb- is the largest and most expensive on the planet .
monuc arrived in drc in 1999 when what is now known as the second congo war involved seven other african countries : zimbabwe , angola , chad , namibia , burundi , rwanda , and uganda .
the countries supported opposing sides - laurent kabila 's government or rebel groups in eastern congo - for different reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobutu was toppled by laurent kabila in the first congo war -lrb- 1996 - 97 -rrb- angola supported kabila because he defeated mobutu sese seko , who had helped jonas savimbi 's unita in angola 's civil war which spanned over two decades .
on the other hand , rwanda helped the rally for congolese democracy -lrb- rcd -rrb- to support tutsis in drc against hutu militias .
but rwanda , much like uganda , has been part of the war also to exploit natural resources - especially diamonds - in eastern congo .
more than 5 million people have died since 1998 as a result of the conflict .
and those who have not died directly continue to die from malnutrition or preventable diseases like cholera while thousands of women , especially in the kivu region , have been raped and many infected with hiv .
monuc and congolese army not on the same page monuc was sent to strengthen the congolese national forces and protect the population .
but many feel that it has not helped .
in fact , in " killings in kiwanja : the un 's inability to protect civilians , " human rights watch reports that monuc has failed to protect the population .
it says that monuc 's failure led to the massacre of 150 people in kiwanja in december 2008 , and that un troops have raped girls and women in eastern congo .
james paul , executive director of the global policy forum , agrees that un forces have failed to protect the population .
in part , because they were expected to work with the congolese forces which have also been accused of human rights violations , including the rape of thousands of women .
" there have been problems in the relationship between the peacekeepers and the congolese army because of concern that the un has been identified with the violations , " paul said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of women and girls have been raped by rebels as a result , instead of working with the congolese army as it should have , monuc has distanced itself from the congolese army so as not to be complicit in the latter 's actions .
" the relations between monuc and the congolese government have deteriorated extremely over the last couple of years because they do n't see eye to eye on many issues , " denis tull , a research fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
next year 's election ups the stakes last month 's announcement by the congolese government that it wanted all un troops to leave the country by august 2011 should have come as no surprise .
but its timing was strategic .
" with the upcoming 50th anniversary of congo 's independence in june , the government does not want to see a permanent presence of the un , " tull said .
observers say the government wants to take credit for the achievements that have taken place since monuc arrived in 1999 . this would put it in good light for the presidential elections in 2011 .
in spite of the criticism against monuc , it has helped to reduce the extent of the conflict and helped congo hold its first democratic elections in over four decades in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president joseph kabila won the elections in 2006 " president kabila wants to be able to say to the congolese people that he made the un mission leave because there is peace in the country , " tull said .
fabienne hara , the vice-president of multilateral relations at the international crisis group , agrees .
she told deutsche welle that " one of the reasons why the congolese government wants to see monuc withdraw is that they also want to be in charge of their own elections . "
un troops withdrawal unlikely however , it is unlikely that the congolese government will get exactly what it wants .
even though 2,000 un troops are to leave congo by june 30th , a report in march by un secretary general ban ki-moon , recommends that troops remain in the more unstable eastern congo .
also , the recent violence in equateur will very likely affect the future of the un mission .
" this new episode in equateur shows that even western congo is not completely stable despite what the government is saying .
there 's still some serious sources of tensions elsewhere in the congo , " hara said .
the un security council delegation visiting the democratic republic of congo over the next few days will most certainly take the recent violence in equateur into consideration , and un troops are expected to remain in the eastern part of the country because " any withdrawal from eastern congo would be a major catastrophe for the civilian population , " tull said .

they 've been in the country for decades , but the mainstream food industry is only just starting to cater to them . customers walking through the aisles of some paris area supermarkets are now likely to find halal meat and processed foods .
whether it 's spicy ready-to-eat chicken wings , halal pate , or mock ham made from turkey , halal products are increasingly making their way into mainstream shopping venues .
it may not seem like much , but for france this marks a striking change .
this was made evident last summer when the zakia food brand aired the first nationally broadcast television commercial for halal food .
it turned enough heads to make it into french newscasts .
halal means legal or lawful in arabic and refers to foods that are sanctioned by islamic authorities .
pork , blood and alcohol are not halal .
food industry observers say supermarkets and the rest of the food industry are just following the money trail .
" five and a half billion euros are going to be spent on these kinds of products this year in france , " said abbas bendali , the head of solis , a market research firm specialized in ethnic niches .
" there are five million potential customers .
so this is more than a niche , this is a real consumer segment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french food companies are shedding their misconceptions about halal meat new generation of customers a few years ago , halal foods could only be found in small shops in low-rent immigrant neighborhoods .
now france 's second largest supermarket chain , casino , has hired abderrahman bouzid to manage the halal and traditional muslim foods sold in its 10,000 stores .
he said the market is growing thanks to a new generation of french muslims .
" those under the age of 40 do n't have any hang-ups about affirming who they are ; they want to be taken into consideration , " bouzid said , explaining that muslim consumers are perfectly aware of their buying power and will prefer retailers that offer halal products .
" they 're saying ' if you are dismissive of my needs , by ignoring my customs and my preferences , i wo n't shop in your business ' , " he added .
casino has even created its own halal product line , which it markets under the name wassila .
others in the food industry are following suit .
international brands such as knorr , maggi , liebig and french firms like duc and fleury michon have all started selling halal options .
they now compete with established halal brands such as zakia , isla delice and medina .
attitudes shift some of these brands and others recently attended a halal trade show in paris , where visitors could find everything from halal foie gras and faux-bacon cheese burgers to microwaveable halal meals such as lasagna and chicken curry with rice .
antoine bonnel started the fair six years ago , when it attracted far fewer exhibitors .
this year , 100 companies participated .
bonnel said he has noticed an attitude shift in the food industry .
in the past , mainstream brands did n't want to be associates with halal because it was considered low-brow , he said , adding that french muslims had little money and unenviable social positions .
" these people came from a very poor immigrant background , " bonnel said .
" so the global image was a cheap image . "
there were also misconceptions about the ritual slaughter of animals required for meat to be considered halal .
and there were rumors that some of the taxes for this ritual could be funneled to questionable foreign causes .

several french politicians criticized the move and the extreme-right national front highlighted the company in its anti-immigrant rhetoric .
but from a business perspective , the new buying power and improved social status of the young muslim generation are sweeping misgivings to the side .
sweeter than champagne the upcoming french launch of a non-alcoholic sparkling wine is just one example of that .
the drink , called " night orient , " is sold in what looks like a champagne bottle and provides people with the satisfying pop that comes with opening a bottle of real champagne .
" we decided to launch a festive drink for muslims , completely alcohol free , " said arnaud jacquemin , one of the drink 's creators .
" for weddings , for birthdays or the end of the year they have to drink orange juice , or soda , which is n't festive . "
jacquemin is n't himself muslim , but while working in the beverage industry , he saw sales of non-alcoholic drinks consistently rise and realized this market was largely untapped .
night orient tastes far sweeter than real champagne .
focus group testing showed the version initially developed was a little too dry for consumers unaccustomed to drinking wine .
so the formula was changed to better appeal to the muslim palate .
the beverage had a successful test run in some paris area supermarkets .
the small company has since signed deals with four national retail chains to officially launch the beverage in france during ramadan later this year .

they 've been in the country for decades , but the mainstream food industry is only just starting to cater to them . customers walking through the aisles of some paris area supermarkets are now likely to find halal meat and processed foods .
whether it 's spicy ready-to-eat chicken wings , halal pate , or mock ham made from turkey , halal products are increasingly making their way into mainstream shopping venues .
it may not seem like much , but for france this marks a striking change .
this was made evident last summer when the zakia food brand aired the first nationally broadcast television commercial for halal food .
it turned enough heads to make it into french newscasts .
halal means legal or lawful in arabic and refers to foods that are sanctioned by islamic authorities .
pork , blood and alcohol are not halal .
food industry observers say supermarkets and the rest of the food industry are just following the money trail .
" five and a half billion euros are going to be spent on these kinds of products this year in france , " said abbas bendali , the head of solis , a market research firm specialized in ethnic niches .

he said the market is growing thanks to a new generation of french muslims .
" those under the age of 40 do n't have any hang-ups about affirming who they are ; they want to be taken into consideration , " bouzid said , explaining that muslim consumers are perfectly aware of their buying power and will prefer retailers that offer halal products .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 17.04.2010 un troops unlikely to pull out from congo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monuc troops on patrol in kinshasa - the congolese capital in march , the congolese government asked the un mission to withdraw all its troops .
but the recent violence raises questions as to whether the government can actually secure the country without international help . next month , france is due to present a draft of a new resolution on the un mandate for the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- to the un security council . many observers are already asking how the recent violence in mbandaka in the northwestern province of equateur , where rebels seized an airport and killed 13 people , will affect the future of the un 's involvement .
with more than 20,000 troops , the un mission -lrb- monuc -rrb- is the largest and most expensive on the planet .
monuc arrived in drc in 1999 when what is now known as the second congo war involved seven other african countries : zimbabwe , angola , chad , namibia , burundi , rwanda , and uganda .
the countries supported opposing sides - laurent kabila 's government or rebel groups in eastern congo - for different reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobutu was toppled by laurent kabila in the first congo war -lrb- 1996 - 97 -rrb- angola supported kabila because he defeated mobutu sese seko , who had helped jonas savimbi 's unita in angola 's civil war which spanned over two decades .
on the other hand , rwanda helped the rally for congolese democracy -lrb- rcd -rrb- to support tutsis in drc against hutu militias .
but rwanda , much like uganda , has been part of the war also to exploit natural resources - especially diamonds - in eastern congo .
more than 5 million people have died since 1998 as a result of the conflict .
and those who have not died directly continue to die from malnutrition or preventable diseases like cholera while thousands of women , especially in the kivu region , have been raped and many infected with hiv .
monuc and congolese army not on the same page monuc was sent to strengthen the congolese national forces and protect the population .
but many feel that it has not helped .
in fact , in " killings in kiwanja : the un 's inability to protect civilians , " human rights watch reports that monuc has failed to protect the population .
it says that monuc 's failure led to the massacre of 150 people in kiwanja in december 2008 , and that un troops have raped girls and women in eastern congo .
james paul , executive director of the global policy forum , agrees that un forces have failed to protect the population .
in part , because they were expected to work with the congolese forces which have also been accused of human rights violations , including the rape of thousands of women .
" there have been problems in the relationship between the peacekeepers and the congolese army because of concern that the un has been identified with the violations , " paul said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of women and girls have been raped by rebels as a result , instead of working with the congolese army as it should have , monuc has distanced itself from the congolese army so as not to be complicit in the latter 's actions .
" the relations between monuc and the congolese government have deteriorated extremely over the last couple of years because they do n't see eye to eye on many issues , " denis tull , a research fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
next year 's election ups the stakes last month 's announcement by the congolese government that it wanted all un troops to leave the country by august 2011 should have come as no surprise .
but its timing was strategic .
" with the upcoming 50th anniversary of congo 's independence in june , the government does not want to see a permanent presence of the un , " tull said .
observers say the government wants to take credit for the achievements that have taken place since monuc arrived in 1999 . this would put it in good light for the presidential elections in 2011 .
in spite of the criticism against monuc , it has helped to reduce the extent of the conflict and helped congo hold its first democratic elections in over four decades in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president joseph kabila won the elections in 2006 " president kabila wants to be able to say to the congolese people that he made the un mission leave because there is peace in the country , " tull said .
fabienne hara , the vice-president of multilateral relations at the international crisis group , agrees .
she told deutsche welle that " one of the reasons why the congolese government wants to see monuc withdraw is that they also want to be in charge of their own elections . "
un troops withdrawal unlikely however , it is unlikely that the congolese government will get exactly what it wants .
even though 2,000 un troops are to leave congo by june 30th , a report in march by un secretary general ban ki-moon , recommends that troops remain in the more unstable eastern congo .
also , the recent violence in equateur will very likely affect the future of the un mission .
" this new episode in equateur shows that even western congo is not completely stable despite what the government is saying .
there 's still some serious sources of tensions elsewhere in the congo , " hara said .
the un security council delegation visiting the democratic republic of congo over the next few days will most certainly take the recent violence in equateur into consideration , and un troops are expected to remain in the eastern part of the country because " any withdrawal from eastern congo would be a major catastrophe for the civilian population , " tull said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of women and girls have been raped by rebels as a result , instead of working with the congolese army as it should have , monuc has distanced itself from the congolese army so as not to be complicit in the latter 's actions .
" the relations between monuc and the congolese government have deteriorated extremely over the last couple of years because they do n't see eye to eye on many issues , " denis tull , a research fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
next year 's election ups the stakes last month 's announcement by the congolese government that it wanted all un troops to leave the country by august 2011 should have come as no surprise .
but its timing was strategic .
" with the upcoming 50th anniversary of congo 's independence in june , the government does not want to see a permanent presence of the un , " tull said .
observers say the government wants to take credit for the achievements that have taken place since monuc arrived in 1999 . this would put it in good light for the presidential elections in 2011 .
in spite of the criticism against monuc , it has helped to reduce the extent of the conflict and helped congo hold its first democratic elections in over four decades in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president joseph kabila won the elections in 2006 " president kabila wants to be able to say to the congolese people that he made the un mission leave because there is peace in the country , " tull said .
fabienne hara , the vice-president of multilateral relations at the international crisis group , agrees .
she told deutsche welle that " one of the reasons why the congolese government wants to see monuc withdraw is that they also want to be in charge of their own elections . "
un troops withdrawal unlikely however , it is unlikely that the congolese government will get exactly what it wants .
even though 2,000 un troops are to leave congo by june 30th , a report in march by un secretary general ban ki-moon , recommends that troops remain in the more unstable eastern congo .
also , the recent violence in equateur will very likely affect the future of the un mission .
" this new episode in equateur shows that even western congo is not completely stable despite what the government is saying .
there 's still some serious sources of tensions elsewhere in the congo , " hara said .
the un security council delegation visiting the democratic republic of congo over the next few days will most certainly take the recent violence in equateur into consideration , and un troops are expected to remain in the eastern part of the country because " any withdrawal from eastern congo would be a major catastrophe for the civilian population , " tull said .

but the recent violence raises questions as to whether the government can actually secure the country without international help . next month , france is due to present a draft of a new resolution on the un mandate for the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- to the un security council . many observers are already asking how the recent violence in mbandaka in the northwestern province of equateur , where rebels seized an airport and killed 13 people , will affect the future of the un 's involvement .
with more than 20,000 troops , the un mission -lrb- monuc -rrb- is the largest and most expensive on the planet .
monuc arrived in drc in 1999 when what is now known as the second congo war involved seven other african countries : zimbabwe , angola , chad , namibia , burundi , rwanda , and uganda .
the countries supported opposing sides - laurent kabila 's government or rebel groups in eastern congo - for different reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobutu was toppled by laurent kabila in the first congo war -lrb- 1996 - 97 -rrb- angola supported kabila because he defeated mobutu sese seko , who had helped jonas savimbi 's unita in angola 's civil war which spanned over two decades .
on the other hand , rwanda helped the rally for congolese democracy -lrb- rcd -rrb- to support tutsis in drc against hutu militias .
but rwanda , much like uganda , has been part of the war also to exploit natural resources - especially diamonds - in eastern congo .
more than 5 million people have died since 1998 as a result of the conflict .
and those who have not died directly continue to die from malnutrition or preventable diseases like cholera while thousands of women , especially in the kivu region , have been raped and many infected with hiv .
monuc and congolese army not on the same page monuc was sent to strengthen the congolese national forces and protect the population .
but many feel that it has not helped .
in fact , in " killings in kiwanja : the un 's inability to protect civilians , " human rights watch reports that monuc has failed to protect the population .
it says that monuc 's failure led to the massacre of 150 people in kiwanja in december 2008 , and that un troops have raped girls and women in eastern congo .
james paul , executive director of the global policy forum , agrees that un forces have failed to protect the population .
in part , because they were expected to work with the congolese forces which have also been accused of human rights violations , including the rape of thousands of women .
" there have been problems in the relationship between the peacekeepers and the congolese army because of concern that the un has been identified with the violations , " paul said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 17.04.2010 un troops unlikely to pull out from congo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monuc troops on patrol in kinshasa - the congolese capital in march , the congolese government asked the un mission to withdraw all its troops .
but the recent violence raises questions as to whether the government can actually secure the country without international help . next month , france is due to present a draft of a new resolution on the un mandate for the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- to the un security council . many observers are already asking how the recent violence in mbandaka in the northwestern province of equateur , where rebels seized an airport and killed 13 people , will affect the future of the un 's involvement .
with more than 20,000 troops , the un mission -lrb- monuc -rrb- is the largest and most expensive on the planet .
monuc arrived in drc in 1999 when what is now known as the second congo war involved seven other african countries : zimbabwe , angola , chad , namibia , burundi , rwanda , and uganda .
the countries supported opposing sides - laurent kabila 's government or rebel groups in eastern congo - for different reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobutu was toppled by laurent kabila in the first congo war -lrb- 1996 - 97 -rrb- angola supported kabila because he defeated mobutu sese seko , who had helped jonas savimbi 's unita in angola 's civil war which spanned over two decades .
on the other hand , rwanda helped the rally for congolese democracy -lrb- rcd -rrb- to support tutsis in drc against hutu militias .
but rwanda , much like uganda , has been part of the war also to exploit natural resources - especially diamonds - in eastern congo .
more than 5 million people have died since 1998 as a result of the conflict .
and those who have not died directly continue to die from malnutrition or preventable diseases like cholera while thousands of women , especially in the kivu region , have been raped and many infected with hiv .
monuc and congolese army not on the same page monuc was sent to strengthen the congolese national forces and protect the population .
but many feel that it has not helped .
in fact , in " killings in kiwanja : the un 's inability to protect civilians , " human rights watch reports that monuc has failed to protect the population .
it says that monuc 's failure led to the massacre of 150 people in kiwanja in december 2008 , and that un troops have raped girls and women in eastern congo .
james paul , executive director of the global policy forum , agrees that un forces have failed to protect the population .
in part , because they were expected to work with the congolese forces which have also been accused of human rights violations , including the rape of thousands of women .
" there have been problems in the relationship between the peacekeepers and the congolese army because of concern that the un has been identified with the violations , " paul said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of women and girls have been raped by rebels as a result , instead of working with the congolese army as it should have , monuc has distanced itself from the congolese army so as not to be complicit in the latter 's actions .
" the relations between monuc and the congolese government have deteriorated extremely over the last couple of years because they do n't see eye to eye on many issues , " denis tull , a research fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
next year 's election ups the stakes last month 's announcement by the congolese government that it wanted all un troops to leave the country by august 2011 should have come as no surprise .
but its timing was strategic .
" with the upcoming 50th anniversary of congo 's independence in june , the government does not want to see a permanent presence of the un , " tull said .
observers say the government wants to take credit for the achievements that have taken place since monuc arrived in 1999 . this would put it in good light for the presidential elections in 2011 .
in spite of the criticism against monuc , it has helped to reduce the extent of the conflict and helped congo hold its first democratic elections in over four decades in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president joseph kabila won the elections in 2006 " president kabila wants to be able to say to the congolese people that he made the un mission leave because there is peace in the country , " tull said .
fabienne hara , the vice-president of multilateral relations at the international crisis group , agrees .
she told deutsche welle that " one of the reasons why the congolese government wants to see monuc withdraw is that they also want to be in charge of their own elections . "
un troops withdrawal unlikely however , it is unlikely that the congolese government will get exactly what it wants .
even though 2,000 un troops are to leave congo by june 30th , a report in march by un secretary general ban ki-moon , recommends that troops remain in the more unstable eastern congo .
also , the recent violence in equateur will very likely affect the future of the un mission .
" this new episode in equateur shows that even western congo is not completely stable despite what the government is saying .
there 's still some serious sources of tensions elsewhere in the congo , " hara said .
the un security council delegation visiting the democratic republic of congo over the next few days will most certainly take the recent violence in equateur into consideration , and un troops are expected to remain in the eastern part of the country because " any withdrawal from eastern congo would be a major catastrophe for the civilian population , " tull said .

they 've been in the country for decades , but the mainstream food industry is only just starting to cater to them . customers walking through the aisles of some paris area supermarkets are now likely to find halal meat and processed foods .
whether it 's spicy ready-to-eat chicken wings , halal pate , or mock ham made from turkey , halal products are increasingly making their way into mainstream shopping venues .
it may not seem like much , but for france this marks a striking change .
this was made evident last summer when the zakia food brand aired the first nationally broadcast television commercial for halal food .
it turned enough heads to make it into french newscasts .
halal means legal or lawful in arabic and refers to foods that are sanctioned by islamic authorities .
pork , blood and alcohol are not halal .
food industry observers say supermarkets and the rest of the food industry are just following the money trail .
" five and a half billion euros are going to be spent on these kinds of products this year in france , " said abbas bendali , the head of solis , a market research firm specialized in ethnic niches .
" there are five million potential customers .
so this is more than a niche , this is a real consumer segment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french food companies are shedding their misconceptions about halal meat new generation of customers a few years ago , halal foods could only be found in small shops in low-rent immigrant neighborhoods .
now france 's second largest supermarket chain , casino , has hired abderrahman bouzid to manage the halal and traditional muslim foods sold in its 10,000 stores .
he said the market is growing thanks to a new generation of french muslims .
" those under the age of 40 do n't have any hang-ups about affirming who they are ; they want to be taken into consideration , " bouzid said , explaining that muslim consumers are perfectly aware of their buying power and will prefer retailers that offer halal products .
" they 're saying ' if you are dismissive of my needs , by ignoring my customs and my preferences , i wo n't shop in your business ' , " he added .
casino has even created its own halal product line , which it markets under the name wassila .
others in the food industry are following suit .
international brands such as knorr , maggi , liebig and french firms like duc and fleury michon have all started selling halal options .
they now compete with established halal brands such as zakia , isla delice and medina .
attitudes shift some of these brands and others recently attended a halal trade show in paris , where visitors could find everything from halal foie gras and faux-bacon cheese burgers to microwaveable halal meals such as lasagna and chicken curry with rice .
antoine bonnel started the fair six years ago , when it attracted far fewer exhibitors .
this year , 100 companies participated .
bonnel said he has noticed an attitude shift in the food industry .
in the past , mainstream brands did n't want to be associates with halal because it was considered low-brow , he said , adding that french muslims had little money and unenviable social positions .
" these people came from a very poor immigrant background , " bonnel said .
" so the global image was a cheap image . "
there were also misconceptions about the ritual slaughter of animals required for meat to be considered halal .
and there were rumors that some of the taxes for this ritual could be funneled to questionable foreign causes .
bildunterschrift : young muslims represent a significant consumer segment some of this unease came to the surface earlier this year , when fast food chain quick revealed it had made eight of its 362 restaurants halal .
several french politicians criticized the move and the extreme-right national front highlighted the company in its anti-immigrant rhetoric .
but from a business perspective , the new buying power and improved social status of the young muslim generation are sweeping misgivings to the side .
sweeter than champagne the upcoming french launch of a non-alcoholic sparkling wine is just one example of that .
the drink , called " night orient , " is sold in what looks like a champagne bottle and provides people with the satisfying pop that comes with opening a bottle of real champagne .
" we decided to launch a festive drink for muslims , completely alcohol free , " said arnaud jacquemin , one of the drink 's creators .
" for weddings , for birthdays or the end of the year they have to drink orange juice , or soda , which is n't festive . "
jacquemin is n't himself muslim , but while working in the beverage industry , he saw sales of non-alcoholic drinks consistently rise and realized this market was largely untapped .
night orient tastes far sweeter than real champagne .
focus group testing showed the version initially developed was a little too dry for consumers unaccustomed to drinking wine .
so the formula was changed to better appeal to the muslim palate .
the beverage had a successful test run in some paris area supermarkets .
the small company has since signed deals with four national retail chains to officially launch the beverage in france during ramadan later this year .

the minister left the isaf camp in masar-i-sharif after the disruption to european airspace had already begun , but guttenberg hoped he would nonetheless make it back to germany . the defense minister was travelling with five bundeswehr soldiers wounded in a taliban attack in northern afghanistan on thursday . the group was first taken to a german military base in uzbekistan to board a medical transport carrier heading towards europe .
the soldiers were meant to be brought to military hospitals in germany to ensure that they would receive optimal care . with the plane redirected to turkey , the soldiers have spent the night at a us hospital in istanbul and are to continue to germany only at a later stage .
guttenberg on saturday continued his way back to germany albeit it remained unclear by which means of transportation . an ash cloud from a volcanic eruption in iceland on friday spread over most of europe , leading to more than half of all flights being cancelled .
germany 's entire airspace is affected by the problem , which has caused all major airports to be shut down . funeral for fallen soldiers set for sunday guttenberg had been scheduled to return to germany on thursday after a two-day visit to afghanistan . while in transit in uzbekistan , however , he was notified of the bloody attack - which killed four bundeswehr soldiers .
the minister subsequently returned to afghanistan with the bundeswehr 's chief of staff , volker wieker .
guttenberg visited the wounded soldiers at the german military base in masar-i-sharif on friday as they waited for a military aircraft equipped with proper medical equipment to bring them back to germany .
bundeswehr officials report that the wounded troops are all in stable condition .
while four of the five soldiers have sustained serious injuries , these are not believed to be life-threatening .
wieker is scheduled to stay on in afghanistan to attend the funeral service for the four soldiers , which is planned for sunday in the masar-i-sharif camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's funeral would follow a service held just last week explosive , not rocket , triggered thursday 's ambush the latest german casualties came after a bundeswehr patrol came under attack travelling between kunduz and baghlan on thursday .
after initially reporting that the deadly ambush began when a german armored vehicle was struck by a rocket close to pol-i-khomri camp , germany 's defense ministry on friday corrected this , saying the attackers used a remotely detonated explosive device .
three bundeswehr soldiers died in the initial explosion , with the fourth killed in an ensuing battle , in which the isaf troops are believed to have come under mortar and gunfire .
a total of 43 german soldiers have now been killed in afghanistan since the bundeswehr mission began in 2002 .
of those , 26 have been killed in firefights or insurgent attacks .
in recent weeks , taliban insurgents have stepped up pressure on the german troops based in the northern province of kunduz .

guttenberg on saturday continued his way back to germany albeit it remained unclear by which means of transportation . an ash cloud from a volcanic eruption in iceland on friday spread over most of europe , leading to more than half of all flights being cancelled .
germany 's entire airspace is affected by the problem , which has caused all major airports to be shut down . funeral for fallen soldiers set for sunday guttenberg had been scheduled to return to germany on thursday after a two-day visit to afghanistan . while in transit in uzbekistan , however , he was notified of the bloody attack - which killed four bundeswehr soldiers .
the minister subsequently returned to afghanistan with the bundeswehr 's chief of staff , volker wieker .
guttenberg visited the wounded soldiers at the german military base in masar-i-sharif on friday as they waited for a military aircraft equipped with proper medical equipment to bring them back to germany .
bundeswehr officials report that the wounded troops are all in stable condition .
while four of the five soldiers have sustained serious injuries , these are not believed to be life-threatening .
wieker is scheduled to stay on in afghanistan to attend the funeral service for the four soldiers , which is planned for sunday in the masar-i-sharif camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's funeral would follow a service held just last week explosive , not rocket , triggered thursday 's ambush the latest german casualties came after a bundeswehr patrol came under attack travelling between kunduz and baghlan on thursday .
after initially reporting that the deadly ambush began when a german armored vehicle was struck by a rocket close to pol-i-khomri camp , germany 's defense ministry on friday corrected this , saying the attackers used a remotely detonated explosive device .
three bundeswehr soldiers died in the initial explosion , with the fourth killed in an ensuing battle , in which the isaf troops are believed to have come under mortar and gunfire .
a total of 43 german soldiers have now been killed in afghanistan since the bundeswehr mission began in 2002 .
of those , 26 have been killed in firefights or insurgent attacks .
in recent weeks , taliban insurgents have stepped up pressure on the german troops based in the northern province of kunduz .
on april 2 , three german soldiers were killed during a mine-clearing expedition. ai / glb / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 17.04.2010 un troops unlikely to pull out from congo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monuc troops on patrol in kinshasa - the congolese capital in march , the congolese government asked the un mission to withdraw all its troops .
but the recent violence raises questions as to whether the government can actually secure the country without international help . next month , france is due to present a draft of a new resolution on the un mandate for the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- to the un security council . many observers are already asking how the recent violence in mbandaka in the northwestern province of equateur , where rebels seized an airport and killed 13 people , will affect the future of the un 's involvement .
with more than 20,000 troops , the un mission -lrb- monuc -rrb- is the largest and most expensive on the planet .
monuc arrived in drc in 1999 when what is now known as the second congo war involved seven other african countries : zimbabwe , angola , chad , namibia , burundi , rwanda , and uganda .
the countries supported opposing sides - laurent kabila 's government or rebel groups in eastern congo - for different reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobutu was toppled by laurent kabila in the first congo war -lrb- 1996 - 97 -rrb- angola supported kabila because he defeated mobutu sese seko , who had helped jonas savimbi 's unita in angola 's civil war which spanned over two decades .
on the other hand , rwanda helped the rally for congolese democracy -lrb- rcd -rrb- to support tutsis in drc against hutu militias .
but rwanda , much like uganda , has been part of the war also to exploit natural resources - especially diamonds - in eastern congo .
more than 5 million people have died since 1998 as a result of the conflict .
and those who have not died directly continue to die from malnutrition or preventable diseases like cholera while thousands of women , especially in the kivu region , have been raped and many infected with hiv .
monuc and congolese army not on the same page monuc was sent to strengthen the congolese national forces and protect the population .
but many feel that it has not helped .
in fact , in " killings in kiwanja : the un 's inability to protect civilians , " human rights watch reports that monuc has failed to protect the population .
it says that monuc 's failure led to the massacre of 150 people in kiwanja in december 2008 , and that un troops have raped girls and women in eastern congo .
james paul , executive director of the global policy forum , agrees that un forces have failed to protect the population .
in part , because they were expected to work with the congolese forces which have also been accused of human rights violations , including the rape of thousands of women .
" there have been problems in the relationship between the peacekeepers and the congolese army because of concern that the un has been identified with the violations , " paul said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of women and girls have been raped by rebels as a result , instead of working with the congolese army as it should have , monuc has distanced itself from the congolese army so as not to be complicit in the latter 's actions .
" the relations between monuc and the congolese government have deteriorated extremely over the last couple of years because they do n't see eye to eye on many issues , " denis tull , a research fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
next year 's election ups the stakes last month 's announcement by the congolese government that it wanted all un troops to leave the country by august 2011 should have come as no surprise .
but its timing was strategic .
" with the upcoming 50th anniversary of congo 's independence in june , the government does not want to see a permanent presence of the un , " tull said .
observers say the government wants to take credit for the achievements that have taken place since monuc arrived in 1999 . this would put it in good light for the presidential elections in 2011 .
in spite of the criticism against monuc , it has helped to reduce the extent of the conflict and helped congo hold its first democratic elections in over four decades in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president joseph kabila won the elections in 2006 " president kabila wants to be able to say to the congolese people that he made the un mission leave because there is peace in the country , " tull said .
fabienne hara , the vice-president of multilateral relations at the international crisis group , agrees .
she told deutsche welle that " one of the reasons why the congolese government wants to see monuc withdraw is that they also want to be in charge of their own elections . "
un troops withdrawal unlikely however , it is unlikely that the congolese government will get exactly what it wants .
even though 2,000 un troops are to leave congo by june 30th , a report in march by un secretary general ban ki-moon , recommends that troops remain in the more unstable eastern congo .
also , the recent violence in equateur will very likely affect the future of the un mission .
" this new episode in equateur shows that even western congo is not completely stable despite what the government is saying .
there 's still some serious sources of tensions elsewhere in the congo , " hara said .
the un security council delegation visiting the democratic republic of congo over the next few days will most certainly take the recent violence in equateur into consideration , and un troops are expected to remain in the eastern part of the country because " any withdrawal from eastern congo would be a major catastrophe for the civilian population , " tull said .

they 've been in the country for decades , but the mainstream food industry is only just starting to cater to them . customers walking through the aisles of some paris area supermarkets are now likely to find halal meat and processed foods .
whether it 's spicy ready-to-eat chicken wings , halal pate , or mock ham made from turkey , halal products are increasingly making their way into mainstream shopping venues .
it may not seem like much , but for france this marks a striking change .
this was made evident last summer when the zakia food brand aired the first nationally broadcast television commercial for halal food .
it turned enough heads to make it into french newscasts .
halal means legal or lawful in arabic and refers to foods that are sanctioned by islamic authorities .
pork , blood and alcohol are not halal .
food industry observers say supermarkets and the rest of the food industry are just following the money trail .
" five and a half billion euros are going to be spent on these kinds of products this year in france , " said abbas bendali , the head of solis , a market research firm specialized in ethnic niches .
" there are five million potential customers .
so this is more than a niche , this is a real consumer segment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french food companies are shedding their misconceptions about halal meat new generation of customers a few years ago , halal foods could only be found in small shops in low-rent immigrant neighborhoods .
now france 's second largest supermarket chain , casino , has hired abderrahman bouzid to manage the halal and traditional muslim foods sold in its 10,000 stores .
he said the market is growing thanks to a new generation of french muslims .
" those under the age of 40 do n't have any hang-ups about affirming who they are ; they want to be taken into consideration , " bouzid said , explaining that muslim consumers are perfectly aware of their buying power and will prefer retailers that offer halal products .
" they 're saying ' if you are dismissive of my needs , by ignoring my customs and my preferences , i wo n't shop in your business ' , " he added .
casino has even created its own halal product line , which it markets under the name wassila .
others in the food industry are following suit .
international brands such as knorr , maggi , liebig and french firms like duc and fleury michon have all started selling halal options .
they now compete with established halal brands such as zakia , isla delice and medina .
attitudes shift some of these brands and others recently attended a halal trade show in paris , where visitors could find everything from halal foie gras and faux-bacon cheese burgers to microwaveable halal meals such as lasagna and chicken curry with rice .
antoine bonnel started the fair six years ago , when it attracted far fewer exhibitors .
this year , 100 companies participated .
bonnel said he has noticed an attitude shift in the food industry .
in the past , mainstream brands did n't want to be associates with halal because it was considered low-brow , he said , adding that french muslims had little money and unenviable social positions .
" these people came from a very poor immigrant background , " bonnel said .
" so the global image was a cheap image . "
there were also misconceptions about the ritual slaughter of animals required for meat to be considered halal .
and there were rumors that some of the taxes for this ritual could be funneled to questionable foreign causes .
bildunterschrift : young muslims represent a significant consumer segment some of this unease came to the surface earlier this year , when fast food chain quick revealed it had made eight of its 362 restaurants halal .
several french politicians criticized the move and the extreme-right national front highlighted the company in its anti-immigrant rhetoric .
but from a business perspective , the new buying power and improved social status of the young muslim generation are sweeping misgivings to the side .
sweeter than champagne the upcoming french launch of a non-alcoholic sparkling wine is just one example of that .
the drink , called " night orient , " is sold in what looks like a champagne bottle and provides people with the satisfying pop that comes with opening a bottle of real champagne .
" we decided to launch a festive drink for muslims , completely alcohol free , " said arnaud jacquemin , one of the drink 's creators .
" for weddings , for birthdays or the end of the year they have to drink orange juice , or soda , which is n't festive . "
jacquemin is n't himself muslim , but while working in the beverage industry , he saw sales of non-alcoholic drinks consistently rise and realized this market was largely untapped .
night orient tastes far sweeter than real champagne .
focus group testing showed the version initially developed was a little too dry for consumers unaccustomed to drinking wine .
so the formula was changed to better appeal to the muslim palate .
the beverage had a successful test run in some paris area supermarkets .
the small company has since signed deals with four national retail chains to officially launch the beverage in france during ramadan later this year .

they 've been in the country for decades , but the mainstream food industry is only just starting to cater to them . customers walking through the aisles of some paris area supermarkets are now likely to find halal meat and processed foods .
whether it 's spicy ready-to-eat chicken wings , halal pate , or mock ham made from turkey , halal products are increasingly making their way into mainstream shopping venues .
it may not seem like much , but for france this marks a striking change .
this was made evident last summer when the zakia food brand aired the first nationally broadcast television commercial for halal food .
it turned enough heads to make it into french newscasts .
halal means legal or lawful in arabic and refers to foods that are sanctioned by islamic authorities .
pork , blood and alcohol are not halal .
food industry observers say supermarkets and the rest of the food industry are just following the money trail .
" five and a half billion euros are going to be spent on these kinds of products this year in france , " said abbas bendali , the head of solis , a market research firm specialized in ethnic niches .
" there are five million potential customers .
so this is more than a niche , this is a real consumer segment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french food companies are shedding their misconceptions about halal meat new generation of customers a few years ago , halal foods could only be found in small shops in low-rent immigrant neighborhoods .
now france 's second largest supermarket chain , casino , has hired abderrahman bouzid to manage the halal and traditional muslim foods sold in its 10,000 stores .
he said the market is growing thanks to a new generation of french muslims .
" those under the age of 40 do n't have any hang-ups about affirming who they are ; they want to be taken into consideration , " bouzid said , explaining that muslim consumers are perfectly aware of their buying power and will prefer retailers that offer halal products .
" they 're saying ' if you are dismissive of my needs , by ignoring my customs and my preferences , i wo n't shop in your business ' , " he added .
casino has even created its own halal product line , which it markets under the name wassila .
others in the food industry are following suit .
international brands such as knorr , maggi , liebig and french firms like duc and fleury michon have all started selling halal options .
they now compete with established halal brands such as zakia , isla delice and medina .
attitudes shift some of these brands and others recently attended a halal trade show in paris , where visitors could find everything from halal foie gras and faux-bacon cheese burgers to microwaveable halal meals such as lasagna and chicken curry with rice .
antoine bonnel started the fair six years ago , when it attracted far fewer exhibitors .
this year , 100 companies participated .
bonnel said he has noticed an attitude shift in the food industry .
in the past , mainstream brands did n't want to be associates with halal because it was considered low-brow , he said , adding that french muslims had little money and unenviable social positions .
" these people came from a very poor immigrant background , " bonnel said .
" so the global image was a cheap image . "
there were also misconceptions about the ritual slaughter of animals required for meat to be considered halal .
and there were rumors that some of the taxes for this ritual could be funneled to questionable foreign causes .
bildunterschrift : young muslims represent a significant consumer segment some of this unease came to the surface earlier this year , when fast food chain quick revealed it had made eight of its 362 restaurants halal .
several french politicians criticized the move and the extreme-right national front highlighted the company in its anti-immigrant rhetoric .
but from a business perspective , the new buying power and improved social status of the young muslim generation are sweeping misgivings to the side .
sweeter than champagne the upcoming french launch of a non-alcoholic sparkling wine is just one example of that .
the drink , called " night orient , " is sold in what looks like a champagne bottle and provides people with the satisfying pop that comes with opening a bottle of real champagne .
" we decided to launch a festive drink for muslims , completely alcohol free , " said arnaud jacquemin , one of the drink 's creators .
" for weddings , for birthdays or the end of the year they have to drink orange juice , or soda , which is n't festive . "
jacquemin is n't himself muslim , but while working in the beverage industry , he saw sales of non-alcoholic drinks consistently rise and realized this market was largely untapped .
night orient tastes far sweeter than real champagne .
focus group testing showed the version initially developed was a little too dry for consumers unaccustomed to drinking wine .
so the formula was changed to better appeal to the muslim palate .
the beverage had a successful test run in some paris area supermarkets .
the small company has since signed deals with four national retail chains to officially launch the beverage in france during ramadan later this year .

but the recent violence raises questions as to whether the government can actually secure the country without international help . next month , france is due to present a draft of a new resolution on the un mandate for the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- to the un security council . many observers are already asking how the recent violence in mbandaka in the northwestern province of equateur , where rebels seized an airport and killed 13 people , will affect the future of the un 's involvement .
with more than 20,000 troops , the un mission -lrb- monuc -rrb- is the largest and most expensive on the planet .
monuc arrived in drc in 1999 when what is now known as the second congo war involved seven other african countries : zimbabwe , angola , chad , namibia , burundi , rwanda , and uganda .
the countries supported opposing sides - laurent kabila 's government or rebel groups in eastern congo - for different reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobutu was toppled by laurent kabila in the first congo war -lrb- 1996 - 97 -rrb- angola supported kabila because he defeated mobutu sese seko , who had helped jonas savimbi 's unita in angola 's civil war which spanned over two decades .
on the other hand , rwanda helped the rally for congolese democracy -lrb- rcd -rrb- to support tutsis in drc against hutu militias .
but rwanda , much like uganda , has been part of the war also to exploit natural resources - especially diamonds - in eastern congo .
more than 5 million people have died since 1998 as a result of the conflict .
and those who have not died directly continue to die from malnutrition or preventable diseases like cholera while thousands of women , especially in the kivu region , have been raped and many infected with hiv .
monuc and congolese army not on the same page monuc was sent to strengthen the congolese national forces and protect the population .
but many feel that it has not helped .
in fact , in " killings in kiwanja : the un 's inability to protect civilians , " human rights watch reports that monuc has failed to protect the population .
it says that monuc 's failure led to the massacre of 150 people in kiwanja in december 2008 , and that un troops have raped girls and women in eastern congo .
james paul , executive director of the global policy forum , agrees that un forces have failed to protect the population .
in part , because they were expected to work with the congolese forces which have also been accused of human rights violations , including the rape of thousands of women .
" there have been problems in the relationship between the peacekeepers and the congolese army because of concern that the un has been identified with the violations , " paul said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of women and girls have been raped by rebels as a result , instead of working with the congolese army as it should have , monuc has distanced itself from the congolese army so as not to be complicit in the latter 's actions .
" the relations between monuc and the congolese government have deteriorated extremely over the last couple of years because they do n't see eye to eye on many issues , " denis tull , a research fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
next year 's election ups the stakes last month 's announcement by the congolese government that it wanted all un troops to leave the country by august 2011 should have come as no surprise .
but its timing was strategic .
" with the upcoming 50th anniversary of congo 's independence in june , the government does not want to see a permanent presence of the un , " tull said .
observers say the government wants to take credit for the achievements that have taken place since monuc arrived in 1999 . this would put it in good light for the presidential elections in 2011 .
in spite of the criticism against monuc , it has helped to reduce the extent of the conflict and helped congo hold its first democratic elections in over four decades in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president joseph kabila won the elections in 2006 " president kabila wants to be able to say to the congolese people that he made the un mission leave because there is peace in the country , " tull said .
fabienne hara , the vice-president of multilateral relations at the international crisis group , agrees .
she told deutsche welle that " one of the reasons why the congolese government wants to see monuc withdraw is that they also want to be in charge of their own elections . "
un troops withdrawal unlikely however , it is unlikely that the congolese government will get exactly what it wants .
even though 2,000 un troops are to leave congo by june 30th , a report in march by un secretary general ban ki-moon , recommends that troops remain in the more unstable eastern congo .
also , the recent violence in equateur will very likely affect the future of the un mission .
" this new episode in equateur shows that even western congo is not completely stable despite what the government is saying .
there 's still some serious sources of tensions elsewhere in the congo , " hara said .
the un security council delegation visiting the democratic republic of congo over the next few days will most certainly take the recent violence in equateur into consideration , and un troops are expected to remain in the eastern part of the country because " any withdrawal from eastern congo would be a major catastrophe for the civilian population , " tull said .

but the recent violence raises questions as to whether the government can actually secure the country without international help . next month , france is due to present a draft of a new resolution on the un mandate for the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- to the un security council . many observers are already asking how the recent violence in mbandaka in the northwestern province of equateur , where rebels seized an airport and killed 13 people , will affect the future of the un 's involvement .
with more than 20,000 troops , the un mission -lrb- monuc -rrb- is the largest and most expensive on the planet .
monuc arrived in drc in 1999 when what is now known as the second congo war involved seven other african countries : zimbabwe , angola , chad , namibia , burundi , rwanda , and uganda .
the countries supported opposing sides - laurent kabila 's government or rebel groups in eastern congo - for different reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobutu was toppled by laurent kabila in the first congo war -lrb- 1996 - 97 -rrb- angola supported kabila because he defeated mobutu sese seko , who had helped jonas savimbi 's unita in angola 's civil war which spanned over two decades .
on the other hand , rwanda helped the rally for congolese democracy -lrb- rcd -rrb- to support tutsis in drc against hutu militias .
but rwanda , much like uganda , has been part of the war also to exploit natural resources - especially diamonds - in eastern congo .
more than 5 million people have died since 1998 as a result of the conflict .
and those who have not died directly continue to die from malnutrition or preventable diseases like cholera while thousands of women , especially in the kivu region , have been raped and many infected with hiv .
monuc and congolese army not on the same page monuc was sent to strengthen the congolese national forces and protect the population .
but many feel that it has not helped .
in fact , in " killings in kiwanja : the un 's inability to protect civilians , " human rights watch reports that monuc has failed to protect the population .
it says that monuc 's failure led to the massacre of 150 people in kiwanja in december 2008 , and that un troops have raped girls and women in eastern congo .
james paul , executive director of the global policy forum , agrees that un forces have failed to protect the population .
in part , because they were expected to work with the congolese forces which have also been accused of human rights violations , including the rape of thousands of women .
" there have been problems in the relationship between the peacekeepers and the congolese army because of concern that the un has been identified with the violations , " paul said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of women and girls have been raped by rebels as a result , instead of working with the congolese army as it should have , monuc has distanced itself from the congolese army so as not to be complicit in the latter 's actions .
" the relations between monuc and the congolese government have deteriorated extremely over the last couple of years because they do n't see eye to eye on many issues , " denis tull , a research fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
next year 's election ups the stakes last month 's announcement by the congolese government that it wanted all un troops to leave the country by august 2011 should have come as no surprise .
but its timing was strategic .
" with the upcoming 50th anniversary of congo 's independence in june , the government does not want to see a permanent presence of the un , " tull said .
observers say the government wants to take credit for the achievements that have taken place since monuc arrived in 1999 . this would put it in good light for the presidential elections in 2011 .
in spite of the criticism against monuc , it has helped to reduce the extent of the conflict and helped congo hold its first democratic elections in over four decades in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president joseph kabila won the elections in 2006 " president kabila wants to be able to say to the congolese people that he made the un mission leave because there is peace in the country , " tull said .
fabienne hara , the vice-president of multilateral relations at the international crisis group , agrees .
she told deutsche welle that " one of the reasons why the congolese government wants to see monuc withdraw is that they also want to be in charge of their own elections . "
un troops withdrawal unlikely however , it is unlikely that the congolese government will get exactly what it wants .
even though 2,000 un troops are to leave congo by june 30th , a report in march by un secretary general ban ki-moon , recommends that troops remain in the more unstable eastern congo .
also , the recent violence in equateur will very likely affect the future of the un mission .
" this new episode in equateur shows that even western congo is not completely stable despite what the government is saying .
there 's still some serious sources of tensions elsewhere in the congo , " hara said .
the un security council delegation visiting the democratic republic of congo over the next few days will most certainly take the recent violence in equateur into consideration , and un troops are expected to remain in the eastern part of the country because " any withdrawal from eastern congo would be a major catastrophe for the civilian population , " tull said .

the minister left the isaf camp in masar-i-sharif after the disruption to european airspace had already begun , but guttenberg hoped he would nonetheless make it back to germany . the defense minister was travelling with five bundeswehr soldiers wounded in a taliban attack in northern afghanistan on thursday . the group was first taken to a german military base in uzbekistan to board a medical transport carrier heading towards europe .
the soldiers were meant to be brought to military hospitals in germany to ensure that they would receive optimal care . with the plane redirected to turkey , the soldiers have spent the night at a us hospital in istanbul and are to continue to germany only at a later stage .
guttenberg on saturday continued his way back to germany albeit it remained unclear by which means of transportation . an ash cloud from a volcanic eruption in iceland on friday spread over most of europe , leading to more than half of all flights being cancelled .
germany 's entire airspace is affected by the problem , which has caused all major airports to be shut down . funeral for fallen soldiers set for sunday guttenberg had been scheduled to return to germany on thursday after a two-day visit to afghanistan . while in transit in uzbekistan , however , he was notified of the bloody attack - which killed four bundeswehr soldiers .
the minister subsequently returned to afghanistan with the bundeswehr 's chief of staff , volker wieker .
guttenberg visited the wounded soldiers at the german military base in masar-i-sharif on friday as they waited for a military aircraft equipped with proper medical equipment to bring them back to germany .
bundeswehr officials report that the wounded troops are all in stable condition .
while four of the five soldiers have sustained serious injuries , these are not believed to be life-threatening .
wieker is scheduled to stay on in afghanistan to attend the funeral service for the four soldiers , which is planned for sunday in the masar-i-sharif camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's funeral would follow a service held just last week explosive , not rocket , triggered thursday 's ambush the latest german casualties came after a bundeswehr patrol came under attack travelling between kunduz and baghlan on thursday .
after initially reporting that the deadly ambush began when a german armored vehicle was struck by a rocket close to pol-i-khomri camp , germany 's defense ministry on friday corrected this , saying the attackers used a remotely detonated explosive device .
three bundeswehr soldiers died in the initial explosion , with the fourth killed in an ensuing battle , in which the isaf troops are believed to have come under mortar and gunfire .
a total of 43 german soldiers have now been killed in afghanistan since the bundeswehr mission began in 2002 .
of those , 26 have been killed in firefights or insurgent attacks .
in recent weeks , taliban insurgents have stepped up pressure on the german troops based in the northern province of kunduz .

the minister left the isaf camp in masar-i-sharif after the disruption to european airspace had already begun , but guttenberg hoped he would nonetheless make it back to germany . the defense minister was travelling with five bundeswehr soldiers wounded in a taliban attack in northern afghanistan on thursday . the group was first taken to a german military base in uzbekistan to board a medical transport carrier heading towards europe .

the minister left the isaf camp in masar-i-sharif after the disruption to european airspace had already begun , but guttenberg hoped he would nonetheless make it back to germany . the defense minister was travelling with five bundeswehr soldiers wounded in a taliban attack in northern afghanistan on thursday . the group was first taken to a german military base in uzbekistan to board a medical transport carrier heading towards europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 17.04.2010 french supermarkets tap rising demand for halal food großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : halal fast food has finally caught on in france with an estimated five million muslims , france has the biggest islamic population in europe .
they 've been in the country for decades , but the mainstream food industry is only just starting to cater to them . customers walking through the aisles of some paris area supermarkets are now likely to find halal meat and processed foods .
whether it 's spicy ready-to-eat chicken wings , halal pate , or mock ham made from turkey , halal products are increasingly making their way into mainstream shopping venues .
it may not seem like much , but for france this marks a striking change .
this was made evident last summer when the zakia food brand aired the first nationally broadcast television commercial for halal food .
it turned enough heads to make it into french newscasts .
halal means legal or lawful in arabic and refers to foods that are sanctioned by islamic authorities .
pork , blood and alcohol are not halal .
food industry observers say supermarkets and the rest of the food industry are just following the money trail .
" five and a half billion euros are going to be spent on these kinds of products this year in france , " said abbas bendali , the head of solis , a market research firm specialized in ethnic niches .
" there are five million potential customers .
so this is more than a niche , this is a real consumer segment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french food companies are shedding their misconceptions about halal meat new generation of customers a few years ago , halal foods could only be found in small shops in low-rent immigrant neighborhoods .
now france 's second largest supermarket chain , casino , has hired abderrahman bouzid to manage the halal and traditional muslim foods sold in its 10,000 stores .
he said the market is growing thanks to a new generation of french muslims .
" those under the age of 40 do n't have any hang-ups about affirming who they are ; they want to be taken into consideration , " bouzid said , explaining that muslim consumers are perfectly aware of their buying power and will prefer retailers that offer halal products .
" they 're saying ' if you are dismissive of my needs , by ignoring my customs and my preferences , i wo n't shop in your business ' , " he added .
casino has even created its own halal product line , which it markets under the name wassila .
others in the food industry are following suit .
international brands such as knorr , maggi , liebig and french firms like duc and fleury michon have all started selling halal options .
they now compete with established halal brands such as zakia , isla delice and medina .
attitudes shift some of these brands and others recently attended a halal trade show in paris , where visitors could find everything from halal foie gras and faux-bacon cheese burgers to microwaveable halal meals such as lasagna and chicken curry with rice .
antoine bonnel started the fair six years ago , when it attracted far fewer exhibitors .
this year , 100 companies participated .
bonnel said he has noticed an attitude shift in the food industry .
in the past , mainstream brands did n't want to be associates with halal because it was considered low-brow , he said , adding that french muslims had little money and unenviable social positions .
" these people came from a very poor immigrant background , " bonnel said .
" so the global image was a cheap image . "
there were also misconceptions about the ritual slaughter of animals required for meat to be considered halal .
and there were rumors that some of the taxes for this ritual could be funneled to questionable foreign causes .
bildunterschrift : young muslims represent a significant consumer segment some of this unease came to the surface earlier this year , when fast food chain quick revealed it had made eight of its 362 restaurants halal .
several french politicians criticized the move and the extreme-right national front highlighted the company in its anti-immigrant rhetoric .
but from a business perspective , the new buying power and improved social status of the young muslim generation are sweeping misgivings to the side .
sweeter than champagne the upcoming french launch of a non-alcoholic sparkling wine is just one example of that .
the drink , called " night orient , " is sold in what looks like a champagne bottle and provides people with the satisfying pop that comes with opening a bottle of real champagne .
" we decided to launch a festive drink for muslims , completely alcohol free , " said arnaud jacquemin , one of the drink 's creators .
" for weddings , for birthdays or the end of the year they have to drink orange juice , or soda , which is n't festive . "
jacquemin is n't himself muslim , but while working in the beverage industry , he saw sales of non-alcoholic drinks consistently rise and realized this market was largely untapped .
night orient tastes far sweeter than real champagne .
focus group testing showed the version initially developed was a little too dry for consumers unaccustomed to drinking wine .
so the formula was changed to better appeal to the muslim palate .
the beverage had a successful test run in some paris area supermarkets .
the small company has since signed deals with four national retail chains to officially launch the beverage in france during ramadan later this year .

it 's also caused major financial losses for airlines and sent their stocks tumbling . airlines were reeling saturday as flights and passengers remained grounded for a third straight day due to the icelandic volcanic ash cloud hovering over much of europe .
large flag carriers and no-frills airlines alike saw their shares dip on friday . the eurocontrol air traffic agency in brussels estimates that nearly 60 per cent of the region 's 28,000 daily flights , have been affected by the volcanic ash . british airways shares closed down more than 3 per cent on friday , while in ireland budget airline ryanair was down 2.3 per cent .
europe 's largest airline by revenue , lufthansa , ended the day down 4 per cent , while air france-klm slid by 3.4 per cent .
the disruption in travel is costing airliners roughly 148 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- in lost revenues per day .
after friday , about 16,000 flights were cancelled , making it the largest airspace shutdown since the second world war .
" in addition to lost revenues , airlines will incur added costs for re-routing of aircraft , care for stranded passengers and stranded aircraft at various ports , " the aviation industry body iata said in a statement on friday .
the association of european airlines estimated that the european economy had lost about one billion euros so far from flight bans across the continent .
however , airline reinsurers played down the potential of the ash cloud to greatly disturb business , hurt agriculture , or cause property damage .
" as long as the restriction to air travel remains temporary as is now expected , there should be no measureable impact for the broader economy , " said reinsurer munich re in a statement .
" it 's just an issue for the airlines to handle . "
airlines are typically not insured against cancellations .
other industries affected deutsche post , europe 's largest mail and express delivery company , said the cloud has disrupted delivery by air and the company has switched to land transport where possible .
the cloud has even affected the hotel industry throughout asia , as dozens of cancelled european flights have left hotels struggling to accommodate thousands of passengers .
but according to energy company officials , oil , gas , and electricity production in europe is not likely to suffer .
the one direct effect from the ash cloud is that offshore workers in the north sea will have to wait longer for replacements , as helicopters were also grounded as part of the flight ban .
flight bans have been imposed by more than 15 european countries .
britain , germany , finland , slovakia , estonia and denmark have extended their bans until sunday. mk / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airlines are typically not insured against cancellations .
other industries affected deutsche post , europe 's largest mail and express delivery company , said the cloud has disrupted delivery by air and the company has switched to land transport where possible .
the cloud has even affected the hotel industry throughout asia , as dozens of cancelled european flights have left hotels struggling to accommodate thousands of passengers .
but according to energy company officials , oil , gas , and electricity production in europe is not likely to suffer .
the one direct effect from the ash cloud is that offshore workers in the north sea will have to wait longer for replacements , as helicopters were also grounded as part of the flight ban .
flight bans have been imposed by more than 15 european countries .
britain , germany , finland , slovakia , estonia and denmark have extended their bans until sunday. mk / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more than 20 countries have closed their airspace with some countries calling off all flights until monday morning . european flights remained grounded on saturday due to a vast cloud of volcanic ash from iceland that has covered much of europe and has spread as far east as russia .
britain , ireland , switzerland , and belgium all extended their flight bans on saturday .
more than 20 european countries grounded flights because of the ash cloud .
the disruption hit german chancellor angela merkel who was trying to return to berlin from the united states on friday when her plane was diverted to lisbon .
she flew to rome on saturday , having to spend the night in italy . the chancellor will therefore be unable to attend the funeral of polish president lech kaczynski on sunday .
in addition , flights bringing home the bodies of german soldiers killed in afghanistan along with soldiers wounded in the country were redirected to turkey .
bildunterschrift : the last time the volcano erupted , in the 19th century , it continued sporadically for over a year things could get worse volcanic ash can terminally damage the engines and windows of jetliners .
the national air traffic services , which oversees british airspace , said the situation from the cloud is getting worse . experts tracking the volcano beneath the eyjafjallajokull glacier said there were no signs of reduced activity on friday .
after a relatively minor eruption one month ago , the volcano erupted again on wednesday , with these two incidents breaking almost 200 years of dormancy .
that last recorded eruption continued - with varying levels of severity and intermittent periods of inactivity - for almost 18 months between 1821 and 1823 .
" we have no prediction on how long -lsb- the eruption -rsb- will last , " said geophysicist bergthora thorbjnardottir at the iceland meteorological office .
hundreds of thousands stranded westerly and north-westerly winds have blown the ash across swathes of northern and central europe , grounding some 17,000 flights on friday , after around 6,000 were cancelled on thursday .
the disruption is costing airlines over 148 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- per day .
currently , only emergency flights are permitted into and out of the affected regions in europe .
all 16 international airports in germany were closed on saturday with no flights set to take off until at least 2pm on sunday .

" everything that can run is running . "
the eurostar train service linking britain and mainland europe via the channel tunnel is fully booked , with the company reporting 38,000 travelers on friday , 10,000 more than average .
international coach services also claimed to be running at five times their usual capacity due to a surge in demand .
rental car companies reported a similar phenomenon , with some passengers even electing to drive long journeys to foreign destinations .

the mass on a specially designed stage in the shape of a staircase was celebrated by polish bishops and the vatican envoy , cardinal angelo sodano " things like this never happen ; they are impossible .
it is the greatest tragedy in the history of poland since world war ii , " prime minister donald tusk told the assembled mourners . " they all had their dreams and hopes for the future of their homeland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 17.04.2010 last-second heroics clinch pole for vettel in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel has been dominating in qualifying this season sebastian vettel will start sunday 's chinese formula one grand prix on pole position , after another stunning qualifying performance .
it 's vettel 's third pole in four races this season . sebastian vettel claimed a last-gasp pole position in shanghai on saturday , and will line up at the head of the field for formula one 's chinese grand prix .
it 's vettel 's third pole position in four races , with his red bull teammate mark webber qualifying second .
vettel had appeared to be struggling over the course of the weekend . yet when it mattered most , in the dying moments of the final segment of qualifying -lrb- " q3 " -rrb- , he found another gear and laid down comfortably the fastest lap of the entire weekend .
" how do you do that ? "
vettel 's bewildered race engineer asked over team radio , immediately after the german lit up the timing screens .
" woohoo !
yes , baby ! " replied the 22-year old .
red bull have dominated qualifying this season , with one of their cars starting at the front for every race so far .
however , in china it looked like mclaren 's lewis hamilton had the upper hand , especially in the high-speed sections of the circuit .
" what a qualifying session , it was pretty incredible , " vettel said in the press conference afterwards .
" at the start of the session i was n't entirely happy , especially in the first sector of the lap , but by the end i was totally satisfied with the car , and was the quickest driver across almost the entire lap . "
" i want to say thanks to the mechanics , they certainly did n't get a lunch break today !
they had to work flat out between practice and qualifying to fix the problems we were having with the car but , as always , they did a great job . "
if vettel - who won the last race in malaysia - can convert his qualifying performance into another win on sunday , he would be guaranteed to take the lead in the world championship , regardless of where his competition finishes .
mixed fortunes at mercedes behind the red bull duo , ferrari 's spanish double world champion , fernando alonso , secured third place , with mercedes driver nico rosberg an impressive fourth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosberg has been overshadowing veteran teammate schumacher " i 'd say i 'm pretty happy , " rosberg told german television .
" this morning it looked much worse for us , but now we 're really close to the front .
red bull seems to have a bit of an advantage , but then there 's us and ferrari not far behind . "
however , mercedes ' other german driver , seven-time champion michael schumacher , qualified far behind his teammate in ninth , seven tenths of a second -lrb- a deceptively long time in formula one terms -rrb- adrift of rosberg .
" i know where i lost those seven tenths , so i can handle it , " schumacher said .
" but of course it 's a pity .
nico has a well set-up car , and he got the best out of it , and obviously i would have liked to achieve the same .
i shall try to do so in the race tomorrow . "
so far , either through reliability problems or a lack of speed , the highly anticipated return of schumacher to f1 after three years away has not delivered impressive results - with qualifying pace arguably his biggest problem .
sutil impresses again germany 's other strong qualifier was adrian sutil , driving for the relatively small force india team .
the 27-year old , who has never scored a top three finish in his career , starts just behind f1 's most successful driver schumacher in tenth position .
sutil has been in the top ten at the start of every race this year , by far the best performance of his career to date , but the other cars ahead of him are likely to prove too strong in the race on sunday .
the mclaren drivers jenson button and lewis hamilton - who were tipped to shine in shanghai - line up fifth and sixth , ferrari 's felipe massa starts seventh , and robert kubica grabbed eighth place for renault .
germany 's rookie nico hulkenberg is a rather disappointing sixteenth on the grid for williams , with countryman timo glock nineteenth in his virgin racing car .
glock wins the dubious honor , once again , of being the fastest driver at any of formula one 's three new teams - all of whom have been well adrift of the rest of the field so far this season .

more than 20 countries have closed their airspace with some countries calling off all flights until monday morning . european flights remained grounded on saturday due to a vast cloud of volcanic ash from iceland that has covered much of europe and has spread as far east as russia .
britain , ireland , switzerland , and belgium all extended their flight bans on saturday .
more than 20 european countries grounded flights because of the ash cloud .
the disruption hit german chancellor angela merkel who was trying to return to berlin from the united states on friday when her plane was diverted to lisbon .
she flew to rome on saturday , having to spend the night in italy . the chancellor will therefore be unable to attend the funeral of polish president lech kaczynski on sunday .
in addition , flights bringing home the bodies of german soldiers killed in afghanistan along with soldiers wounded in the country were redirected to turkey .
bildunterschrift : the last time the volcano erupted , in the 19th century , it continued sporadically for over a year things could get worse volcanic ash can terminally damage the engines and windows of jetliners .
the national air traffic services , which oversees british airspace , said the situation from the cloud is getting worse . experts tracking the volcano beneath the eyjafjallajokull glacier said there were no signs of reduced activity on friday .
after a relatively minor eruption one month ago , the volcano erupted again on wednesday , with these two incidents breaking almost 200 years of dormancy .
that last recorded eruption continued - with varying levels of severity and intermittent periods of inactivity - for almost 18 months between 1821 and 1823 .
" we have no prediction on how long -lsb- the eruption -rsb- will last , " said geophysicist bergthora thorbjnardottir at the iceland meteorological office .
hundreds of thousands stranded westerly and north-westerly winds have blown the ash across swathes of northern and central europe , grounding some 17,000 flights on friday , after around 6,000 were cancelled on thursday .
the disruption is costing airlines over 148 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- per day .
currently , only emergency flights are permitted into and out of the affected regions in europe .
all 16 international airports in germany were closed on saturday with no flights set to take off until at least 2pm on sunday .

the eurostar train service linking britain and mainland europe via the channel tunnel is fully booked , with the company reporting 38,000 travelers on friday , 10,000 more than average .
international coach services also claimed to be running at five times their usual capacity due to a surge in demand .

but now this pristine winemaking region is threatened by a bridge that is to span the valley , against the wishes of many locals and winemakers . the moselle valley in western germany is known for its picturesque views and world-famous moselle riesling wine .
the region thrives on the wine industry and the tourism that it brings .
in an effort to boost access to the valley , the national and state government have launched a project to build a bridge across the moselle valley .
supporters of the project say it will boost tourism in the region by shortening the travel time between neighboring belgium and luxembourg .
they say traffic congestion will be relieved for locals , and commercial connections to nearby airports will be improved .
but not everyone in the valley is convinced that building the bridge is worth it .
they 're afraid the damage to the landscape and the environment will outweigh the benefits .
pro-moselle bildunterschrift : pictures from pro-moselle showing the valley as it is and what will change with the bridge a group of citizens in the valley have formed a group called pro-moselle .
they are against the construction of the bridge , and have started a number of initiatives to try to stop construction .
last spring the group stopped tractors from digging at the official groundbreaking ceremony of the bridge , and a petition against the bridge can be signed on the group 's web site or at one of their regularly scheduled sunday demonstrations .
on sundays , members of the group meet in the town of bernkastel to gather signatures .
they hold two panoramic photographs : one shows how the valley looks now , while the other shows the same image but with the proposed bridge added in .
" these pictures alone say it all , " a woman visiting from moenchengladbach who signed the petition told deutsche welle .
" we 're enjoying the landscape here as tourists , without a bridge .
with a bridge , it is unthinkable . "
wine allies plans for the bridge have been on the books since the late 1960s , but it was n't until late 2008 that the project was given the green light .
most of the 270 million euros -lrb- $ 366 million -rrb- budgeted for the project is coming from the federal government , with the government of the state of rhineland-palatinate chipping in 20 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wine expert hugh johnson says moselle riesling is one of a kind the pro-moselle group has gained support from german politicians and leaders in the wine world .
former foreign minister joschka fisher and the co-leader of the greens ' parliamentary party , renate kuenast , are on board , as is hugh johnson , a world-renowned wine writer from britain .
johnson calls the planned bridge a ' road on stilts . '
in a video posted on the pro-moselle website , he calls on the citizens of the area to stand up and fight for the moselle valley and its one-of-a-kind wine .
" i can tell you that the whole world has nothing comparable to a moselle riesling .
you can imitate the wine of bordeaux in the napa valley , " johnson said .
" you can even imitate the wine of burgundy in certain places .
but there is nothing that even starts to imitate great moselle riesling . "
a long tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus berres markus berres runs the c.h. berres winery in uerzig , a town that will basically fall under the shadow of the bridge once it is completed .
his family has been in the business for 500 years , and the 31-year-old winemaker is part of the 21st generation to run the family business in the moselle valley .
he fears that tourists will be driven away once the bridge is built .
" this region lives from tourism and winemaking , " berres said in an interview with deutsche welle , " but who wants to take their holiday under a bridge ?
nobody .
so i do n't see any advantage to building the bridge . "
the state 's transportation minister , hendrik hering , announced that 35 million euros would be reinvested in the environment as a measure of compensation .
however , winemakers are still worried about the bridge 's effect on the water supply for the grapes growing on the slopes of the valley , or how the grapes will react to the additional car exhaust .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although it is years from completion , signs of the bridge are apparent " the vines will be growing with the bridge or without the bridge , " said markus berres .
" the question is , how high will the quality be ? "
too late to be stopped ?
preparation work is already underway on the bridge .
a receding tree line and dirt access roads are starting to give an indication of what the area will look like once the bridge is complete .
pro-moselle insists that as long as construction has not started , the bridge can still be stopped .
markus berres predicts that many people will move away from the valley if the bridge is completed .
in either case , berres says he 'll stay .
his family has made its living in the moselle valley for centuries , and berres plans to keep the tradition alive .
but for him , making germany 's famous moselle riesling wine just wo n't be the same in the shadow of a bridge .

it 's also caused major financial losses for airlines and sent their stocks tumbling . airlines were reeling saturday as flights and passengers remained grounded for a third straight day due to the icelandic volcanic ash cloud hovering over much of europe .
large flag carriers and no-frills airlines alike saw their shares dip on friday . the eurocontrol air traffic agency in brussels estimates that nearly 60 per cent of the region 's 28,000 daily flights , have been affected by the volcanic ash . british airways shares closed down more than 3 per cent on friday , while in ireland budget airline ryanair was down 2.3 per cent .
europe 's largest airline by revenue , lufthansa , ended the day down 4 per cent , while air france-klm slid by 3.4 per cent .
the disruption in travel is costing airliners roughly 148 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- in lost revenues per day .
after friday , about 16,000 flights were cancelled , making it the largest airspace shutdown since the second world war .
" in addition to lost revenues , airlines will incur added costs for re-routing of aircraft , care for stranded passengers and stranded aircraft at various ports , " the aviation industry body iata said in a statement on friday .
the association of european airlines estimated that the european economy had lost about one billion euros so far from flight bans across the continent .
however , airline reinsurers played down the potential of the ash cloud to greatly disturb business , hurt agriculture , or cause property damage .
" as long as the restriction to air travel remains temporary as is now expected , there should be no measureable impact for the broader economy , " said reinsurer munich re in a statement .
" it 's just an issue for the airlines to handle . "
airlines are typically not insured against cancellations .
other industries affected deutsche post , europe 's largest mail and express delivery company , said the cloud has disrupted delivery by air and the company has switched to land transport where possible .
the cloud has even affected the hotel industry throughout asia , as dozens of cancelled european flights have left hotels struggling to accommodate thousands of passengers .
but according to energy company officials , oil , gas , and electricity production in europe is not likely to suffer .
the one direct effect from the ash cloud is that offshore workers in the north sea will have to wait longer for replacements , as helicopters were also grounded as part of the flight ban .
flight bans have been imposed by more than 15 european countries .
britain , germany , finland , slovakia , estonia and denmark have extended their bans until sunday. mk / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more than 20 countries have closed their airspace with some countries calling off all flights until monday morning . european flights remained grounded on saturday due to a vast cloud of volcanic ash from iceland that has covered much of europe and has spread as far east as russia .
britain , ireland , switzerland , and belgium all extended their flight bans on saturday .
more than 20 european countries grounded flights because of the ash cloud .
the disruption hit german chancellor angela merkel who was trying to return to berlin from the united states on friday when her plane was diverted to lisbon .
she flew to rome on saturday , having to spend the night in italy . the chancellor will therefore be unable to attend the funeral of polish president lech kaczynski on sunday .
in addition , flights bringing home the bodies of german soldiers killed in afghanistan along with soldiers wounded in the country were redirected to turkey .
bildunterschrift : the last time the volcano erupted , in the 19th century , it continued sporadically for over a year things could get worse volcanic ash can terminally damage the engines and windows of jetliners .
the national air traffic services , which oversees british airspace , said the situation from the cloud is getting worse . experts tracking the volcano beneath the eyjafjallajokull glacier said there were no signs of reduced activity on friday .
after a relatively minor eruption one month ago , the volcano erupted again on wednesday , with these two incidents breaking almost 200 years of dormancy .
that last recorded eruption continued - with varying levels of severity and intermittent periods of inactivity - for almost 18 months between 1821 and 1823 .
" we have no prediction on how long -lsb- the eruption -rsb- will last , " said geophysicist bergthora thorbjnardottir at the iceland meteorological office .
hundreds of thousands stranded westerly and north-westerly winds have blown the ash across swathes of northern and central europe , grounding some 17,000 flights on friday , after around 6,000 were cancelled on thursday .
the disruption is costing airlines over 148 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- per day .
currently , only emergency flights are permitted into and out of the affected regions in europe .
all 16 international airports in germany were closed on saturday with no flights set to take off until at least 2pm on sunday .

" we have a lot more people booking tickets , and are putting every train at our disposal into action , " a bahn spokesman told german public broadcaster ard .
" everything that can run is running . "
the eurostar train service linking britain and mainland europe via the channel tunnel is fully booked , with the company reporting 38,000 travelers on friday , 10,000 more than average .
international coach services also claimed to be running at five times their usual capacity due to a surge in demand .

they 've been in the country for decades , but the mainstream food industry is only just starting to cater to them . customers walking through the aisles of some paris area supermarkets are now likely to find halal meat and processed foods .
whether it 's spicy ready-to-eat chicken wings , halal pate , or mock ham made from turkey , halal products are increasingly making their way into mainstream shopping venues .
it may not seem like much , but for france this marks a striking change .
this was made evident last summer when the zakia food brand aired the first nationally broadcast television commercial for halal food .
it turned enough heads to make it into french newscasts .
halal means legal or lawful in arabic and refers to foods that are sanctioned by islamic authorities .
pork , blood and alcohol are not halal .
food industry observers say supermarkets and the rest of the food industry are just following the money trail .
" five and a half billion euros are going to be spent on these kinds of products this year in france , " said abbas bendali , the head of solis , a market research firm specialized in ethnic niches .
" there are five million potential customers .
so this is more than a niche , this is a real consumer segment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french food companies are shedding their misconceptions about halal meat new generation of customers a few years ago , halal foods could only be found in small shops in low-rent immigrant neighborhoods .
now france 's second largest supermarket chain , casino , has hired abderrahman bouzid to manage the halal and traditional muslim foods sold in its 10,000 stores .
he said the market is growing thanks to a new generation of french muslims .
" those under the age of 40 do n't have any hang-ups about affirming who they are ; they want to be taken into consideration , " bouzid said , explaining that muslim consumers are perfectly aware of their buying power and will prefer retailers that offer halal products .
" they 're saying ' if you are dismissive of my needs , by ignoring my customs and my preferences , i wo n't shop in your business ' , " he added .
casino has even created its own halal product line , which it markets under the name wassila .
others in the food industry are following suit .
international brands such as knorr , maggi , liebig and french firms like duc and fleury michon have all started selling halal options .
they now compete with established halal brands such as zakia , isla delice and medina .
attitudes shift some of these brands and others recently attended a halal trade show in paris , where visitors could find everything from halal foie gras and faux-bacon cheese burgers to microwaveable halal meals such as lasagna and chicken curry with rice .
antoine bonnel started the fair six years ago , when it attracted far fewer exhibitors .
this year , 100 companies participated .
bonnel said he has noticed an attitude shift in the food industry .
in the past , mainstream brands did n't want to be associates with halal because it was considered low-brow , he said , adding that french muslims had little money and unenviable social positions .
" these people came from a very poor immigrant background , " bonnel said .
" so the global image was a cheap image . "
there were also misconceptions about the ritual slaughter of animals required for meat to be considered halal .
and there were rumors that some of the taxes for this ritual could be funneled to questionable foreign causes .
bildunterschrift : young muslims represent a significant consumer segment some of this unease came to the surface earlier this year , when fast food chain quick revealed it had made eight of its 362 restaurants halal .
several french politicians criticized the move and the extreme-right national front highlighted the company in its anti-immigrant rhetoric .
but from a business perspective , the new buying power and improved social status of the young muslim generation are sweeping misgivings to the side .
sweeter than champagne the upcoming french launch of a non-alcoholic sparkling wine is just one example of that .
the drink , called " night orient , " is sold in what looks like a champagne bottle and provides people with the satisfying pop that comes with opening a bottle of real champagne .
" we decided to launch a festive drink for muslims , completely alcohol free , " said arnaud jacquemin , one of the drink 's creators .
" for weddings , for birthdays or the end of the year they have to drink orange juice , or soda , which is n't festive . "
jacquemin is n't himself muslim , but while working in the beverage industry , he saw sales of non-alcoholic drinks consistently rise and realized this market was largely untapped .
night orient tastes far sweeter than real champagne .
focus group testing showed the version initially developed was a little too dry for consumers unaccustomed to drinking wine .
so the formula was changed to better appeal to the muslim palate .
the beverage had a successful test run in some paris area supermarkets .
the small company has since signed deals with four national retail chains to officially launch the beverage in france during ramadan later this year .

they 've been in the country for decades , but the mainstream food industry is only just starting to cater to them . customers walking through the aisles of some paris area supermarkets are now likely to find halal meat and processed foods .
whether it 's spicy ready-to-eat chicken wings , halal pate , or mock ham made from turkey , halal products are increasingly making their way into mainstream shopping venues .
it may not seem like much , but for france this marks a striking change .
this was made evident last summer when the zakia food brand aired the first nationally broadcast television commercial for halal food .
it turned enough heads to make it into french newscasts .
halal means legal or lawful in arabic and refers to foods that are sanctioned by islamic authorities .
pork , blood and alcohol are not halal .
food industry observers say supermarkets and the rest of the food industry are just following the money trail .
" five and a half billion euros are going to be spent on these kinds of products this year in france , " said abbas bendali , the head of solis , a market research firm specialized in ethnic niches .
" there are five million potential customers .
so this is more than a niche , this is a real consumer segment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french food companies are shedding their misconceptions about halal meat new generation of customers a few years ago , halal foods could only be found in small shops in low-rent immigrant neighborhoods .
now france 's second largest supermarket chain , casino , has hired abderrahman bouzid to manage the halal and traditional muslim foods sold in its 10,000 stores .
he said the market is growing thanks to a new generation of french muslims .
" those under the age of 40 do n't have any hang-ups about affirming who they are ; they want to be taken into consideration , " bouzid said , explaining that muslim consumers are perfectly aware of their buying power and will prefer retailers that offer halal products .
" they 're saying ' if you are dismissive of my needs , by ignoring my customs and my preferences , i wo n't shop in your business ' , " he added .
casino has even created its own halal product line , which it markets under the name wassila .
others in the food industry are following suit .
international brands such as knorr , maggi , liebig and french firms like duc and fleury michon have all started selling halal options .
they now compete with established halal brands such as zakia , isla delice and medina .
attitudes shift some of these brands and others recently attended a halal trade show in paris , where visitors could find everything from halal foie gras and faux-bacon cheese burgers to microwaveable halal meals such as lasagna and chicken curry with rice .
antoine bonnel started the fair six years ago , when it attracted far fewer exhibitors .
this year , 100 companies participated .
bonnel said he has noticed an attitude shift in the food industry .
in the past , mainstream brands did n't want to be associates with halal because it was considered low-brow , he said , adding that french muslims had little money and unenviable social positions .
" these people came from a very poor immigrant background , " bonnel said .
" so the global image was a cheap image . "
there were also misconceptions about the ritual slaughter of animals required for meat to be considered halal .
and there were rumors that some of the taxes for this ritual could be funneled to questionable foreign causes .
bildunterschrift : young muslims represent a significant consumer segment some of this unease came to the surface earlier this year , when fast food chain quick revealed it had made eight of its 362 restaurants halal .
several french politicians criticized the move and the extreme-right national front highlighted the company in its anti-immigrant rhetoric .
but from a business perspective , the new buying power and improved social status of the young muslim generation are sweeping misgivings to the side .
sweeter than champagne the upcoming french launch of a non-alcoholic sparkling wine is just one example of that .
the drink , called " night orient , " is sold in what looks like a champagne bottle and provides people with the satisfying pop that comes with opening a bottle of real champagne .
" we decided to launch a festive drink for muslims , completely alcohol free , " said arnaud jacquemin , one of the drink 's creators .
" for weddings , for birthdays or the end of the year they have to drink orange juice , or soda , which is n't festive . "
jacquemin is n't himself muslim , but while working in the beverage industry , he saw sales of non-alcoholic drinks consistently rise and realized this market was largely untapped .
night orient tastes far sweeter than real champagne .
focus group testing showed the version initially developed was a little too dry for consumers unaccustomed to drinking wine .
so the formula was changed to better appeal to the muslim palate .
the beverage had a successful test run in some paris area supermarkets .
the small company has since signed deals with four national retail chains to officially launch the beverage in france during ramadan later this year .

they 've been in the country for decades , but the mainstream food industry is only just starting to cater to them . customers walking through the aisles of some paris area supermarkets are now likely to find halal meat and processed foods .
whether it 's spicy ready-to-eat chicken wings , halal pate , or mock ham made from turkey , halal products are increasingly making their way into mainstream shopping venues .
it may not seem like much , but for france this marks a striking change .
this was made evident last summer when the zakia food brand aired the first nationally broadcast television commercial for halal food .
it turned enough heads to make it into french newscasts .
halal means legal or lawful in arabic and refers to foods that are sanctioned by islamic authorities .
pork , blood and alcohol are not halal .
food industry observers say supermarkets and the rest of the food industry are just following the money trail .
" five and a half billion euros are going to be spent on these kinds of products this year in france , " said abbas bendali , the head of solis , a market research firm specialized in ethnic niches .
" there are five million potential customers .
so this is more than a niche , this is a real consumer segment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french food companies are shedding their misconceptions about halal meat new generation of customers a few years ago , halal foods could only be found in small shops in low-rent immigrant neighborhoods .
now france 's second largest supermarket chain , casino , has hired abderrahman bouzid to manage the halal and traditional muslim foods sold in its 10,000 stores .
he said the market is growing thanks to a new generation of french muslims .
" those under the age of 40 do n't have any hang-ups about affirming who they are ; they want to be taken into consideration , " bouzid said , explaining that muslim consumers are perfectly aware of their buying power and will prefer retailers that offer halal products .
" they 're saying ' if you are dismissive of my needs , by ignoring my customs and my preferences , i wo n't shop in your business ' , " he added .
casino has even created its own halal product line , which it markets under the name wassila .
others in the food industry are following suit .
international brands such as knorr , maggi , liebig and french firms like duc and fleury michon have all started selling halal options .
they now compete with established halal brands such as zakia , isla delice and medina .
attitudes shift some of these brands and others recently attended a halal trade show in paris , where visitors could find everything from halal foie gras and faux-bacon cheese burgers to microwaveable halal meals such as lasagna and chicken curry with rice .
antoine bonnel started the fair six years ago , when it attracted far fewer exhibitors .
this year , 100 companies participated .
bonnel said he has noticed an attitude shift in the food industry .
in the past , mainstream brands did n't want to be associates with halal because it was considered low-brow , he said , adding that french muslims had little money and unenviable social positions .
" these people came from a very poor immigrant background , " bonnel said .
" so the global image was a cheap image . "
there were also misconceptions about the ritual slaughter of animals required for meat to be considered halal .
and there were rumors that some of the taxes for this ritual could be funneled to questionable foreign causes .
bildunterschrift : young muslims represent a significant consumer segment some of this unease came to the surface earlier this year , when fast food chain quick revealed it had made eight of its 362 restaurants halal .
several french politicians criticized the move and the extreme-right national front highlighted the company in its anti-immigrant rhetoric .
but from a business perspective , the new buying power and improved social status of the young muslim generation are sweeping misgivings to the side .
sweeter than champagne the upcoming french launch of a non-alcoholic sparkling wine is just one example of that .
the drink , called " night orient , " is sold in what looks like a champagne bottle and provides people with the satisfying pop that comes with opening a bottle of real champagne .
" we decided to launch a festive drink for muslims , completely alcohol free , " said arnaud jacquemin , one of the drink 's creators .
" for weddings , for birthdays or the end of the year they have to drink orange juice , or soda , which is n't festive . "
jacquemin is n't himself muslim , but while working in the beverage industry , he saw sales of non-alcoholic drinks consistently rise and realized this market was largely untapped .
night orient tastes far sweeter than real champagne .
focus group testing showed the version initially developed was a little too dry for consumers unaccustomed to drinking wine .
so the formula was changed to better appeal to the muslim palate .
the beverage had a successful test run in some paris area supermarkets .
the small company has since signed deals with four national retail chains to officially launch the beverage in france during ramadan later this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de tourism -pipe- 17.04.2010 germany 's riesling vineyards threatened by controversial bridge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the world 's best riesling comes from the moselle valley vineyards germany 's moselle valley produces some of the world 's best rieslings .
but now this pristine winemaking region is threatened by a bridge that is to span the valley , against the wishes of many locals and winemakers . the moselle valley in western germany is known for its picturesque views and world-famous moselle riesling wine .
the region thrives on the wine industry and the tourism that it brings .
in an effort to boost access to the valley , the national and state government have launched a project to build a bridge across the moselle valley .
supporters of the project say it will boost tourism in the region by shortening the travel time between neighboring belgium and luxembourg .
they say traffic congestion will be relieved for locals , and commercial connections to nearby airports will be improved .
but not everyone in the valley is convinced that building the bridge is worth it .
they 're afraid the damage to the landscape and the environment will outweigh the benefits .
pro-moselle bildunterschrift : pictures from pro-moselle showing the valley as it is and what will change with the bridge a group of citizens in the valley have formed a group called pro-moselle .
they are against the construction of the bridge , and have started a number of initiatives to try to stop construction .
last spring the group stopped tractors from digging at the official groundbreaking ceremony of the bridge , and a petition against the bridge can be signed on the group 's web site or at one of their regularly scheduled sunday demonstrations .
on sundays , members of the group meet in the town of bernkastel to gather signatures .
they hold two panoramic photographs : one shows how the valley looks now , while the other shows the same image but with the proposed bridge added in .
" these pictures alone say it all , " a woman visiting from moenchengladbach who signed the petition told deutsche welle .
" we 're enjoying the landscape here as tourists , without a bridge .
with a bridge , it is unthinkable . "
wine allies plans for the bridge have been on the books since the late 1960s , but it was n't until late 2008 that the project was given the green light .
most of the 270 million euros -lrb- $ 366 million -rrb- budgeted for the project is coming from the federal government , with the government of the state of rhineland-palatinate chipping in 20 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wine expert hugh johnson says moselle riesling is one of a kind the pro-moselle group has gained support from german politicians and leaders in the wine world .
former foreign minister joschka fisher and the co-leader of the greens ' parliamentary party , renate kuenast , are on board , as is hugh johnson , a world-renowned wine writer from britain .
johnson calls the planned bridge a ' road on stilts . '
in a video posted on the pro-moselle website , he calls on the citizens of the area to stand up and fight for the moselle valley and its one-of-a-kind wine .
" i can tell you that the whole world has nothing comparable to a moselle riesling .
you can imitate the wine of bordeaux in the napa valley , " johnson said .
" you can even imitate the wine of burgundy in certain places .
but there is nothing that even starts to imitate great moselle riesling . "
a long tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus berres markus berres runs the c.h. berres winery in uerzig , a town that will basically fall under the shadow of the bridge once it is completed .
his family has been in the business for 500 years , and the 31-year-old winemaker is part of the 21st generation to run the family business in the moselle valley .
he fears that tourists will be driven away once the bridge is built .
" this region lives from tourism and winemaking , " berres said in an interview with deutsche welle , " but who wants to take their holiday under a bridge ?
nobody .
so i do n't see any advantage to building the bridge . "
the state 's transportation minister , hendrik hering , announced that 35 million euros would be reinvested in the environment as a measure of compensation .
however , winemakers are still worried about the bridge 's effect on the water supply for the grapes growing on the slopes of the valley , or how the grapes will react to the additional car exhaust .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although it is years from completion , signs of the bridge are apparent " the vines will be growing with the bridge or without the bridge , " said markus berres .
" the question is , how high will the quality be ? "
too late to be stopped ?
preparation work is already underway on the bridge .
a receding tree line and dirt access roads are starting to give an indication of what the area will look like once the bridge is complete .
pro-moselle insists that as long as construction has not started , the bridge can still be stopped .
markus berres predicts that many people will move away from the valley if the bridge is completed .
in either case , berres says he 'll stay .
his family has made its living in the moselle valley for centuries , and berres plans to keep the tradition alive .
but for him , making germany 's famous moselle riesling wine just wo n't be the same in the shadow of a bridge .

but now this pristine winemaking region is threatened by a bridge that is to span the valley , against the wishes of many locals and winemakers . the moselle valley in western germany is known for its picturesque views and world-famous moselle riesling wine .
the region thrives on the wine industry and the tourism that it brings .
in an effort to boost access to the valley , the national and state government have launched a project to build a bridge across the moselle valley .
supporters of the project say it will boost tourism in the region by shortening the travel time between neighboring belgium and luxembourg .
they say traffic congestion will be relieved for locals , and commercial connections to nearby airports will be improved .
but not everyone in the valley is convinced that building the bridge is worth it .
they 're afraid the damage to the landscape and the environment will outweigh the benefits .
pro-moselle bildunterschrift : pictures from pro-moselle showing the valley as it is and what will change with the bridge a group of citizens in the valley have formed a group called pro-moselle .
they are against the construction of the bridge , and have started a number of initiatives to try to stop construction .
last spring the group stopped tractors from digging at the official groundbreaking ceremony of the bridge , and a petition against the bridge can be signed on the group 's web site or at one of their regularly scheduled sunday demonstrations .
on sundays , members of the group meet in the town of bernkastel to gather signatures .
they hold two panoramic photographs : one shows how the valley looks now , while the other shows the same image but with the proposed bridge added in .
" these pictures alone say it all , " a woman visiting from moenchengladbach who signed the petition told deutsche welle .
" we 're enjoying the landscape here as tourists , without a bridge .
with a bridge , it is unthinkable . "
wine allies plans for the bridge have been on the books since the late 1960s , but it was n't until late 2008 that the project was given the green light .
most of the 270 million euros -lrb- $ 366 million -rrb- budgeted for the project is coming from the federal government , with the government of the state of rhineland-palatinate chipping in 20 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wine expert hugh johnson says moselle riesling is one of a kind the pro-moselle group has gained support from german politicians and leaders in the wine world .
former foreign minister joschka fisher and the co-leader of the greens ' parliamentary party , renate kuenast , are on board , as is hugh johnson , a world-renowned wine writer from britain .
johnson calls the planned bridge a ' road on stilts . '
in a video posted on the pro-moselle website , he calls on the citizens of the area to stand up and fight for the moselle valley and its one-of-a-kind wine .
" i can tell you that the whole world has nothing comparable to a moselle riesling .
you can imitate the wine of bordeaux in the napa valley , " johnson said .
" you can even imitate the wine of burgundy in certain places .
but there is nothing that even starts to imitate great moselle riesling . "
a long tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus berres markus berres runs the c.h. berres winery in uerzig , a town that will basically fall under the shadow of the bridge once it is completed .
his family has been in the business for 500 years , and the 31-year-old winemaker is part of the 21st generation to run the family business in the moselle valley .
he fears that tourists will be driven away once the bridge is built .
" this region lives from tourism and winemaking , " berres said in an interview with deutsche welle , " but who wants to take their holiday under a bridge ?
nobody .
so i do n't see any advantage to building the bridge . "
the state 's transportation minister , hendrik hering , announced that 35 million euros would be reinvested in the environment as a measure of compensation .
however , winemakers are still worried about the bridge 's effect on the water supply for the grapes growing on the slopes of the valley , or how the grapes will react to the additional car exhaust .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although it is years from completion , signs of the bridge are apparent " the vines will be growing with the bridge or without the bridge , " said markus berres .
" the question is , how high will the quality be ? "
too late to be stopped ?
preparation work is already underway on the bridge .
a receding tree line and dirt access roads are starting to give an indication of what the area will look like once the bridge is complete .
pro-moselle insists that as long as construction has not started , the bridge can still be stopped .
markus berres predicts that many people will move away from the valley if the bridge is completed .
in either case , berres says he 'll stay .
his family has made its living in the moselle valley for centuries , and berres plans to keep the tradition alive .
but for him , making germany 's famous moselle riesling wine just wo n't be the same in the shadow of a bridge .

but the recent violence raises questions as to whether the government can actually secure the country without international help . next month , france is due to present a draft of a new resolution on the un mandate for the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- to the un security council . many observers are already asking how the recent violence in mbandaka in the northwestern province of equateur , where rebels seized an airport and killed 13 people , will affect the future of the un 's involvement .
with more than 20,000 troops , the un mission -lrb- monuc -rrb- is the largest and most expensive on the planet .
monuc arrived in drc in 1999 when what is now known as the second congo war involved seven other african countries : zimbabwe , angola , chad , namibia , burundi , rwanda , and uganda .
the countries supported opposing sides - laurent kabila 's government or rebel groups in eastern congo - for different reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobutu was toppled by laurent kabila in the first congo war -lrb- 1996 - 97 -rrb- angola supported kabila because he defeated mobutu sese seko , who had helped jonas savimbi 's unita in angola 's civil war which spanned over two decades .
on the other hand , rwanda helped the rally for congolese democracy -lrb- rcd -rrb- to support tutsis in drc against hutu militias .
but rwanda , much like uganda , has been part of the war also to exploit natural resources - especially diamonds - in eastern congo .
more than 5 million people have died since 1998 as a result of the conflict .
and those who have not died directly continue to die from malnutrition or preventable diseases like cholera while thousands of women , especially in the kivu region , have been raped and many infected with hiv .
monuc and congolese army not on the same page monuc was sent to strengthen the congolese national forces and protect the population .
but many feel that it has not helped .
in fact , in " killings in kiwanja : the un 's inability to protect civilians , " human rights watch reports that monuc has failed to protect the population .
it says that monuc 's failure led to the massacre of 150 people in kiwanja in december 2008 , and that un troops have raped girls and women in eastern congo .
james paul , executive director of the global policy forum , agrees that un forces have failed to protect the population .
in part , because they were expected to work with the congolese forces which have also been accused of human rights violations , including the rape of thousands of women .
" there have been problems in the relationship between the peacekeepers and the congolese army because of concern that the un has been identified with the violations , " paul said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of women and girls have been raped by rebels as a result , instead of working with the congolese army as it should have , monuc has distanced itself from the congolese army so as not to be complicit in the latter 's actions .
" the relations between monuc and the congolese government have deteriorated extremely over the last couple of years because they do n't see eye to eye on many issues , " denis tull , a research fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
next year 's election ups the stakes last month 's announcement by the congolese government that it wanted all un troops to leave the country by august 2011 should have come as no surprise .
but its timing was strategic .
" with the upcoming 50th anniversary of congo 's independence in june , the government does not want to see a permanent presence of the un , " tull said .
observers say the government wants to take credit for the achievements that have taken place since monuc arrived in 1999 . this would put it in good light for the presidential elections in 2011 .
in spite of the criticism against monuc , it has helped to reduce the extent of the conflict and helped congo hold its first democratic elections in over four decades in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president joseph kabila won the elections in 2006 " president kabila wants to be able to say to the congolese people that he made the un mission leave because there is peace in the country , " tull said .
fabienne hara , the vice-president of multilateral relations at the international crisis group , agrees .
she told deutsche welle that " one of the reasons why the congolese government wants to see monuc withdraw is that they also want to be in charge of their own elections . "
un troops withdrawal unlikely however , it is unlikely that the congolese government will get exactly what it wants .
even though 2,000 un troops are to leave congo by june 30th , a report in march by un secretary general ban ki-moon , recommends that troops remain in the more unstable eastern congo .
also , the recent violence in equateur will very likely affect the future of the un mission .
" this new episode in equateur shows that even western congo is not completely stable despite what the government is saying .
there 's still some serious sources of tensions elsewhere in the congo , " hara said .
the un security council delegation visiting the democratic republic of congo over the next few days will most certainly take the recent violence in equateur into consideration , and un troops are expected to remain in the eastern part of the country because " any withdrawal from eastern congo would be a major catastrophe for the civilian population , " tull said .

she told deutsche welle that " one of the reasons why the congolese government wants to see monuc withdraw is that they also want to be in charge of their own elections . "
un troops withdrawal unlikely however , it is unlikely that the congolese government will get exactly what it wants .
even though 2,000 un troops are to leave congo by june 30th , a report in march by un secretary general ban ki-moon , recommends that troops remain in the more unstable eastern congo .
also , the recent violence in equateur will very likely affect the future of the un mission .
" this new episode in equateur shows that even western congo is not completely stable despite what the government is saying .
there 's still some serious sources of tensions elsewhere in the congo , " hara said .
the un security council delegation visiting the democratic republic of congo over the next few days will most certainly take the recent violence in equateur into consideration , and un troops are expected to remain in the eastern part of the country because " any withdrawal from eastern congo would be a major catastrophe for the civilian population , " tull said .

but the recent violence raises questions as to whether the government can actually secure the country without international help . next month , france is due to present a draft of a new resolution on the un mandate for the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- to the un security council . many observers are already asking how the recent violence in mbandaka in the northwestern province of equateur , where rebels seized an airport and killed 13 people , will affect the future of the un 's involvement .
with more than 20,000 troops , the un mission -lrb- monuc -rrb- is the largest and most expensive on the planet .
monuc arrived in drc in 1999 when what is now known as the second congo war involved seven other african countries : zimbabwe , angola , chad , namibia , burundi , rwanda , and uganda .
the countries supported opposing sides - laurent kabila 's government or rebel groups in eastern congo - for different reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobutu was toppled by laurent kabila in the first congo war -lrb- 1996 - 97 -rrb- angola supported kabila because he defeated mobutu sese seko , who had helped jonas savimbi 's unita in angola 's civil war which spanned over two decades .
on the other hand , rwanda helped the rally for congolese democracy -lrb- rcd -rrb- to support tutsis in drc against hutu militias .
but rwanda , much like uganda , has been part of the war also to exploit natural resources - especially diamonds - in eastern congo .
more than 5 million people have died since 1998 as a result of the conflict .
and those who have not died directly continue to die from malnutrition or preventable diseases like cholera while thousands of women , especially in the kivu region , have been raped and many infected with hiv .
monuc and congolese army not on the same page monuc was sent to strengthen the congolese national forces and protect the population .
but many feel that it has not helped .
in fact , in " killings in kiwanja : the un 's inability to protect civilians , " human rights watch reports that monuc has failed to protect the population .
it says that monuc 's failure led to the massacre of 150 people in kiwanja in december 2008 , and that un troops have raped girls and women in eastern congo .
james paul , executive director of the global policy forum , agrees that un forces have failed to protect the population .
in part , because they were expected to work with the congolese forces which have also been accused of human rights violations , including the rape of thousands of women .
" there have been problems in the relationship between the peacekeepers and the congolese army because of concern that the un has been identified with the violations , " paul said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of women and girls have been raped by rebels as a result , instead of working with the congolese army as it should have , monuc has distanced itself from the congolese army so as not to be complicit in the latter 's actions .
" the relations between monuc and the congolese government have deteriorated extremely over the last couple of years because they do n't see eye to eye on many issues , " denis tull , a research fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
next year 's election ups the stakes last month 's announcement by the congolese government that it wanted all un troops to leave the country by august 2011 should have come as no surprise .
but its timing was strategic .
" with the upcoming 50th anniversary of congo 's independence in june , the government does not want to see a permanent presence of the un , " tull said .
observers say the government wants to take credit for the achievements that have taken place since monuc arrived in 1999 . this would put it in good light for the presidential elections in 2011 .
in spite of the criticism against monuc , it has helped to reduce the extent of the conflict and helped congo hold its first democratic elections in over four decades in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president joseph kabila won the elections in 2006 " president kabila wants to be able to say to the congolese people that he made the un mission leave because there is peace in the country , " tull said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobutu was toppled by laurent kabila in the first congo war -lrb- 1996 - 97 -rrb- angola supported kabila because he defeated mobutu sese seko , who had helped jonas savimbi 's unita in angola 's civil war which spanned over two decades .
on the other hand , rwanda helped the rally for congolese democracy -lrb- rcd -rrb- to support tutsis in drc against hutu militias .
but rwanda , much like uganda , has been part of the war also to exploit natural resources - especially diamonds - in eastern congo .
more than 5 million people have died since 1998 as a result of the conflict .
and those who have not died directly continue to die from malnutrition or preventable diseases like cholera while thousands of women , especially in the kivu region , have been raped and many infected with hiv .
monuc and congolese army not on the same page monuc was sent to strengthen the congolese national forces and protect the population .
but many feel that it has not helped .
in fact , in " killings in kiwanja : the un 's inability to protect civilians , " human rights watch reports that monuc has failed to protect the population .
it says that monuc 's failure led to the massacre of 150 people in kiwanja in december 2008 , and that un troops have raped girls and women in eastern congo .
james paul , executive director of the global policy forum , agrees that un forces have failed to protect the population .
in part , because they were expected to work with the congolese forces which have also been accused of human rights violations , including the rape of thousands of women .
" there have been problems in the relationship between the peacekeepers and the congolese army because of concern that the un has been identified with the violations , " paul said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of women and girls have been raped by rebels as a result , instead of working with the congolese army as it should have , monuc has distanced itself from the congolese army so as not to be complicit in the latter 's actions .
" the relations between monuc and the congolese government have deteriorated extremely over the last couple of years because they do n't see eye to eye on many issues , " denis tull , a research fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
next year 's election ups the stakes last month 's announcement by the congolese government that it wanted all un troops to leave the country by august 2011 should have come as no surprise .
but its timing was strategic .
" with the upcoming 50th anniversary of congo 's independence in june , the government does not want to see a permanent presence of the un , " tull said .
observers say the government wants to take credit for the achievements that have taken place since monuc arrived in 1999 . this would put it in good light for the presidential elections in 2011 .
in spite of the criticism against monuc , it has helped to reduce the extent of the conflict and helped congo hold its first democratic elections in over four decades in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president joseph kabila won the elections in 2006 " president kabila wants to be able to say to the congolese people that he made the un mission leave because there is peace in the country , " tull said .
fabienne hara , the vice-president of multilateral relations at the international crisis group , agrees .
she told deutsche welle that " one of the reasons why the congolese government wants to see monuc withdraw is that they also want to be in charge of their own elections . "
un troops withdrawal unlikely however , it is unlikely that the congolese government will get exactly what it wants .
even though 2,000 un troops are to leave congo by june 30th , a report in march by un secretary general ban ki-moon , recommends that troops remain in the more unstable eastern congo .
also , the recent violence in equateur will very likely affect the future of the un mission .
" this new episode in equateur shows that even western congo is not completely stable despite what the government is saying .
there 's still some serious sources of tensions elsewhere in the congo , " hara said .
the un security council delegation visiting the democratic republic of congo over the next few days will most certainly take the recent violence in equateur into consideration , and un troops are expected to remain in the eastern part of the country because " any withdrawal from eastern congo would be a major catastrophe for the civilian population , " tull said .

but the recent violence raises questions as to whether the government can actually secure the country without international help . next month , france is due to present a draft of a new resolution on the un mandate for the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- to the un security council . many observers are already asking how the recent violence in mbandaka in the northwestern province of equateur , where rebels seized an airport and killed 13 people , will affect the future of the un 's involvement .
with more than 20,000 troops , the un mission -lrb- monuc -rrb- is the largest and most expensive on the planet .

more than 20 countries have closed their airspace with some countries calling off all flights until monday morning . european flights remained grounded on saturday due to a vast cloud of volcanic ash from iceland that has covered much of europe and has spread as far east as russia .
britain , ireland , switzerland , and belgium all extended their flight bans on saturday .
more than 20 european countries grounded flights because of the ash cloud .
the disruption hit german chancellor angela merkel who was trying to return to berlin from the united states on friday when her plane was diverted to lisbon .
she flew to rome on saturday , having to spend the night in italy . the chancellor will therefore be unable to attend the funeral of polish president lech kaczynski on sunday .
in addition , flights bringing home the bodies of german soldiers killed in afghanistan along with soldiers wounded in the country were redirected to turkey .
bildunterschrift : the last time the volcano erupted , in the 19th century , it continued sporadically for over a year things could get worse volcanic ash can terminally damage the engines and windows of jetliners .
the national air traffic services , which oversees british airspace , said the situation from the cloud is getting worse . experts tracking the volcano beneath the eyjafjallajokull glacier said there were no signs of reduced activity on friday .
after a relatively minor eruption one month ago , the volcano erupted again on wednesday , with these two incidents breaking almost 200 years of dormancy .
that last recorded eruption continued - with varying levels of severity and intermittent periods of inactivity - for almost 18 months between 1821 and 1823 .
" we have no prediction on how long -lsb- the eruption -rsb- will last , " said geophysicist bergthora thorbjnardottir at the iceland meteorological office .
hundreds of thousands stranded westerly and north-westerly winds have blown the ash across swathes of northern and central europe , grounding some 17,000 flights on friday , after around 6,000 were cancelled on thursday .
the disruption is costing airlines over 148 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- per day .
currently , only emergency flights are permitted into and out of the affected regions in europe .
all 16 international airports in germany were closed on saturday with no flights set to take off until at least 2pm on sunday .

" everything that can run is running . "
the eurostar train service linking britain and mainland europe via the channel tunnel is fully booked , with the company reporting 38,000 travelers on friday , 10,000 more than average .
international coach services also claimed to be running at five times their usual capacity due to a surge in demand .
rental car companies reported a similar phenomenon , with some passengers even electing to drive long journeys to foreign destinations .

after initially reporting that the deadly ambush began when a german armored vehicle was struck by a rocket close to pol-i-khomri camp , germany 's defense ministry on friday corrected this , saying the attackers used a remotely detonated explosive device .
three bundeswehr soldiers died in the initial explosion , with the fourth killed in an ensuing battle , in which the isaf troops are believed to have come under mortar and gunfire .
a total of 43 german soldiers have now been killed in afghanistan since the bundeswehr mission began in 2002 .

the minister left the isaf camp in masar-i-sharif after the disruption to european airspace had already begun , but guttenberg hoped he would nonetheless make it back to germany . the defense minister was travelling with five bundeswehr soldiers wounded in a taliban attack in northern afghanistan on thursday . the group was first taken to a german military base in uzbekistan to board a medical transport carrier heading towards europe .
the soldiers were meant to be brought to military hospitals in germany to ensure that they would receive optimal care . with the plane redirected to turkey , the soldiers have spent the night at a us hospital in istanbul and are to continue to germany only at a later stage .
guttenberg on saturday continued his way back to germany albeit it remained unclear by which means of transportation . an ash cloud from a volcanic eruption in iceland on friday spread over most of europe , leading to more than half of all flights being cancelled .
germany 's entire airspace is affected by the problem , which has caused all major airports to be shut down . funeral for fallen soldiers set for sunday guttenberg had been scheduled to return to germany on thursday after a two-day visit to afghanistan . while in transit in uzbekistan , however , he was notified of the bloody attack - which killed four bundeswehr soldiers .
the minister subsequently returned to afghanistan with the bundeswehr 's chief of staff , volker wieker .
guttenberg visited the wounded soldiers at the german military base in masar-i-sharif on friday as they waited for a military aircraft equipped with proper medical equipment to bring them back to germany .
bundeswehr officials report that the wounded troops are all in stable condition .
while four of the five soldiers have sustained serious injuries , these are not believed to be life-threatening .
wieker is scheduled to stay on in afghanistan to attend the funeral service for the four soldiers , which is planned for sunday in the masar-i-sharif camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's funeral would follow a service held just last week explosive , not rocket , triggered thursday 's ambush the latest german casualties came after a bundeswehr patrol came under attack travelling between kunduz and baghlan on thursday .
after initially reporting that the deadly ambush began when a german armored vehicle was struck by a rocket close to pol-i-khomri camp , germany 's defense ministry on friday corrected this , saying the attackers used a remotely detonated explosive device .
three bundeswehr soldiers died in the initial explosion , with the fourth killed in an ensuing battle , in which the isaf troops are believed to have come under mortar and gunfire .
a total of 43 german soldiers have now been killed in afghanistan since the bundeswehr mission began in 2002 .
of those , 26 have been killed in firefights or insurgent attacks .
in recent weeks , taliban insurgents have stepped up pressure on the german troops based in the northern province of kunduz .

but now this pristine winemaking region is threatened by a bridge that is to span the valley , against the wishes of many locals and winemakers . the moselle valley in western germany is known for its picturesque views and world-famous moselle riesling wine .
the region thrives on the wine industry and the tourism that it brings .
in an effort to boost access to the valley , the national and state government have launched a project to build a bridge across the moselle valley .
supporters of the project say it will boost tourism in the region by shortening the travel time between neighboring belgium and luxembourg .
they say traffic congestion will be relieved for locals , and commercial connections to nearby airports will be improved .
but not everyone in the valley is convinced that building the bridge is worth it .
they 're afraid the damage to the landscape and the environment will outweigh the benefits .
pro-moselle bildunterschrift : pictures from pro-moselle showing the valley as it is and what will change with the bridge a group of citizens in the valley have formed a group called pro-moselle .
they are against the construction of the bridge , and have started a number of initiatives to try to stop construction .
last spring the group stopped tractors from digging at the official groundbreaking ceremony of the bridge , and a petition against the bridge can be signed on the group 's web site or at one of their regularly scheduled sunday demonstrations .
on sundays , members of the group meet in the town of bernkastel to gather signatures .
they hold two panoramic photographs : one shows how the valley looks now , while the other shows the same image but with the proposed bridge added in .
" these pictures alone say it all , " a woman visiting from moenchengladbach who signed the petition told deutsche welle .
" we 're enjoying the landscape here as tourists , without a bridge .
with a bridge , it is unthinkable . "
wine allies plans for the bridge have been on the books since the late 1960s , but it was n't until late 2008 that the project was given the green light .
most of the 270 million euros -lrb- $ 366 million -rrb- budgeted for the project is coming from the federal government , with the government of the state of rhineland-palatinate chipping in 20 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wine expert hugh johnson says moselle riesling is one of a kind the pro-moselle group has gained support from german politicians and leaders in the wine world .
former foreign minister joschka fisher and the co-leader of the greens ' parliamentary party , renate kuenast , are on board , as is hugh johnson , a world-renowned wine writer from britain .
johnson calls the planned bridge a ' road on stilts . '
in a video posted on the pro-moselle website , he calls on the citizens of the area to stand up and fight for the moselle valley and its one-of-a-kind wine .
" i can tell you that the whole world has nothing comparable to a moselle riesling .
you can imitate the wine of bordeaux in the napa valley , " johnson said .
" you can even imitate the wine of burgundy in certain places .
but there is nothing that even starts to imitate great moselle riesling . "
a long tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus berres markus berres runs the c.h. berres winery in uerzig , a town that will basically fall under the shadow of the bridge once it is completed .
his family has been in the business for 500 years , and the 31-year-old winemaker is part of the 21st generation to run the family business in the moselle valley .
he fears that tourists will be driven away once the bridge is built .
" this region lives from tourism and winemaking , " berres said in an interview with deutsche welle , " but who wants to take their holiday under a bridge ?
nobody .
so i do n't see any advantage to building the bridge . "
the state 's transportation minister , hendrik hering , announced that 35 million euros would be reinvested in the environment as a measure of compensation .
however , winemakers are still worried about the bridge 's effect on the water supply for the grapes growing on the slopes of the valley , or how the grapes will react to the additional car exhaust .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although it is years from completion , signs of the bridge are apparent " the vines will be growing with the bridge or without the bridge , " said markus berres .
" the question is , how high will the quality be ? "
too late to be stopped ?
preparation work is already underway on the bridge .
a receding tree line and dirt access roads are starting to give an indication of what the area will look like once the bridge is complete .
pro-moselle insists that as long as construction has not started , the bridge can still be stopped .
markus berres predicts that many people will move away from the valley if the bridge is completed .
in either case , berres says he 'll stay .
his family has made its living in the moselle valley for centuries , and berres plans to keep the tradition alive .
but for him , making germany 's famous moselle riesling wine just wo n't be the same in the shadow of a bridge .

it 's also caused major financial losses for airlines and sent their stocks tumbling . airlines were reeling saturday as flights and passengers remained grounded for a third straight day due to the icelandic volcanic ash cloud hovering over much of europe .
large flag carriers and no-frills airlines alike saw their shares dip on friday . the eurocontrol air traffic agency in brussels estimates that nearly 60 per cent of the region 's 28,000 daily flights , have been affected by the volcanic ash . british airways shares closed down more than 3 per cent on friday , while in ireland budget airline ryanair was down 2.3 per cent .
europe 's largest airline by revenue , lufthansa , ended the day down 4 per cent , while air france-klm slid by 3.4 per cent .
the disruption in travel is costing airliners roughly 148 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- in lost revenues per day .
after friday , about 16,000 flights were cancelled , making it the largest airspace shutdown since the second world war .
" in addition to lost revenues , airlines will incur added costs for re-routing of aircraft , care for stranded passengers and stranded aircraft at various ports , " the aviation industry body iata said in a statement on friday .
the association of european airlines estimated that the european economy had lost about one billion euros so far from flight bans across the continent .
however , airline reinsurers played down the potential of the ash cloud to greatly disturb business , hurt agriculture , or cause property damage .
" as long as the restriction to air travel remains temporary as is now expected , there should be no measureable impact for the broader economy , " said reinsurer munich re in a statement .
" it 's just an issue for the airlines to handle . "
airlines are typically not insured against cancellations .
other industries affected deutsche post , europe 's largest mail and express delivery company , said the cloud has disrupted delivery by air and the company has switched to land transport where possible .
the cloud has even affected the hotel industry throughout asia , as dozens of cancelled european flights have left hotels struggling to accommodate thousands of passengers .
but according to energy company officials , oil , gas , and electricity production in europe is not likely to suffer .
the one direct effect from the ash cloud is that offshore workers in the north sea will have to wait longer for replacements , as helicopters were also grounded as part of the flight ban .
flight bans have been imposed by more than 15 european countries .
britain , germany , finland , slovakia , estonia and denmark have extended their bans until sunday. mk / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's just an issue for the airlines to handle . "
airlines are typically not insured against cancellations .
other industries affected deutsche post , europe 's largest mail and express delivery company , said the cloud has disrupted delivery by air and the company has switched to land transport where possible .
the cloud has even affected the hotel industry throughout asia , as dozens of cancelled european flights have left hotels struggling to accommodate thousands of passengers .
but according to energy company officials , oil , gas , and electricity production in europe is not likely to suffer .
the one direct effect from the ash cloud is that offshore workers in the north sea will have to wait longer for replacements , as helicopters were also grounded as part of the flight ban .
flight bans have been imposed by more than 15 european countries .
britain , germany , finland , slovakia , estonia and denmark have extended their bans until sunday. mk / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's vettel 's third pole in four races this season . sebastian vettel claimed a last-gasp pole position in shanghai on saturday , and will line up at the head of the field for formula one 's chinese grand prix .
it 's vettel 's third pole position in four races , with his red bull teammate mark webber qualifying second .
vettel had appeared to be struggling over the course of the weekend . yet when it mattered most , in the dying moments of the final segment of qualifying -lrb- " q3 " -rrb- , he found another gear and laid down comfortably the fastest lap of the entire weekend .
" how do you do that ? "
vettel 's bewildered race engineer asked over team radio , immediately after the german lit up the timing screens .
" woohoo !
yes , baby ! " replied the 22-year old .
red bull have dominated qualifying this season , with one of their cars starting at the front for every race so far .
however , in china it looked like mclaren 's lewis hamilton had the upper hand , especially in the high-speed sections of the circuit .
" what a qualifying session , it was pretty incredible , " vettel said in the press conference afterwards .
" at the start of the session i was n't entirely happy , especially in the first sector of the lap , but by the end i was totally satisfied with the car , and was the quickest driver across almost the entire lap . "
" i want to say thanks to the mechanics , they certainly did n't get a lunch break today !
they had to work flat out between practice and qualifying to fix the problems we were having with the car but , as always , they did a great job . "
if vettel - who won the last race in malaysia - can convert his qualifying performance into another win on sunday , he would be guaranteed to take the lead in the world championship , regardless of where his competition finishes .
mixed fortunes at mercedes behind the red bull duo , ferrari 's spanish double world champion , fernando alonso , secured third place , with mercedes driver nico rosberg an impressive fourth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosberg has been overshadowing veteran teammate schumacher " i 'd say i 'm pretty happy , " rosberg told german television .
" this morning it looked much worse for us , but now we 're really close to the front .
red bull seems to have a bit of an advantage , but then there 's us and ferrari not far behind . "
however , mercedes ' other german driver , seven-time champion michael schumacher , qualified far behind his teammate in ninth , seven tenths of a second -lrb- a deceptively long time in formula one terms -rrb- adrift of rosberg .
" i know where i lost those seven tenths , so i can handle it , " schumacher said .
" but of course it 's a pity .
nico has a well set-up car , and he got the best out of it , and obviously i would have liked to achieve the same .
i shall try to do so in the race tomorrow . "
so far , either through reliability problems or a lack of speed , the highly anticipated return of schumacher to f1 after three years away has not delivered impressive results - with qualifying pace arguably his biggest problem .
sutil impresses again germany 's other strong qualifier was adrian sutil , driving for the relatively small force india team .
the 27-year old , who has never scored a top three finish in his career , starts just behind f1 's most successful driver schumacher in tenth position .
sutil has been in the top ten at the start of every race this year , by far the best performance of his career to date , but the other cars ahead of him are likely to prove too strong in the race on sunday .
the mclaren drivers jenson button and lewis hamilton - who were tipped to shine in shanghai - line up fifth and sixth , ferrari 's felipe massa starts seventh , and robert kubica grabbed eighth place for renault .
germany 's rookie nico hulkenberg is a rather disappointing sixteenth on the grid for williams , with countryman timo glock nineteenth in his virgin racing car .
glock wins the dubious honor , once again , of being the fastest driver at any of formula one 's three new teams - all of whom have been well adrift of the rest of the field so far this season .

it 's vettel 's third pole in four races this season . sebastian vettel claimed a last-gasp pole position in shanghai on saturday , and will line up at the head of the field for formula one 's chinese grand prix .
it 's vettel 's third pole position in four races , with his red bull teammate mark webber qualifying second .
vettel had appeared to be struggling over the course of the weekend . yet when it mattered most , in the dying moments of the final segment of qualifying -lrb- " q3 " -rrb- , he found another gear and laid down comfortably the fastest lap of the entire weekend .
" how do you do that ? "
vettel 's bewildered race engineer asked over team radio , immediately after the german lit up the timing screens .
" woohoo !
yes , baby ! " replied the 22-year old .
red bull have dominated qualifying this season , with one of their cars starting at the front for every race so far .
however , in china it looked like mclaren 's lewis hamilton had the upper hand , especially in the high-speed sections of the circuit .
" what a qualifying session , it was pretty incredible , " vettel said in the press conference afterwards .
" at the start of the session i was n't entirely happy , especially in the first sector of the lap , but by the end i was totally satisfied with the car , and was the quickest driver across almost the entire lap . "
" i want to say thanks to the mechanics , they certainly did n't get a lunch break today !
they had to work flat out between practice and qualifying to fix the problems we were having with the car but , as always , they did a great job . "
if vettel - who won the last race in malaysia - can convert his qualifying performance into another win on sunday , he would be guaranteed to take the lead in the world championship , regardless of where his competition finishes .
mixed fortunes at mercedes behind the red bull duo , ferrari 's spanish double world champion , fernando alonso , secured third place , with mercedes driver nico rosberg an impressive fourth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosberg has been overshadowing veteran teammate schumacher " i 'd say i 'm pretty happy , " rosberg told german television .
" this morning it looked much worse for us , but now we 're really close to the front .
red bull seems to have a bit of an advantage , but then there 's us and ferrari not far behind . "
however , mercedes ' other german driver , seven-time champion michael schumacher , qualified far behind his teammate in ninth , seven tenths of a second -lrb- a deceptively long time in formula one terms -rrb- adrift of rosberg .
" i know where i lost those seven tenths , so i can handle it , " schumacher said .
" but of course it 's a pity .
nico has a well set-up car , and he got the best out of it , and obviously i would have liked to achieve the same .
i shall try to do so in the race tomorrow . "
so far , either through reliability problems or a lack of speed , the highly anticipated return of schumacher to f1 after three years away has not delivered impressive results - with qualifying pace arguably his biggest problem .
sutil impresses again germany 's other strong qualifier was adrian sutil , driving for the relatively small force india team .
the 27-year old , who has never scored a top three finish in his career , starts just behind f1 's most successful driver schumacher in tenth position .
sutil has been in the top ten at the start of every race this year , by far the best performance of his career to date , but the other cars ahead of him are likely to prove too strong in the race on sunday .
the mclaren drivers jenson button and lewis hamilton - who were tipped to shine in shanghai - line up fifth and sixth , ferrari 's felipe massa starts seventh , and robert kubica grabbed eighth place for renault .
germany 's rookie nico hulkenberg is a rather disappointing sixteenth on the grid for williams , with countryman timo glock nineteenth in his virgin racing car .
glock wins the dubious honor , once again , of being the fastest driver at any of formula one 's three new teams - all of whom have been well adrift of the rest of the field so far this season .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 17.04.2010 un troops unlikely to pull out from congo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monuc troops on patrol in kinshasa - the congolese capital in march , the congolese government asked the un mission to withdraw all its troops .
but the recent violence raises questions as to whether the government can actually secure the country without international help . next month , france is due to present a draft of a new resolution on the un mandate for the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- to the un security council . many observers are already asking how the recent violence in mbandaka in the northwestern province of equateur , where rebels seized an airport and killed 13 people , will affect the future of the un 's involvement .
with more than 20,000 troops , the un mission -lrb- monuc -rrb- is the largest and most expensive on the planet .
monuc arrived in drc in 1999 when what is now known as the second congo war involved seven other african countries : zimbabwe , angola , chad , namibia , burundi , rwanda , and uganda .
the countries supported opposing sides - laurent kabila 's government or rebel groups in eastern congo - for different reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobutu was toppled by laurent kabila in the first congo war -lrb- 1996 - 97 -rrb- angola supported kabila because he defeated mobutu sese seko , who had helped jonas savimbi 's unita in angola 's civil war which spanned over two decades .
on the other hand , rwanda helped the rally for congolese democracy -lrb- rcd -rrb- to support tutsis in drc against hutu militias .
but rwanda , much like uganda , has been part of the war also to exploit natural resources - especially diamonds - in eastern congo .
more than 5 million people have died since 1998 as a result of the conflict .
and those who have not died directly continue to die from malnutrition or preventable diseases like cholera while thousands of women , especially in the kivu region , have been raped and many infected with hiv .
monuc and congolese army not on the same page monuc was sent to strengthen the congolese national forces and protect the population .
but many feel that it has not helped .
in fact , in " killings in kiwanja : the un 's inability to protect civilians , " human rights watch reports that monuc has failed to protect the population .
it says that monuc 's failure led to the massacre of 150 people in kiwanja in december 2008 , and that un troops have raped girls and women in eastern congo .
james paul , executive director of the global policy forum , agrees that un forces have failed to protect the population .
in part , because they were expected to work with the congolese forces which have also been accused of human rights violations , including the rape of thousands of women .
" there have been problems in the relationship between the peacekeepers and the congolese army because of concern that the un has been identified with the violations , " paul said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of women and girls have been raped by rebels as a result , instead of working with the congolese army as it should have , monuc has distanced itself from the congolese army so as not to be complicit in the latter 's actions .
" the relations between monuc and the congolese government have deteriorated extremely over the last couple of years because they do n't see eye to eye on many issues , " denis tull , a research fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
next year 's election ups the stakes last month 's announcement by the congolese government that it wanted all un troops to leave the country by august 2011 should have come as no surprise .
but its timing was strategic .
" with the upcoming 50th anniversary of congo 's independence in june , the government does not want to see a permanent presence of the un , " tull said .
observers say the government wants to take credit for the achievements that have taken place since monuc arrived in 1999 . this would put it in good light for the presidential elections in 2011 .
in spite of the criticism against monuc , it has helped to reduce the extent of the conflict and helped congo hold its first democratic elections in over four decades in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president joseph kabila won the elections in 2006 " president kabila wants to be able to say to the congolese people that he made the un mission leave because there is peace in the country , " tull said .
fabienne hara , the vice-president of multilateral relations at the international crisis group , agrees .
she told deutsche welle that " one of the reasons why the congolese government wants to see monuc withdraw is that they also want to be in charge of their own elections . "
un troops withdrawal unlikely however , it is unlikely that the congolese government will get exactly what it wants .
even though 2,000 un troops are to leave congo by june 30th , a report in march by un secretary general ban ki-moon , recommends that troops remain in the more unstable eastern congo .
also , the recent violence in equateur will very likely affect the future of the un mission .
" this new episode in equateur shows that even western congo is not completely stable despite what the government is saying .
there 's still some serious sources of tensions elsewhere in the congo , " hara said .
the un security council delegation visiting the democratic republic of congo over the next few days will most certainly take the recent violence in equateur into consideration , and un troops are expected to remain in the eastern part of the country because " any withdrawal from eastern congo would be a major catastrophe for the civilian population , " tull said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 17.04.2010 un troops unlikely to pull out from congo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monuc troops on patrol in kinshasa - the congolese capital in march , the congolese government asked the un mission to withdraw all its troops .
but the recent violence raises questions as to whether the government can actually secure the country without international help . next month , france is due to present a draft of a new resolution on the un mandate for the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- to the un security council . many observers are already asking how the recent violence in mbandaka in the northwestern province of equateur , where rebels seized an airport and killed 13 people , will affect the future of the un 's involvement .
with more than 20,000 troops , the un mission -lrb- monuc -rrb- is the largest and most expensive on the planet .
monuc arrived in drc in 1999 when what is now known as the second congo war involved seven other african countries : zimbabwe , angola , chad , namibia , burundi , rwanda , and uganda .
the countries supported opposing sides - laurent kabila 's government or rebel groups in eastern congo - for different reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobutu was toppled by laurent kabila in the first congo war -lrb- 1996 - 97 -rrb- angola supported kabila because he defeated mobutu sese seko , who had helped jonas savimbi 's unita in angola 's civil war which spanned over two decades .
on the other hand , rwanda helped the rally for congolese democracy -lrb- rcd -rrb- to support tutsis in drc against hutu militias .
but rwanda , much like uganda , has been part of the war also to exploit natural resources - especially diamonds - in eastern congo .
more than 5 million people have died since 1998 as a result of the conflict .
and those who have not died directly continue to die from malnutrition or preventable diseases like cholera while thousands of women , especially in the kivu region , have been raped and many infected with hiv .
monuc and congolese army not on the same page monuc was sent to strengthen the congolese national forces and protect the population .
but many feel that it has not helped .
in fact , in " killings in kiwanja : the un 's inability to protect civilians , " human rights watch reports that monuc has failed to protect the population .
it says that monuc 's failure led to the massacre of 150 people in kiwanja in december 2008 , and that un troops have raped girls and women in eastern congo .
james paul , executive director of the global policy forum , agrees that un forces have failed to protect the population .
in part , because they were expected to work with the congolese forces which have also been accused of human rights violations , including the rape of thousands of women .
" there have been problems in the relationship between the peacekeepers and the congolese army because of concern that the un has been identified with the violations , " paul said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of women and girls have been raped by rebels as a result , instead of working with the congolese army as it should have , monuc has distanced itself from the congolese army so as not to be complicit in the latter 's actions .
" the relations between monuc and the congolese government have deteriorated extremely over the last couple of years because they do n't see eye to eye on many issues , " denis tull , a research fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
next year 's election ups the stakes last month 's announcement by the congolese government that it wanted all un troops to leave the country by august 2011 should have come as no surprise .
but its timing was strategic .
" with the upcoming 50th anniversary of congo 's independence in june , the government does not want to see a permanent presence of the un , " tull said .
observers say the government wants to take credit for the achievements that have taken place since monuc arrived in 1999 . this would put it in good light for the presidential elections in 2011 .
in spite of the criticism against monuc , it has helped to reduce the extent of the conflict and helped congo hold its first democratic elections in over four decades in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president joseph kabila won the elections in 2006 " president kabila wants to be able to say to the congolese people that he made the un mission leave because there is peace in the country , " tull said .
fabienne hara , the vice-president of multilateral relations at the international crisis group , agrees .
she told deutsche welle that " one of the reasons why the congolese government wants to see monuc withdraw is that they also want to be in charge of their own elections . "
un troops withdrawal unlikely however , it is unlikely that the congolese government will get exactly what it wants .
even though 2,000 un troops are to leave congo by june 30th , a report in march by un secretary general ban ki-moon , recommends that troops remain in the more unstable eastern congo .
also , the recent violence in equateur will very likely affect the future of the un mission .
" this new episode in equateur shows that even western congo is not completely stable despite what the government is saying .
there 's still some serious sources of tensions elsewhere in the congo , " hara said .
the un security council delegation visiting the democratic republic of congo over the next few days will most certainly take the recent violence in equateur into consideration , and un troops are expected to remain in the eastern part of the country because " any withdrawal from eastern congo would be a major catastrophe for the civilian population , " tull said .

but the recent violence raises questions as to whether the government can actually secure the country without international help . next month , france is due to present a draft of a new resolution on the un mandate for the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- to the un security council . many observers are already asking how the recent violence in mbandaka in the northwestern province of equateur , where rebels seized an airport and killed 13 people , will affect the future of the un 's involvement .
with more than 20,000 troops , the un mission -lrb- monuc -rrb- is the largest and most expensive on the planet .
monuc arrived in drc in 1999 when what is now known as the second congo war involved seven other african countries : zimbabwe , angola , chad , namibia , burundi , rwanda , and uganda .
the countries supported opposing sides - laurent kabila 's government or rebel groups in eastern congo - for different reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobutu was toppled by laurent kabila in the first congo war -lrb- 1996 - 97 -rrb- angola supported kabila because he defeated mobutu sese seko , who had helped jonas savimbi 's unita in angola 's civil war which spanned over two decades .
on the other hand , rwanda helped the rally for congolese democracy -lrb- rcd -rrb- to support tutsis in drc against hutu militias .
but rwanda , much like uganda , has been part of the war also to exploit natural resources - especially diamonds - in eastern congo .
more than 5 million people have died since 1998 as a result of the conflict .
and those who have not died directly continue to die from malnutrition or preventable diseases like cholera while thousands of women , especially in the kivu region , have been raped and many infected with hiv .
monuc and congolese army not on the same page monuc was sent to strengthen the congolese national forces and protect the population .
but many feel that it has not helped .
in fact , in " killings in kiwanja : the un 's inability to protect civilians , " human rights watch reports that monuc has failed to protect the population .
it says that monuc 's failure led to the massacre of 150 people in kiwanja in december 2008 , and that un troops have raped girls and women in eastern congo .
james paul , executive director of the global policy forum , agrees that un forces have failed to protect the population .
in part , because they were expected to work with the congolese forces which have also been accused of human rights violations , including the rape of thousands of women .
" there have been problems in the relationship between the peacekeepers and the congolese army because of concern that the un has been identified with the violations , " paul said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of women and girls have been raped by rebels as a result , instead of working with the congolese army as it should have , monuc has distanced itself from the congolese army so as not to be complicit in the latter 's actions .
" the relations between monuc and the congolese government have deteriorated extremely over the last couple of years because they do n't see eye to eye on many issues , " denis tull , a research fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
next year 's election ups the stakes last month 's announcement by the congolese government that it wanted all un troops to leave the country by august 2011 should have come as no surprise .
but its timing was strategic .
" with the upcoming 50th anniversary of congo 's independence in june , the government does not want to see a permanent presence of the un , " tull said .

in spite of the criticism against monuc , it has helped to reduce the extent of the conflict and helped congo hold its first democratic elections in over four decades in 2006 .

they 've been in the country for decades , but the mainstream food industry is only just starting to cater to them . customers walking through the aisles of some paris area supermarkets are now likely to find halal meat and processed foods .
whether it 's spicy ready-to-eat chicken wings , halal pate , or mock ham made from turkey , halal products are increasingly making their way into mainstream shopping venues .
it may not seem like much , but for france this marks a striking change .
this was made evident last summer when the zakia food brand aired the first nationally broadcast television commercial for halal food .
it turned enough heads to make it into french newscasts .
halal means legal or lawful in arabic and refers to foods that are sanctioned by islamic authorities .
pork , blood and alcohol are not halal .
food industry observers say supermarkets and the rest of the food industry are just following the money trail .
" five and a half billion euros are going to be spent on these kinds of products this year in france , " said abbas bendali , the head of solis , a market research firm specialized in ethnic niches .
" there are five million potential customers .
so this is more than a niche , this is a real consumer segment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french food companies are shedding their misconceptions about halal meat new generation of customers a few years ago , halal foods could only be found in small shops in low-rent immigrant neighborhoods .
now france 's second largest supermarket chain , casino , has hired abderrahman bouzid to manage the halal and traditional muslim foods sold in its 10,000 stores .
he said the market is growing thanks to a new generation of french muslims .
" those under the age of 40 do n't have any hang-ups about affirming who they are ; they want to be taken into consideration , " bouzid said , explaining that muslim consumers are perfectly aware of their buying power and will prefer retailers that offer halal products .
" they 're saying ' if you are dismissive of my needs , by ignoring my customs and my preferences , i wo n't shop in your business ' , " he added .
casino has even created its own halal product line , which it markets under the name wassila .
others in the food industry are following suit .
international brands such as knorr , maggi , liebig and french firms like duc and fleury michon have all started selling halal options .
they now compete with established halal brands such as zakia , isla delice and medina .
attitudes shift some of these brands and others recently attended a halal trade show in paris , where visitors could find everything from halal foie gras and faux-bacon cheese burgers to microwaveable halal meals such as lasagna and chicken curry with rice .
antoine bonnel started the fair six years ago , when it attracted far fewer exhibitors .
this year , 100 companies participated .
bonnel said he has noticed an attitude shift in the food industry .
in the past , mainstream brands did n't want to be associates with halal because it was considered low-brow , he said , adding that french muslims had little money and unenviable social positions .
" these people came from a very poor immigrant background , " bonnel said .
" so the global image was a cheap image . "
there were also misconceptions about the ritual slaughter of animals required for meat to be considered halal .
and there were rumors that some of the taxes for this ritual could be funneled to questionable foreign causes .
bildunterschrift : young muslims represent a significant consumer segment some of this unease came to the surface earlier this year , when fast food chain quick revealed it had made eight of its 362 restaurants halal .
several french politicians criticized the move and the extreme-right national front highlighted the company in its anti-immigrant rhetoric .
but from a business perspective , the new buying power and improved social status of the young muslim generation are sweeping misgivings to the side .
sweeter than champagne the upcoming french launch of a non-alcoholic sparkling wine is just one example of that .
the drink , called " night orient , " is sold in what looks like a champagne bottle and provides people with the satisfying pop that comes with opening a bottle of real champagne .
" we decided to launch a festive drink for muslims , completely alcohol free , " said arnaud jacquemin , one of the drink 's creators .
" for weddings , for birthdays or the end of the year they have to drink orange juice , or soda , which is n't festive . "
jacquemin is n't himself muslim , but while working in the beverage industry , he saw sales of non-alcoholic drinks consistently rise and realized this market was largely untapped .
night orient tastes far sweeter than real champagne .
focus group testing showed the version initially developed was a little too dry for consumers unaccustomed to drinking wine .
so the formula was changed to better appeal to the muslim palate .
the beverage had a successful test run in some paris area supermarkets .
the small company has since signed deals with four national retail chains to officially launch the beverage in france during ramadan later this year .

the minister left the isaf camp in masar-i-sharif after the disruption to european airspace had already begun , but guttenberg hoped he would nonetheless make it back to germany . the defense minister was travelling with five bundeswehr soldiers wounded in a taliban attack in northern afghanistan on thursday . the group was first taken to a german military base in uzbekistan to board a medical transport carrier heading towards europe .
the soldiers were meant to be brought to military hospitals in germany to ensure that they would receive optimal care . with the plane redirected to turkey , the soldiers have spent the night at a us hospital in istanbul and are to continue to germany only at a later stage .
guttenberg on saturday continued his way back to germany albeit it remained unclear by which means of transportation . an ash cloud from a volcanic eruption in iceland on friday spread over most of europe , leading to more than half of all flights being cancelled .
germany 's entire airspace is affected by the problem , which has caused all major airports to be shut down . funeral for fallen soldiers set for sunday guttenberg had been scheduled to return to germany on thursday after a two-day visit to afghanistan . while in transit in uzbekistan , however , he was notified of the bloody attack - which killed four bundeswehr soldiers .
the minister subsequently returned to afghanistan with the bundeswehr 's chief of staff , volker wieker .
guttenberg visited the wounded soldiers at the german military base in masar-i-sharif on friday as they waited for a military aircraft equipped with proper medical equipment to bring them back to germany .
bundeswehr officials report that the wounded troops are all in stable condition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 17.04.2010 un troops unlikely to pull out from congo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monuc troops on patrol in kinshasa - the congolese capital in march , the congolese government asked the un mission to withdraw all its troops .
but the recent violence raises questions as to whether the government can actually secure the country without international help . next month , france is due to present a draft of a new resolution on the un mandate for the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- to the un security council . many observers are already asking how the recent violence in mbandaka in the northwestern province of equateur , where rebels seized an airport and killed 13 people , will affect the future of the un 's involvement .
with more than 20,000 troops , the un mission -lrb- monuc -rrb- is the largest and most expensive on the planet .
monuc arrived in drc in 1999 when what is now known as the second congo war involved seven other african countries : zimbabwe , angola , chad , namibia , burundi , rwanda , and uganda .
the countries supported opposing sides - laurent kabila 's government or rebel groups in eastern congo - for different reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobutu was toppled by laurent kabila in the first congo war -lrb- 1996 - 97 -rrb- angola supported kabila because he defeated mobutu sese seko , who had helped jonas savimbi 's unita in angola 's civil war which spanned over two decades .
on the other hand , rwanda helped the rally for congolese democracy -lrb- rcd -rrb- to support tutsis in drc against hutu militias .
but rwanda , much like uganda , has been part of the war also to exploit natural resources - especially diamonds - in eastern congo .
more than 5 million people have died since 1998 as a result of the conflict .
and those who have not died directly continue to die from malnutrition or preventable diseases like cholera while thousands of women , especially in the kivu region , have been raped and many infected with hiv .
monuc and congolese army not on the same page monuc was sent to strengthen the congolese national forces and protect the population .
but many feel that it has not helped .
in fact , in " killings in kiwanja : the un 's inability to protect civilians , " human rights watch reports that monuc has failed to protect the population .
it says that monuc 's failure led to the massacre of 150 people in kiwanja in december 2008 , and that un troops have raped girls and women in eastern congo .
james paul , executive director of the global policy forum , agrees that un forces have failed to protect the population .
in part , because they were expected to work with the congolese forces which have also been accused of human rights violations , including the rape of thousands of women .
" there have been problems in the relationship between the peacekeepers and the congolese army because of concern that the un has been identified with the violations , " paul said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of women and girls have been raped by rebels as a result , instead of working with the congolese army as it should have , monuc has distanced itself from the congolese army so as not to be complicit in the latter 's actions .
" the relations between monuc and the congolese government have deteriorated extremely over the last couple of years because they do n't see eye to eye on many issues , " denis tull , a research fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
next year 's election ups the stakes last month 's announcement by the congolese government that it wanted all un troops to leave the country by august 2011 should have come as no surprise .
but its timing was strategic .
" with the upcoming 50th anniversary of congo 's independence in june , the government does not want to see a permanent presence of the un , " tull said .
observers say the government wants to take credit for the achievements that have taken place since monuc arrived in 1999 . this would put it in good light for the presidential elections in 2011 .
in spite of the criticism against monuc , it has helped to reduce the extent of the conflict and helped congo hold its first democratic elections in over four decades in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president joseph kabila won the elections in 2006 " president kabila wants to be able to say to the congolese people that he made the un mission leave because there is peace in the country , " tull said .
fabienne hara , the vice-president of multilateral relations at the international crisis group , agrees .
she told deutsche welle that " one of the reasons why the congolese government wants to see monuc withdraw is that they also want to be in charge of their own elections . "
un troops withdrawal unlikely however , it is unlikely that the congolese government will get exactly what it wants .
even though 2,000 un troops are to leave congo by june 30th , a report in march by un secretary general ban ki-moon , recommends that troops remain in the more unstable eastern congo .
also , the recent violence in equateur will very likely affect the future of the un mission .
" this new episode in equateur shows that even western congo is not completely stable despite what the government is saying .
there 's still some serious sources of tensions elsewhere in the congo , " hara said .
the un security council delegation visiting the democratic republic of congo over the next few days will most certainly take the recent violence in equateur into consideration , and un troops are expected to remain in the eastern part of the country because " any withdrawal from eastern congo would be a major catastrophe for the civilian population , " tull said .

but now this pristine winemaking region is threatened by a bridge that is to span the valley , against the wishes of many locals and winemakers . the moselle valley in western germany is known for its picturesque views and world-famous moselle riesling wine .
the region thrives on the wine industry and the tourism that it brings .
in an effort to boost access to the valley , the national and state government have launched a project to build a bridge across the moselle valley .
supporters of the project say it will boost tourism in the region by shortening the travel time between neighboring belgium and luxembourg .
they say traffic congestion will be relieved for locals , and commercial connections to nearby airports will be improved .
but not everyone in the valley is convinced that building the bridge is worth it .
they 're afraid the damage to the landscape and the environment will outweigh the benefits .
pro-moselle bildunterschrift : pictures from pro-moselle showing the valley as it is and what will change with the bridge a group of citizens in the valley have formed a group called pro-moselle .
they are against the construction of the bridge , and have started a number of initiatives to try to stop construction .
last spring the group stopped tractors from digging at the official groundbreaking ceremony of the bridge , and a petition against the bridge can be signed on the group 's web site or at one of their regularly scheduled sunday demonstrations .
on sundays , members of the group meet in the town of bernkastel to gather signatures .
they hold two panoramic photographs : one shows how the valley looks now , while the other shows the same image but with the proposed bridge added in .
" these pictures alone say it all , " a woman visiting from moenchengladbach who signed the petition told deutsche welle .
" we 're enjoying the landscape here as tourists , without a bridge .
with a bridge , it is unthinkable . "
wine allies plans for the bridge have been on the books since the late 1960s , but it was n't until late 2008 that the project was given the green light .
most of the 270 million euros -lrb- $ 366 million -rrb- budgeted for the project is coming from the federal government , with the government of the state of rhineland-palatinate chipping in 20 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wine expert hugh johnson says moselle riesling is one of a kind the pro-moselle group has gained support from german politicians and leaders in the wine world .
former foreign minister joschka fisher and the co-leader of the greens ' parliamentary party , renate kuenast , are on board , as is hugh johnson , a world-renowned wine writer from britain .
johnson calls the planned bridge a ' road on stilts . '
in a video posted on the pro-moselle website , he calls on the citizens of the area to stand up and fight for the moselle valley and its one-of-a-kind wine .
" i can tell you that the whole world has nothing comparable to a moselle riesling .
you can imitate the wine of bordeaux in the napa valley , " johnson said .
" you can even imitate the wine of burgundy in certain places .
but there is nothing that even starts to imitate great moselle riesling . "
a long tradition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus berres markus berres runs the c.h. berres winery in uerzig , a town that will basically fall under the shadow of the bridge once it is completed .
his family has been in the business for 500 years , and the 31-year-old winemaker is part of the 21st generation to run the family business in the moselle valley .
he fears that tourists will be driven away once the bridge is built .
" this region lives from tourism and winemaking , " berres said in an interview with deutsche welle , " but who wants to take their holiday under a bridge ?
nobody .
so i do n't see any advantage to building the bridge . "
the state 's transportation minister , hendrik hering , announced that 35 million euros would be reinvested in the environment as a measure of compensation .
however , winemakers are still worried about the bridge 's effect on the water supply for the grapes growing on the slopes of the valley , or how the grapes will react to the additional car exhaust .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although it is years from completion , signs of the bridge are apparent " the vines will be growing with the bridge or without the bridge , " said markus berres .
" the question is , how high will the quality be ? "
too late to be stopped ?
preparation work is already underway on the bridge .
a receding tree line and dirt access roads are starting to give an indication of what the area will look like once the bridge is complete .
pro-moselle insists that as long as construction has not started , the bridge can still be stopped .
markus berres predicts that many people will move away from the valley if the bridge is completed .
in either case , berres says he 'll stay .
his family has made its living in the moselle valley for centuries , and berres plans to keep the tradition alive .
but for him , making germany 's famous moselle riesling wine just wo n't be the same in the shadow of a bridge .

the minister left the isaf camp in masar-i-sharif after the disruption to european airspace had already begun , but guttenberg hoped he would nonetheless make it back to germany . the defense minister was travelling with five bundeswehr soldiers wounded in a taliban attack in northern afghanistan on thursday . the group was first taken to a german military base in uzbekistan to board a medical transport carrier heading towards europe .
the soldiers were meant to be brought to military hospitals in germany to ensure that they would receive optimal care . with the plane redirected to turkey , the soldiers have spent the night at a us hospital in istanbul and are to continue to germany only at a later stage .
guttenberg on saturday continued his way back to germany albeit it remained unclear by which means of transportation . an ash cloud from a volcanic eruption in iceland on friday spread over most of europe , leading to more than half of all flights being cancelled .
germany 's entire airspace is affected by the problem , which has caused all major airports to be shut down . funeral for fallen soldiers set for sunday guttenberg had been scheduled to return to germany on thursday after a two-day visit to afghanistan . while in transit in uzbekistan , however , he was notified of the bloody attack - which killed four bundeswehr soldiers .
the minister subsequently returned to afghanistan with the bundeswehr 's chief of staff , volker wieker .
guttenberg visited the wounded soldiers at the german military base in masar-i-sharif on friday as they waited for a military aircraft equipped with proper medical equipment to bring them back to germany .
bundeswehr officials report that the wounded troops are all in stable condition .
while four of the five soldiers have sustained serious injuries , these are not believed to be life-threatening .
wieker is scheduled to stay on in afghanistan to attend the funeral service for the four soldiers , which is planned for sunday in the masar-i-sharif camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's funeral would follow a service held just last week explosive , not rocket , triggered thursday 's ambush the latest german casualties came after a bundeswehr patrol came under attack travelling between kunduz and baghlan on thursday .
after initially reporting that the deadly ambush began when a german armored vehicle was struck by a rocket close to pol-i-khomri camp , germany 's defense ministry on friday corrected this , saying the attackers used a remotely detonated explosive device .
three bundeswehr soldiers died in the initial explosion , with the fourth killed in an ensuing battle , in which the isaf troops are believed to have come under mortar and gunfire .
a total of 43 german soldiers have now been killed in afghanistan since the bundeswehr mission began in 2002 .
of those , 26 have been killed in firefights or insurgent attacks .
in recent weeks , taliban insurgents have stepped up pressure on the german troops based in the northern province of kunduz .
on april 2 , three german soldiers were killed during a mine-clearing expedition. ai / glb / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the recent violence raises questions as to whether the government can actually secure the country without international help . next month , france is due to present a draft of a new resolution on the un mandate for the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- to the un security council . many observers are already asking how the recent violence in mbandaka in the northwestern province of equateur , where rebels seized an airport and killed 13 people , will affect the future of the un 's involvement .
with more than 20,000 troops , the un mission -lrb- monuc -rrb- is the largest and most expensive on the planet .
monuc arrived in drc in 1999 when what is now known as the second congo war involved seven other african countries : zimbabwe , angola , chad , namibia , burundi , rwanda , and uganda .
the countries supported opposing sides - laurent kabila 's government or rebel groups in eastern congo - for different reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobutu was toppled by laurent kabila in the first congo war -lrb- 1996 - 97 -rrb- angola supported kabila because he defeated mobutu sese seko , who had helped jonas savimbi 's unita in angola 's civil war which spanned over two decades .
on the other hand , rwanda helped the rally for congolese democracy -lrb- rcd -rrb- to support tutsis in drc against hutu militias .
but rwanda , much like uganda , has been part of the war also to exploit natural resources - especially diamonds - in eastern congo .
more than 5 million people have died since 1998 as a result of the conflict .
and those who have not died directly continue to die from malnutrition or preventable diseases like cholera while thousands of women , especially in the kivu region , have been raped and many infected with hiv .
monuc and congolese army not on the same page monuc was sent to strengthen the congolese national forces and protect the population .
but many feel that it has not helped .
in fact , in " killings in kiwanja : the un 's inability to protect civilians , " human rights watch reports that monuc has failed to protect the population .
it says that monuc 's failure led to the massacre of 150 people in kiwanja in december 2008 , and that un troops have raped girls and women in eastern congo .
james paul , executive director of the global policy forum , agrees that un forces have failed to protect the population .
in part , because they were expected to work with the congolese forces which have also been accused of human rights violations , including the rape of thousands of women .
" there have been problems in the relationship between the peacekeepers and the congolese army because of concern that the un has been identified with the violations , " paul said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of women and girls have been raped by rebels as a result , instead of working with the congolese army as it should have , monuc has distanced itself from the congolese army so as not to be complicit in the latter 's actions .
" the relations between monuc and the congolese government have deteriorated extremely over the last couple of years because they do n't see eye to eye on many issues , " denis tull , a research fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
next year 's election ups the stakes last month 's announcement by the congolese government that it wanted all un troops to leave the country by august 2011 should have come as no surprise .
but its timing was strategic .
" with the upcoming 50th anniversary of congo 's independence in june , the government does not want to see a permanent presence of the un , " tull said .
observers say the government wants to take credit for the achievements that have taken place since monuc arrived in 1999 . this would put it in good light for the presidential elections in 2011 .
in spite of the criticism against monuc , it has helped to reduce the extent of the conflict and helped congo hold its first democratic elections in over four decades in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president joseph kabila won the elections in 2006 " president kabila wants to be able to say to the congolese people that he made the un mission leave because there is peace in the country , " tull said .
fabienne hara , the vice-president of multilateral relations at the international crisis group , agrees .
she told deutsche welle that " one of the reasons why the congolese government wants to see monuc withdraw is that they also want to be in charge of their own elections . "
un troops withdrawal unlikely however , it is unlikely that the congolese government will get exactly what it wants .
even though 2,000 un troops are to leave congo by june 30th , a report in march by un secretary general ban ki-moon , recommends that troops remain in the more unstable eastern congo .
also , the recent violence in equateur will very likely affect the future of the un mission .
" this new episode in equateur shows that even western congo is not completely stable despite what the government is saying .
there 's still some serious sources of tensions elsewhere in the congo , " hara said .
the un security council delegation visiting the democratic republic of congo over the next few days will most certainly take the recent violence in equateur into consideration , and un troops are expected to remain in the eastern part of the country because " any withdrawal from eastern congo would be a major catastrophe for the civilian population , " tull said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 17.04.2010 un troops unlikely to pull out from congo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monuc troops on patrol in kinshasa - the congolese capital in march , the congolese government asked the un mission to withdraw all its troops .
but the recent violence raises questions as to whether the government can actually secure the country without international help . next month , france is due to present a draft of a new resolution on the un mandate for the democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- to the un security council . many observers are already asking how the recent violence in mbandaka in the northwestern province of equateur , where rebels seized an airport and killed 13 people , will affect the future of the un 's involvement .
with more than 20,000 troops , the un mission -lrb- monuc -rrb- is the largest and most expensive on the planet .
monuc arrived in drc in 1999 when what is now known as the second congo war involved seven other african countries : zimbabwe , angola , chad , namibia , burundi , rwanda , and uganda .
the countries supported opposing sides - laurent kabila 's government or rebel groups in eastern congo - for different reasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobutu was toppled by laurent kabila in the first congo war -lrb- 1996 - 97 -rrb- angola supported kabila because he defeated mobutu sese seko , who had helped jonas savimbi 's unita in angola 's civil war which spanned over two decades .
on the other hand , rwanda helped the rally for congolese democracy -lrb- rcd -rrb- to support tutsis in drc against hutu militias .
but rwanda , much like uganda , has been part of the war also to exploit natural resources - especially diamonds - in eastern congo .
more than 5 million people have died since 1998 as a result of the conflict .
and those who have not died directly continue to die from malnutrition or preventable diseases like cholera while thousands of women , especially in the kivu region , have been raped and many infected with hiv .
monuc and congolese army not on the same page monuc was sent to strengthen the congolese national forces and protect the population .
but many feel that it has not helped .
in fact , in " killings in kiwanja : the un 's inability to protect civilians , " human rights watch reports that monuc has failed to protect the population .
it says that monuc 's failure led to the massacre of 150 people in kiwanja in december 2008 , and that un troops have raped girls and women in eastern congo .
james paul , executive director of the global policy forum , agrees that un forces have failed to protect the population .
in part , because they were expected to work with the congolese forces which have also been accused of human rights violations , including the rape of thousands of women .
" there have been problems in the relationship between the peacekeepers and the congolese army because of concern that the un has been identified with the violations , " paul said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of women and girls have been raped by rebels as a result , instead of working with the congolese army as it should have , monuc has distanced itself from the congolese army so as not to be complicit in the latter 's actions .
" the relations between monuc and the congolese government have deteriorated extremely over the last couple of years because they do n't see eye to eye on many issues , " denis tull , a research fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
next year 's election ups the stakes last month 's announcement by the congolese government that it wanted all un troops to leave the country by august 2011 should have come as no surprise .
but its timing was strategic .
" with the upcoming 50th anniversary of congo 's independence in june , the government does not want to see a permanent presence of the un , " tull said .
observers say the government wants to take credit for the achievements that have taken place since monuc arrived in 1999 . this would put it in good light for the presidential elections in 2011 .
in spite of the criticism against monuc , it has helped to reduce the extent of the conflict and helped congo hold its first democratic elections in over four decades in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president joseph kabila won the elections in 2006 " president kabila wants to be able to say to the congolese people that he made the un mission leave because there is peace in the country , " tull said .
fabienne hara , the vice-president of multilateral relations at the international crisis group , agrees .
she told deutsche welle that " one of the reasons why the congolese government wants to see monuc withdraw is that they also want to be in charge of their own elections . "
un troops withdrawal unlikely however , it is unlikely that the congolese government will get exactly what it wants .
even though 2,000 un troops are to leave congo by june 30th , a report in march by un secretary general ban ki-moon , recommends that troops remain in the more unstable eastern congo .
also , the recent violence in equateur will very likely affect the future of the un mission .
" this new episode in equateur shows that even western congo is not completely stable despite what the government is saying .
there 's still some serious sources of tensions elsewhere in the congo , " hara said .
the un security council delegation visiting the democratic republic of congo over the next few days will most certainly take the recent violence in equateur into consideration , and un troops are expected to remain in the eastern part of the country because " any withdrawal from eastern congo would be a major catastrophe for the civilian population , " tull said .

they 've been in the country for decades , but the mainstream food industry is only just starting to cater to them . customers walking through the aisles of some paris area supermarkets are now likely to find halal meat and processed foods .
whether it 's spicy ready-to-eat chicken wings , halal pate , or mock ham made from turkey , halal products are increasingly making their way into mainstream shopping venues .
it may not seem like much , but for france this marks a striking change .
this was made evident last summer when the zakia food brand aired the first nationally broadcast television commercial for halal food .
it turned enough heads to make it into french newscasts .
halal means legal or lawful in arabic and refers to foods that are sanctioned by islamic authorities .
pork , blood and alcohol are not halal .
food industry observers say supermarkets and the rest of the food industry are just following the money trail .
" five and a half billion euros are going to be spent on these kinds of products this year in france , " said abbas bendali , the head of solis , a market research firm specialized in ethnic niches .
" there are five million potential customers .
so this is more than a niche , this is a real consumer segment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french food companies are shedding their misconceptions about halal meat new generation of customers a few years ago , halal foods could only be found in small shops in low-rent immigrant neighborhoods .
now france 's second largest supermarket chain , casino , has hired abderrahman bouzid to manage the halal and traditional muslim foods sold in its 10,000 stores .
he said the market is growing thanks to a new generation of french muslims .
" those under the age of 40 do n't have any hang-ups about affirming who they are ; they want to be taken into consideration , " bouzid said , explaining that muslim consumers are perfectly aware of their buying power and will prefer retailers that offer halal products .
" they 're saying ' if you are dismissive of my needs , by ignoring my customs and my preferences , i wo n't shop in your business ' , " he added .
casino has even created its own halal product line , which it markets under the name wassila .
others in the food industry are following suit .
international brands such as knorr , maggi , liebig and french firms like duc and fleury michon have all started selling halal options .
they now compete with established halal brands such as zakia , isla delice and medina .
attitudes shift some of these brands and others recently attended a halal trade show in paris , where visitors could find everything from halal foie gras and faux-bacon cheese burgers to microwaveable halal meals such as lasagna and chicken curry with rice .
antoine bonnel started the fair six years ago , when it attracted far fewer exhibitors .
this year , 100 companies participated .
bonnel said he has noticed an attitude shift in the food industry .
in the past , mainstream brands did n't want to be associates with halal because it was considered low-brow , he said , adding that french muslims had little money and unenviable social positions .
" these people came from a very poor immigrant background , " bonnel said .
" so the global image was a cheap image . "
there were also misconceptions about the ritual slaughter of animals required for meat to be considered halal .
and there were rumors that some of the taxes for this ritual could be funneled to questionable foreign causes .
bildunterschrift : young muslims represent a significant consumer segment some of this unease came to the surface earlier this year , when fast food chain quick revealed it had made eight of its 362 restaurants halal .
several french politicians criticized the move and the extreme-right national front highlighted the company in its anti-immigrant rhetoric .
but from a business perspective , the new buying power and improved social status of the young muslim generation are sweeping misgivings to the side .
sweeter than champagne the upcoming french launch of a non-alcoholic sparkling wine is just one example of that .
the drink , called " night orient , " is sold in what looks like a champagne bottle and provides people with the satisfying pop that comes with opening a bottle of real champagne .
" we decided to launch a festive drink for muslims , completely alcohol free , " said arnaud jacquemin , one of the drink 's creators .
" for weddings , for birthdays or the end of the year they have to drink orange juice , or soda , which is n't festive . "
jacquemin is n't himself muslim , but while working in the beverage industry , he saw sales of non-alcoholic drinks consistently rise and realized this market was largely untapped .
night orient tastes far sweeter than real champagne .
focus group testing showed the version initially developed was a little too dry for consumers unaccustomed to drinking wine .
so the formula was changed to better appeal to the muslim palate .
the beverage had a successful test run in some paris area supermarkets .
the small company has since signed deals with four national retail chains to officially launch the beverage in france during ramadan later this year .

they 've been in the country for decades , but the mainstream food industry is only just starting to cater to them . customers walking through the aisles of some paris area supermarkets are now likely to find halal meat and processed foods .
whether it 's spicy ready-to-eat chicken wings , halal pate , or mock ham made from turkey , halal products are increasingly making their way into mainstream shopping venues .
it may not seem like much , but for france this marks a striking change .
this was made evident last summer when the zakia food brand aired the first nationally broadcast television commercial for halal food .
it turned enough heads to make it into french newscasts .
halal means legal or lawful in arabic and refers to foods that are sanctioned by islamic authorities .
pork , blood and alcohol are not halal .
food industry observers say supermarkets and the rest of the food industry are just following the money trail .
" five and a half billion euros are going to be spent on these kinds of products this year in france , " said abbas bendali , the head of solis , a market research firm specialized in ethnic niches .
" there are five million potential customers .
so this is more than a niche , this is a real consumer segment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french food companies are shedding their misconceptions about halal meat new generation of customers a few years ago , halal foods could only be found in small shops in low-rent immigrant neighborhoods .
now france 's second largest supermarket chain , casino , has hired abderrahman bouzid to manage the halal and traditional muslim foods sold in its 10,000 stores .
he said the market is growing thanks to a new generation of french muslims .
" those under the age of 40 do n't have any hang-ups about affirming who they are ; they want to be taken into consideration , " bouzid said , explaining that muslim consumers are perfectly aware of their buying power and will prefer retailers that offer halal products .
" they 're saying ' if you are dismissive of my needs , by ignoring my customs and my preferences , i wo n't shop in your business ' , " he added .
casino has even created its own halal product line , which it markets under the name wassila .
others in the food industry are following suit .
international brands such as knorr , maggi , liebig and french firms like duc and fleury michon have all started selling halal options .
they now compete with established halal brands such as zakia , isla delice and medina .
attitudes shift some of these brands and others recently attended a halal trade show in paris , where visitors could find everything from halal foie gras and faux-bacon cheese burgers to microwaveable halal meals such as lasagna and chicken curry with rice .
antoine bonnel started the fair six years ago , when it attracted far fewer exhibitors .
this year , 100 companies participated .
bonnel said he has noticed an attitude shift in the food industry .
in the past , mainstream brands did n't want to be associates with halal because it was considered low-brow , he said , adding that french muslims had little money and unenviable social positions .
" these people came from a very poor immigrant background , " bonnel said .
" so the global image was a cheap image . "
there were also misconceptions about the ritual slaughter of animals required for meat to be considered halal .
and there were rumors that some of the taxes for this ritual could be funneled to questionable foreign causes .
bildunterschrift : young muslims represent a significant consumer segment some of this unease came to the surface earlier this year , when fast food chain quick revealed it had made eight of its 362 restaurants halal .
several french politicians criticized the move and the extreme-right national front highlighted the company in its anti-immigrant rhetoric .
but from a business perspective , the new buying power and improved social status of the young muslim generation are sweeping misgivings to the side .
sweeter than champagne the upcoming french launch of a non-alcoholic sparkling wine is just one example of that .
the drink , called " night orient , " is sold in what looks like a champagne bottle and provides people with the satisfying pop that comes with opening a bottle of real champagne .
" we decided to launch a festive drink for muslims , completely alcohol free , " said arnaud jacquemin , one of the drink 's creators .
" for weddings , for birthdays or the end of the year they have to drink orange juice , or soda , which is n't festive . "
jacquemin is n't himself muslim , but while working in the beverage industry , he saw sales of non-alcoholic drinks consistently rise and realized this market was largely untapped .
night orient tastes far sweeter than real champagne .
focus group testing showed the version initially developed was a little too dry for consumers unaccustomed to drinking wine .
so the formula was changed to better appeal to the muslim palate .
the beverage had a successful test run in some paris area supermarkets .
the small company has since signed deals with four national retail chains to officially launch the beverage in france during ramadan later this year .

the minister left the isaf camp in masar-i-sharif after the disruption to european airspace had already begun , but guttenberg hoped he would nonetheless make it back to germany . the defense minister was travelling with five bundeswehr soldiers wounded in a taliban attack in northern afghanistan on thursday . the group was first taken to a german military base in uzbekistan to board a medical transport carrier heading towards europe .
the soldiers were meant to be brought to military hospitals in germany to ensure that they would receive optimal care . with the plane redirected to turkey , the soldiers have spent the night at a us hospital in istanbul and are to continue to germany only at a later stage .
guttenberg on saturday continued his way back to germany albeit it remained unclear by which means of transportation . an ash cloud from a volcanic eruption in iceland on friday spread over most of europe , leading to more than half of all flights being cancelled .
germany 's entire airspace is affected by the problem , which has caused all major airports to be shut down . funeral for fallen soldiers set for sunday guttenberg had been scheduled to return to germany on thursday after a two-day visit to afghanistan . while in transit in uzbekistan , however , he was notified of the bloody attack - which killed four bundeswehr soldiers .
the minister subsequently returned to afghanistan with the bundeswehr 's chief of staff , volker wieker .
guttenberg visited the wounded soldiers at the german military base in masar-i-sharif on friday as they waited for a military aircraft equipped with proper medical equipment to bring them back to germany .
bundeswehr officials report that the wounded troops are all in stable condition .
while four of the five soldiers have sustained serious injuries , these are not believed to be life-threatening .
wieker is scheduled to stay on in afghanistan to attend the funeral service for the four soldiers , which is planned for sunday in the masar-i-sharif camp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday 's funeral would follow a service held just last week explosive , not rocket , triggered thursday 's ambush the latest german casualties came after a bundeswehr patrol came under attack travelling between kunduz and baghlan on thursday .
after initially reporting that the deadly ambush began when a german armored vehicle was struck by a rocket close to pol-i-khomri camp , germany 's defense ministry on friday corrected this , saying the attackers used a remotely detonated explosive device .
three bundeswehr soldiers died in the initial explosion , with the fourth killed in an ensuing battle , in which the isaf troops are believed to have come under mortar and gunfire .
a total of 43 german soldiers have now been killed in afghanistan since the bundeswehr mission began in 2002 .
of those , 26 have been killed in firefights or insurgent attacks .
in recent weeks , taliban insurgents have stepped up pressure on the german troops based in the northern province of kunduz .

it 's also caused major financial losses for airlines and sent their stocks tumbling . airlines were reeling saturday as flights and passengers remained grounded for a third straight day due to the icelandic volcanic ash cloud hovering over much of europe .
large flag carriers and no-frills airlines alike saw their shares dip on friday . the eurocontrol air traffic agency in brussels estimates that nearly 60 per cent of the region 's 28,000 daily flights , have been affected by the volcanic ash . british airways shares closed down more than 3 per cent on friday , while in ireland budget airline ryanair was down 2.3 per cent .
europe 's largest airline by revenue , lufthansa , ended the day down 4 per cent , while air france-klm slid by 3.4 per cent .
the disruption in travel is costing airliners roughly 148 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- in lost revenues per day .
after friday , about 16,000 flights were cancelled , making it the largest airspace shutdown since the second world war .
" in addition to lost revenues , airlines will incur added costs for re-routing of aircraft , care for stranded passengers and stranded aircraft at various ports , " the aviation industry body iata said in a statement on friday .
the association of european airlines estimated that the european economy had lost about one billion euros so far from flight bans across the continent .
however , airline reinsurers played down the potential of the ash cloud to greatly disturb business , hurt agriculture , or cause property damage .
" as long as the restriction to air travel remains temporary as is now expected , there should be no measureable impact for the broader economy , " said reinsurer munich re in a statement .
" it 's just an issue for the airlines to handle . "
airlines are typically not insured against cancellations .
other industries affected deutsche post , europe 's largest mail and express delivery company , said the cloud has disrupted delivery by air and the company has switched to land transport where possible .
the cloud has even affected the hotel industry throughout asia , as dozens of cancelled european flights have left hotels struggling to accommodate thousands of passengers .
but according to energy company officials , oil , gas , and electricity production in europe is not likely to suffer .
the one direct effect from the ash cloud is that offshore workers in the north sea will have to wait longer for replacements , as helicopters were also grounded as part of the flight ban .
flight bans have been imposed by more than 15 european countries .
britain , germany , finland , slovakia , estonia and denmark have extended their bans until sunday. mk / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more than 20 countries have closed their airspace with some countries calling off all flights until monday morning . european flights remained grounded on saturday due to a vast cloud of volcanic ash from iceland that has covered much of europe and has spread as far east as russia .
britain , ireland , switzerland , and belgium all extended their flight bans on saturday .
more than 20 european countries grounded flights because of the ash cloud .
the disruption hit german chancellor angela merkel who was trying to return to berlin from the united states on friday when her plane was diverted to lisbon .
she flew to rome on saturday , having to spend the night in italy . the chancellor will therefore be unable to attend the funeral of polish president lech kaczynski on sunday .
in addition , flights bringing home the bodies of german soldiers killed in afghanistan along with soldiers wounded in the country were redirected to turkey .
bildunterschrift : the last time the volcano erupted , in the 19th century , it continued sporadically for over a year things could get worse volcanic ash can terminally damage the engines and windows of jetliners .
the national air traffic services , which oversees british airspace , said the situation from the cloud is getting worse . experts tracking the volcano beneath the eyjafjallajokull glacier said there were no signs of reduced activity on friday .
after a relatively minor eruption one month ago , the volcano erupted again on wednesday , with these two incidents breaking almost 200 years of dormancy .
that last recorded eruption continued - with varying levels of severity and intermittent periods of inactivity - for almost 18 months between 1821 and 1823 .
" we have no prediction on how long -lsb- the eruption -rsb- will last , " said geophysicist bergthora thorbjnardottir at the iceland meteorological office .
hundreds of thousands stranded westerly and north-westerly winds have blown the ash across swathes of northern and central europe , grounding some 17,000 flights on friday , after around 6,000 were cancelled on thursday .
the disruption is costing airlines over 148 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- per day .
currently , only emergency flights are permitted into and out of the affected regions in europe .
all 16 international airports in germany were closed on saturday with no flights set to take off until at least 2pm on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train operators and others are getting extra business germany 's national rail service , deutsche bahn , has reported a surge in demand as travellers look for another way to reach their destination .
" we have a lot more people booking tickets , and are putting every train at our disposal into action , " a bahn spokesman told german public broadcaster ard .
" everything that can run is running . "

more than 20 countries have closed their airspace with some countries calling off all flights until monday morning . european flights remained grounded on saturday due to a vast cloud of volcanic ash from iceland that has covered much of europe and has spread as far east as russia .
britain , ireland , switzerland , and belgium all extended their flight bans on saturday .
more than 20 european countries grounded flights because of the ash cloud .
the disruption hit german chancellor angela merkel who was trying to return to berlin from the united states on friday when her plane was diverted to lisbon .
she flew to rome on saturday , having to spend the night in italy . the chancellor will therefore be unable to attend the funeral of polish president lech kaczynski on sunday .
in addition , flights bringing home the bodies of german soldiers killed in afghanistan along with soldiers wounded in the country were redirected to turkey .
bildunterschrift : the last time the volcano erupted , in the 19th century , it continued sporadically for over a year things could get worse volcanic ash can terminally damage the engines and windows of jetliners .
the national air traffic services , which oversees british airspace , said the situation from the cloud is getting worse . experts tracking the volcano beneath the eyjafjallajokull glacier said there were no signs of reduced activity on friday .
after a relatively minor eruption one month ago , the volcano erupted again on wednesday , with these two incidents breaking almost 200 years of dormancy .
that last recorded eruption continued - with varying levels of severity and intermittent periods of inactivity - for almost 18 months between 1821 and 1823 .
" we have no prediction on how long -lsb- the eruption -rsb- will last , " said geophysicist bergthora thorbjnardottir at the iceland meteorological office .
hundreds of thousands stranded westerly and north-westerly winds have blown the ash across swathes of northern and central europe , grounding some 17,000 flights on friday , after around 6,000 were cancelled on thursday .
the disruption is costing airlines over 148 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- per day .
currently , only emergency flights are permitted into and out of the affected regions in europe .
all 16 international airports in germany were closed on saturday with no flights set to take off until at least 2pm on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train operators and others are getting extra business germany 's national rail service , deutsche bahn , has reported a surge in demand as travellers look for another way to reach their destination .

however , airline reinsurers played down the potential of the ash cloud to greatly disturb business , hurt agriculture , or cause property damage .
" as long as the restriction to air travel remains temporary as is now expected , there should be no measureable impact for the broader economy , " said reinsurer munich re in a statement .
" it 's just an issue for the airlines to handle . "
airlines are typically not insured against cancellations .
other industries affected deutsche post , europe 's largest mail and express delivery company , said the cloud has disrupted delivery by air and the company has switched to land transport where possible .
the cloud has even affected the hotel industry throughout asia , as dozens of cancelled european flights have left hotels struggling to accommodate thousands of passengers .
but according to energy company officials , oil , gas , and electricity production in europe is not likely to suffer .
the one direct effect from the ash cloud is that offshore workers in the north sea will have to wait longer for replacements , as helicopters were also grounded as part of the flight ban .
flight bans have been imposed by more than 15 european countries .
britain , germany , finland , slovakia , estonia and denmark have extended their bans until sunday. mk / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's vettel 's third pole in four races this season . sebastian vettel claimed a last-gasp pole position in shanghai on saturday , and will line up at the head of the field for formula one 's chinese grand prix .
it 's vettel 's third pole position in four races , with his red bull teammate mark webber qualifying second .
vettel had appeared to be struggling over the course of the weekend . yet when it mattered most , in the dying moments of the final segment of qualifying -lrb- " q3 " -rrb- , he found another gear and laid down comfortably the fastest lap of the entire weekend .
" how do you do that ? "
vettel 's bewildered race engineer asked over team radio , immediately after the german lit up the timing screens .
" woohoo !
yes , baby ! " replied the 22-year old .
red bull have dominated qualifying this season , with one of their cars starting at the front for every race so far .
however , in china it looked like mclaren 's lewis hamilton had the upper hand , especially in the high-speed sections of the circuit .
" what a qualifying session , it was pretty incredible , " vettel said in the press conference afterwards .
" at the start of the session i was n't entirely happy , especially in the first sector of the lap , but by the end i was totally satisfied with the car , and was the quickest driver across almost the entire lap . "
" i want to say thanks to the mechanics , they certainly did n't get a lunch break today !
they had to work flat out between practice and qualifying to fix the problems we were having with the car but , as always , they did a great job . "
if vettel - who won the last race in malaysia - can convert his qualifying performance into another win on sunday , he would be guaranteed to take the lead in the world championship , regardless of where his competition finishes .
mixed fortunes at mercedes behind the red bull duo , ferrari 's spanish double world champion , fernando alonso , secured third place , with mercedes driver nico rosberg an impressive fourth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosberg has been overshadowing veteran teammate schumacher " i 'd say i 'm pretty happy , " rosberg told german television .
" this morning it looked much worse for us , but now we 're really close to the front .
red bull seems to have a bit of an advantage , but then there 's us and ferrari not far behind . "
however , mercedes ' other german driver , seven-time champion michael schumacher , qualified far behind his teammate in ninth , seven tenths of a second -lrb- a deceptively long time in formula one terms -rrb- adrift of rosberg .
" i know where i lost those seven tenths , so i can handle it , " schumacher said .
" but of course it 's a pity .
nico has a well set-up car , and he got the best out of it , and obviously i would have liked to achieve the same .
i shall try to do so in the race tomorrow . "
so far , either through reliability problems or a lack of speed , the highly anticipated return of schumacher to f1 after three years away has not delivered impressive results - with qualifying pace arguably his biggest problem .
sutil impresses again germany 's other strong qualifier was adrian sutil , driving for the relatively small force india team .
the 27-year old , who has never scored a top three finish in his career , starts just behind f1 's most successful driver schumacher in tenth position .
sutil has been in the top ten at the start of every race this year , by far the best performance of his career to date , but the other cars ahead of him are likely to prove too strong in the race on sunday .
the mclaren drivers jenson button and lewis hamilton - who were tipped to shine in shanghai - line up fifth and sixth , ferrari 's felipe massa starts seventh , and robert kubica grabbed eighth place for renault .
germany 's rookie nico hulkenberg is a rather disappointing sixteenth on the grid for williams , with countryman timo glock nineteenth in his virgin racing car .
glock wins the dubious honor , once again , of being the fastest driver at any of formula one 's three new teams - all of whom have been well adrift of the rest of the field so far this season .

more than 20 countries have closed their airspace with some countries calling off all flights until monday morning . european flights remained grounded on saturday due to a vast cloud of volcanic ash from iceland that has covered much of europe and has spread as far east as russia .
britain , ireland , switzerland , and belgium all extended their flight bans on saturday .
more than 20 european countries grounded flights because of the ash cloud .
the disruption hit german chancellor angela merkel who was trying to return to berlin from the united states on friday when her plane was diverted to lisbon .
she flew to rome on saturday , having to spend the night in italy . the chancellor will therefore be unable to attend the funeral of polish president lech kaczynski on sunday .
in addition , flights bringing home the bodies of german soldiers killed in afghanistan along with soldiers wounded in the country were redirected to turkey .
bildunterschrift : the last time the volcano erupted , in the 19th century , it continued sporadically for over a year things could get worse volcanic ash can terminally damage the engines and windows of jetliners .
the national air traffic services , which oversees british airspace , said the situation from the cloud is getting worse . experts tracking the volcano beneath the eyjafjallajokull glacier said there were no signs of reduced activity on friday .
after a relatively minor eruption one month ago , the volcano erupted again on wednesday , with these two incidents breaking almost 200 years of dormancy .
that last recorded eruption continued - with varying levels of severity and intermittent periods of inactivity - for almost 18 months between 1821 and 1823 .
" we have no prediction on how long -lsb- the eruption -rsb- will last , " said geophysicist bergthora thorbjnardottir at the iceland meteorological office .
hundreds of thousands stranded westerly and north-westerly winds have blown the ash across swathes of northern and central europe , grounding some 17,000 flights on friday , after around 6,000 were cancelled on thursday .
the disruption is costing airlines over 148 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- per day .
currently , only emergency flights are permitted into and out of the affected regions in europe .

more than 20 countries have closed their airspace with some countries calling off all flights until monday morning . european flights remained grounded on saturday due to a vast cloud of volcanic ash from iceland that has covered much of europe and has spread as far east as russia .
britain , ireland , switzerland , and belgium all extended their flight bans on saturday .
more than 20 european countries grounded flights because of the ash cloud .
the disruption hit german chancellor angela merkel who was trying to return to berlin from the united states on friday when her plane was diverted to lisbon .
she flew to rome on saturday , having to spend the night in italy . the chancellor will therefore be unable to attend the funeral of polish president lech kaczynski on sunday .
in addition , flights bringing home the bodies of german soldiers killed in afghanistan along with soldiers wounded in the country were redirected to turkey .
bildunterschrift : the last time the volcano erupted , in the 19th century , it continued sporadically for over a year things could get worse volcanic ash can terminally damage the engines and windows of jetliners .
the national air traffic services , which oversees british airspace , said the situation from the cloud is getting worse . experts tracking the volcano beneath the eyjafjallajokull glacier said there were no signs of reduced activity on friday .
after a relatively minor eruption one month ago , the volcano erupted again on wednesday , with these two incidents breaking almost 200 years of dormancy .
that last recorded eruption continued - with varying levels of severity and intermittent periods of inactivity - for almost 18 months between 1821 and 1823 .
" we have no prediction on how long -lsb- the eruption -rsb- will last , " said geophysicist bergthora thorbjnardottir at the iceland meteorological office .
hundreds of thousands stranded westerly and north-westerly winds have blown the ash across swathes of northern and central europe , grounding some 17,000 flights on friday , after around 6,000 were cancelled on thursday .
the disruption is costing airlines over 148 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- per day .
currently , only emergency flights are permitted into and out of the affected regions in europe .
all 16 international airports in germany were closed on saturday with no flights set to take off until at least 2pm on sunday .

" we have a lot more people booking tickets , and are putting every train at our disposal into action , " a bahn spokesman told german public broadcaster ard .
" everything that can run is running . "
the eurostar train service linking britain and mainland europe via the channel tunnel is fully booked , with the company reporting 38,000 travelers on friday , 10,000 more than average .
international coach services also claimed to be running at five times their usual capacity due to a surge in demand .

with three matches left in the season , bayern maintain a two point lead over schalke , who also won on saturday . seven unanswered goals by bayern munich 's attacking superstars - ivica olic , arjen robben , and thomas mueller - dismantled a hapless hanover on saturday evening , giving munich the lead in the bundesliga table .

four minutes into the second half , the croatian olic headed home his second goal from close range .
a minute later , robben notched his second , while mueller made it six for the home side in the 62nd minute when he drove home an olic cross .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke took the bundesliga lead on saturday , temporarily robben rounded off the scoring by picking up his hat trick in injury time , which was more than enough for the win and the bundesliga lead .
schalke two points back earlier on saturday , schalke took down borussia moenchengladbach 3-1 thanks to two goals from ivan rakitic .
the win broke a two-match losing streak for schalke , who have 61 points , two behind bayern .
rakitic gave schalke an early lead with a thundering strike from 25 meters in the eighth minute .
raul bobadilla evened the score eight minutes later for visitors gladbach when he beat two defenders in the air , raced clear and got the better of keeper manuel neuer for an empty net goal .
schalke re-took the lead in the dying seconds of the first half with a goal from jefferson farfan , and rakitic notched his second at the beginning of the second half to put the match away .

it 's vettel 's third pole in four races this season . sebastian vettel claimed a last-gasp pole position in shanghai on saturday , and will line up at the head of the field for formula one 's chinese grand prix .
it 's vettel 's third pole position in four races , with his red bull teammate mark webber qualifying second .
vettel had appeared to be struggling over the course of the weekend . yet when it mattered most , in the dying moments of the final segment of qualifying -lrb- " q3 " -rrb- , he found another gear and laid down comfortably the fastest lap of the entire weekend .
" how do you do that ? "
vettel 's bewildered race engineer asked over team radio , immediately after the german lit up the timing screens .
" woohoo !
yes , baby ! " replied the 22-year old .
red bull have dominated qualifying this season , with one of their cars starting at the front for every race so far .
however , in china it looked like mclaren 's lewis hamilton had the upper hand , especially in the high-speed sections of the circuit .
" what a qualifying session , it was pretty incredible , " vettel said in the press conference afterwards .
" at the start of the session i was n't entirely happy , especially in the first sector of the lap , but by the end i was totally satisfied with the car , and was the quickest driver across almost the entire lap . "
" i want to say thanks to the mechanics , they certainly did n't get a lunch break today !
they had to work flat out between practice and qualifying to fix the problems we were having with the car but , as always , they did a great job . "
if vettel - who won the last race in malaysia - can convert his qualifying performance into another win on sunday , he would be guaranteed to take the lead in the world championship , regardless of where his competition finishes .
mixed fortunes at mercedes behind the red bull duo , ferrari 's spanish double world champion , fernando alonso , secured third place , with mercedes driver nico rosberg an impressive fourth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rosberg has been overshadowing veteran teammate schumacher " i 'd say i 'm pretty happy , " rosberg told german television .
" this morning it looked much worse for us , but now we 're really close to the front .
red bull seems to have a bit of an advantage , but then there 's us and ferrari not far behind . "
however , mercedes ' other german driver , seven-time champion michael schumacher , qualified far behind his teammate in ninth , seven tenths of a second -lrb- a deceptively long time in formula one terms -rrb- adrift of rosberg .
" i know where i lost those seven tenths , so i can handle it , " schumacher said .
" but of course it 's a pity .
nico has a well set-up car , and he got the best out of it , and obviously i would have liked to achieve the same .
i shall try to do so in the race tomorrow . "
so far , either through reliability problems or a lack of speed , the highly anticipated return of schumacher to f1 after three years away has not delivered impressive results - with qualifying pace arguably his biggest problem .
sutil impresses again germany 's other strong qualifier was adrian sutil , driving for the relatively small force india team .
the 27-year old , who has never scored a top three finish in his career , starts just behind f1 's most successful driver schumacher in tenth position .
sutil has been in the top ten at the start of every race this year , by far the best performance of his career to date , but the other cars ahead of him are likely to prove too strong in the race on sunday .
the mclaren drivers jenson button and lewis hamilton - who were tipped to shine in shanghai - line up fifth and sixth , ferrari 's felipe massa starts seventh , and robert kubica grabbed eighth place for renault .
germany 's rookie nico hulkenberg is a rather disappointing sixteenth on the grid for williams , with countryman timo glock nineteenth in his virgin racing car .
glock wins the dubious honor , once again , of being the fastest driver at any of formula one 's three new teams - all of whom have been well adrift of the rest of the field so far this season .

more than 20 countries have closed their airspace with some countries calling off all flights until monday morning . european flights remained grounded on saturday due to a vast cloud of volcanic ash from iceland that has covered much of europe and has spread as far east as russia .
britain , ireland , switzerland , and belgium all extended their flight bans on saturday .
more than 20 european countries grounded flights because of the ash cloud .
the disruption hit german chancellor angela merkel who was trying to return to berlin from the united states on friday when her plane was diverted to lisbon .
she flew to rome on saturday , having to spend the night in italy . the chancellor will therefore be unable to attend the funeral of polish president lech kaczynski on sunday .
in addition , flights bringing home the bodies of german soldiers killed in afghanistan along with soldiers wounded in the country were redirected to turkey .
bildunterschrift : the last time the volcano erupted , in the 19th century , it continued sporadically for over a year things could get worse volcanic ash can terminally damage the engines and windows of jetliners .
the national air traffic services , which oversees british airspace , said the situation from the cloud is getting worse . experts tracking the volcano beneath the eyjafjallajokull glacier said there were no signs of reduced activity on friday .
after a relatively minor eruption one month ago , the volcano erupted again on wednesday , with these two incidents breaking almost 200 years of dormancy .
that last recorded eruption continued - with varying levels of severity and intermittent periods of inactivity - for almost 18 months between 1821 and 1823 .
" we have no prediction on how long -lsb- the eruption -rsb- will last , " said geophysicist bergthora thorbjnardottir at the iceland meteorological office .
hundreds of thousands stranded westerly and north-westerly winds have blown the ash across swathes of northern and central europe , grounding some 17,000 flights on friday , after around 6,000 were cancelled on thursday .
the disruption is costing airlines over 148 million euros -lrb- $ 200 million -rrb- per day .
currently , only emergency flights are permitted into and out of the affected regions in europe .
all 16 international airports in germany were closed on saturday with no flights set to take off until at least 2pm on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : train operators and others are getting extra business germany 's national rail service , deutsche bahn , has reported a surge in demand as travellers look for another way to reach their destination .
" we have a lot more people booking tickets , and are putting every train at our disposal into action , " a bahn spokesman told german public broadcaster ard .
" everything that can run is running . "
the eurostar train service linking britain and mainland europe via the channel tunnel is fully booked , with the company reporting 38,000 travelers on friday , 10,000 more than average .
international coach services also claimed to be running at five times their usual capacity due to a surge in demand .
rental car companies reported a similar phenomenon , with some passengers even electing to drive long journeys to foreign destinations .
