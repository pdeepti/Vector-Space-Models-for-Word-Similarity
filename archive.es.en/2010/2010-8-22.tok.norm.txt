supporters say a dirty tricks campaign is underway after the publication of classified documents . authorities in sweden withdrew the arrest warrant over alleged rape for wikileaks founder julian assange the day after it was issued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pentagon warns that wikileaks data could endanger soldiers in afghanistan " as far as i am concerned there are no longer any grounds to suspect that he committed rape , " chief prosecutor eva finne said on saturday , august 21 .
the swedish prosecution authority said that assange was still being investigated on suspicion of molestation , but that he was no longer wanted by police .
the whistle-blowing website wikileaks came to prominence in july after publishing thousands of classified documents about the war in afghanistan .
the pentagon was enraged , saying that the information could put soldiers and their afghan helpers in danger .
the german isaf military official general brigadier josef blotz called the wikileaks actions " extremely irresponsible " and " basically a crime . "
' deeply disturbing ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden has some of the world 's toughest privacy laws in the world the arrest warrant was issued on friday after two women made allegations to swedish police .
assange told wikileaks ' twitter page the charges were " without basis " and described the timing of the allegations as " deeply disturbing . "
another twitter comment carried on the wikileaks website said , " we were warned to expect ' dirty tricks ' .
now we have the first one . "
the 39-year-old australian also rejected the accusations by e-mail , citing " dirty tricks " by those who were not happy with the publishing of sensitive documents .
assange was in sweden last week to defend his plans to publish more documents about the afghan war and its conduct by nato forces .
sweden has strict laws on protection of sources , and many of wikileaks ' web servers are based there .
the country ’ s pirate party , which campaigns for internet privacy , last week agreed to maintain wikileaks ’ servers in sweden .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical music -pipe- 22.08.2010 star violinist julia fischer impresses at the piano , too großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violinist julia fischer has a full concert schedule julia fischer wears many hats .
not only is she one of the most successful violinists in the world and the youngest professor in germany , but also a wife , mother - and accomplished pianist . in a dvd coming out this month on the decca label , julia fischer performs both the violin and the piano in the same concert , together with the junge deutsche philharmonie and conductor matthias pintscher . deutsche welle : ms fischer , you play the violin , you play the piano , you have a family and you 're a professor at a german music school - does your day have more than 24 hours or do you simply not sleep ? julia fischer : -lrb- laughs -rrb- neither .
of course , that sounds like a lot , but it 's different when you start your career as early as i did .
i 've been giving concerts since i was 11 , so it 's not so strange that i started teaching at 23 . as you say , your course was set early on .
your brother and your mother play the piano and you started off with the piano .
how did you become interested in playing the violin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer played the piano before learning the violin at the age of three , you do n't really become interested in something .
piano played a role from the very beginning ; it was just there in the living room .
and in the neighboring village , there was a good violin teacher , and my mother knew that .
she had sent her own piano students there to find out whether he really was as good as everyone said .
so she sent me to him for lessons and he really was a fantastic instructor .
that 's why , even though i was really young , i made progress quickly and my interest grew . but you never neglected the piano . no , not entirely .
i enjoyed playing it too much .
for me , it was a hobby , just like it is for other people .
and maybe i needed it as a kind of outlet - just making music without thinking about a particular goal .
that was just free time ; i could play and practice whatever i wanted . were you able to take anything from the piano and apply it to the violin - or were they completely separate for you ? no , they go hand in hand .
i started playing violin repertoire on the piano , for example .
i learned the piano part to the brahms -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , and from the beethoven -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , too .
that gave me a completely different perspective and helped me a lot as far as learning the harmonic and polyphonic structure of a work . i learned the piano works by the same composers -lsb- whose works i played on the violin -rsb- .
there are 10 violin sonatas by beethoven , but 32 for piano .
and i had played 12 of them before i learned the first sonata for violin .
that made a lot of things easier . this month , a new dvd is coming out showing a concert where you played saint-saens ' third violin concerto and grieg 's piano concerto .
that sounds like a challenge ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer received violin lessons at a very young age yes , it was .
that would be a challenge for anyone .
but it was a one-time thing .
i do n't think i 'll be doing that very often - especially not both instruments on the same day .
besides , it was kind of a way to save face - if i had only played the piano and it did n't go well , then the people would have had a bad concert . i thought , if i play the violin too , then at least half of the concert would be good . -lrb- laughs -rrb- the point was n't to prove that i could play both instruments on the same evening . was there a reason why you performed first on the violin , then on the piano ? it 's very difficult to play the violin after you 've played the piano because the violin requires more fine motor skills and less strength .
it takes less muscle work - that 's why the fine motor skills do n't work so well after playing the piano .
but , the other way around , playing the violin is a good way to warm up for playing the piano . you 're now a mother , as well as a musician .
how do you manage it all ? how to combine family and career is a question that a lot of people ask .
not just me .
fortunately , it 's very easy for me to combine them in my family .

the german interior minister said the trainers , who instruct 5,000 police recruits a year , could stay in the country beyond 2014 . after responsibility for security is handed over to afghan police and soldiers in 2014 , german police trainers will continue to teach local recruits .
" that seems to me to be in tune with the sustainability of our current engagement , " german interior minister thomas de maiziere told the dpa news agency .
" but whether three , five , twenty or another number of police trainers will stay in afghanistan , i ca n't yet say . "
in july , afghan president harmid karzai told international diplomats at a conference that 2014 was the date when afghans " will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country . "
it is a non-binding date , but has been seized upon by western politicians facing electorates at home who are increasingly opposed to sending soldiers to fight an increasingly powerful taliban insurgency for a national government plagued by high levels of corruption .
corruption is a problem de maiziere said he could imagine that german trainers would handle officer training after the official handover of security .
by the afghan police force should number 134,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german experts have been working with their afghan colleagues since 2002 german police train around 5,000 afghans a year .
the interior minister said that there were widespread problems of corruption in the afghan state .
" a police force can only win authority in a country if it is free of corruption , " de maiziere said , adding that the same applies to the government .
germany has been working to help train afghan police recruits for eight years as part of the eupol project .
this year , the number of german police trainers rose from 170 to 250 .
tense security situation the new regional commander of the international security assistance force in northern afghanistan , german major general hans-werner fritz , says the deployment in the area is " reaching a kind of culmination . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf troops have faced a challenging few months the security situation has gotten more tense over the last few months , fritz told the german paper " welt am sonntag , " but added that he was confident about making progress in the north of the country .
" i can see that we have come on in terms of stabilization and reconstruction , " he said , stressing that it was important to keep both the military and civilian components of the afghanistan mission in mind .
german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg shared that opinion , saying the situation in parts of the country where german troops are stationed had gotten dramatically tougher .
he said the taliban has strengthened their positions in the north and even penetrated into formerly peaceful areas such as kunduz .
he stressed , however , that in other areas the security situation was showing some improvement .
the ferocity of the war has been intensifying since the united states began deploying an extra 30,000 troops as part of president barack obama 's surge in support of a counter-insurgency campaign aimed at speeding an end to the conflict .
germany has some 4,000 troops serving in afghanistan .

the german interior minister said the trainers , who instruct 5,000 police recruits a year , could stay in the country beyond 2014 . after responsibility for security is handed over to afghan police and soldiers in 2014 , german police trainers will continue to teach local recruits .
" that seems to me to be in tune with the sustainability of our current engagement , " german interior minister thomas de maiziere told the dpa news agency .
" but whether three , five , twenty or another number of police trainers will stay in afghanistan , i ca n't yet say . "
in july , afghan president harmid karzai told international diplomats at a conference that 2014 was the date when afghans " will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country . "
it is a non-binding date , but has been seized upon by western politicians facing electorates at home who are increasingly opposed to sending soldiers to fight an increasingly powerful taliban insurgency for a national government plagued by high levels of corruption .
corruption is a problem de maiziere said he could imagine that german trainers would handle officer training after the official handover of security .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german experts have been working with their afghan colleagues since 2002 german police train around 5,000 afghans a year .
the interior minister said that there were widespread problems of corruption in the afghan state .
" a police force can only win authority in a country if it is free of corruption , " de maiziere said , adding that the same applies to the government .
germany has been working to help train afghan police recruits for eight years as part of the eupol project .
this year , the number of german police trainers rose from 170 to 250 .
tense security situation the new regional commander of the international security assistance force in northern afghanistan , german major general hans-werner fritz , says the deployment in the area is " reaching a kind of culmination . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf troops have faced a challenging few months the security situation has gotten more tense over the last few months , fritz told the german paper " welt am sonntag , " but added that he was confident about making progress in the north of the country .
" i can see that we have come on in terms of stabilization and reconstruction , " he said , stressing that it was important to keep both the military and civilian components of the afghanistan mission in mind .
german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg shared that opinion , saying the situation in parts of the country where german troops are stationed had gotten dramatically tougher .
he said the taliban has strengthened their positions in the north and even penetrated into formerly peaceful areas such as kunduz .
he stressed , however , that in other areas the security situation was showing some improvement .
the ferocity of the war has been intensifying since the united states began deploying an extra 30,000 troops as part of president barack obama 's surge in support of a counter-insurgency campaign aimed at speeding an end to the conflict .
germany has some 4,000 troops serving in afghanistan .

the german interior minister said the trainers , who instruct 5,000 police recruits a year , could stay in the country beyond 2014 . after responsibility for security is handed over to afghan police and soldiers in 2014 , german police trainers will continue to teach local recruits .
" that seems to me to be in tune with the sustainability of our current engagement , " german interior minister thomas de maiziere told the dpa news agency .
" but whether three , five , twenty or another number of police trainers will stay in afghanistan , i ca n't yet say . "
in july , afghan president harmid karzai told international diplomats at a conference that 2014 was the date when afghans " will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country . "
it is a non-binding date , but has been seized upon by western politicians facing electorates at home who are increasingly opposed to sending soldiers to fight an increasingly powerful taliban insurgency for a national government plagued by high levels of corruption .
corruption is a problem de maiziere said he could imagine that german trainers would handle officer training after the official handover of security .
by the afghan police force should number 134,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german experts have been working with their afghan colleagues since 2002 german police train around 5,000 afghans a year .
the interior minister said that there were widespread problems of corruption in the afghan state .
" a police force can only win authority in a country if it is free of corruption , " de maiziere said , adding that the same applies to the government .
germany has been working to help train afghan police recruits for eight years as part of the eupol project .
this year , the number of german police trainers rose from 170 to 250 .
tense security situation the new regional commander of the international security assistance force in northern afghanistan , german major general hans-werner fritz , says the deployment in the area is " reaching a kind of culmination . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf troops have faced a challenging few months the security situation has gotten more tense over the last few months , fritz told the german paper " welt am sonntag , " but added that he was confident about making progress in the north of the country .
" i can see that we have come on in terms of stabilization and reconstruction , " he said , stressing that it was important to keep both the military and civilian components of the afghanistan mission in mind .
german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg shared that opinion , saying the situation in parts of the country where german troops are stationed had gotten dramatically tougher .
he said the taliban has strengthened their positions in the north and even penetrated into formerly peaceful areas such as kunduz .
he stressed , however , that in other areas the security situation was showing some improvement .
the ferocity of the war has been intensifying since the united states began deploying an extra 30,000 troops as part of president barack obama 's surge in support of a counter-insurgency campaign aimed at speeding an end to the conflict .
germany has some 4,000 troops serving in afghanistan .

not only is she one of the most successful violinists in the world and the youngest professor in germany , but also a wife , mother - and accomplished pianist . in a dvd coming out this month on the decca label , julia fischer performs both the violin and the piano in the same concert , together with the junge deutsche philharmonie and conductor matthias pintscher . deutsche welle : ms fischer , you play the violin , you play the piano , you have a family and you 're a professor at a german music school - does your day have more than 24 hours or do you simply not sleep ? julia fischer : -lrb- laughs -rrb- neither .
of course , that sounds like a lot , but it 's different when you start your career as early as i did .
i 've been giving concerts since i was 11 , so it 's not so strange that i started teaching at 23 . as you say , your course was set early on .
your brother and your mother play the piano and you started off with the piano .
how did you become interested in playing the violin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer played the piano before learning the violin at the age of three , you do n't really become interested in something .
piano played a role from the very beginning ; it was just there in the living room .
and in the neighboring village , there was a good violin teacher , and my mother knew that .
she had sent her own piano students there to find out whether he really was as good as everyone said .
so she sent me to him for lessons and he really was a fantastic instructor .
that 's why , even though i was really young , i made progress quickly and my interest grew . but you never neglected the piano . no , not entirely .
i enjoyed playing it too much .
for me , it was a hobby , just like it is for other people .
and maybe i needed it as a kind of outlet - just making music without thinking about a particular goal .
that was just free time ; i could play and practice whatever i wanted . were you able to take anything from the piano and apply it to the violin - or were they completely separate for you ? no , they go hand in hand .
i started playing violin repertoire on the piano , for example .
i learned the piano part to the brahms -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , and from the beethoven -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , too .
that gave me a completely different perspective and helped me a lot as far as learning the harmonic and polyphonic structure of a work . i learned the piano works by the same composers -lsb- whose works i played on the violin -rsb- .
there are 10 violin sonatas by beethoven , but 32 for piano .
and i had played 12 of them before i learned the first sonata for violin .
that made a lot of things easier . this month , a new dvd is coming out showing a concert where you played saint-saens ' third violin concerto and grieg 's piano concerto .
that sounds like a challenge ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer received violin lessons at a very young age yes , it was .
that would be a challenge for anyone .
but it was a one-time thing .
i do n't think i 'll be doing that very often - especially not both instruments on the same day .
besides , it was kind of a way to save face - if i had only played the piano and it did n't go well , then the people would have had a bad concert . i thought , if i play the violin too , then at least half of the concert would be good . -lrb- laughs -rrb- the point was n't to prove that i could play both instruments on the same evening . was there a reason why you performed first on the violin , then on the piano ? it 's very difficult to play the violin after you 've played the piano because the violin requires more fine motor skills and less strength .
it takes less muscle work - that 's why the fine motor skills do n't work so well after playing the piano .
but , the other way around , playing the violin is a good way to warm up for playing the piano . you 're now a mother , as well as a musician .
how do you manage it all ? how to combine family and career is a question that a lot of people ask .
not just me .
fortunately , it 's very easy for me to combine them in my family .
i think people have the most problems when they 're not able to clearly define their priorities and do n't make clear how important their career is and how important their family is .
once you 've cleared that up , you do n't have any moral conflicts .
to be a balanced person , you have to recognize what 's important . interview : bjorn woll -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

supporters say a dirty tricks campaign is underway after the publication of classified documents . authorities in sweden withdrew the arrest warrant over alleged rape for wikileaks founder julian assange the day after it was issued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pentagon warns that wikileaks data could endanger soldiers in afghanistan " as far as i am concerned there are no longer any grounds to suspect that he committed rape , " chief prosecutor eva finne said on saturday , august 21 .
the swedish prosecution authority said that assange was still being investigated on suspicion of molestation , but that he was no longer wanted by police .
the whistle-blowing website wikileaks came to prominence in july after publishing thousands of classified documents about the war in afghanistan .
the pentagon was enraged , saying that the information could put soldiers and their afghan helpers in danger .
the german isaf military official general brigadier josef blotz called the wikileaks actions " extremely irresponsible " and " basically a crime . "
' deeply disturbing ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden has some of the world 's toughest privacy laws in the world the arrest warrant was issued on friday after two women made allegations to swedish police .
assange told wikileaks ' twitter page the charges were " without basis " and described the timing of the allegations as " deeply disturbing . "
another twitter comment carried on the wikileaks website said , " we were warned to expect ' dirty tricks ' .
now we have the first one . "
the 39-year-old australian also rejected the accusations by e-mail , citing " dirty tricks " by those who were not happy with the publishing of sensitive documents .
assange was in sweden last week to defend his plans to publish more documents about the afghan war and its conduct by nato forces .
sweden has strict laws on protection of sources , and many of wikileaks ' web servers are based there .
the country ’ s pirate party , which campaigns for internet privacy , last week agreed to maintain wikileaks ’ servers in sweden .

supporters say a dirty tricks campaign is underway after the publication of classified documents . authorities in sweden withdrew the arrest warrant over alleged rape for wikileaks founder julian assange the day after it was issued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pentagon warns that wikileaks data could endanger soldiers in afghanistan " as far as i am concerned there are no longer any grounds to suspect that he committed rape , " chief prosecutor eva finne said on saturday , august 21 .
the swedish prosecution authority said that assange was still being investigated on suspicion of molestation , but that he was no longer wanted by police .
the whistle-blowing website wikileaks came to prominence in july after publishing thousands of classified documents about the war in afghanistan .
the pentagon was enraged , saying that the information could put soldiers and their afghan helpers in danger .
the german isaf military official general brigadier josef blotz called the wikileaks actions " extremely irresponsible " and " basically a crime . "
' deeply disturbing ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden has some of the world 's toughest privacy laws in the world the arrest warrant was issued on friday after two women made allegations to swedish police .
assange told wikileaks ' twitter page the charges were " without basis " and described the timing of the allegations as " deeply disturbing . "
another twitter comment carried on the wikileaks website said , " we were warned to expect ' dirty tricks ' .
now we have the first one . "
the 39-year-old australian also rejected the accusations by e-mail , citing " dirty tricks " by those who were not happy with the publishing of sensitive documents .
assange was in sweden last week to defend his plans to publish more documents about the afghan war and its conduct by nato forces .
sweden has strict laws on protection of sources , and many of wikileaks ' web servers are based there .
the country ’ s pirate party , which campaigns for internet privacy , last week agreed to maintain wikileaks ’ servers in sweden .

" it is important that , along with the critics of nuclear energy , we also hear from those who believe -lsb- nuclear energy -rsb- to be an essential bridge technology for some time to come , " merkel said in an interview for the bild am sonntag weekly newspaper , which was published on sunday , august 22 .
the christian democrat leader wants nuclear operators to pay the tax in exchange for an extension of the lifetimes of the country 's nuclear plants , which are scheduled to cease operating in 2020 .
" we want energy in germany to be cleaner and more environmentally friendly , to be more secure , and to remain affordable for germans and the economy , " she said .
the german government will decide " on the question of energy supply for the coming decades and accordingly on the question of the prosperity of our country on the basis of comprehensive and rational debate , " merkel said .
open criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said both sides of the argument should be heard merkel 's comments come a day after a number of top managers and former politicians participated in an advertisement campaign , signing a protest letter that sharply criticized the planned tax on fuel rods .
among those involved were energy giants e.on , rwe and vattenfall , as well as industrial leaders basf , bayer , tyssenkrupp and germany 's largest bank , deutsche bank .
" a policy that consists of filling the budget by creating new energy taxes amounts to blocking important future investments , " the open letter said .
but environment minister norbert roettgen said there would be no going back on plans to tax power companies 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.9 billion -rrb- each year as part of government efforts to balance public finances .
on saturday , european union energy commissioner guenther oettinger threw his support behind the planned tax , calling on german nuclear energy providers to hand over at least half of the profits from extending the lifespan of their stations .
" it 's quite normal for nuclear groups to protest at the idea of a tax , but they should give the authorities a large part of the sizeable profits accruing from the -lrb- extended -rrb- operation of nuclear plants , " he said in an interview with daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung .
" i consider that at least 50 percent would be appropriate , " oettinger said .

" it is important that , along with the critics of nuclear energy , we also hear from those who believe -lsb- nuclear energy -rsb- to be an essential bridge technology for some time to come , " merkel said in an interview for the bild am sonntag weekly newspaper , which was published on sunday , august 22 .
the christian democrat leader wants nuclear operators to pay the tax in exchange for an extension of the lifetimes of the country 's nuclear plants , which are scheduled to cease operating in 2020 .
" we want energy in germany to be cleaner and more environmentally friendly , to be more secure , and to remain affordable for germans and the economy , " she said .
the german government will decide " on the question of energy supply for the coming decades and accordingly on the question of the prosperity of our country on the basis of comprehensive and rational debate , " merkel said .
open criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said both sides of the argument should be heard merkel 's comments come a day after a number of top managers and former politicians participated in an advertisement campaign , signing a protest letter that sharply criticized the planned tax on fuel rods .
among those involved were energy giants e.on , rwe and vattenfall , as well as industrial leaders basf , bayer , tyssenkrupp and germany 's largest bank , deutsche bank .
" a policy that consists of filling the budget by creating new energy taxes amounts to blocking important future investments , " the open letter said .
but environment minister norbert roettgen said there would be no going back on plans to tax power companies 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.9 billion -rrb- each year as part of government efforts to balance public finances .
on saturday , european union energy commissioner guenther oettinger threw his support behind the planned tax , calling on german nuclear energy providers to hand over at least half of the profits from extending the lifespan of their stations .
" it 's quite normal for nuclear groups to protest at the idea of a tax , but they should give the authorities a large part of the sizeable profits accruing from the -lrb- extended -rrb- operation of nuclear plants , " he said in an interview with daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung .
" i consider that at least 50 percent would be appropriate , " oettinger said .

" i consider that at least 50 percent would be appropriate , " oettinger said .

not only is she one of the most successful violinists in the world and the youngest professor in germany , but also a wife , mother - and accomplished pianist . in a dvd coming out this month on the decca label , julia fischer performs both the violin and the piano in the same concert , together with the junge deutsche philharmonie and conductor matthias pintscher . deutsche welle : ms fischer , you play the violin , you play the piano , you have a family and you 're a professor at a german music school - does your day have more than 24 hours or do you simply not sleep ? julia fischer : -lrb- laughs -rrb- neither .
of course , that sounds like a lot , but it 's different when you start your career as early as i did .
i 've been giving concerts since i was 11 , so it 's not so strange that i started teaching at 23 . as you say , your course was set early on .
your brother and your mother play the piano and you started off with the piano .
how did you become interested in playing the violin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer played the piano before learning the violin at the age of three , you do n't really become interested in something .
piano played a role from the very beginning ; it was just there in the living room .
and in the neighboring village , there was a good violin teacher , and my mother knew that .
she had sent her own piano students there to find out whether he really was as good as everyone said .
so she sent me to him for lessons and he really was a fantastic instructor .
that 's why , even though i was really young , i made progress quickly and my interest grew . but you never neglected the piano . no , not entirely .
i enjoyed playing it too much .
for me , it was a hobby , just like it is for other people .
and maybe i needed it as a kind of outlet - just making music without thinking about a particular goal .
that was just free time ; i could play and practice whatever i wanted . were you able to take anything from the piano and apply it to the violin - or were they completely separate for you ? no , they go hand in hand .
i started playing violin repertoire on the piano , for example .
i learned the piano part to the brahms -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , and from the beethoven -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , too .
that gave me a completely different perspective and helped me a lot as far as learning the harmonic and polyphonic structure of a work . i learned the piano works by the same composers -lsb- whose works i played on the violin -rsb- .
there are 10 violin sonatas by beethoven , but 32 for piano .
and i had played 12 of them before i learned the first sonata for violin .
that made a lot of things easier . this month , a new dvd is coming out showing a concert where you played saint-saens ' third violin concerto and grieg 's piano concerto .
that sounds like a challenge ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer received violin lessons at a very young age yes , it was .
that would be a challenge for anyone .
but it was a one-time thing .
i do n't think i 'll be doing that very often - especially not both instruments on the same day .
besides , it was kind of a way to save face - if i had only played the piano and it did n't go well , then the people would have had a bad concert . i thought , if i play the violin too , then at least half of the concert would be good . -lrb- laughs -rrb- the point was n't to prove that i could play both instruments on the same evening . was there a reason why you performed first on the violin , then on the piano ? it 's very difficult to play the violin after you 've played the piano because the violin requires more fine motor skills and less strength .
it takes less muscle work - that 's why the fine motor skills do n't work so well after playing the piano .
but , the other way around , playing the violin is a good way to warm up for playing the piano . you 're now a mother , as well as a musician .
how do you manage it all ? how to combine family and career is a question that a lot of people ask .
not just me .
fortunately , it 's very easy for me to combine them in my family .
i think people have the most problems when they 're not able to clearly define their priorities and do n't make clear how important their career is and how important their family is .
once you 've cleared that up , you do n't have any moral conflicts .
to be a balanced person , you have to recognize what 's important . interview : bjorn woll -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is important that , along with the critics of nuclear energy , we also hear from those who believe -lsb- nuclear energy -rsb- to be an essential bridge technology for some time to come , " merkel said in an interview for the bild am sonntag weekly newspaper , which was published on sunday , august 22 .
the christian democrat leader wants nuclear operators to pay the tax in exchange for an extension of the lifetimes of the country 's nuclear plants , which are scheduled to cease operating in 2020 .
" we want energy in germany to be cleaner and more environmentally friendly , to be more secure , and to remain affordable for germans and the economy , " she said .
the german government will decide " on the question of energy supply for the coming decades and accordingly on the question of the prosperity of our country on the basis of comprehensive and rational debate , " merkel said .
open criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said both sides of the argument should be heard merkel 's comments come a day after a number of top managers and former politicians participated in an advertisement campaign , signing a protest letter that sharply criticized the planned tax on fuel rods .
among those involved were energy giants e.on , rwe and vattenfall , as well as industrial leaders basf , bayer , tyssenkrupp and germany 's largest bank , deutsche bank .
" a policy that consists of filling the budget by creating new energy taxes amounts to blocking important future investments , " the open letter said .
but environment minister norbert roettgen said there would be no going back on plans to tax power companies 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.9 billion -rrb- each year as part of government efforts to balance public finances .
on saturday , european union energy commissioner guenther oettinger threw his support behind the planned tax , calling on german nuclear energy providers to hand over at least half of the profits from extending the lifespan of their stations .
" it 's quite normal for nuclear groups to protest at the idea of a tax , but they should give the authorities a large part of the sizeable profits accruing from the -lrb- extended -rrb- operation of nuclear plants , " he said in an interview with daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung .
" i consider that at least 50 percent would be appropriate , " oettinger said .

" it is important that , along with the critics of nuclear energy , we also hear from those who believe -lsb- nuclear energy -rsb- to be an essential bridge technology for some time to come , " merkel said in an interview for the bild am sonntag weekly newspaper , which was published on sunday , august 22 .
the christian democrat leader wants nuclear operators to pay the tax in exchange for an extension of the lifetimes of the country 's nuclear plants , which are scheduled to cease operating in 2020 .
" we want energy in germany to be cleaner and more environmentally friendly , to be more secure , and to remain affordable for germans and the economy , " she said .
the german government will decide " on the question of energy supply for the coming decades and accordingly on the question of the prosperity of our country on the basis of comprehensive and rational debate , " merkel said .
open criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said both sides of the argument should be heard merkel 's comments come a day after a number of top managers and former politicians participated in an advertisement campaign , signing a protest letter that sharply criticized the planned tax on fuel rods .
among those involved were energy giants e.on , rwe and vattenfall , as well as industrial leaders basf , bayer , tyssenkrupp and germany 's largest bank , deutsche bank .
" a policy that consists of filling the budget by creating new energy taxes amounts to blocking important future investments , " the open letter said .
but environment minister norbert roettgen said there would be no going back on plans to tax power companies 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.9 billion -rrb- each year as part of government efforts to balance public finances .
on saturday , european union energy commissioner guenther oettinger threw his support behind the planned tax , calling on german nuclear energy providers to hand over at least half of the profits from extending the lifespan of their stations .
" it 's quite normal for nuclear groups to protest at the idea of a tax , but they should give the authorities a large part of the sizeable profits accruing from the -lrb- extended -rrb- operation of nuclear plants , " he said in an interview with daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung .
" i consider that at least 50 percent would be appropriate , " oettinger said .

not only is she one of the most successful violinists in the world and the youngest professor in germany , but also a wife , mother - and accomplished pianist . in a dvd coming out this month on the decca label , julia fischer performs both the violin and the piano in the same concert , together with the junge deutsche philharmonie and conductor matthias pintscher . deutsche welle : ms fischer , you play the violin , you play the piano , you have a family and you 're a professor at a german music school - does your day have more than 24 hours or do you simply not sleep ? julia fischer : -lrb- laughs -rrb- neither .
of course , that sounds like a lot , but it 's different when you start your career as early as i did .
i 've been giving concerts since i was 11 , so it 's not so strange that i started teaching at 23 . as you say , your course was set early on .
your brother and your mother play the piano and you started off with the piano .
how did you become interested in playing the violin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer played the piano before learning the violin at the age of three , you do n't really become interested in something .
piano played a role from the very beginning ; it was just there in the living room .
and in the neighboring village , there was a good violin teacher , and my mother knew that .
she had sent her own piano students there to find out whether he really was as good as everyone said .
so she sent me to him for lessons and he really was a fantastic instructor .
that 's why , even though i was really young , i made progress quickly and my interest grew . but you never neglected the piano . no , not entirely .
i enjoyed playing it too much .
for me , it was a hobby , just like it is for other people .
and maybe i needed it as a kind of outlet - just making music without thinking about a particular goal .
that was just free time ; i could play and practice whatever i wanted . were you able to take anything from the piano and apply it to the violin - or were they completely separate for you ? no , they go hand in hand .
i started playing violin repertoire on the piano , for example .
i learned the piano part to the brahms -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , and from the beethoven -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , too .
that gave me a completely different perspective and helped me a lot as far as learning the harmonic and polyphonic structure of a work . i learned the piano works by the same composers -lsb- whose works i played on the violin -rsb- .
there are 10 violin sonatas by beethoven , but 32 for piano .
and i had played 12 of them before i learned the first sonata for violin .
that made a lot of things easier . this month , a new dvd is coming out showing a concert where you played saint-saens ' third violin concerto and grieg 's piano concerto .
that sounds like a challenge ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer received violin lessons at a very young age yes , it was .
that would be a challenge for anyone .
but it was a one-time thing .
i do n't think i 'll be doing that very often - especially not both instruments on the same day .
besides , it was kind of a way to save face - if i had only played the piano and it did n't go well , then the people would have had a bad concert . i thought , if i play the violin too , then at least half of the concert would be good . -lrb- laughs -rrb- the point was n't to prove that i could play both instruments on the same evening . was there a reason why you performed first on the violin , then on the piano ? it 's very difficult to play the violin after you 've played the piano because the violin requires more fine motor skills and less strength .
it takes less muscle work - that 's why the fine motor skills do n't work so well after playing the piano .
but , the other way around , playing the violin is a good way to warm up for playing the piano . you 're now a mother , as well as a musician .
how do you manage it all ? how to combine family and career is a question that a lot of people ask .
not just me .
fortunately , it 's very easy for me to combine them in my family .
i think people have the most problems when they 're not able to clearly define their priorities and do n't make clear how important their career is and how important their family is .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical music -pipe- 22.08.2010 star violinist julia fischer impresses at the piano , too großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violinist julia fischer has a full concert schedule julia fischer wears many hats .
not only is she one of the most successful violinists in the world and the youngest professor in germany , but also a wife , mother - and accomplished pianist . in a dvd coming out this month on the decca label , julia fischer performs both the violin and the piano in the same concert , together with the junge deutsche philharmonie and conductor matthias pintscher . deutsche welle : ms fischer , you play the violin , you play the piano , you have a family and you 're a professor at a german music school - does your day have more than 24 hours or do you simply not sleep ? julia fischer : -lrb- laughs -rrb- neither .
of course , that sounds like a lot , but it 's different when you start your career as early as i did .
i 've been giving concerts since i was 11 , so it 's not so strange that i started teaching at 23 . as you say , your course was set early on .
your brother and your mother play the piano and you started off with the piano .
how did you become interested in playing the violin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer played the piano before learning the violin at the age of three , you do n't really become interested in something .
piano played a role from the very beginning ; it was just there in the living room .
and in the neighboring village , there was a good violin teacher , and my mother knew that .
she had sent her own piano students there to find out whether he really was as good as everyone said .
so she sent me to him for lessons and he really was a fantastic instructor .
that 's why , even though i was really young , i made progress quickly and my interest grew . but you never neglected the piano . no , not entirely .
i enjoyed playing it too much .
for me , it was a hobby , just like it is for other people .
and maybe i needed it as a kind of outlet - just making music without thinking about a particular goal .
that was just free time ; i could play and practice whatever i wanted . were you able to take anything from the piano and apply it to the violin - or were they completely separate for you ? no , they go hand in hand .
i started playing violin repertoire on the piano , for example .
i learned the piano part to the brahms -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , and from the beethoven -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , too .
that gave me a completely different perspective and helped me a lot as far as learning the harmonic and polyphonic structure of a work . i learned the piano works by the same composers -lsb- whose works i played on the violin -rsb- .
there are 10 violin sonatas by beethoven , but 32 for piano .
and i had played 12 of them before i learned the first sonata for violin .
that made a lot of things easier . this month , a new dvd is coming out showing a concert where you played saint-saens ' third violin concerto and grieg 's piano concerto .
that sounds like a challenge ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer received violin lessons at a very young age yes , it was .
that would be a challenge for anyone .
but it was a one-time thing .
i do n't think i 'll be doing that very often - especially not both instruments on the same day .
besides , it was kind of a way to save face - if i had only played the piano and it did n't go well , then the people would have had a bad concert . i thought , if i play the violin too , then at least half of the concert would be good . -lrb- laughs -rrb- the point was n't to prove that i could play both instruments on the same evening . was there a reason why you performed first on the violin , then on the piano ? it 's very difficult to play the violin after you 've played the piano because the violin requires more fine motor skills and less strength .
it takes less muscle work - that 's why the fine motor skills do n't work so well after playing the piano .
but , the other way around , playing the violin is a good way to warm up for playing the piano . you 're now a mother , as well as a musician .
how do you manage it all ? how to combine family and career is a question that a lot of people ask .
not just me .
fortunately , it 's very easy for me to combine them in my family .
i think people have the most problems when they 're not able to clearly define their priorities and do n't make clear how important their career is and how important their family is .
once you 've cleared that up , you do n't have any moral conflicts .
to be a balanced person , you have to recognize what 's important . interview : bjorn woll -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical music -pipe- 22.08.2010 star violinist julia fischer impresses at the piano , too großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violinist julia fischer has a full concert schedule julia fischer wears many hats .
not only is she one of the most successful violinists in the world and the youngest professor in germany , but also a wife , mother - and accomplished pianist . in a dvd coming out this month on the decca label , julia fischer performs both the violin and the piano in the same concert , together with the junge deutsche philharmonie and conductor matthias pintscher . deutsche welle : ms fischer , you play the violin , you play the piano , you have a family and you 're a professor at a german music school - does your day have more than 24 hours or do you simply not sleep ? julia fischer : -lrb- laughs -rrb- neither .
of course , that sounds like a lot , but it 's different when you start your career as early as i did .
i 've been giving concerts since i was 11 , so it 's not so strange that i started teaching at 23 . as you say , your course was set early on .
your brother and your mother play the piano and you started off with the piano .
how did you become interested in playing the violin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer played the piano before learning the violin at the age of three , you do n't really become interested in something .
piano played a role from the very beginning ; it was just there in the living room .
and in the neighboring village , there was a good violin teacher , and my mother knew that .
she had sent her own piano students there to find out whether he really was as good as everyone said .
so she sent me to him for lessons and he really was a fantastic instructor .
that 's why , even though i was really young , i made progress quickly and my interest grew . but you never neglected the piano . no , not entirely .
i enjoyed playing it too much .
for me , it was a hobby , just like it is for other people .
and maybe i needed it as a kind of outlet - just making music without thinking about a particular goal .
that was just free time ; i could play and practice whatever i wanted . were you able to take anything from the piano and apply it to the violin - or were they completely separate for you ? no , they go hand in hand .
i started playing violin repertoire on the piano , for example .
i learned the piano part to the brahms -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , and from the beethoven -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , too .
that gave me a completely different perspective and helped me a lot as far as learning the harmonic and polyphonic structure of a work . i learned the piano works by the same composers -lsb- whose works i played on the violin -rsb- .
there are 10 violin sonatas by beethoven , but 32 for piano .
and i had played 12 of them before i learned the first sonata for violin .
that made a lot of things easier . this month , a new dvd is coming out showing a concert where you played saint-saens ' third violin concerto and grieg 's piano concerto .
that sounds like a challenge ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer received violin lessons at a very young age yes , it was .
that would be a challenge for anyone .
but it was a one-time thing .
i do n't think i 'll be doing that very often - especially not both instruments on the same day .
besides , it was kind of a way to save face - if i had only played the piano and it did n't go well , then the people would have had a bad concert . i thought , if i play the violin too , then at least half of the concert would be good . -lrb- laughs -rrb- the point was n't to prove that i could play both instruments on the same evening . was there a reason why you performed first on the violin , then on the piano ? it 's very difficult to play the violin after you 've played the piano because the violin requires more fine motor skills and less strength .
it takes less muscle work - that 's why the fine motor skills do n't work so well after playing the piano .
but , the other way around , playing the violin is a good way to warm up for playing the piano . you 're now a mother , as well as a musician .
how do you manage it all ? how to combine family and career is a question that a lot of people ask .
not just me .
fortunately , it 's very easy for me to combine them in my family .
i think people have the most problems when they 're not able to clearly define their priorities and do n't make clear how important their career is and how important their family is .
once you 've cleared that up , you do n't have any moral conflicts .
to be a balanced person , you have to recognize what 's important . interview : bjorn woll -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

supporters say a dirty tricks campaign is underway after the publication of classified documents . authorities in sweden withdrew the arrest warrant over alleged rape for wikileaks founder julian assange the day after it was issued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pentagon warns that wikileaks data could endanger soldiers in afghanistan " as far as i am concerned there are no longer any grounds to suspect that he committed rape , " chief prosecutor eva finne said on saturday , august 21 .
the swedish prosecution authority said that assange was still being investigated on suspicion of molestation , but that he was no longer wanted by police .
the whistle-blowing website wikileaks came to prominence in july after publishing thousands of classified documents about the war in afghanistan .
the pentagon was enraged , saying that the information could put soldiers and their afghan helpers in danger .
the german isaf military official general brigadier josef blotz called the wikileaks actions " extremely irresponsible " and " basically a crime . "

another twitter comment carried on the wikileaks website said , " we were warned to expect ' dirty tricks ' .
now we have the first one . "
the 39-year-old australian also rejected the accusations by e-mail , citing " dirty tricks " by those who were not happy with the publishing of sensitive documents .
assange was in sweden last week to defend his plans to publish more documents about the afghan war and its conduct by nato forces .
sweden has strict laws on protection of sources , and many of wikileaks ' web servers are based there .
the country ’ s pirate party , which campaigns for internet privacy , last week agreed to maintain wikileaks ’ servers in sweden .

" it is important that , along with the critics of nuclear energy , we also hear from those who believe -lsb- nuclear energy -rsb- to be an essential bridge technology for some time to come , " merkel said in an interview for the bild am sonntag weekly newspaper , which was published on sunday , august 22 .

he said that schlingensief had had an immense influence on german-language film and theater . " provocation was not a rare part of his stylistic device , " neumann said .
" with this he sought to trigger controversy and irritation . " berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit said on saturday that " a major talent in theater has left the stage . " works remembered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 49-year-old spent time working in vienna meanwhile , the berlin academy of the arts , which recently assumed control of schlingeneif 's archived works and was planning a public exhibition with the artist , has spoken of the loss of a man who wove together the many fabrics of german society . schlingensief contained an " immensely explosive force , artistically and politically , " said the academy 's president , klaus staeck . " in all his works , beginning with his first cinematic attempts right up to his great opera stagings , it was about the exploration of the relationship between politics , art and society , " staeck said .
" and so we are now responsible for his archive , which has found a place in our academy . " life dedicated to controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlingensief 's productions , such as " parsifal , " were internationally recognized schlingensief made headlines after casting neo-nazi skinhead amateur actors in his rendition of shakespeare 's " hamlet , " burning an effigy of former israeli prime minister ariel sharon , and wearing a placard with the message " kill helmut kohl , " in reference to the former german chancellor . in vienna , schlingensief created a television show called " auslaender raus ! "
-lrb- " foreigners out ! " -rrb- which denounced the rise of populism and racism . the program was a send-up of the big brother reality tv show in which asylum seekers lived inside containers similar to those that deported jews during world war ii .
every week the public would vote to evict an asylum seeker not from the show , but from the country . in 1998 , schlingensief founded the political party " opportunity 2000 " and took part in national elections , asking people to vote for themselves . he also invited people to join an anti-chancellor swim in the then-chancellor helmut kohl 's holiday retreat in lake wolfgang in austria .
his aim was to cause the lake to overflow with six million people in it , the number representing germany 's unemployed at the time . author : darren mara -lrb- afp / dpa -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not only is she one of the most successful violinists in the world and the youngest professor in germany , but also a wife , mother - and accomplished pianist . in a dvd coming out this month on the decca label , julia fischer performs both the violin and the piano in the same concert , together with the junge deutsche philharmonie and conductor matthias pintscher . deutsche welle : ms fischer , you play the violin , you play the piano , you have a family and you 're a professor at a german music school - does your day have more than 24 hours or do you simply not sleep ? julia fischer : -lrb- laughs -rrb- neither .
of course , that sounds like a lot , but it 's different when you start your career as early as i did .
i 've been giving concerts since i was 11 , so it 's not so strange that i started teaching at 23 . as you say , your course was set early on .
your brother and your mother play the piano and you started off with the piano .
how did you become interested in playing the violin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer played the piano before learning the violin at the age of three , you do n't really become interested in something .
piano played a role from the very beginning ; it was just there in the living room .
and in the neighboring village , there was a good violin teacher , and my mother knew that .
she had sent her own piano students there to find out whether he really was as good as everyone said .
so she sent me to him for lessons and he really was a fantastic instructor .
that 's why , even though i was really young , i made progress quickly and my interest grew . but you never neglected the piano . no , not entirely .
i enjoyed playing it too much .
for me , it was a hobby , just like it is for other people .
and maybe i needed it as a kind of outlet - just making music without thinking about a particular goal .
that was just free time ; i could play and practice whatever i wanted . were you able to take anything from the piano and apply it to the violin - or were they completely separate for you ? no , they go hand in hand .
i started playing violin repertoire on the piano , for example .
i learned the piano part to the brahms -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , and from the beethoven -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , too .
that gave me a completely different perspective and helped me a lot as far as learning the harmonic and polyphonic structure of a work . i learned the piano works by the same composers -lsb- whose works i played on the violin -rsb- .
there are 10 violin sonatas by beethoven , but 32 for piano .
and i had played 12 of them before i learned the first sonata for violin .
that made a lot of things easier . this month , a new dvd is coming out showing a concert where you played saint-saens ' third violin concerto and grieg 's piano concerto .
that sounds like a challenge ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer received violin lessons at a very young age yes , it was .
that would be a challenge for anyone .
but it was a one-time thing .
i do n't think i 'll be doing that very often - especially not both instruments on the same day .
besides , it was kind of a way to save face - if i had only played the piano and it did n't go well , then the people would have had a bad concert . i thought , if i play the violin too , then at least half of the concert would be good . -lrb- laughs -rrb- the point was n't to prove that i could play both instruments on the same evening . was there a reason why you performed first on the violin , then on the piano ? it 's very difficult to play the violin after you 've played the piano because the violin requires more fine motor skills and less strength .
it takes less muscle work - that 's why the fine motor skills do n't work so well after playing the piano .
but , the other way around , playing the violin is a good way to warm up for playing the piano . you 're now a mother , as well as a musician .
how do you manage it all ? how to combine family and career is a question that a lot of people ask .
not just me .
fortunately , it 's very easy for me to combine them in my family .

not only is she one of the most successful violinists in the world and the youngest professor in germany , but also a wife , mother - and accomplished pianist . in a dvd coming out this month on the decca label , julia fischer performs both the violin and the piano in the same concert , together with the junge deutsche philharmonie and conductor matthias pintscher . deutsche welle : ms fischer , you play the violin , you play the piano , you have a family and you 're a professor at a german music school - does your day have more than 24 hours or do you simply not sleep ? julia fischer : -lrb- laughs -rrb- neither .
of course , that sounds like a lot , but it 's different when you start your career as early as i did .
i 've been giving concerts since i was 11 , so it 's not so strange that i started teaching at 23 . as you say , your course was set early on .
your brother and your mother play the piano and you started off with the piano .
how did you become interested in playing the violin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer played the piano before learning the violin at the age of three , you do n't really become interested in something .
piano played a role from the very beginning ; it was just there in the living room .
and in the neighboring village , there was a good violin teacher , and my mother knew that .
she had sent her own piano students there to find out whether he really was as good as everyone said .
so she sent me to him for lessons and he really was a fantastic instructor .
that 's why , even though i was really young , i made progress quickly and my interest grew . but you never neglected the piano . no , not entirely .
i enjoyed playing it too much .
for me , it was a hobby , just like it is for other people .
and maybe i needed it as a kind of outlet - just making music without thinking about a particular goal .
that was just free time ; i could play and practice whatever i wanted . were you able to take anything from the piano and apply it to the violin - or were they completely separate for you ? no , they go hand in hand .
i started playing violin repertoire on the piano , for example .
i learned the piano part to the brahms -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , and from the beethoven -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , too .
that gave me a completely different perspective and helped me a lot as far as learning the harmonic and polyphonic structure of a work . i learned the piano works by the same composers -lsb- whose works i played on the violin -rsb- .
there are 10 violin sonatas by beethoven , but 32 for piano .
and i had played 12 of them before i learned the first sonata for violin .
that made a lot of things easier . this month , a new dvd is coming out showing a concert where you played saint-saens ' third violin concerto and grieg 's piano concerto .
that sounds like a challenge ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer received violin lessons at a very young age yes , it was .
that would be a challenge for anyone .
but it was a one-time thing .
i do n't think i 'll be doing that very often - especially not both instruments on the same day .
besides , it was kind of a way to save face - if i had only played the piano and it did n't go well , then the people would have had a bad concert . i thought , if i play the violin too , then at least half of the concert would be good . -lrb- laughs -rrb- the point was n't to prove that i could play both instruments on the same evening . was there a reason why you performed first on the violin , then on the piano ? it 's very difficult to play the violin after you 've played the piano because the violin requires more fine motor skills and less strength .
it takes less muscle work - that 's why the fine motor skills do n't work so well after playing the piano .
but , the other way around , playing the violin is a good way to warm up for playing the piano . you 're now a mother , as well as a musician .
how do you manage it all ? how to combine family and career is a question that a lot of people ask .
not just me .
fortunately , it 's very easy for me to combine them in my family .
i think people have the most problems when they 're not able to clearly define their priorities and do n't make clear how important their career is and how important their family is .

not only is she one of the most successful violinists in the world and the youngest professor in germany , but also a wife , mother - and accomplished pianist . in a dvd coming out this month on the decca label , julia fischer performs both the violin and the piano in the same concert , together with the junge deutsche philharmonie and conductor matthias pintscher . deutsche welle : ms fischer , you play the violin , you play the piano , you have a family and you 're a professor at a german music school - does your day have more than 24 hours or do you simply not sleep ? julia fischer : -lrb- laughs -rrb- neither .
of course , that sounds like a lot , but it 's different when you start your career as early as i did .
i 've been giving concerts since i was 11 , so it 's not so strange that i started teaching at 23 . as you say , your course was set early on .
your brother and your mother play the piano and you started off with the piano .
how did you become interested in playing the violin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer played the piano before learning the violin at the age of three , you do n't really become interested in something .
piano played a role from the very beginning ; it was just there in the living room .
and in the neighboring village , there was a good violin teacher , and my mother knew that .
she had sent her own piano students there to find out whether he really was as good as everyone said .
so she sent me to him for lessons and he really was a fantastic instructor .
that 's why , even though i was really young , i made progress quickly and my interest grew . but you never neglected the piano . no , not entirely .
i enjoyed playing it too much .
for me , it was a hobby , just like it is for other people .
and maybe i needed it as a kind of outlet - just making music without thinking about a particular goal .
that was just free time ; i could play and practice whatever i wanted . were you able to take anything from the piano and apply it to the violin - or were they completely separate for you ? no , they go hand in hand .
i started playing violin repertoire on the piano , for example .
i learned the piano part to the brahms -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , and from the beethoven -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , too .
that gave me a completely different perspective and helped me a lot as far as learning the harmonic and polyphonic structure of a work . i learned the piano works by the same composers -lsb- whose works i played on the violin -rsb- .
there are 10 violin sonatas by beethoven , but 32 for piano .
and i had played 12 of them before i learned the first sonata for violin .
that made a lot of things easier . this month , a new dvd is coming out showing a concert where you played saint-saens ' third violin concerto and grieg 's piano concerto .
that sounds like a challenge ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer received violin lessons at a very young age yes , it was .
that would be a challenge for anyone .
but it was a one-time thing .
i do n't think i 'll be doing that very often - especially not both instruments on the same day .
besides , it was kind of a way to save face - if i had only played the piano and it did n't go well , then the people would have had a bad concert . i thought , if i play the violin too , then at least half of the concert would be good . -lrb- laughs -rrb- the point was n't to prove that i could play both instruments on the same evening . was there a reason why you performed first on the violin , then on the piano ? it 's very difficult to play the violin after you 've played the piano because the violin requires more fine motor skills and less strength .
it takes less muscle work - that 's why the fine motor skills do n't work so well after playing the piano .
but , the other way around , playing the violin is a good way to warm up for playing the piano . you 're now a mother , as well as a musician .
how do you manage it all ? how to combine family and career is a question that a lot of people ask .
not just me .
fortunately , it 's very easy for me to combine them in my family .
i think people have the most problems when they 're not able to clearly define their priorities and do n't make clear how important their career is and how important their family is .
once you 've cleared that up , you do n't have any moral conflicts .
to be a balanced person , you have to recognize what 's important . interview : bjorn woll -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said that schlingensief had had an immense influence on german-language film and theater . " provocation was not a rare part of his stylistic device , " neumann said .
" with this he sought to trigger controversy and irritation . " berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit said on saturday that " a major talent in theater has left the stage . " works remembered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 49-year-old spent time working in vienna meanwhile , the berlin academy of the arts , which recently assumed control of schlingeneif 's archived works and was planning a public exhibition with the artist , has spoken of the loss of a man who wove together the many fabrics of german society . schlingensief contained an " immensely explosive force , artistically and politically , " said the academy 's president , klaus staeck . " in all his works , beginning with his first cinematic attempts right up to his great opera stagings , it was about the exploration of the relationship between politics , art and society , " staeck said .
" and so we are now responsible for his archive , which has found a place in our academy .

in july , afghan president harmid karzai told international diplomats at a conference that 2014 was the date when afghans " will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country . "
it is a non-binding date , but has been seized upon by western politicians facing electorates at home who are increasingly opposed to sending soldiers to fight an increasingly powerful taliban insurgency for a national government plagued by high levels of corruption .

the whistle-blowing website wikileaks came to prominence in july after publishing thousands of classified documents about the war in afghanistan .

another twitter comment carried on the wikileaks website said , " we were warned to expect ' dirty tricks ' .

he said that schlingensief had had an immense influence on german-language film and theater . " provocation was not a rare part of his stylistic device , " neumann said .
" with this he sought to trigger controversy and irritation . " berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit said on saturday that " a major talent in theater has left the stage . " works remembered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 49-year-old spent time working in vienna meanwhile , the berlin academy of the arts , which recently assumed control of schlingeneif 's archived works and was planning a public exhibition with the artist , has spoken of the loss of a man who wove together the many fabrics of german society . schlingensief contained an " immensely explosive force , artistically and politically , " said the academy 's president , klaus staeck . " in all his works , beginning with his first cinematic attempts right up to his great opera stagings , it was about the exploration of the relationship between politics , art and society , " staeck said .
" and so we are now responsible for his archive , which has found a place in our academy . " life dedicated to controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlingensief 's productions , such as " parsifal , " were internationally recognized schlingensief made headlines after casting neo-nazi skinhead amateur actors in his rendition of shakespeare 's " hamlet , " burning an effigy of former israeli prime minister ariel sharon , and wearing a placard with the message " kill helmut kohl , " in reference to the former german chancellor . in vienna , schlingensief created a television show called " auslaender raus ! "
-lrb- " foreigners out ! " -rrb- which denounced the rise of populism and racism . the program was a send-up of the big brother reality tv show in which asylum seekers lived inside containers similar to those that deported jews during world war ii .
every week the public would vote to evict an asylum seeker not from the show , but from the country . in 1998 , schlingensief founded the political party " opportunity 2000 " and took part in national elections , asking people to vote for themselves . he also invited people to join an anti-chancellor swim in the then-chancellor helmut kohl 's holiday retreat in lake wolfgang in austria .
his aim was to cause the lake to overflow with six million people in it , the number representing germany 's unemployed at the time . author : darren mara -lrb- afp / dpa -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is important that , along with the critics of nuclear energy , we also hear from those who believe -lsb- nuclear energy -rsb- to be an essential bridge technology for some time to come , " merkel said in an interview for the bild am sonntag weekly newspaper , which was published on sunday , august 22 .
the christian democrat leader wants nuclear operators to pay the tax in exchange for an extension of the lifetimes of the country 's nuclear plants , which are scheduled to cease operating in 2020 .
" we want energy in germany to be cleaner and more environmentally friendly , to be more secure , and to remain affordable for germans and the economy , " she said .
the german government will decide " on the question of energy supply for the coming decades and accordingly on the question of the prosperity of our country on the basis of comprehensive and rational debate , " merkel said .
open criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said both sides of the argument should be heard merkel 's comments come a day after a number of top managers and former politicians participated in an advertisement campaign , signing a protest letter that sharply criticized the planned tax on fuel rods .
among those involved were energy giants e.on , rwe and vattenfall , as well as industrial leaders basf , bayer , tyssenkrupp and germany 's largest bank , deutsche bank .
" a policy that consists of filling the budget by creating new energy taxes amounts to blocking important future investments , " the open letter said .
but environment minister norbert roettgen said there would be no going back on plans to tax power companies 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.9 billion -rrb- each year as part of government efforts to balance public finances .
on saturday , european union energy commissioner guenther oettinger threw his support behind the planned tax , calling on german nuclear energy providers to hand over at least half of the profits from extending the lifespan of their stations .
" it 's quite normal for nuclear groups to protest at the idea of a tax , but they should give the authorities a large part of the sizeable profits accruing from the -lrb- extended -rrb- operation of nuclear plants , " he said in an interview with daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung .
" i consider that at least 50 percent would be appropriate , " oettinger said .

the bild am sonntag newspaper says that up to 800 million euros may be involved in the alleged evasion . a whistle-blower claims he has information showing 250 german companies are evading taxes by moving money to switzerland .
the informant has reported his alleged findings to german authorities , according to the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the newspaper said the data allegedly points to up to 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- stashed away in swiss banks .
the information was apparently e-mailed to the finance ministry in the southern state of baden-wuerttemberg .
willi staechele , the state finance minister , told the bild am sonntag " we are taking this e-mail seriously and are studying whether the data can legally be touched . "
in the past switzerland has reacted angrily to german purchases of stolen data about swiss bank accounts .

according to the newspaper , the anonymous whistle-blower claimed most of the 250 companies in question were from the telecommunications and real-estate sectors .

he said that schlingensief had had an immense influence on german-language film and theater . " provocation was not a rare part of his stylistic device , " neumann said .
" with this he sought to trigger controversy and irritation . " berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit said on saturday that " a major talent in theater has left the stage . " works remembered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 49-year-old spent time working in vienna meanwhile , the berlin academy of the arts , which recently assumed control of schlingeneif 's archived works and was planning a public exhibition with the artist , has spoken of the loss of a man who wove together the many fabrics of german society . schlingensief contained an " immensely explosive force , artistically and politically , " said the academy 's president , klaus staeck . " in all his works , beginning with his first cinematic attempts right up to his great opera stagings , it was about the exploration of the relationship between politics , art and society , " staeck said .
" and so we are now responsible for his archive , which has found a place in our academy . " life dedicated to controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlingensief 's productions , such as " parsifal , " were internationally recognized schlingensief made headlines after casting neo-nazi skinhead amateur actors in his rendition of shakespeare 's " hamlet , " burning an effigy of former israeli prime minister ariel sharon , and wearing a placard with the message " kill helmut kohl , " in reference to the former german chancellor . in vienna , schlingensief created a television show called " auslaender raus ! "
-lrb- " foreigners out ! " -rrb- which denounced the rise of populism and racism . the program was a send-up of the big brother reality tv show in which asylum seekers lived inside containers similar to those that deported jews during world war ii .
every week the public would vote to evict an asylum seeker not from the show , but from the country . in 1998 , schlingensief founded the political party " opportunity 2000 " and took part in national elections , asking people to vote for themselves . he also invited people to join an anti-chancellor swim in the then-chancellor helmut kohl 's holiday retreat in lake wolfgang in austria .
his aim was to cause the lake to overflow with six million people in it , the number representing germany 's unemployed at the time . author : darren mara -lrb- afp / dpa -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german interior minister said the trainers , who instruct 5,000 police recruits a year , could stay in the country beyond 2014 . after responsibility for security is handed over to afghan police and soldiers in 2014 , german police trainers will continue to teach local recruits .
" that seems to me to be in tune with the sustainability of our current engagement , " german interior minister thomas de maiziere told the dpa news agency .
" but whether three , five , twenty or another number of police trainers will stay in afghanistan , i ca n't yet say . "
in july , afghan president harmid karzai told international diplomats at a conference that 2014 was the date when afghans " will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country . "
it is a non-binding date , but has been seized upon by western politicians facing electorates at home who are increasingly opposed to sending soldiers to fight an increasingly powerful taliban insurgency for a national government plagued by high levels of corruption .
corruption is a problem de maiziere said he could imagine that german trainers would handle officer training after the official handover of security .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german experts have been working with their afghan colleagues since 2002 german police train around 5,000 afghans a year .
the interior minister said that there were widespread problems of corruption in the afghan state .
" a police force can only win authority in a country if it is free of corruption , " de maiziere said , adding that the same applies to the government .
germany has been working to help train afghan police recruits for eight years as part of the eupol project .
this year , the number of german police trainers rose from 170 to 250 .
tense security situation the new regional commander of the international security assistance force in northern afghanistan , german major general hans-werner fritz , says the deployment in the area is " reaching a kind of culmination . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf troops have faced a challenging few months the security situation has gotten more tense over the last few months , fritz told the german paper " welt am sonntag , " but added that he was confident about making progress in the north of the country .
" i can see that we have come on in terms of stabilization and reconstruction , " he said , stressing that it was important to keep both the military and civilian components of the afghanistan mission in mind .
german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg shared that opinion , saying the situation in parts of the country where german troops are stationed had gotten dramatically tougher .
he said the taliban has strengthened their positions in the north and even penetrated into formerly peaceful areas such as kunduz .
he stressed , however , that in other areas the security situation was showing some improvement .
the ferocity of the war has been intensifying since the united states began deploying an extra 30,000 troops as part of president barack obama 's surge in support of a counter-insurgency campaign aimed at speeding an end to the conflict .
germany has some 4,000 troops serving in afghanistan .

in july , afghan president harmid karzai told international diplomats at a conference that 2014 was the date when afghans " will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country . "
it is a non-binding date , but has been seized upon by western politicians facing electorates at home who are increasingly opposed to sending soldiers to fight an increasingly powerful taliban insurgency for a national government plagued by high levels of corruption .

" i can see that we have come on in terms of stabilization and reconstruction , " he said , stressing that it was important to keep both the military and civilian components of the afghanistan mission in mind .
german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg shared that opinion , saying the situation in parts of the country where german troops are stationed had gotten dramatically tougher .
he said the taliban has strengthened their positions in the north and even penetrated into formerly peaceful areas such as kunduz .
he stressed , however , that in other areas the security situation was showing some improvement .
the ferocity of the war has been intensifying since the united states began deploying an extra 30,000 troops as part of president barack obama 's surge in support of a counter-insurgency campaign aimed at speeding an end to the conflict .

he said that schlingensief had had an immense influence on german-language film and theater . " provocation was not a rare part of his stylistic device , " neumann said .
" with this he sought to trigger controversy and irritation . " berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit said on saturday that " a major talent in theater has left the stage . " works remembered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 49-year-old spent time working in vienna meanwhile , the berlin academy of the arts , which recently assumed control of schlingeneif 's archived works and was planning a public exhibition with the artist , has spoken of the loss of a man who wove together the many fabrics of german society . schlingensief contained an " immensely explosive force , artistically and politically , " said the academy 's president , klaus staeck . " in all his works , beginning with his first cinematic attempts right up to his great opera stagings , it was about the exploration of the relationship between politics , art and society , " staeck said .
" and so we are now responsible for his archive , which has found a place in our academy . " life dedicated to controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlingensief 's productions , such as " parsifal , " were internationally recognized schlingensief made headlines after casting neo-nazi skinhead amateur actors in his rendition of shakespeare 's " hamlet , " burning an effigy of former israeli prime minister ariel sharon , and wearing a placard with the message " kill helmut kohl , " in reference to the former german chancellor . in vienna , schlingensief created a television show called " auslaender raus ! "
-lrb- " foreigners out ! " -rrb- which denounced the rise of populism and racism . the program was a send-up of the big brother reality tv show in which asylum seekers lived inside containers similar to those that deported jews during world war ii .
every week the public would vote to evict an asylum seeker not from the show , but from the country . in 1998 , schlingensief founded the political party " opportunity 2000 " and took part in national elections , asking people to vote for themselves . he also invited people to join an anti-chancellor swim in the then-chancellor helmut kohl 's holiday retreat in lake wolfgang in austria .
his aim was to cause the lake to overflow with six million people in it , the number representing germany 's unemployed at the time . author : darren mara -lrb- afp / dpa -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 22.08.2010 merkel attempts to defuse dispute over planned nuclear tax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country 's nuclear plants are scheduled to go offline in 2020 as debate in germany intensifies over a planned tax on nuclear power plant operators , the country 's leader , angela merkel , steps in to try to ease the standoff between the government and the energy sector . german chancellor angela merkel has tried to defuse an ongoing row with the german energy industry over government plans to introduce a tax on nuclear power providers by striking a conciliatory tone .
" it is important that , along with the critics of nuclear energy , we also hear from those who believe -lsb- nuclear energy -rsb- to be an essential bridge technology for some time to come , " merkel said in an interview for the bild am sonntag weekly newspaper , which was published on sunday , august 22 .
the christian democrat leader wants nuclear operators to pay the tax in exchange for an extension of the lifetimes of the country 's nuclear plants , which are scheduled to cease operating in 2020 .
" we want energy in germany to be cleaner and more environmentally friendly , to be more secure , and to remain affordable for germans and the economy , " she said .
the german government will decide " on the question of energy supply for the coming decades and accordingly on the question of the prosperity of our country on the basis of comprehensive and rational debate , " merkel said .
open criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said both sides of the argument should be heard merkel 's comments come a day after a number of top managers and former politicians participated in an advertisement campaign , signing a protest letter that sharply criticized the planned tax on fuel rods .
among those involved were energy giants e.on , rwe and vattenfall , as well as industrial leaders basf , bayer , tyssenkrupp and germany 's largest bank , deutsche bank .
" a policy that consists of filling the budget by creating new energy taxes amounts to blocking important future investments , " the open letter said .
but environment minister norbert roettgen said there would be no going back on plans to tax power companies 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.9 billion -rrb- each year as part of government efforts to balance public finances .
on saturday , european union energy commissioner guenther oettinger threw his support behind the planned tax , calling on german nuclear energy providers to hand over at least half of the profits from extending the lifespan of their stations .
" it 's quite normal for nuclear groups to protest at the idea of a tax , but they should give the authorities a large part of the sizeable profits accruing from the -lrb- extended -rrb- operation of nuclear plants , " he said in an interview with daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung .
" i consider that at least 50 percent would be appropriate , " oettinger said .

" it is important that , along with the critics of nuclear energy , we also hear from those who believe -lsb- nuclear energy -rsb- to be an essential bridge technology for some time to come , " merkel said in an interview for the bild am sonntag weekly newspaper , which was published on sunday , august 22 .
the christian democrat leader wants nuclear operators to pay the tax in exchange for an extension of the lifetimes of the country 's nuclear plants , which are scheduled to cease operating in 2020 .
" we want energy in germany to be cleaner and more environmentally friendly , to be more secure , and to remain affordable for germans and the economy , " she said .
the german government will decide " on the question of energy supply for the coming decades and accordingly on the question of the prosperity of our country on the basis of comprehensive and rational debate , " merkel said .
open criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said both sides of the argument should be heard merkel 's comments come a day after a number of top managers and former politicians participated in an advertisement campaign , signing a protest letter that sharply criticized the planned tax on fuel rods .
among those involved were energy giants e.on , rwe and vattenfall , as well as industrial leaders basf , bayer , tyssenkrupp and germany 's largest bank , deutsche bank .
" a policy that consists of filling the budget by creating new energy taxes amounts to blocking important future investments , " the open letter said .
but environment minister norbert roettgen said there would be no going back on plans to tax power companies 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.9 billion -rrb- each year as part of government efforts to balance public finances .
on saturday , european union energy commissioner guenther oettinger threw his support behind the planned tax , calling on german nuclear energy providers to hand over at least half of the profits from extending the lifespan of their stations .
" it 's quite normal for nuclear groups to protest at the idea of a tax , but they should give the authorities a large part of the sizeable profits accruing from the -lrb- extended -rrb- operation of nuclear plants , " he said in an interview with daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung .
" i consider that at least 50 percent would be appropriate , " oettinger said .

the german interior minister said the trainers , who instruct 5,000 police recruits a year , could stay in the country beyond 2014 . after responsibility for security is handed over to afghan police and soldiers in 2014 , german police trainers will continue to teach local recruits .
" that seems to me to be in tune with the sustainability of our current engagement , " german interior minister thomas de maiziere told the dpa news agency .
" but whether three , five , twenty or another number of police trainers will stay in afghanistan , i ca n't yet say . "
in july , afghan president harmid karzai told international diplomats at a conference that 2014 was the date when afghans " will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country . "
it is a non-binding date , but has been seized upon by western politicians facing electorates at home who are increasingly opposed to sending soldiers to fight an increasingly powerful taliban insurgency for a national government plagued by high levels of corruption .
corruption is a problem de maiziere said he could imagine that german trainers would handle officer training after the official handover of security .
by the afghan police force should number 134,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german experts have been working with their afghan colleagues since 2002 german police train around 5,000 afghans a year .
the interior minister said that there were widespread problems of corruption in the afghan state .
" a police force can only win authority in a country if it is free of corruption , " de maiziere said , adding that the same applies to the government .
germany has been working to help train afghan police recruits for eight years as part of the eupol project .
this year , the number of german police trainers rose from 170 to 250 .
tense security situation the new regional commander of the international security assistance force in northern afghanistan , german major general hans-werner fritz , says the deployment in the area is " reaching a kind of culmination . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf troops have faced a challenging few months the security situation has gotten more tense over the last few months , fritz told the german paper " welt am sonntag , " but added that he was confident about making progress in the north of the country .
" i can see that we have come on in terms of stabilization and reconstruction , " he said , stressing that it was important to keep both the military and civilian components of the afghanistan mission in mind .
german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg shared that opinion , saying the situation in parts of the country where german troops are stationed had gotten dramatically tougher .
he said the taliban has strengthened their positions in the north and even penetrated into formerly peaceful areas such as kunduz .
he stressed , however , that in other areas the security situation was showing some improvement .
the ferocity of the war has been intensifying since the united states began deploying an extra 30,000 troops as part of president barack obama 's surge in support of a counter-insurgency campaign aimed at speeding an end to the conflict .
germany has some 4,000 troops serving in afghanistan .

he said that schlingensief had had an immense influence on german-language film and theater . " provocation was not a rare part of his stylistic device , " neumann said .
" with this he sought to trigger controversy and irritation . " berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit said on saturday that " a major talent in theater has left the stage . " works remembered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 49-year-old spent time working in vienna meanwhile , the berlin academy of the arts , which recently assumed control of schlingeneif 's archived works and was planning a public exhibition with the artist , has spoken of the loss of a man who wove together the many fabrics of german society . schlingensief contained an " immensely explosive force , artistically and politically , " said the academy 's president , klaus staeck . " in all his works , beginning with his first cinematic attempts right up to his great opera stagings , it was about the exploration of the relationship between politics , art and society , " staeck said .
" and so we are now responsible for his archive , which has found a place in our academy . " life dedicated to controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlingensief 's productions , such as " parsifal , " were internationally recognized schlingensief made headlines after casting neo-nazi skinhead amateur actors in his rendition of shakespeare 's " hamlet , " burning an effigy of former israeli prime minister ariel sharon , and wearing a placard with the message " kill helmut kohl , " in reference to the former german chancellor . in vienna , schlingensief created a television show called " auslaender raus ! "
-lrb- " foreigners out ! " -rrb- which denounced the rise of populism and racism . the program was a send-up of the big brother reality tv show in which asylum seekers lived inside containers similar to those that deported jews during world war ii .
every week the public would vote to evict an asylum seeker not from the show , but from the country . in 1998 , schlingensief founded the political party " opportunity 2000 " and took part in national elections , asking people to vote for themselves . he also invited people to join an anti-chancellor swim in the then-chancellor helmut kohl 's holiday retreat in lake wolfgang in austria .
his aim was to cause the lake to overflow with six million people in it , the number representing germany 's unemployed at the time . author : darren mara -lrb- afp / dpa -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said that schlingensief had had an immense influence on german-language film and theater . " provocation was not a rare part of his stylistic device , " neumann said .
" with this he sought to trigger controversy and irritation . " berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit said on saturday that " a major talent in theater has left the stage . " works remembered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 49-year-old spent time working in vienna meanwhile , the berlin academy of the arts , which recently assumed control of schlingeneif 's archived works and was planning a public exhibition with the artist , has spoken of the loss of a man who wove together the many fabrics of german society . schlingensief contained an " immensely explosive force , artistically and politically , " said the academy 's president , klaus staeck . " in all his works , beginning with his first cinematic attempts right up to his great opera stagings , it was about the exploration of the relationship between politics , art and society , " staeck said .
" and so we are now responsible for his archive , which has found a place in our academy . " life dedicated to controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlingensief 's productions , such as " parsifal , " were internationally recognized schlingensief made headlines after casting neo-nazi skinhead amateur actors in his rendition of shakespeare 's " hamlet , " burning an effigy of former israeli prime minister ariel sharon , and wearing a placard with the message " kill helmut kohl , " in reference to the former german chancellor . in vienna , schlingensief created a television show called " auslaender raus ! "
-lrb- " foreigners out ! " -rrb- which denounced the rise of populism and racism . the program was a send-up of the big brother reality tv show in which asylum seekers lived inside containers similar to those that deported jews during world war ii .
every week the public would vote to evict an asylum seeker not from the show , but from the country . in 1998 , schlingensief founded the political party " opportunity 2000 " and took part in national elections , asking people to vote for themselves . he also invited people to join an anti-chancellor swim in the then-chancellor helmut kohl 's holiday retreat in lake wolfgang in austria .
his aim was to cause the lake to overflow with six million people in it , the number representing germany 's unemployed at the time . author : darren mara -lrb- afp / dpa -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

supporters say a dirty tricks campaign is underway after the publication of classified documents . authorities in sweden withdrew the arrest warrant over alleged rape for wikileaks founder julian assange the day after it was issued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pentagon warns that wikileaks data could endanger soldiers in afghanistan " as far as i am concerned there are no longer any grounds to suspect that he committed rape , " chief prosecutor eva finne said on saturday , august 21 .
the swedish prosecution authority said that assange was still being investigated on suspicion of molestation , but that he was no longer wanted by police .
the whistle-blowing website wikileaks came to prominence in july after publishing thousands of classified documents about the war in afghanistan .
the pentagon was enraged , saying that the information could put soldiers and their afghan helpers in danger .
the german isaf military official general brigadier josef blotz called the wikileaks actions " extremely irresponsible " and " basically a crime . "
' deeply disturbing ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden has some of the world 's toughest privacy laws in the world the arrest warrant was issued on friday after two women made allegations to swedish police .
assange told wikileaks ' twitter page the charges were " without basis " and described the timing of the allegations as " deeply disturbing . "
another twitter comment carried on the wikileaks website said , " we were warned to expect ' dirty tricks ' .
now we have the first one . "
the 39-year-old australian also rejected the accusations by e-mail , citing " dirty tricks " by those who were not happy with the publishing of sensitive documents .
assange was in sweden last week to defend his plans to publish more documents about the afghan war and its conduct by nato forces .
sweden has strict laws on protection of sources , and many of wikileaks ' web servers are based there .
the country ’ s pirate party , which campaigns for internet privacy , last week agreed to maintain wikileaks ’ servers in sweden .

the german interior minister said the trainers , who instruct 5,000 police recruits a year , could stay in the country beyond 2014 . after responsibility for security is handed over to afghan police and soldiers in 2014 , german police trainers will continue to teach local recruits .
" that seems to me to be in tune with the sustainability of our current engagement , " german interior minister thomas de maiziere told the dpa news agency .
" but whether three , five , twenty or another number of police trainers will stay in afghanistan , i ca n't yet say . "
in july , afghan president harmid karzai told international diplomats at a conference that 2014 was the date when afghans " will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country . "
it is a non-binding date , but has been seized upon by western politicians facing electorates at home who are increasingly opposed to sending soldiers to fight an increasingly powerful taliban insurgency for a national government plagued by high levels of corruption .
corruption is a problem de maiziere said he could imagine that german trainers would handle officer training after the official handover of security .
by the afghan police force should number 134,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german experts have been working with their afghan colleagues since 2002 german police train around 5,000 afghans a year .
the interior minister said that there were widespread problems of corruption in the afghan state .
" a police force can only win authority in a country if it is free of corruption , " de maiziere said , adding that the same applies to the government .
germany has been working to help train afghan police recruits for eight years as part of the eupol project .
this year , the number of german police trainers rose from 170 to 250 .
tense security situation the new regional commander of the international security assistance force in northern afghanistan , german major general hans-werner fritz , says the deployment in the area is " reaching a kind of culmination . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf troops have faced a challenging few months the security situation has gotten more tense over the last few months , fritz told the german paper " welt am sonntag , " but added that he was confident about making progress in the north of the country .
" i can see that we have come on in terms of stabilization and reconstruction , " he said , stressing that it was important to keep both the military and civilian components of the afghanistan mission in mind .
german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg shared that opinion , saying the situation in parts of the country where german troops are stationed had gotten dramatically tougher .
he said the taliban has strengthened their positions in the north and even penetrated into formerly peaceful areas such as kunduz .
he stressed , however , that in other areas the security situation was showing some improvement .
the ferocity of the war has been intensifying since the united states began deploying an extra 30,000 troops as part of president barack obama 's surge in support of a counter-insurgency campaign aimed at speeding an end to the conflict .
germany has some 4,000 troops serving in afghanistan .

he said that schlingensief had had an immense influence on german-language film and theater . " provocation was not a rare part of his stylistic device , " neumann said .

" in all his works , beginning with his first cinematic attempts right up to his great opera stagings , it was about the exploration of the relationship between politics , art and society , " staeck said .

"
-lrb- " foreigners out ! " -rrb- which denounced the rise of populism and racism . the program was a send-up of the big brother reality tv show in which asylum seekers lived inside containers similar to those that deported jews during world war ii .
every week the public would vote to evict an asylum seeker not from the show , but from the country . in 1998 , schlingensief founded the political party " opportunity 2000 " and took part in national elections , asking people to vote for themselves . he also invited people to join an anti-chancellor swim in the then-chancellor helmut kohl 's holiday retreat in lake wolfgang in austria .

" it is important that , along with the critics of nuclear energy , we also hear from those who believe -lsb- nuclear energy -rsb- to be an essential bridge technology for some time to come , " merkel said in an interview for the bild am sonntag weekly newspaper , which was published on sunday , august 22 .
the christian democrat leader wants nuclear operators to pay the tax in exchange for an extension of the lifetimes of the country 's nuclear plants , which are scheduled to cease operating in 2020 .
" we want energy in germany to be cleaner and more environmentally friendly , to be more secure , and to remain affordable for germans and the economy , " she said .
the german government will decide " on the question of energy supply for the coming decades and accordingly on the question of the prosperity of our country on the basis of comprehensive and rational debate , " merkel said .
open criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said both sides of the argument should be heard merkel 's comments come a day after a number of top managers and former politicians participated in an advertisement campaign , signing a protest letter that sharply criticized the planned tax on fuel rods .
among those involved were energy giants e.on , rwe and vattenfall , as well as industrial leaders basf , bayer , tyssenkrupp and germany 's largest bank , deutsche bank .
" a policy that consists of filling the budget by creating new energy taxes amounts to blocking important future investments , " the open letter said .
but environment minister norbert roettgen said there would be no going back on plans to tax power companies 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.9 billion -rrb- each year as part of government efforts to balance public finances .
on saturday , european union energy commissioner guenther oettinger threw his support behind the planned tax , calling on german nuclear energy providers to hand over at least half of the profits from extending the lifespan of their stations .
" it 's quite normal for nuclear groups to protest at the idea of a tax , but they should give the authorities a large part of the sizeable profits accruing from the -lrb- extended -rrb- operation of nuclear plants , " he said in an interview with daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung .
" i consider that at least 50 percent would be appropriate , " oettinger said .

the german interior minister said the trainers , who instruct 5,000 police recruits a year , could stay in the country beyond 2014 . after responsibility for security is handed over to afghan police and soldiers in 2014 , german police trainers will continue to teach local recruits .
" that seems to me to be in tune with the sustainability of our current engagement , " german interior minister thomas de maiziere told the dpa news agency .
" but whether three , five , twenty or another number of police trainers will stay in afghanistan , i ca n't yet say . "
in july , afghan president harmid karzai told international diplomats at a conference that 2014 was the date when afghans " will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country . "
it is a non-binding date , but has been seized upon by western politicians facing electorates at home who are increasingly opposed to sending soldiers to fight an increasingly powerful taliban insurgency for a national government plagued by high levels of corruption .
corruption is a problem de maiziere said he could imagine that german trainers would handle officer training after the official handover of security .
by the afghan police force should number 134,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german experts have been working with their afghan colleagues since 2002 german police train around 5,000 afghans a year .
the interior minister said that there were widespread problems of corruption in the afghan state .
" a police force can only win authority in a country if it is free of corruption , " de maiziere said , adding that the same applies to the government .
germany has been working to help train afghan police recruits for eight years as part of the eupol project .
this year , the number of german police trainers rose from 170 to 250 .
tense security situation the new regional commander of the international security assistance force in northern afghanistan , german major general hans-werner fritz , says the deployment in the area is " reaching a kind of culmination . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf troops have faced a challenging few months the security situation has gotten more tense over the last few months , fritz told the german paper " welt am sonntag , " but added that he was confident about making progress in the north of the country .
" i can see that we have come on in terms of stabilization and reconstruction , " he said , stressing that it was important to keep both the military and civilian components of the afghanistan mission in mind .
german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg shared that opinion , saying the situation in parts of the country where german troops are stationed had gotten dramatically tougher .
he said the taliban has strengthened their positions in the north and even penetrated into formerly peaceful areas such as kunduz .
he stressed , however , that in other areas the security situation was showing some improvement .
the ferocity of the war has been intensifying since the united states began deploying an extra 30,000 troops as part of president barack obama 's surge in support of a counter-insurgency campaign aimed at speeding an end to the conflict .
germany has some 4,000 troops serving in afghanistan .

not only is she one of the most successful violinists in the world and the youngest professor in germany , but also a wife , mother - and accomplished pianist . in a dvd coming out this month on the decca label , julia fischer performs both the violin and the piano in the same concert , together with the junge deutsche philharmonie and conductor matthias pintscher . deutsche welle : ms fischer , you play the violin , you play the piano , you have a family and you 're a professor at a german music school - does your day have more than 24 hours or do you simply not sleep ? julia fischer : -lrb- laughs -rrb- neither .
of course , that sounds like a lot , but it 's different when you start your career as early as i did .
i 've been giving concerts since i was 11 , so it 's not so strange that i started teaching at 23 . as you say , your course was set early on .
your brother and your mother play the piano and you started off with the piano .
how did you become interested in playing the violin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer played the piano before learning the violin at the age of three , you do n't really become interested in something .
piano played a role from the very beginning ; it was just there in the living room .
and in the neighboring village , there was a good violin teacher , and my mother knew that .
she had sent her own piano students there to find out whether he really was as good as everyone said .
so she sent me to him for lessons and he really was a fantastic instructor .
that 's why , even though i was really young , i made progress quickly and my interest grew . but you never neglected the piano . no , not entirely .
i enjoyed playing it too much .
for me , it was a hobby , just like it is for other people .
and maybe i needed it as a kind of outlet - just making music without thinking about a particular goal .
that was just free time ; i could play and practice whatever i wanted . were you able to take anything from the piano and apply it to the violin - or were they completely separate for you ? no , they go hand in hand .
i started playing violin repertoire on the piano , for example .
i learned the piano part to the brahms -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , and from the beethoven -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , too .
that gave me a completely different perspective and helped me a lot as far as learning the harmonic and polyphonic structure of a work . i learned the piano works by the same composers -lsb- whose works i played on the violin -rsb- .
there are 10 violin sonatas by beethoven , but 32 for piano .
and i had played 12 of them before i learned the first sonata for violin .
that made a lot of things easier . this month , a new dvd is coming out showing a concert where you played saint-saens ' third violin concerto and grieg 's piano concerto .
that sounds like a challenge ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer received violin lessons at a very young age yes , it was .
that would be a challenge for anyone .
but it was a one-time thing .
i do n't think i 'll be doing that very often - especially not both instruments on the same day .
besides , it was kind of a way to save face - if i had only played the piano and it did n't go well , then the people would have had a bad concert . i thought , if i play the violin too , then at least half of the concert would be good . -lrb- laughs -rrb- the point was n't to prove that i could play both instruments on the same evening . was there a reason why you performed first on the violin , then on the piano ? it 's very difficult to play the violin after you 've played the piano because the violin requires more fine motor skills and less strength .
it takes less muscle work - that 's why the fine motor skills do n't work so well after playing the piano .
but , the other way around , playing the violin is a good way to warm up for playing the piano . you 're now a mother , as well as a musician .
how do you manage it all ? how to combine family and career is a question that a lot of people ask .

fortunately , it 's very easy for me to combine them in my family .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical music -pipe- 22.08.2010 star violinist julia fischer impresses at the piano , too großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violinist julia fischer has a full concert schedule julia fischer wears many hats .
not only is she one of the most successful violinists in the world and the youngest professor in germany , but also a wife , mother - and accomplished pianist . in a dvd coming out this month on the decca label , julia fischer performs both the violin and the piano in the same concert , together with the junge deutsche philharmonie and conductor matthias pintscher . deutsche welle : ms fischer , you play the violin , you play the piano , you have a family and you 're a professor at a german music school - does your day have more than 24 hours or do you simply not sleep ? julia fischer : -lrb- laughs -rrb- neither .
of course , that sounds like a lot , but it 's different when you start your career as early as i did .
i 've been giving concerts since i was 11 , so it 's not so strange that i started teaching at 23 . as you say , your course was set early on .
your brother and your mother play the piano and you started off with the piano .
how did you become interested in playing the violin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer played the piano before learning the violin at the age of three , you do n't really become interested in something .
piano played a role from the very beginning ; it was just there in the living room .
and in the neighboring village , there was a good violin teacher , and my mother knew that .
she had sent her own piano students there to find out whether he really was as good as everyone said .
so she sent me to him for lessons and he really was a fantastic instructor .
that 's why , even though i was really young , i made progress quickly and my interest grew . but you never neglected the piano . no , not entirely .
i enjoyed playing it too much .
for me , it was a hobby , just like it is for other people .
and maybe i needed it as a kind of outlet - just making music without thinking about a particular goal .
that was just free time ; i could play and practice whatever i wanted . were you able to take anything from the piano and apply it to the violin - or were they completely separate for you ? no , they go hand in hand .
i started playing violin repertoire on the piano , for example .
i learned the piano part to the brahms -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , and from the beethoven -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , too .
that gave me a completely different perspective and helped me a lot as far as learning the harmonic and polyphonic structure of a work . i learned the piano works by the same composers -lsb- whose works i played on the violin -rsb- .
there are 10 violin sonatas by beethoven , but 32 for piano .
and i had played 12 of them before i learned the first sonata for violin .
that made a lot of things easier . this month , a new dvd is coming out showing a concert where you played saint-saens ' third violin concerto and grieg 's piano concerto .
that sounds like a challenge ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer received violin lessons at a very young age yes , it was .
that would be a challenge for anyone .
but it was a one-time thing .
i do n't think i 'll be doing that very often - especially not both instruments on the same day .
besides , it was kind of a way to save face - if i had only played the piano and it did n't go well , then the people would have had a bad concert . i thought , if i play the violin too , then at least half of the concert would be good . -lrb- laughs -rrb- the point was n't to prove that i could play both instruments on the same evening . was there a reason why you performed first on the violin , then on the piano ? it 's very difficult to play the violin after you 've played the piano because the violin requires more fine motor skills and less strength .
it takes less muscle work - that 's why the fine motor skills do n't work so well after playing the piano .
but , the other way around , playing the violin is a good way to warm up for playing the piano . you 're now a mother , as well as a musician .
how do you manage it all ? how to combine family and career is a question that a lot of people ask .
not just me .
fortunately , it 's very easy for me to combine them in my family .
i think people have the most problems when they 're not able to clearly define their priorities and do n't make clear how important their career is and how important their family is .
once you 've cleared that up , you do n't have any moral conflicts .
to be a balanced person , you have to recognize what 's important . interview : bjorn woll -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

supporters say a dirty tricks campaign is underway after the publication of classified documents . authorities in sweden withdrew the arrest warrant over alleged rape for wikileaks founder julian assange the day after it was issued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pentagon warns that wikileaks data could endanger soldiers in afghanistan " as far as i am concerned there are no longer any grounds to suspect that he committed rape , " chief prosecutor eva finne said on saturday , august 21 .
the swedish prosecution authority said that assange was still being investigated on suspicion of molestation , but that he was no longer wanted by police .
the whistle-blowing website wikileaks came to prominence in july after publishing thousands of classified documents about the war in afghanistan .
the pentagon was enraged , saying that the information could put soldiers and their afghan helpers in danger .
the german isaf military official general brigadier josef blotz called the wikileaks actions " extremely irresponsible " and " basically a crime . "
' deeply disturbing ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden has some of the world 's toughest privacy laws in the world the arrest warrant was issued on friday after two women made allegations to swedish police .
assange told wikileaks ' twitter page the charges were " without basis " and described the timing of the allegations as " deeply disturbing . "
another twitter comment carried on the wikileaks website said , " we were warned to expect ' dirty tricks ' .
now we have the first one . "
the 39-year-old australian also rejected the accusations by e-mail , citing " dirty tricks " by those who were not happy with the publishing of sensitive documents .
assange was in sweden last week to defend his plans to publish more documents about the afghan war and its conduct by nato forces .
sweden has strict laws on protection of sources , and many of wikileaks ' web servers are based there .
the country ’ s pirate party , which campaigns for internet privacy , last week agreed to maintain wikileaks ’ servers in sweden .

the german interior minister said the trainers , who instruct 5,000 police recruits a year , could stay in the country beyond 2014 . after responsibility for security is handed over to afghan police and soldiers in 2014 , german police trainers will continue to teach local recruits .
" that seems to me to be in tune with the sustainability of our current engagement , " german interior minister thomas de maiziere told the dpa news agency .
" but whether three , five , twenty or another number of police trainers will stay in afghanistan , i ca n't yet say . "
in july , afghan president harmid karzai told international diplomats at a conference that 2014 was the date when afghans " will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country . "
it is a non-binding date , but has been seized upon by western politicians facing electorates at home who are increasingly opposed to sending soldiers to fight an increasingly powerful taliban insurgency for a national government plagued by high levels of corruption .
corruption is a problem de maiziere said he could imagine that german trainers would handle officer training after the official handover of security .
by the afghan police force should number 134,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german experts have been working with their afghan colleagues since 2002 german police train around 5,000 afghans a year .
the interior minister said that there were widespread problems of corruption in the afghan state .
" a police force can only win authority in a country if it is free of corruption , " de maiziere said , adding that the same applies to the government .
germany has been working to help train afghan police recruits for eight years as part of the eupol project .
this year , the number of german police trainers rose from 170 to 250 .
tense security situation the new regional commander of the international security assistance force in northern afghanistan , german major general hans-werner fritz , says the deployment in the area is " reaching a kind of culmination . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf troops have faced a challenging few months the security situation has gotten more tense over the last few months , fritz told the german paper " welt am sonntag , " but added that he was confident about making progress in the north of the country .
" i can see that we have come on in terms of stabilization and reconstruction , " he said , stressing that it was important to keep both the military and civilian components of the afghanistan mission in mind .
german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg shared that opinion , saying the situation in parts of the country where german troops are stationed had gotten dramatically tougher .
he said the taliban has strengthened their positions in the north and even penetrated into formerly peaceful areas such as kunduz .
he stressed , however , that in other areas the security situation was showing some improvement .
the ferocity of the war has been intensifying since the united states began deploying an extra 30,000 troops as part of president barack obama 's surge in support of a counter-insurgency campaign aimed at speeding an end to the conflict .
germany has some 4,000 troops serving in afghanistan .

" it is important that , along with the critics of nuclear energy , we also hear from those who believe -lsb- nuclear energy -rsb- to be an essential bridge technology for some time to come , " merkel said in an interview for the bild am sonntag weekly newspaper , which was published on sunday , august 22 .
the christian democrat leader wants nuclear operators to pay the tax in exchange for an extension of the lifetimes of the country 's nuclear plants , which are scheduled to cease operating in 2020 .
" we want energy in germany to be cleaner and more environmentally friendly , to be more secure , and to remain affordable for germans and the economy , " she said .
the german government will decide " on the question of energy supply for the coming decades and accordingly on the question of the prosperity of our country on the basis of comprehensive and rational debate , " merkel said .
open criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said both sides of the argument should be heard merkel 's comments come a day after a number of top managers and former politicians participated in an advertisement campaign , signing a protest letter that sharply criticized the planned tax on fuel rods .
among those involved were energy giants e.on , rwe and vattenfall , as well as industrial leaders basf , bayer , tyssenkrupp and germany 's largest bank , deutsche bank .
" a policy that consists of filling the budget by creating new energy taxes amounts to blocking important future investments , " the open letter said .
but environment minister norbert roettgen said there would be no going back on plans to tax power companies 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.9 billion -rrb- each year as part of government efforts to balance public finances .
on saturday , european union energy commissioner guenther oettinger threw his support behind the planned tax , calling on german nuclear energy providers to hand over at least half of the profits from extending the lifespan of their stations .
" it 's quite normal for nuclear groups to protest at the idea of a tax , but they should give the authorities a large part of the sizeable profits accruing from the -lrb- extended -rrb- operation of nuclear plants , " he said in an interview with daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung .
" i consider that at least 50 percent would be appropriate , " oettinger said .

"
-lrb- " foreigners out ! " -rrb- which denounced the rise of populism and racism . the program was a send-up of the big brother reality tv show in which asylum seekers lived inside containers similar to those that deported jews during world war ii .

willi staechele , the state finance minister , told the bild am sonntag " we are taking this e-mail seriously and are studying whether the data can legally be touched . "
in the past switzerland has reacted angrily to german purchases of stolen data about swiss bank accounts .
baden-wuerttemberg has said it refuses to do deals with whistle-blowers .
but a state spokesman in stuttgart told the dpa new agency that if the data were true , they would act on it .
according to the newspaper , the anonymous whistle-blower claimed most of the 250 companies in question were from the telecommunications and real-estate sectors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 22.08.2010 merkel attempts to defuse dispute over planned nuclear tax großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country 's nuclear plants are scheduled to go offline in 2020 as debate in germany intensifies over a planned tax on nuclear power plant operators , the country 's leader , angela merkel , steps in to try to ease the standoff between the government and the energy sector . german chancellor angela merkel has tried to defuse an ongoing row with the german energy industry over government plans to introduce a tax on nuclear power providers by striking a conciliatory tone .
" it is important that , along with the critics of nuclear energy , we also hear from those who believe -lsb- nuclear energy -rsb- to be an essential bridge technology for some time to come , " merkel said in an interview for the bild am sonntag weekly newspaper , which was published on sunday , august 22 .
the christian democrat leader wants nuclear operators to pay the tax in exchange for an extension of the lifetimes of the country 's nuclear plants , which are scheduled to cease operating in 2020 .
" we want energy in germany to be cleaner and more environmentally friendly , to be more secure , and to remain affordable for germans and the economy , " she said .
the german government will decide " on the question of energy supply for the coming decades and accordingly on the question of the prosperity of our country on the basis of comprehensive and rational debate , " merkel said .
open criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said both sides of the argument should be heard merkel 's comments come a day after a number of top managers and former politicians participated in an advertisement campaign , signing a protest letter that sharply criticized the planned tax on fuel rods .
among those involved were energy giants e.on , rwe and vattenfall , as well as industrial leaders basf , bayer , tyssenkrupp and germany 's largest bank , deutsche bank .
" a policy that consists of filling the budget by creating new energy taxes amounts to blocking important future investments , " the open letter said .
but environment minister norbert roettgen said there would be no going back on plans to tax power companies 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.9 billion -rrb- each year as part of government efforts to balance public finances .
on saturday , european union energy commissioner guenther oettinger threw his support behind the planned tax , calling on german nuclear energy providers to hand over at least half of the profits from extending the lifespan of their stations .
" it 's quite normal for nuclear groups to protest at the idea of a tax , but they should give the authorities a large part of the sizeable profits accruing from the -lrb- extended -rrb- operation of nuclear plants , " he said in an interview with daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung .
" i consider that at least 50 percent would be appropriate , " oettinger said .

of course , that sounds like a lot , but it 's different when you start your career as early as i did .
i 've been giving concerts since i was 11 , so it 's not so strange that i started teaching at 23 . as you say , your course was set early on .
your brother and your mother play the piano and you started off with the piano .
how did you become interested in playing the violin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer played the piano before learning the violin at the age of three , you do n't really become interested in something .
piano played a role from the very beginning ; it was just there in the living room .
and in the neighboring village , there was a good violin teacher , and my mother knew that .
she had sent her own piano students there to find out whether he really was as good as everyone said .
so she sent me to him for lessons and he really was a fantastic instructor .
that 's why , even though i was really young , i made progress quickly and my interest grew . but you never neglected the piano . no , not entirely .
i enjoyed playing it too much .
for me , it was a hobby , just like it is for other people .
and maybe i needed it as a kind of outlet - just making music without thinking about a particular goal .
that was just free time ; i could play and practice whatever i wanted . were you able to take anything from the piano and apply it to the violin - or were they completely separate for you ? no , they go hand in hand .
i started playing violin repertoire on the piano , for example .
i learned the piano part to the brahms -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , and from the beethoven -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , too .
that gave me a completely different perspective and helped me a lot as far as learning the harmonic and polyphonic structure of a work . i learned the piano works by the same composers -lsb- whose works i played on the violin -rsb- .
there are 10 violin sonatas by beethoven , but 32 for piano .
and i had played 12 of them before i learned the first sonata for violin .
that made a lot of things easier . this month , a new dvd is coming out showing a concert where you played saint-saens ' third violin concerto and grieg 's piano concerto .
that sounds like a challenge ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer received violin lessons at a very young age yes , it was .
that would be a challenge for anyone .
but it was a one-time thing .
i do n't think i 'll be doing that very often - especially not both instruments on the same day .
besides , it was kind of a way to save face - if i had only played the piano and it did n't go well , then the people would have had a bad concert . i thought , if i play the violin too , then at least half of the concert would be good . -lrb- laughs -rrb- the point was n't to prove that i could play both instruments on the same evening . was there a reason why you performed first on the violin , then on the piano ? it 's very difficult to play the violin after you 've played the piano because the violin requires more fine motor skills and less strength .
it takes less muscle work - that 's why the fine motor skills do n't work so well after playing the piano .

how do you manage it all ? how to combine family and career is a question that a lot of people ask .

piano played a role from the very beginning ; it was just there in the living room .
and in the neighboring village , there was a good violin teacher , and my mother knew that .
she had sent her own piano students there to find out whether he really was as good as everyone said .
so she sent me to him for lessons and he really was a fantastic instructor .
that 's why , even though i was really young , i made progress quickly and my interest grew . but you never neglected the piano . no , not entirely .
i enjoyed playing it too much .
for me , it was a hobby , just like it is for other people .
and maybe i needed it as a kind of outlet - just making music without thinking about a particular goal .
that was just free time ; i could play and practice whatever i wanted . were you able to take anything from the piano and apply it to the violin - or were they completely separate for you ? no , they go hand in hand .
i started playing violin repertoire on the piano , for example .
i learned the piano part to the brahms -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , and from the beethoven -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , too .
that gave me a completely different perspective and helped me a lot as far as learning the harmonic and polyphonic structure of a work . i learned the piano works by the same composers -lsb- whose works i played on the violin -rsb- .
there are 10 violin sonatas by beethoven , but 32 for piano .
and i had played 12 of them before i learned the first sonata for violin .
that made a lot of things easier . this month , a new dvd is coming out showing a concert where you played saint-saens ' third violin concerto and grieg 's piano concerto .
that sounds like a challenge ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer received violin lessons at a very young age yes , it was .
that would be a challenge for anyone .
but it was a one-time thing .
i do n't think i 'll be doing that very often - especially not both instruments on the same day .
besides , it was kind of a way to save face - if i had only played the piano and it did n't go well , then the people would have had a bad concert . i thought , if i play the violin too , then at least half of the concert would be good . -lrb- laughs -rrb- the point was n't to prove that i could play both instruments on the same evening . was there a reason why you performed first on the violin , then on the piano ? it 's very difficult to play the violin after you 've played the piano because the violin requires more fine motor skills and less strength .
it takes less muscle work - that 's why the fine motor skills do n't work so well after playing the piano .
but , the other way around , playing the violin is a good way to warm up for playing the piano . you 're now a mother , as well as a musician .
how do you manage it all ? how to combine family and career is a question that a lot of people ask .
not just me .
fortunately , it 's very easy for me to combine them in my family .
i think people have the most problems when they 're not able to clearly define their priorities and do n't make clear how important their career is and how important their family is .
once you 've cleared that up , you do n't have any moral conflicts .
to be a balanced person , you have to recognize what 's important . interview : bjorn woll -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not only is she one of the most successful violinists in the world and the youngest professor in germany , but also a wife , mother - and accomplished pianist . in a dvd coming out this month on the decca label , julia fischer performs both the violin and the piano in the same concert , together with the junge deutsche philharmonie and conductor matthias pintscher . deutsche welle : ms fischer , you play the violin , you play the piano , you have a family and you 're a professor at a german music school - does your day have more than 24 hours or do you simply not sleep ? julia fischer : -lrb- laughs -rrb- neither .
of course , that sounds like a lot , but it 's different when you start your career as early as i did .
i 've been giving concerts since i was 11 , so it 's not so strange that i started teaching at 23 . as you say , your course was set early on .
your brother and your mother play the piano and you started off with the piano .
how did you become interested in playing the violin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer played the piano before learning the violin at the age of three , you do n't really become interested in something .
piano played a role from the very beginning ; it was just there in the living room .
and in the neighboring village , there was a good violin teacher , and my mother knew that .
she had sent her own piano students there to find out whether he really was as good as everyone said .
so she sent me to him for lessons and he really was a fantastic instructor .
that 's why , even though i was really young , i made progress quickly and my interest grew . but you never neglected the piano . no , not entirely .
i enjoyed playing it too much .
for me , it was a hobby , just like it is for other people .
and maybe i needed it as a kind of outlet - just making music without thinking about a particular goal .
that was just free time ; i could play and practice whatever i wanted . were you able to take anything from the piano and apply it to the violin - or were they completely separate for you ? no , they go hand in hand .
i started playing violin repertoire on the piano , for example .
i learned the piano part to the brahms -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , and from the beethoven -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , too .
that gave me a completely different perspective and helped me a lot as far as learning the harmonic and polyphonic structure of a work . i learned the piano works by the same composers -lsb- whose works i played on the violin -rsb- .
there are 10 violin sonatas by beethoven , but 32 for piano .
and i had played 12 of them before i learned the first sonata for violin .
that made a lot of things easier . this month , a new dvd is coming out showing a concert where you played saint-saens ' third violin concerto and grieg 's piano concerto .
that sounds like a challenge ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer received violin lessons at a very young age yes , it was .
that would be a challenge for anyone .
but it was a one-time thing .
i do n't think i 'll be doing that very often - especially not both instruments on the same day .
besides , it was kind of a way to save face - if i had only played the piano and it did n't go well , then the people would have had a bad concert . i thought , if i play the violin too , then at least half of the concert would be good . -lrb- laughs -rrb- the point was n't to prove that i could play both instruments on the same evening . was there a reason why you performed first on the violin , then on the piano ? it 's very difficult to play the violin after you 've played the piano because the violin requires more fine motor skills and less strength .
it takes less muscle work - that 's why the fine motor skills do n't work so well after playing the piano .
but , the other way around , playing the violin is a good way to warm up for playing the piano . you 're now a mother , as well as a musician .
how do you manage it all ? how to combine family and career is a question that a lot of people ask .
not just me .
fortunately , it 's very easy for me to combine them in my family .
i think people have the most problems when they 're not able to clearly define their priorities and do n't make clear how important their career is and how important their family is .
once you 've cleared that up , you do n't have any moral conflicts .

and i had played 12 of them before i learned the first sonata for violin .
that made a lot of things easier . this month , a new dvd is coming out showing a concert where you played saint-saens ' third violin concerto and grieg 's piano concerto .
that sounds like a challenge ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer received violin lessons at a very young age yes , it was .
that would be a challenge for anyone .
but it was a one-time thing .
i do n't think i 'll be doing that very often - especially not both instruments on the same day .
besides , it was kind of a way to save face - if i had only played the piano and it did n't go well , then the people would have had a bad concert . i thought , if i play the violin too , then at least half of the concert would be good . -lrb- laughs -rrb- the point was n't to prove that i could play both instruments on the same evening . was there a reason why you performed first on the violin , then on the piano ? it 's very difficult to play the violin after you 've played the piano because the violin requires more fine motor skills and less strength .
it takes less muscle work - that 's why the fine motor skills do n't work so well after playing the piano .
but , the other way around , playing the violin is a good way to warm up for playing the piano . you 're now a mother , as well as a musician .
how do you manage it all ? how to combine family and career is a question that a lot of people ask .
not just me .
fortunately , it 's very easy for me to combine them in my family .
i think people have the most problems when they 're not able to clearly define their priorities and do n't make clear how important their career is and how important their family is .
once you 've cleared that up , you do n't have any moral conflicts .
to be a balanced person , you have to recognize what 's important . interview : bjorn woll -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german interior minister said the trainers , who instruct 5,000 police recruits a year , could stay in the country beyond 2014 . after responsibility for security is handed over to afghan police and soldiers in 2014 , german police trainers will continue to teach local recruits .
" that seems to me to be in tune with the sustainability of our current engagement , " german interior minister thomas de maiziere told the dpa news agency .
" but whether three , five , twenty or another number of police trainers will stay in afghanistan , i ca n't yet say . "
in july , afghan president harmid karzai told international diplomats at a conference that 2014 was the date when afghans " will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country . "
it is a non-binding date , but has been seized upon by western politicians facing electorates at home who are increasingly opposed to sending soldiers to fight an increasingly powerful taliban insurgency for a national government plagued by high levels of corruption .
corruption is a problem de maiziere said he could imagine that german trainers would handle officer training after the official handover of security .
by the afghan police force should number 134,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german experts have been working with their afghan colleagues since 2002 german police train around 5,000 afghans a year .
the interior minister said that there were widespread problems of corruption in the afghan state .
" a police force can only win authority in a country if it is free of corruption , " de maiziere said , adding that the same applies to the government .
germany has been working to help train afghan police recruits for eight years as part of the eupol project .
this year , the number of german police trainers rose from 170 to 250 .
tense security situation the new regional commander of the international security assistance force in northern afghanistan , german major general hans-werner fritz , says the deployment in the area is " reaching a kind of culmination . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf troops have faced a challenging few months the security situation has gotten more tense over the last few months , fritz told the german paper " welt am sonntag , " but added that he was confident about making progress in the north of the country .
" i can see that we have come on in terms of stabilization and reconstruction , " he said , stressing that it was important to keep both the military and civilian components of the afghanistan mission in mind .
german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg shared that opinion , saying the situation in parts of the country where german troops are stationed had gotten dramatically tougher .
he said the taliban has strengthened their positions in the north and even penetrated into formerly peaceful areas such as kunduz .
he stressed , however , that in other areas the security situation was showing some improvement .
the ferocity of the war has been intensifying since the united states began deploying an extra 30,000 troops as part of president barack obama 's surge in support of a counter-insurgency campaign aimed at speeding an end to the conflict .
germany has some 4,000 troops serving in afghanistan .

" it is important that , along with the critics of nuclear energy , we also hear from those who believe -lsb- nuclear energy -rsb- to be an essential bridge technology for some time to come , " merkel said in an interview for the bild am sonntag weekly newspaper , which was published on sunday , august 22 .
the christian democrat leader wants nuclear operators to pay the tax in exchange for an extension of the lifetimes of the country 's nuclear plants , which are scheduled to cease operating in 2020 .
" we want energy in germany to be cleaner and more environmentally friendly , to be more secure , and to remain affordable for germans and the economy , " she said .
the german government will decide " on the question of energy supply for the coming decades and accordingly on the question of the prosperity of our country on the basis of comprehensive and rational debate , " merkel said .
open criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said both sides of the argument should be heard merkel 's comments come a day after a number of top managers and former politicians participated in an advertisement campaign , signing a protest letter that sharply criticized the planned tax on fuel rods .
among those involved were energy giants e.on , rwe and vattenfall , as well as industrial leaders basf , bayer , tyssenkrupp and germany 's largest bank , deutsche bank .
" a policy that consists of filling the budget by creating new energy taxes amounts to blocking important future investments , " the open letter said .
but environment minister norbert roettgen said there would be no going back on plans to tax power companies 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.9 billion -rrb- each year as part of government efforts to balance public finances .
on saturday , european union energy commissioner guenther oettinger threw his support behind the planned tax , calling on german nuclear energy providers to hand over at least half of the profits from extending the lifespan of their stations .
" it 's quite normal for nuclear groups to protest at the idea of a tax , but they should give the authorities a large part of the sizeable profits accruing from the -lrb- extended -rrb- operation of nuclear plants , " he said in an interview with daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung .
" i consider that at least 50 percent would be appropriate , " oettinger said .

the german interior minister said the trainers , who instruct 5,000 police recruits a year , could stay in the country beyond 2014 . after responsibility for security is handed over to afghan police and soldiers in 2014 , german police trainers will continue to teach local recruits .
" that seems to me to be in tune with the sustainability of our current engagement , " german interior minister thomas de maiziere told the dpa news agency .
" but whether three , five , twenty or another number of police trainers will stay in afghanistan , i ca n't yet say . "
in july , afghan president harmid karzai told international diplomats at a conference that 2014 was the date when afghans " will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country . "
it is a non-binding date , but has been seized upon by western politicians facing electorates at home who are increasingly opposed to sending soldiers to fight an increasingly powerful taliban insurgency for a national government plagued by high levels of corruption .
corruption is a problem de maiziere said he could imagine that german trainers would handle officer training after the official handover of security .
by the afghan police force should number 134,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german experts have been working with their afghan colleagues since 2002 german police train around 5,000 afghans a year .
the interior minister said that there were widespread problems of corruption in the afghan state .
" a police force can only win authority in a country if it is free of corruption , " de maiziere said , adding that the same applies to the government .
germany has been working to help train afghan police recruits for eight years as part of the eupol project .
this year , the number of german police trainers rose from 170 to 250 .
tense security situation the new regional commander of the international security assistance force in northern afghanistan , german major general hans-werner fritz , says the deployment in the area is " reaching a kind of culmination . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf troops have faced a challenging few months the security situation has gotten more tense over the last few months , fritz told the german paper " welt am sonntag , " but added that he was confident about making progress in the north of the country .
" i can see that we have come on in terms of stabilization and reconstruction , " he said , stressing that it was important to keep both the military and civilian components of the afghanistan mission in mind .

the german interior minister said the trainers , who instruct 5,000 police recruits a year , could stay in the country beyond 2014 . after responsibility for security is handed over to afghan police and soldiers in 2014 , german police trainers will continue to teach local recruits .
" that seems to me to be in tune with the sustainability of our current engagement , " german interior minister thomas de maiziere told the dpa news agency .
" but whether three , five , twenty or another number of police trainers will stay in afghanistan , i ca n't yet say . "
in july , afghan president harmid karzai told international diplomats at a conference that 2014 was the date when afghans " will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country . "
it is a non-binding date , but has been seized upon by western politicians facing electorates at home who are increasingly opposed to sending soldiers to fight an increasingly powerful taliban insurgency for a national government plagued by high levels of corruption .
corruption is a problem de maiziere said he could imagine that german trainers would handle officer training after the official handover of security .
by the afghan police force should number 134,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german experts have been working with their afghan colleagues since 2002 german police train around 5,000 afghans a year .
the interior minister said that there were widespread problems of corruption in the afghan state .
" a police force can only win authority in a country if it is free of corruption , " de maiziere said , adding that the same applies to the government .
germany has been working to help train afghan police recruits for eight years as part of the eupol project .
this year , the number of german police trainers rose from 170 to 250 .
tense security situation the new regional commander of the international security assistance force in northern afghanistan , german major general hans-werner fritz , says the deployment in the area is " reaching a kind of culmination . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isaf troops have faced a challenging few months the security situation has gotten more tense over the last few months , fritz told the german paper " welt am sonntag , " but added that he was confident about making progress in the north of the country .
" i can see that we have come on in terms of stabilization and reconstruction , " he said , stressing that it was important to keep both the military and civilian components of the afghanistan mission in mind .
german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg shared that opinion , saying the situation in parts of the country where german troops are stationed had gotten dramatically tougher .
he said the taliban has strengthened their positions in the north and even penetrated into formerly peaceful areas such as kunduz .

" it is important that , along with the critics of nuclear energy , we also hear from those who believe -lsb- nuclear energy -rsb- to be an essential bridge technology for some time to come , " merkel said in an interview for the bild am sonntag weekly newspaper , which was published on sunday , august 22 .
the christian democrat leader wants nuclear operators to pay the tax in exchange for an extension of the lifetimes of the country 's nuclear plants , which are scheduled to cease operating in 2020 .
" we want energy in germany to be cleaner and more environmentally friendly , to be more secure , and to remain affordable for germans and the economy , " she said .

" it 's quite normal for nuclear groups to protest at the idea of a tax , but they should give the authorities a large part of the sizeable profits accruing from the -lrb- extended -rrb- operation of nuclear plants , " he said in an interview with daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung .
" i consider that at least 50 percent would be appropriate , " oettinger said .

in july , afghan president harmid karzai told international diplomats at a conference that 2014 was the date when afghans " will be responsible for all military and law enforcement operations throughout our country . "
it is a non-binding date , but has been seized upon by western politicians facing electorates at home who are increasingly opposed to sending soldiers to fight an increasingly powerful taliban insurgency for a national government plagued by high levels of corruption .

" i can see that we have come on in terms of stabilization and reconstruction , " he said , stressing that it was important to keep both the military and civilian components of the afghanistan mission in mind .
german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg shared that opinion , saying the situation in parts of the country where german troops are stationed had gotten dramatically tougher .
he said the taliban has strengthened their positions in the north and even penetrated into formerly peaceful areas such as kunduz .
he stressed , however , that in other areas the security situation was showing some improvement .

the painting , " poppy flowers , " worth an estimated 39 million euros -lrb- $ 50 million -rrb- was stolen from the mahmoud khalil museum in the egyptian capital after it was cut from its frame .
egyptian culture minister farouk hosni confirmed that the painting was still missing , retracting an earlier statement that it had been found .
" despite receiving confirmation that the painting was recovered , the information was inaccurate and procedures continue to determine how the painting was stolen and how to recover it , " hosni said .
a system glitch reports say the museum 's surveillance system has been out of order for some time .
" the cameras had not been working for a long time , and neither had the alarm system , " a museum security official told news agency afp , adding that no image of the painting was therefore available .
" we do n't exactly know how long they had been out of order , but it was a long time , " he said .
" the museum officials said they were looking for spare parts -lsb- for the security system -rsb- but had n't managed to find them , " by the time the theft took place .
this was the second time the painting had been stolen from the museum .
thieves made off with it in 1978 , but it was returned a decade later .
one year later , a duplicate was sold for $ 43 million in london , sparking a debate in egypt about whether the returned painting was , in fact , a fake .
the mahmoud khalil museum houses a collection of 208 items , among them works by monet , toulouse-lautrec , gauguin and rodin .

" it is important that , along with the critics of nuclear energy , we also hear from those who believe -lsb- nuclear energy -rsb- to be an essential bridge technology for some time to come , " merkel said in an interview for the bild am sonntag weekly newspaper , which was published on sunday , august 22 .
the christian democrat leader wants nuclear operators to pay the tax in exchange for an extension of the lifetimes of the country 's nuclear plants , which are scheduled to cease operating in 2020 .
" we want energy in germany to be cleaner and more environmentally friendly , to be more secure , and to remain affordable for germans and the economy , " she said .

among those involved were energy giants e.on , rwe and vattenfall , as well as industrial leaders basf , bayer , tyssenkrupp and germany 's largest bank , deutsche bank .
" a policy that consists of filling the budget by creating new energy taxes amounts to blocking important future investments , " the open letter said .
but environment minister norbert roettgen said there would be no going back on plans to tax power companies 2.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.9 billion -rrb- each year as part of government efforts to balance public finances .
on saturday , european union energy commissioner guenther oettinger threw his support behind the planned tax , calling on german nuclear energy providers to hand over at least half of the profits from extending the lifespan of their stations .
" it 's quite normal for nuclear groups to protest at the idea of a tax , but they should give the authorities a large part of the sizeable profits accruing from the -lrb- extended -rrb- operation of nuclear plants , " he said in an interview with daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung .
" i consider that at least 50 percent would be appropriate , " oettinger said .

not only is she one of the most successful violinists in the world and the youngest professor in germany , but also a wife , mother - and accomplished pianist . in a dvd coming out this month on the decca label , julia fischer performs both the violin and the piano in the same concert , together with the junge deutsche philharmonie and conductor matthias pintscher . deutsche welle : ms fischer , you play the violin , you play the piano , you have a family and you 're a professor at a german music school - does your day have more than 24 hours or do you simply not sleep ? julia fischer : -lrb- laughs -rrb- neither .
of course , that sounds like a lot , but it 's different when you start your career as early as i did .
i 've been giving concerts since i was 11 , so it 's not so strange that i started teaching at 23 . as you say , your course was set early on .
your brother and your mother play the piano and you started off with the piano .
how did you become interested in playing the violin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer played the piano before learning the violin at the age of three , you do n't really become interested in something .
piano played a role from the very beginning ; it was just there in the living room .
and in the neighboring village , there was a good violin teacher , and my mother knew that .
she had sent her own piano students there to find out whether he really was as good as everyone said .
so she sent me to him for lessons and he really was a fantastic instructor .
that 's why , even though i was really young , i made progress quickly and my interest grew . but you never neglected the piano . no , not entirely .
i enjoyed playing it too much .
for me , it was a hobby , just like it is for other people .
and maybe i needed it as a kind of outlet - just making music without thinking about a particular goal .
that was just free time ; i could play and practice whatever i wanted . were you able to take anything from the piano and apply it to the violin - or were they completely separate for you ? no , they go hand in hand .
i started playing violin repertoire on the piano , for example .
i learned the piano part to the brahms -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , and from the beethoven -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , too .
that gave me a completely different perspective and helped me a lot as far as learning the harmonic and polyphonic structure of a work . i learned the piano works by the same composers -lsb- whose works i played on the violin -rsb- .
there are 10 violin sonatas by beethoven , but 32 for piano .
and i had played 12 of them before i learned the first sonata for violin .
that made a lot of things easier . this month , a new dvd is coming out showing a concert where you played saint-saens ' third violin concerto and grieg 's piano concerto .
that sounds like a challenge ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer received violin lessons at a very young age yes , it was .
that would be a challenge for anyone .
but it was a one-time thing .
i do n't think i 'll be doing that very often - especially not both instruments on the same day .
besides , it was kind of a way to save face - if i had only played the piano and it did n't go well , then the people would have had a bad concert . i thought , if i play the violin too , then at least half of the concert would be good . -lrb- laughs -rrb- the point was n't to prove that i could play both instruments on the same evening . was there a reason why you performed first on the violin , then on the piano ? it 's very difficult to play the violin after you 've played the piano because the violin requires more fine motor skills and less strength .
it takes less muscle work - that 's why the fine motor skills do n't work so well after playing the piano .
but , the other way around , playing the violin is a good way to warm up for playing the piano . you 're now a mother , as well as a musician .
how do you manage it all ? how to combine family and career is a question that a lot of people ask .
not just me .
fortunately , it 's very easy for me to combine them in my family .
i think people have the most problems when they 're not able to clearly define their priorities and do n't make clear how important their career is and how important their family is .
once you 've cleared that up , you do n't have any moral conflicts .

not only is she one of the most successful violinists in the world and the youngest professor in germany , but also a wife , mother - and accomplished pianist . in a dvd coming out this month on the decca label , julia fischer performs both the violin and the piano in the same concert , together with the junge deutsche philharmonie and conductor matthias pintscher . deutsche welle : ms fischer , you play the violin , you play the piano , you have a family and you 're a professor at a german music school - does your day have more than 24 hours or do you simply not sleep ? julia fischer : -lrb- laughs -rrb- neither .
of course , that sounds like a lot , but it 's different when you start your career as early as i did .
i 've been giving concerts since i was 11 , so it 's not so strange that i started teaching at 23 . as you say , your course was set early on .
your brother and your mother play the piano and you started off with the piano .
how did you become interested in playing the violin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer played the piano before learning the violin at the age of three , you do n't really become interested in something .
piano played a role from the very beginning ; it was just there in the living room .
and in the neighboring village , there was a good violin teacher , and my mother knew that .
she had sent her own piano students there to find out whether he really was as good as everyone said .
so she sent me to him for lessons and he really was a fantastic instructor .
that 's why , even though i was really young , i made progress quickly and my interest grew . but you never neglected the piano . no , not entirely .
i enjoyed playing it too much .
for me , it was a hobby , just like it is for other people .
and maybe i needed it as a kind of outlet - just making music without thinking about a particular goal .
that was just free time ; i could play and practice whatever i wanted . were you able to take anything from the piano and apply it to the violin - or were they completely separate for you ? no , they go hand in hand .
i started playing violin repertoire on the piano , for example .
i learned the piano part to the brahms -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , and from the beethoven -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , too .
that gave me a completely different perspective and helped me a lot as far as learning the harmonic and polyphonic structure of a work . i learned the piano works by the same composers -lsb- whose works i played on the violin -rsb- .
there are 10 violin sonatas by beethoven , but 32 for piano .
and i had played 12 of them before i learned the first sonata for violin .
that made a lot of things easier . this month , a new dvd is coming out showing a concert where you played saint-saens ' third violin concerto and grieg 's piano concerto .
that sounds like a challenge ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer received violin lessons at a very young age yes , it was .
that would be a challenge for anyone .
but it was a one-time thing .
i do n't think i 'll be doing that very often - especially not both instruments on the same day .
besides , it was kind of a way to save face - if i had only played the piano and it did n't go well , then the people would have had a bad concert . i thought , if i play the violin too , then at least half of the concert would be good . -lrb- laughs -rrb- the point was n't to prove that i could play both instruments on the same evening . was there a reason why you performed first on the violin , then on the piano ? it 's very difficult to play the violin after you 've played the piano because the violin requires more fine motor skills and less strength .
it takes less muscle work - that 's why the fine motor skills do n't work so well after playing the piano .
but , the other way around , playing the violin is a good way to warm up for playing the piano . you 're now a mother , as well as a musician .
how do you manage it all ? how to combine family and career is a question that a lot of people ask .
not just me .
fortunately , it 's very easy for me to combine them in my family .
i think people have the most problems when they 're not able to clearly define their priorities and do n't make clear how important their career is and how important their family is .
once you 've cleared that up , you do n't have any moral conflicts .

not only is she one of the most successful violinists in the world and the youngest professor in germany , but also a wife , mother - and accomplished pianist . in a dvd coming out this month on the decca label , julia fischer performs both the violin and the piano in the same concert , together with the junge deutsche philharmonie and conductor matthias pintscher . deutsche welle : ms fischer , you play the violin , you play the piano , you have a family and you 're a professor at a german music school - does your day have more than 24 hours or do you simply not sleep ? julia fischer : -lrb- laughs -rrb- neither .
of course , that sounds like a lot , but it 's different when you start your career as early as i did .
i 've been giving concerts since i was 11 , so it 's not so strange that i started teaching at 23 . as you say , your course was set early on .
your brother and your mother play the piano and you started off with the piano .
how did you become interested in playing the violin ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer played the piano before learning the violin at the age of three , you do n't really become interested in something .
piano played a role from the very beginning ; it was just there in the living room .
and in the neighboring village , there was a good violin teacher , and my mother knew that .
she had sent her own piano students there to find out whether he really was as good as everyone said .
so she sent me to him for lessons and he really was a fantastic instructor .
that 's why , even though i was really young , i made progress quickly and my interest grew . but you never neglected the piano . no , not entirely .
i enjoyed playing it too much .
for me , it was a hobby , just like it is for other people .
and maybe i needed it as a kind of outlet - just making music without thinking about a particular goal .
that was just free time ; i could play and practice whatever i wanted . were you able to take anything from the piano and apply it to the violin - or were they completely separate for you ? no , they go hand in hand .
i started playing violin repertoire on the piano , for example .
i learned the piano part to the brahms -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , and from the beethoven -lsb- violin -rsb- sonatas , too .
that gave me a completely different perspective and helped me a lot as far as learning the harmonic and polyphonic structure of a work . i learned the piano works by the same composers -lsb- whose works i played on the violin -rsb- .
there are 10 violin sonatas by beethoven , but 32 for piano .
and i had played 12 of them before i learned the first sonata for violin .
that made a lot of things easier . this month , a new dvd is coming out showing a concert where you played saint-saens ' third violin concerto and grieg 's piano concerto .
that sounds like a challenge ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer received violin lessons at a very young age yes , it was .
that would be a challenge for anyone .
but it was a one-time thing .
i do n't think i 'll be doing that very often - especially not both instruments on the same day .
besides , it was kind of a way to save face - if i had only played the piano and it did n't go well , then the people would have had a bad concert . i thought , if i play the violin too , then at least half of the concert would be good . -lrb- laughs -rrb- the point was n't to prove that i could play both instruments on the same evening . was there a reason why you performed first on the violin , then on the piano ? it 's very difficult to play the violin after you 've played the piano because the violin requires more fine motor skills and less strength .
it takes less muscle work - that 's why the fine motor skills do n't work so well after playing the piano .
