critics doubt it . one of the hot topics at this year 's iaa commercial vehicles trade show in hanover is the german governent 's nationwide " long truck " field trial planned some time next year .
the trails could lead to new regulations on semi-truck lengths , creating new business opportunities for both makers of long-haul transportation vehicles and logistics companies operating them .
experts say longer trucks could reduce trucking costs by 20 to 25 percent .
" we build long trucks , and the experience of our customers using them in scandinavia , the netherlands and other markets has been good , " detlef hug , a spokesman for german truck maker man , told deutsche welle .
" of course , germany has its own challenges like heavy traffic and hilly terrain .
so that 's why it is a good idea to conduct a nationwide field trial so that we can test fuel and co2 emission reduction , safety , the impact on car drivers and more . "
truck traffic to increase 70 percent there is a sense of political urgency in berlin .
the federal transportation ministry estimates that truck traffic - already choking numerous german highways - will increase by 70 percent over the next 15 years .
and no one knows where all those vehicles should go .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's autobahns look more like a truck parking lot these days three years ago , several german states launched their own field trials – with mixed results .
accompanying studies also painted a blurred picture .
one of the studies , by the technical rwth aachen university , concluded that long trucks are safe and would reduce emissions .
longer vehicles , it noted , hardly use more fuel than current shorter models ; only during acceleration does the additional load make the truck 's engine slightly less efficient .
but another study by the fraunhofer institute for systems and innovative research claimed that while long trucks could relieve roads and the environment in the short term , they would , in the long term , cause a shift from rail to road that would offset any benefits .
" we 're aware of the work the states have done and the results of their tests will flow into a joint working group between the federal and state transportation ministries , " a spokesman from the federal transportation ministry told deutsche welle .
" these tests , however , were on a small scale .
what is needed is a much larger field trial across the entire country to determine the impact on logistics . "
plenty of interest more than 300 companies , including man , have already registered to participate in the federal government 's planned nationwide test , though a final number of participants has yet to be set .
the goal is to test tractor-trailer combinations with a length of 25.25 meters -lrb- 83 feet -rrb- , or 6.5 meters -lrb- 21 feet -rrb- longer than currently allowed .
the gross weight of the vehicles will remain at the current 44 tons for semi-trucks or 44 for " intermodal " container trucks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man has a booth at the iaa commercial vehicles trade show in hanover " we have heard some talk about the planned nationwide field trial testing 60-ton vehicles , " the ministry spokesman said .
" we have no intention to change the weight .
this is all about increasing volume . "
long trucks , the spokesman said , would allow voluminous goods to be transported with one vehicle , for instance , instead of breaking down the item to transport it with three trucks .
critics of heavy and long 60-ton trucks point to a number of problems , such as the damage they could do to roads and bridges because of their added weight and the lack of sufficiently secure guard rails .
yet long trucks also have their critics , too .
" there are a number of issues to be concerned about , " said martin roggermann from the german pro-rail alliance .
" long trucks are more difficult to pass , they need more space for turning at intersections and do n't fit into the current autobahn parking facilities , not too mention safety issues . "
shift from road to rail but roggermann 's biggest bone of contention is that the expected lower operating costs of long trucks could undermine efforts by his organization and others to shift freight off the road and onto rail .
" we are really concerned about the shift from rail to the road , " he said .
" we do n't believe long trucks will result in fewer trucks but in more trucks and in more problems on german roads . "
moreover , roggermann and others worry that if 40-ton long trucks are allowed , it will only be a matter of time before 60-ton " gigaliners " roar down german roads .
scandinavia began with 40-ton vehicles and later allowed the heavier vehicles , he noted .
few experts will disagree that competition for road freight business has become cutthroat in europe , especially since recent eastward european union expansion .
and plenty of them admit that the prospect of allowing larger vehicles to carry more for less will only fuel that competition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 27.09.2010 limping into champions league fixture , bayern extend with van gaal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is to stay on in munich until the end of the 2011-2012 season fresh off a contract extension with coach louis van gaal , bayern munich are looking for redemption on tuesday in europe .
injury trouble and dysfunction in attack have meant their bundesliga campaign is a shambles . five goals , eight points , ninth place .
such is bayern munich 's meager return from the first six matches of the new bundesliga season .
in that bayern had got off to a slow start last year too before finishing as champions , players and club officials had , until recently , been leery of making critical statements .
since saturday 's 2-1 home loss to surprise league leaders mainz , all that has changed .
“ we have too many players who are n't playing up to their usual standard , ” said defender philipp lahm .
“ work-rate , aggressiveness , passion - we 're missing all of it at the moment , ” said bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
the loss left bayern 10 points adrift of mainz , and that wide margin appears to be ringing a few alarm bells on saebenerstrasse .
“ it 's going to be hard to make up for this deficit , ” lahm added in his post-game remarks .
“ we let happen precisely what we did n't want to happen .
it 's going to take a long time to make up 10 points . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's captain in south africa , lahm , speaks his mind at bayern too sitting prettier luckily for bayern , the champions league is a different story .
there , the bavarians can head to switzerland to take on fc basel with their heads held high .
as if to underscore the club 's confidence that all was not yet lost , bayern 's head coach , louis van gaal , signed a one-year contract extension in basel on monday .
the deal keeps him and his supporting cast of coaches on at the club through june 2012 .
two weeks ago , van gaal 's men broke down a dogged as roma defense and got a 2-0 win to top their group .
basel , meanwhile , stumbled to a 2-1 loss in romania to cfr cluj .
if bayern can manage a win at the st. jakob park on tuesday , they could stay in the driver 's seat in group e , with a potentially winnable home-and-away match-up with cluj next on the club 's docket .
some in the club are already looking to the champions league campaign as a corrective to the poor league start .
“ we need to stay calm , ” said hamit altintop , the turkey winger who has begun to see more playing time with franck ribery out injured for the coming weeks .
“ we won the first game and can afford to play it safe - we do n't have to go storming into attack from the get-go . ”
hurting for goals perhaps it would n't do much good to play things hell-for-leather .
it 's in attack that bayern have disappointed the most .
despite starting the potent likes of thomas mueller , toni kroos , ivica olic and miroslav klose on saturday , bayern failed to find the net - relying instead on a mainz own-goal to get on the scoreboard .
this is not to say bayern 's offensive front is n't able to keep the ball , or create chances .
indeed , they had more than 70 percent of the ball and shot it 15 times .
but many of those chances were not of a particularly high standard , and their shooting was poor .
bayern put the ball on target just four times .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben scored 23 goals and set up eight more for bayern last season it would seem that the missing creativity , not to mention finishing , of arjen robben is holding the team back .
the dutchman 's muscle tear will keep him out of the lineup until the new year , and now franck ribery 's injured ankle means he 'll miss another month at least .
bayern could use their offensive potency .
kroos and mueller filled in fairly effectively for robben and ribery on the two wings on saturday , but this left the side bereft of ideas in the middle , where neither strikers olic and klose , nor defensive midfielders bastian schweinsteiger and mark van bommel offered much creativity .
a change of system , perhaps one that brings mueller and / or kroos into the middle , may do the trick - and in truth , it will have to .
bayern 's small squad means that there are no further personnel options left for van gaal should he wish to shake up the offense .
about a month ago , during the transfer-rumor-mad silly season , big-name playmakers like rafael van de vaart were brought up in connection with bayern munich . van gaal told reporters then that he did n't feel he needed to go out and buy any players to bolster the squad .
“ alaba is better ! ” van gaal had said , referring to one of his favorite young charges , the 18-year-old austrian david alaba , who he 'd used as an emergency wingback last year , but whose real strength is in the offensive midfield .
it was a bold statement - but perhaps we 'd agree with him , if we could only see alaba play .
but that poor lad is hurt as well .

injury trouble and dysfunction in attack have meant their bundesliga campaign is a shambles . five goals , eight points , ninth place .
such is bayern munich 's meager return from the first six matches of the new bundesliga season .
in that bayern had got off to a slow start last year too before finishing as champions , players and club officials had , until recently , been leery of making critical statements .
since saturday 's 2-1 home loss to surprise league leaders mainz , all that has changed .
“ we have too many players who are n't playing up to their usual standard , ” said defender philipp lahm .
“ work-rate , aggressiveness , passion - we 're missing all of it at the moment , ” said bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
the loss left bayern 10 points adrift of mainz , and that wide margin appears to be ringing a few alarm bells on saebenerstrasse .
“ it 's going to be hard to make up for this deficit , ” lahm added in his post-game remarks .
“ we let happen precisely what we did n't want to happen .
it 's going to take a long time to make up 10 points . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's captain in south africa , lahm , speaks his mind at bayern too sitting prettier luckily for bayern , the champions league is a different story .
there , the bavarians can head to switzerland to take on fc basel with their heads held high .
as if to underscore the club 's confidence that all was not yet lost , bayern 's head coach , louis van gaal , signed a one-year contract extension in basel on monday .
the deal keeps him and his supporting cast of coaches on at the club through june 2012 .
two weeks ago , van gaal 's men broke down a dogged as roma defense and got a 2-0 win to top their group .
basel , meanwhile , stumbled to a 2-1 loss in romania to cfr cluj .
if bayern can manage a win at the st. jakob park on tuesday , they could stay in the driver 's seat in group e , with a potentially winnable home-and-away match-up with cluj next on the club 's docket .
some in the club are already looking to the champions league campaign as a corrective to the poor league start .
“ we need to stay calm , ” said hamit altintop , the turkey winger who has begun to see more playing time with franck ribery out injured for the coming weeks .
“ we won the first game and can afford to play it safe - we do n't have to go storming into attack from the get-go . ”
hurting for goals perhaps it would n't do much good to play things hell-for-leather .
it 's in attack that bayern have disappointed the most .
despite starting the potent likes of thomas mueller , toni kroos , ivica olic and miroslav klose on saturday , bayern failed to find the net - relying instead on a mainz own-goal to get on the scoreboard .
this is not to say bayern 's offensive front is n't able to keep the ball , or create chances .
indeed , they had more than 70 percent of the ball and shot it 15 times .
but many of those chances were not of a particularly high standard , and their shooting was poor .
bayern put the ball on target just four times .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben scored 23 goals and set up eight more for bayern last season it would seem that the missing creativity , not to mention finishing , of arjen robben is holding the team back .
the dutchman 's muscle tear will keep him out of the lineup until the new year , and now franck ribery 's injured ankle means he 'll miss another month at least .
bayern could use their offensive potency .
kroos and mueller filled in fairly effectively for robben and ribery on the two wings on saturday , but this left the side bereft of ideas in the middle , where neither strikers olic and klose , nor defensive midfielders bastian schweinsteiger and mark van bommel offered much creativity .
a change of system , perhaps one that brings mueller and / or kroos into the middle , may do the trick - and in truth , it will have to .
bayern 's small squad means that there are no further personnel options left for van gaal should he wish to shake up the offense .
about a month ago , during the transfer-rumor-mad silly season , big-name playmakers like rafael van de vaart were brought up in connection with bayern munich . van gaal told reporters then that he did n't feel he needed to go out and buy any players to bolster the squad .
“ alaba is better ! ” van gaal had said , referring to one of his favorite young charges , the 18-year-old austrian david alaba , who he 'd used as an emergency wingback last year , but whose real strength is in the offensive midfield .
it was a bold statement - but perhaps we 'd agree with him , if we could only see alaba play .
but that poor lad is hurt as well .

meanwhile , a ban on west bank construction has ended - the issue is a major sticking point in mideast peace talks . a ship carrying nine jewish activists from germany , britain , israel and the us set sail on sunday to deliver aid to the gaza strip .
the british boat " irene " departed sunday from famagusta in cyprus in protest against israel 's blockade of the palestinian territory .
the israeli foreign ministry called the move a " provocation . "
' a sacred duty ' the activists included 82-year-old holocaust survivor reuven moskovitz .
" it is a sacred duty for me , as a -lsb- holocaust -rsb- survivor , to protest against the persecution , the oppression and the imprisonment of so many people in gaza , including more than 800,000 children , " moskovitz said .
the trip - which was coordinated by the german organization jewish voice for just peace in the near east and the british group jews for justice for palestinians - intends to bring school supplies , musical instruments and fishing nets into gaza .
it comes after israel 's deadly raid of a gaza-bound aid ship last may , resulting in the deaths of nine turkish activists .
israeli defence minister ehud barak has repeatedly warned that israel will intercept any ship nearing gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's may interception of an aid ship proved deadly the activists have vowed to conduct a peaceful sit down should israeli military attempt to deter their entry to the gaza strip .
netanyahu urges restraint the launch of the aid ship on sunday came on the last day of israel 's freeze on settlement building in the occupied territories on the west bank .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu urged israeli settlers in a statement to exercise restraint after the moratorium expires – in an apparent bid to keep alive peace talks with the palestinians .
" the prime minister calls on the residents in judea and samaria -lsb- the west bank -rsb- and the political parties to show restraint and responsibility today and in the future exactly as they showed restraint and responsibility throughout the months of the freeze , " the statement read .
a ' 50-50 ' chance palestinian president mahmud abbas had earlier vowed to abandon peace talks should the jewish settlers recommence construction on occupied land , though he later said in an interview that he would remain in the talks with the agreement of the arab league .
" israel must choose between peace and the continuation of settlements , " he told the united nations in new york on saturday , denouncing israel 's " mentality of expansion and domination " in the west bank .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barak believes there is a 50 percent chance for the moratorium 's extension while abbas 's spokesman told reporters that there was no progress in a us-led push to extend the moratorium , israeli defence minister barak maintained until the last minute that an extension would be possible .
" i think that the chance of achieving a mutually agreed understanding about -lsb- a -rsb- moratorium is 50-50 , " barak said in a bbc interview in new york where he was meeting with us officials , adding , " i think that the chances of having a peace process is much higher . "
settlers to start new constructions as the official moratorium came to an end , israeli settlers were poised to begin construction on new developments in palestinian territory .
settlers and their supporters held a rally in the settlement of revava to mark the end of the freeze .
in another settlement the foundation stone for a new kindergarten was laid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settlement construction has been on hold for 10 months but it was not expected that there would be a massive surge in construction activity .
" we are getting back to business as usual and building but we will respect the prime minister 's request , " said david ha 'ivri , head of the samaria regional council .
over 430,000 jews live in more than 100 settlements across territory in the west bank and east jerusalem that israel captured from jordan in 1967 .

consumers will now also have warranty repair services in all eu countries . over the weekend , apple managed to defuse a potential legal tangle with the european union 's antitrust regulators by adjusting its iphone policies .
the company agreed to make warranty repair services equally available throughout european union countries , regardless of where a phone was purchased .
it also agreed to loosen restrictions on programming tools used to develop apps , the small programs designed to run on smartphones .
in doing so , the company avoided fines which could have been as high as 10 percent of its yearly turnover .
eu competition commissioner joaquin almunia said in a statement on saturday that " apple 's response to our preliminary investigations shows that the commission can use the competition rules to achieve swift results on the market with clear benefits for consumers . "
market changing rapidly but ian fogg , a london-based analyst for forrester research , said the market is changing at a fast pace , making it difficult for regulators to keep up .
apple 's app store was launched just over two years ago and has grown exponentially .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin almunia is the eu competition commissioner apple has at times struggled to bring consistency into the way it manages the apps in its store , fogg said .
he described apple 's app store as a " curated ecosystem " similar to the amazon kindle store or google 's market for android phone apps .
" i think it makes good business sense for any company that 's curating its ecosystem to be consistent and clear about what is and is n't allowed , because that level playing field enables firms to decide where to invest their efforts , " he told deutsche welle .
" apple 's challenge is the same challenge many firms have in that the products and the markets which are being created are so new that everyone is working out the rules as we go along . "
the european commission said the changes to apple 's policy towards iphone apps will remove limits to independent developers who sometimes were in competition with apple itself .
mobile warranty for mobile phones according to fogg , warranty repair policies vary in the consumer electronics market , but such policies carry added meaning for mobile products such as smartphones .
" for a mobile phone product , having the ability to have the product repaired wherever that person is is very important , " he said .
" it 's much more important for a mobile phone than it would be for a high-definition television , which is likely to be used in the same country that it 's bought in for all of its life . "

but the invasive searches have stirred privacy concerns . germany began its six-month test period of two full-body scanners at hamburg airport on monday as critics continued to denounce the technology as too invasive .
interior minister thomas de maiziere was one of the first to pass through one of the scanners , saying he did not feel cramped or uncomfortable inside .
“ today is an important step on the way to better security in german airports , ” he said .
the german interior ministry , which is responsible for the project , selected hamburg for the trial run under real airport conditions because it is large , but not so large that technical glitches would seriously disrupt the flow of passenger traffic .
hamburg is germany 's fifth largest airport and serves about 12 million passengers annually .
full-body scanners are already in use in the united states and several european countries but , due to widespread privacy concerns , germany has been slow to test the technology .
until now , the machines had only been tested in the laboratory at the federal police academy in luebeck .
the scanners use low-frequency electromagnetic waves to sweep a schematic representation of the human body to check for concealed weapons or explosives .
passengers walk through a three-meter -lrb- 10 foot -rrb- high and two-meter wide cabin and are scanned by the waves , which the machine 's manufacturer says are 10,000-times weaker than the ordinary electro-smog from cell phones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics , like peter schaar , warn that scanners are too invasive scanners ' too invasive ' , critics warn privacy advocates oppose the use of the technology because they say it is too invasive and could reveal embarrassing details about a passenger .
peter schaar , germany 's federal commissioner for data protection , cautioned that “ very sensitive areas ” of a person 's private life could be revealed , such as breast implants , colostomies or other medical aids .
security experts argue , however , that the scanners are indispensable because they detect things , like plastic explosives and ceramic weapons , which conventional metal detectors would not discover .
this has not stopped some countries , notably italy , from scrapping the scanners .
after a six-month trial at airports in rome , venice and palermo , the machines are no longer in use after being deemed too slow and ineffective .
" we did n't get good results during testing , ” said vito riggio , the president of italy 's aviation authority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 27.09.2010 long trucks long for germany 's autobahns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long and even possibly longer : germany considers long trucks with germany 's famed autobahns sometimes looking more like vast truck parking lots than motorways , the government is wondering whether fewer , longer trucks could reduce congestion and emissions .
critics doubt it . one of the hot topics at this year 's iaa commercial vehicles trade show in hanover is the german governent 's nationwide " long truck " field trial planned some time next year .
the trails could lead to new regulations on semi-truck lengths , creating new business opportunities for both makers of long-haul transportation vehicles and logistics companies operating them .
experts say longer trucks could reduce trucking costs by 20 to 25 percent .
" we build long trucks , and the experience of our customers using them in scandinavia , the netherlands and other markets has been good , " detlef hug , a spokesman for german truck maker man , told deutsche welle .
" of course , germany has its own challenges like heavy traffic and hilly terrain .
so that 's why it is a good idea to conduct a nationwide field trial so that we can test fuel and co2 emission reduction , safety , the impact on car drivers and more . "
truck traffic to increase 70 percent there is a sense of political urgency in berlin .
the federal transportation ministry estimates that truck traffic - already choking numerous german highways - will increase by 70 percent over the next 15 years .
and no one knows where all those vehicles should go .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's autobahns look more like a truck parking lot these days three years ago , several german states launched their own field trials – with mixed results .
accompanying studies also painted a blurred picture .
one of the studies , by the technical rwth aachen university , concluded that long trucks are safe and would reduce emissions .
longer vehicles , it noted , hardly use more fuel than current shorter models ; only during acceleration does the additional load make the truck 's engine slightly less efficient .
but another study by the fraunhofer institute for systems and innovative research claimed that while long trucks could relieve roads and the environment in the short term , they would , in the long term , cause a shift from rail to road that would offset any benefits .
" we 're aware of the work the states have done and the results of their tests will flow into a joint working group between the federal and state transportation ministries , " a spokesman from the federal transportation ministry told deutsche welle .
" these tests , however , were on a small scale .
what is needed is a much larger field trial across the entire country to determine the impact on logistics . "
plenty of interest more than 300 companies , including man , have already registered to participate in the federal government 's planned nationwide test , though a final number of participants has yet to be set .
the goal is to test tractor-trailer combinations with a length of 25.25 meters -lrb- 83 feet -rrb- , or 6.5 meters -lrb- 21 feet -rrb- longer than currently allowed .
the gross weight of the vehicles will remain at the current 44 tons for semi-trucks or 44 for " intermodal " container trucks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man has a booth at the iaa commercial vehicles trade show in hanover " we have heard some talk about the planned nationwide field trial testing 60-ton vehicles , " the ministry spokesman said .
" we have no intention to change the weight .
this is all about increasing volume . "
long trucks , the spokesman said , would allow voluminous goods to be transported with one vehicle , for instance , instead of breaking down the item to transport it with three trucks .
critics of heavy and long 60-ton trucks point to a number of problems , such as the damage they could do to roads and bridges because of their added weight and the lack of sufficiently secure guard rails .
yet long trucks also have their critics , too .
" there are a number of issues to be concerned about , " said martin roggermann from the german pro-rail alliance .
" long trucks are more difficult to pass , they need more space for turning at intersections and do n't fit into the current autobahn parking facilities , not too mention safety issues . "
shift from road to rail but roggermann 's biggest bone of contention is that the expected lower operating costs of long trucks could undermine efforts by his organization and others to shift freight off the road and onto rail .
" we are really concerned about the shift from rail to the road , " he said .
" we do n't believe long trucks will result in fewer trucks but in more trucks and in more problems on german roads . "
moreover , roggermann and others worry that if 40-ton long trucks are allowed , it will only be a matter of time before 60-ton " gigaliners " roar down german roads .
scandinavia began with 40-ton vehicles and later allowed the heavier vehicles , he noted .
few experts will disagree that competition for road freight business has become cutthroat in europe , especially since recent eastward european union expansion .
and plenty of them admit that the prospect of allowing larger vehicles to carry more for less will only fuel that competition .

but the invasive searches have stirred privacy concerns . germany began its six-month test period of two full-body scanners at hamburg airport on monday as critics continued to denounce the technology as too invasive .
interior minister thomas de maiziere was one of the first to pass through one of the scanners , saying he did not feel cramped or uncomfortable inside .
“ today is an important step on the way to better security in german airports , ” he said .
the german interior ministry , which is responsible for the project , selected hamburg for the trial run under real airport conditions because it is large , but not so large that technical glitches would seriously disrupt the flow of passenger traffic .
hamburg is germany 's fifth largest airport and serves about 12 million passengers annually .
full-body scanners are already in use in the united states and several european countries but , due to widespread privacy concerns , germany has been slow to test the technology .
until now , the machines had only been tested in the laboratory at the federal police academy in luebeck .
the scanners use low-frequency electromagnetic waves to sweep a schematic representation of the human body to check for concealed weapons or explosives .
passengers walk through a three-meter -lrb- 10 foot -rrb- high and two-meter wide cabin and are scanned by the waves , which the machine 's manufacturer says are 10,000-times weaker than the ordinary electro-smog from cell phones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics , like peter schaar , warn that scanners are too invasive scanners ' too invasive ' , critics warn privacy advocates oppose the use of the technology because they say it is too invasive and could reveal embarrassing details about a passenger .
peter schaar , germany 's federal commissioner for data protection , cautioned that “ very sensitive areas ” of a person 's private life could be revealed , such as breast implants , colostomies or other medical aids .
security experts argue , however , that the scanners are indispensable because they detect things , like plastic explosives and ceramic weapons , which conventional metal detectors would not discover .
this has not stopped some countries , notably italy , from scrapping the scanners .
after a six-month trial at airports in rome , venice and palermo , the machines are no longer in use after being deemed too slow and ineffective .
" we did n't get good results during testing , ” said vito riggio , the president of italy 's aviation authority .

consumers will now also have warranty repair services in all eu countries . over the weekend , apple managed to defuse a potential legal tangle with the european union 's antitrust regulators by adjusting its iphone policies .
the company agreed to make warranty repair services equally available throughout european union countries , regardless of where a phone was purchased .
it also agreed to loosen restrictions on programming tools used to develop apps , the small programs designed to run on smartphones .
in doing so , the company avoided fines which could have been as high as 10 percent of its yearly turnover .
eu competition commissioner joaquin almunia said in a statement on saturday that " apple 's response to our preliminary investigations shows that the commission can use the competition rules to achieve swift results on the market with clear benefits for consumers . "

apple 's app store was launched just over two years ago and has grown exponentially .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin almunia is the eu competition commissioner apple has at times struggled to bring consistency into the way it manages the apps in its store , fogg said .
he described apple 's app store as a " curated ecosystem " similar to the amazon kindle store or google 's market for android phone apps .
" i think it makes good business sense for any company that 's curating its ecosystem to be consistent and clear about what is and is n't allowed , because that level playing field enables firms to decide where to invest their efforts , " he told deutsche welle .
" apple 's challenge is the same challenge many firms have in that the products and the markets which are being created are so new that everyone is working out the rules as we go along . "
the european commission said the changes to apple 's policy towards iphone apps will remove limits to independent developers who sometimes were in competition with apple itself .
mobile warranty for mobile phones according to fogg , warranty repair policies vary in the consumer electronics market , but such policies carry added meaning for mobile products such as smartphones .
" for a mobile phone product , having the ability to have the product repaired wherever that person is is very important , " he said .
" it 's much more important for a mobile phone than it would be for a high-definition television , which is likely to be used in the same country that it 's bought in for all of its life . "

meanwhile , a ban on west bank construction has ended - the issue is a major sticking point in mideast peace talks . a ship carrying nine jewish activists from germany , britain , israel and the us set sail on sunday to deliver aid to the gaza strip .
the british boat " irene " departed sunday from famagusta in cyprus in protest against israel 's blockade of the palestinian territory .
the israeli foreign ministry called the move a " provocation . "
' a sacred duty ' the activists included 82-year-old holocaust survivor reuven moskovitz .
" it is a sacred duty for me , as a -lsb- holocaust -rsb- survivor , to protest against the persecution , the oppression and the imprisonment of so many people in gaza , including more than 800,000 children , " moskovitz said .
the trip - which was coordinated by the german organization jewish voice for just peace in the near east and the british group jews for justice for palestinians - intends to bring school supplies , musical instruments and fishing nets into gaza .
it comes after israel 's deadly raid of a gaza-bound aid ship last may , resulting in the deaths of nine turkish activists .
israeli defence minister ehud barak has repeatedly warned that israel will intercept any ship nearing gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's may interception of an aid ship proved deadly the activists have vowed to conduct a peaceful sit down should israeli military attempt to deter their entry to the gaza strip .
netanyahu urges restraint the launch of the aid ship on sunday came on the last day of israel 's freeze on settlement building in the occupied territories on the west bank .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu urged israeli settlers in a statement to exercise restraint after the moratorium expires – in an apparent bid to keep alive peace talks with the palestinians .
" the prime minister calls on the residents in judea and samaria -lsb- the west bank -rsb- and the political parties to show restraint and responsibility today and in the future exactly as they showed restraint and responsibility throughout the months of the freeze , " the statement read .
a ' 50-50 ' chance palestinian president mahmud abbas had earlier vowed to abandon peace talks should the jewish settlers recommence construction on occupied land , though he later said in an interview that he would remain in the talks with the agreement of the arab league .
" israel must choose between peace and the continuation of settlements , " he told the united nations in new york on saturday , denouncing israel 's " mentality of expansion and domination " in the west bank .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barak believes there is a 50 percent chance for the moratorium 's extension while abbas 's spokesman told reporters that there was no progress in a us-led push to extend the moratorium , israeli defence minister barak maintained until the last minute that an extension would be possible .
" i think that the chance of achieving a mutually agreed understanding about -lsb- a -rsb- moratorium is 50-50 , " barak said in a bbc interview in new york where he was meeting with us officials , adding , " i think that the chances of having a peace process is much higher . "
settlers to start new constructions as the official moratorium came to an end , israeli settlers were poised to begin construction on new developments in palestinian territory .
settlers and their supporters held a rally in the settlement of revava to mark the end of the freeze .
in another settlement the foundation stone for a new kindergarten was laid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settlement construction has been on hold for 10 months but it was not expected that there would be a massive surge in construction activity .
" we are getting back to business as usual and building but we will respect the prime minister 's request , " said david ha 'ivri , head of the samaria regional council .
over 430,000 jews live in more than 100 settlements across territory in the west bank and east jerusalem that israel captured from jordan in 1967 .

speaking to the european parliament 's economic affairs committee , european central bank president jean-claude trichet warned that current oversight on eu states ' budgets is too lax , and called for a board of " wise men and women " to watch over budget discipline .

the european commission is to lay out the details of its enforcement plan on wednesday .
reports say rehn would propose fines of 0.2 percent of gdp for countries who repeatedly fail to comply with financial rules .
in addition , countries with slipping competitiveness or whose growth is based on " excessive imbalances " like the credit boom in the baltic states would receive fines of 0.1 percent of gdp .
" sanctions ... need to be triggered early enough in the process so that they are essentially preventive , " rehn said monday .
" this is very important in order to ensure fiscal discipline , and sustainable growth in the eu . "
germany advocates harshness germany , traditionally one of the most fiscally conservative eu members , weighed in on the enforcement plan with finance minister wolfgang schaeuble writing a letter to his counterparts in the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de consumer electronics -pipe- 27.09.2010 apple sidesteps eu probe with changes to iphone policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple iphone warranties will now apply throughout the eu the european commission has dropped a probe into apple after the company agreed to change its policy toward iphone app developers .
consumers will now also have warranty repair services in all eu countries . over the weekend , apple managed to defuse a potential legal tangle with the european union 's antitrust regulators by adjusting its iphone policies .
the company agreed to make warranty repair services equally available throughout european union countries , regardless of where a phone was purchased .
it also agreed to loosen restrictions on programming tools used to develop apps , the small programs designed to run on smartphones .
in doing so , the company avoided fines which could have been as high as 10 percent of its yearly turnover .
eu competition commissioner joaquin almunia said in a statement on saturday that " apple 's response to our preliminary investigations shows that the commission can use the competition rules to achieve swift results on the market with clear benefits for consumers . "
market changing rapidly but ian fogg , a london-based analyst for forrester research , said the market is changing at a fast pace , making it difficult for regulators to keep up .
apple 's app store was launched just over two years ago and has grown exponentially .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin almunia is the eu competition commissioner apple has at times struggled to bring consistency into the way it manages the apps in its store , fogg said .
he described apple 's app store as a " curated ecosystem " similar to the amazon kindle store or google 's market for android phone apps .
" i think it makes good business sense for any company that 's curating its ecosystem to be consistent and clear about what is and is n't allowed , because that level playing field enables firms to decide where to invest their efforts , " he told deutsche welle .
" apple 's challenge is the same challenge many firms have in that the products and the markets which are being created are so new that everyone is working out the rules as we go along . "
the european commission said the changes to apple 's policy towards iphone apps will remove limits to independent developers who sometimes were in competition with apple itself .
mobile warranty for mobile phones according to fogg , warranty repair policies vary in the consumer electronics market , but such policies carry added meaning for mobile products such as smartphones .
" for a mobile phone product , having the ability to have the product repaired wherever that person is is very important , " he said .
" it 's much more important for a mobile phone than it would be for a high-definition television , which is likely to be used in the same country that it 's bought in for all of its life . "

sejdiu , a 58-year-old former law professor , was elected twice to the presidency - a mainly ceremonial position .
but he remained head of the democratic league of kosovo -lrb- ldk -rrb- - the second largest party and currently the junior partner in prime minister hashim thaci 's government .
the court decision , published on friday , found sejdiu 's dual role to be in " serious violation " of the constitution .
thirty-two members of parliament had filed a legal complaint .
speaking to reporters on monday , sejdiu said he disagreed with the court 's ruling but would respect it .
" over these years i have worked so that the republic of kosovo would have democratic institutions , " he said .
" i was convinced that keeping the function of the president of the democratic league of kosovo without exercising it did not violate the constitution .
the court had a different opinion and i respect the ruling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sejdiu 's ldk party is part of prime minister hasim thaci 's coalition government talks with serbia sejdiu 's resignation comes weeks after serbia , which has not recognized kosovo following its 2008 unilateral declaration of independence , said it would hold direct talks with pristina on practical matters .
belgrade 's refusal to recognize kosovo as an independent country is a major stumbling block to its goal of joining the european union .
meanwhile kosovo was given a major boost by the international court of justice in july , which found its secession from serbia to be in line with international law .
seventy countries currently recognize kosovo 's independence , including the majority of the european union 's 27 member states , as well as the united states .
under a provision in kosovo 's constitution , the speaker of parliament , jakup krasniqi , is to become interim president while parliament has 60 days to appoint a permanent replacement .

critics doubt it . one of the hot topics at this year 's iaa commercial vehicles trade show in hanover is the german governent 's nationwide " long truck " field trial planned some time next year .
the trails could lead to new regulations on semi-truck lengths , creating new business opportunities for both makers of long-haul transportation vehicles and logistics companies operating them .
experts say longer trucks could reduce trucking costs by 20 to 25 percent .
" we build long trucks , and the experience of our customers using them in scandinavia , the netherlands and other markets has been good , " detlef hug , a spokesman for german truck maker man , told deutsche welle .
" of course , germany has its own challenges like heavy traffic and hilly terrain .
so that 's why it is a good idea to conduct a nationwide field trial so that we can test fuel and co2 emission reduction , safety , the impact on car drivers and more . "
truck traffic to increase 70 percent there is a sense of political urgency in berlin .
the federal transportation ministry estimates that truck traffic - already choking numerous german highways - will increase by 70 percent over the next 15 years .
and no one knows where all those vehicles should go .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's autobahns look more like a truck parking lot these days three years ago , several german states launched their own field trials – with mixed results .
accompanying studies also painted a blurred picture .
one of the studies , by the technical rwth aachen university , concluded that long trucks are safe and would reduce emissions .
longer vehicles , it noted , hardly use more fuel than current shorter models ; only during acceleration does the additional load make the truck 's engine slightly less efficient .
but another study by the fraunhofer institute for systems and innovative research claimed that while long trucks could relieve roads and the environment in the short term , they would , in the long term , cause a shift from rail to road that would offset any benefits .
" we 're aware of the work the states have done and the results of their tests will flow into a joint working group between the federal and state transportation ministries , " a spokesman from the federal transportation ministry told deutsche welle .
" these tests , however , were on a small scale .
what is needed is a much larger field trial across the entire country to determine the impact on logistics . "
plenty of interest more than 300 companies , including man , have already registered to participate in the federal government 's planned nationwide test , though a final number of participants has yet to be set .
the goal is to test tractor-trailer combinations with a length of 25.25 meters -lrb- 83 feet -rrb- , or 6.5 meters -lrb- 21 feet -rrb- longer than currently allowed .
the gross weight of the vehicles will remain at the current 44 tons for semi-trucks or 44 for " intermodal " container trucks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man has a booth at the iaa commercial vehicles trade show in hanover " we have heard some talk about the planned nationwide field trial testing 60-ton vehicles , " the ministry spokesman said .
" we have no intention to change the weight .
this is all about increasing volume . "
long trucks , the spokesman said , would allow voluminous goods to be transported with one vehicle , for instance , instead of breaking down the item to transport it with three trucks .
critics of heavy and long 60-ton trucks point to a number of problems , such as the damage they could do to roads and bridges because of their added weight and the lack of sufficiently secure guard rails .
yet long trucks also have their critics , too .
" there are a number of issues to be concerned about , " said martin roggermann from the german pro-rail alliance .
" long trucks are more difficult to pass , they need more space for turning at intersections and do n't fit into the current autobahn parking facilities , not too mention safety issues . "
shift from road to rail but roggermann 's biggest bone of contention is that the expected lower operating costs of long trucks could undermine efforts by his organization and others to shift freight off the road and onto rail .
" we are really concerned about the shift from rail to the road , " he said .
" we do n't believe long trucks will result in fewer trucks but in more trucks and in more problems on german roads . "
moreover , roggermann and others worry that if 40-ton long trucks are allowed , it will only be a matter of time before 60-ton " gigaliners " roar down german roads .
scandinavia began with 40-ton vehicles and later allowed the heavier vehicles , he noted .
few experts will disagree that competition for road freight business has become cutthroat in europe , especially since recent eastward european union expansion .
and plenty of them admit that the prospect of allowing larger vehicles to carry more for less will only fuel that competition .

' pits gritty germany against explosive italy in its culture capital year , germany 's ruhr region is honoring its most distinguished musical son - composer hans werner henze - with a plethora of concerts and events known collectively as " the henze project . " born in the german town of guetersloh in 1926 , hans werner henze is one of germany 's greatest living composers and one of the most significant figures of 20th century classical music .
he 's also been the initiator of numerous projects designed to encourage and nurture young musical talent .
most notably , in 1976 , he founded the cantiere internazionale d 'arte summer academy in montepulciano , which remains a benchmark for progressive music teaching the world over . now , the ruhr valley is honoring henze with a plethora of concerts and events , known collectively as " the henze project . "
in keeping with the composer 's long-standing commitment to encouraging young talent , the jewel in the project 's crown is a new work devised for and with young people . a new composition composed in collaboration with the writers michael kerstan and christian lehnert , " gisela ! - or , the strange and memorable paths of happiness , " is performed by a colorful mix of up-and-coming talent and established professional innovators . several parts are taken by students of essen 's folkswang university , the choir is a youth group from dortmund , and the regional youth ensemble has worked together with cutting-edge contemporary music outfit musikfabrik to create its own distinctive sound . asked by deutsche welle why his work with young people was so important to him , henze answered rather enigmatically : " people are like cats .
when a cat has a litter , all of the kittens are different . each one has a different design , although they come from the same father and mother .
the same goes for -lsb- young -rsb- musicians . "
he said he sees himself not as a teacher , but as an " ally , " henze added .
from che guevara to gisela from oberhausen one noticeable difference between the octogenarian maestro and the up-and-coming generation of composers is that whereas henze 's career has been likened to a seismograph through which the great political and social upheavals of the twentieth century can be read , critics often bemoan the lack of political engagement among contemporary musicians and artists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henze is a national treasure - and an expatriot for his part , henze theorized that political engagement has waned along with certain cultural heroes .
" i think there 's been a sort of withdrawal , " henze said .
" in a funny way , i think it has a lot to do with the death of figures like ernesto -lsb- che -rsb- guevara and rudi dutschke .
somehow , these deaths were followed by a feeling of helplessness , a powerlessness to rebel , however necessary rebellion may be . " henze , who knew both the argentinean revolutionary and the leader of the 1968 german student movement personally , said the political content of his work has never been intentional , but has rather stemmed from his interest in people and his sensitivity to the world around him . music should not be written for an elite , henze insists .
instead , " it should try to reach as wide , and as deep as it can . " from sunny naples to grey oberhausen set in the heartland of germany 's industrial ruhr valley , " gisela ! " looks set to succeed in reaching out to a wider audience by tapping into discourse of regional identity , brought about by essen 's european capital of culture status . " gisela ! " is the story of the eponymous protagonist , a young woman from oberhausen who visits naples with her boyfriend hanspeter , only to fall in love with gennaro , a charismatic italian with a penchant for commedia dell 'arte-style mischief .
determined to prove that her hometown is not the grim and grimy industrial landscape of genarro 's prejudice , but rather part of a sparkling new european capital of culture , gisela takes her new lover home with her . the basic story line could have been drafted by the local tourist board , but the conclusion is a bit more enigmatic .
the inevitable confrontation between the rival lovers is interrupted by the joyful explosion of vesuvius in approbation of gisela 's union with gennaro .
germany 's brand new culture capital seems to have won the blessing of italy 's noble cultural tradition .
however , as the curtain falls , the volcano begins to rain dark ash .
although , in the words of his long-term collaborator michael kerstan , he 's " still very much a german personality , " hans werner henze left germany in 1956 , making italy his permanent home .
unlike gisela , henze has no intentions of returning permanently .

but whether true unity has been achieved depends on whom you ask .
we examine what reunification does and could mean . one important measure of today 's undivided germany is economic , and on this score , as on so many others , the picture is mixed . huge strides have been made in the past twenty years .
just about every eastern german city and town has been thoroughly renovated .
and while income and other economic indices in the east are only 70 to 80 percent of what they are in the west , costs of living - especially for rent - are commensurately lower , so one could argue most eastern germans are n't that much worse off than their western fellow citizens . " silicon saxony " with its computer chips , and the optical industry in and around the city of jena in thuringia , are two examples of eastern industrial success . " i 'm very impressed with how the people in germany 's new states mastered the considerable challenges after 1989 , " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , who helped negotiate the original unification treaty , told deutsche welle .
" i 'm not disappointed at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some high-tech industries have flourished in the east but not everyone 's a winner .
as of july 2010 , unemployment in the east -lrb- 11.5 % -rrb- was nearly double what it was in the west -lrb- 6.6 % -rrb- , and an astonishing 50 percent of the 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 103 billion -rrb- in annual developmental subsidies transferred from west to east is eaten up by social benefits and welfare payments . " unfortunately , economic processes do n't work along the lines of what is just , " richard schroeder - a respected former professor of philosophy and theology at berlin 's humboldt university - said at a major conference earlier this year .
" we have large numbers of people who were n't pillars of the old system but whose situations have gotten a lot worse after the economic caesura . " some 1.6 million people have relocated from east to west since 1990 , most in search of better job opportunities , and that trend shows no sign of letting up .
moreover , sociologists speak of a " brain drain " from the east since it 's the better educated who make up the majority of those who leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty apartment blocks are a common sight in hoyerswerda it 's not uncommon to see unneeded housing units being torn down in eastern cities .
the most extreme example is hoyerswerda near germany 's border with poland and the czech republic , which has lost half of its population in the past decade . in these respects , two different economic subsets continue to exist .
and dissatisfaction with such differences and inequities has manifested itself politically . the rise and fragmentation of the left the incorporation of what germans call the " new states " into the political system of the federal republic has wrought changes few would have anticipated back in 1990 . the current german chancellor , angela merkel , hails from the east , although many germans tend to forget that fact .
and though most eastern germans vote for one of the western parties , others have sought their own alternative . the left party , the successor to the old socialist party in communist east germany , combined with left-wing fringe parties from the west , has established itself as a mouthpiece for disgruntled easterners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi -lrb- right -rrb- and westerner oskar lafontaine led the left party to prominence " reunification had a structural flaw in that the elites of the east were n't accepted , and not just the political elites , but the pedagogical , scientific and artistic elites as well , " left party parliamentary leader gregor gysi told deutsche welle .
" in the beginning , they had no time for my party , but they were rebuffed and forced back to us because the other parties were n't prepared to accept them . " the ironic result is that while the spd and the greens are leery of cooperating with former communists , the political left is bifurcated , helping merkel 's center-right government to hold on to power . the establishment of the left party as a form of peaceful political protest can be seen as evidence of eastern germans ' adoption of western democracy .
but it has also deepened many western germans ' sense of a cultural divide between them and their fellow citizens . ost- and westalgia one unambiguously positive aspect of reunification has been the removal of political barriers that kept many german families painfully separated during the cold war .
there are no exact figures for how many west and east germans had relatives in the " other " germany , but an average of 26 million care packages were sent annually from west to east during germany 's division - an indication of the personal hardships caused by political division . " those who felt imprisoned were overjoyed at an end to their suffering , " says brigitte klump , an author whose private petitions to the united nations over the course of many years helped some 4,000 people leave communist east germany .
" and naturally i still feel joy when i hear from people who succeeded in integrating into the west . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are n't many east-west marriages ostalgia - eastern germans ' supposed longing for the way things were - is a regular topic in the media , but in polls only around ten percent of easterners say they preferred life under socialism .
and eastern germans ' self-identification as a group decreases the later they were born . meanwhile , around half of western germans say the time before 1989 was better than afterward .
this reflects their fond memories of a period of affluence and clear social consensus and suggests that " westalgia " is far more prevalent than its eastern equivalent . partnerships between eastern and western germans make up only around four percent of all german marriages .
this may be due to the fact that most germans still stay in the places they grew up and maintain long-term social circles .
but the number of " ossis " and " wessis " tying the knot lags significantly behind that of germans and foreigners . " thanks to reunification , germany as a whole has gotten a lot more diverse , and feelings of togetherness have grown , " wolfgang schaeuble said .
" what we still need is time , patience , including patience with one another , and the experience of having successfully solved problems together . " the global factor one oft-neglected aspect of reunification is the contributions made by residents who do not hold german passports and the effects it had on them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners are also part of the story foreigners account for roughly eight percent of germany 's population , and with the removal of the east-west political divide , german society became much more multicultural , with large communities from eastern europe joining the substantial turkish minority that had established itself in the post-war federal republic . " the german immigrant nation is one of many nationalities , including germans from the old federal republic , others from the former east , millions of ethnic germans from eastern europe as well as an immigrant population of non-german descent , " said germany 's leading immigration expert klaus bade .
" former ' guest workers ' make up the majority , but there are also lots of smaller groups from an ever greater variety of backgrounds . " foreigners have an inestimable impact on today 's german society , and immigration is crucial in offsetting population decline , as both western and eastern germans are having fewer and fewer children . but after a boom immediately following the end of the cold war , the number of foreigners in germany has stagnated .
economists and sociologists see this as a worrisome trend because germany needs to increase its workforce to compensate for the aging population entering retirement . two decades on from 1990 , it is more apparent than ever that " reunification " is not a restoration of a past society , but a process of creating something new that is inextricable from globalization .
old national paradigms are coming under ever increasing challenges , so the future of the new federal republic is likely to be influenced just as much by factors from abroad as from within its own borders . author : jefferson chase editor : kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the global factor one oft-neglected aspect of reunification is the contributions made by residents who do not hold german passports and the effects it had on them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners are also part of the story foreigners account for roughly eight percent of germany 's population , and with the removal of the east-west political divide , german society became much more multicultural , with large communities from eastern europe joining the substantial turkish minority that had established itself in the post-war federal republic . " the german immigrant nation is one of many nationalities , including germans from the old federal republic , others from the former east , millions of ethnic germans from eastern europe as well as an immigrant population of non-german descent , " said germany 's leading immigration expert klaus bade .
" former ' guest workers ' make up the majority , but there are also lots of smaller groups from an ever greater variety of backgrounds . " foreigners have an inestimable impact on today 's german society , and immigration is crucial in offsetting population decline , as both western and eastern germans are having fewer and fewer children . but after a boom immediately following the end of the cold war , the number of foreigners in germany has stagnated .
economists and sociologists see this as a worrisome trend because germany needs to increase its workforce to compensate for the aging population entering retirement . two decades on from 1990 , it is more apparent than ever that " reunification " is not a restoration of a past society , but a process of creating something new that is inextricable from globalization .
old national paradigms are coming under ever increasing challenges , so the future of the new federal republic is likely to be influenced just as much by factors from abroad as from within its own borders . author : jefferson chase editor : kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opposition parties claim the package will make the poor poorer . german labor minister ursula von der leyen has defended a minimal rise in welfare payments against sharp criticism from opposition parties and trade unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 5 euro increase per month has been branded derisory " the rates are very fair , " she told the daily bild newspaper , following criticism of a rise of 5 euros -lrb- $ 6.70 -rrb- a month which had been agreed by the coalition on sunday .
currently , germany 's 6.5 million " hartz iv " welfare recipients receive up to 359 euros per month .
" the federal statistical office analyzed what people on low earnings were able to spend each month , " said von der leyen , citing sales staff , janitors and hairdressers as examples .
" the calculations show accurately what the subsistence level is . "
' bad news for welfare recipients ' trade unions , as well as opposition parties such as the social democrats and greens , have warned that the rise is not enough and means that the poor will drift deeper into economic difficulties .
however , christian democrat von der leyen said that welfare rates had to be compared with lower level incomes in the working population .
" whoever demands that hartz iv should be higher must justify it by looking at the statistical data , compared with employees who work full time , " said the minister .
" those employees pay for hartz iv through their taxes and , in the end , many of them do not have much more money to spare -lsb- than hartz iv recipients -rsb- . "
no tobacco and alcohol allowance von der leyen defended the fact that the hartz iv would no longer provide an allowance for alcohol and tobacco .
while provision for basic needs was " sacrosanct , " she said , such products did not fall into this category .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will no longer be an allowance for alcohol or cigarettes the minister argued that any attempt by opposition parties to block the reforms in germany 's upper house - the bundesrat , where the ruling coalition has no majority - could not be justified .
chancellor angela merkel and party leaders from coalition partners the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- met to agree the changes on sunday .
monthly benefits for children are set to remain the same at 215 euros , 251 euros and 287 euros for children under age six , aged six to 14 and 14-18 , respectively .
however , the reforms include plans for " non-cash " benefits , such as a chip card that gives needy children access to educational and recreational services .

not a month after israeli-palestinian peace talks resumed , their future is in jeopardy . palestinian president mahmoud abbas delayed a decision on withdrawing from direct peace talks with israel on monday as france voiced strong support for the palestinian position .
after meeting with abbas in paris , french president nicolas sarkozy told reporters that france regretted that israel had not listened to " unanimous calls " to extend a 10-month freeze on israeli settlement construction in the west bank .
the settlement freeze " should have been extended to give negotiations a chance , " sarkozy said .

" the position of the eu is very clear : settlements are illegal under international law , constitute an obstacle to peace and threaten to make a two-state solution impossible , " kocijancic told german news agency dpa . the united states also expressed disappointment that the settlement freeze had not been extended and announced that its middle east envoy george mitchell was on his way to the region to restart negotiations . the eu and the united states make up half of the middle east quartet charged with pursuing a peace solution .
the other members of the quartet are russia and the united nations .
settlements continue to expand bulldozers in at least two west bank settlements resumed work early on monday just hours after the moratorium expired .
the palestinian leadership had repeatedly threatened to pull out of direct peace talks with israel if the settlements continued to expand .
but abbas said there would be no official palestinian answer to the construction resumption until after a meeting with top arab diplomats on october 4 .
" after all these meetings we may be able to issue a position to clarify what is the palestinian and arab opinion on this matter , after israel has refused to freeze settlements , " he said .
" we will not have swift reactions now . "
sarkozy also invited abbas , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and egyptian president hosni mubarak to meet in paris before the end of october .
bildunterschrift : abbas and sarkouy urged israel to extend its settlement freeze peace talks on the line the settlement construction threatened to end the first direct negotiations since 2008 between israel and the palestinians , which began in washington nearly four weeks ago .
netanyahu said in a statement shortly before the construction freeze expired that israel was " ready to pursue continuous contacts in the coming days to find a way to continue peace talks . "
the united states also said its position that the settlement freeze should continue had not changed .
state department spokesman p.j. crowley said the us is " in close touch with both parties and will be meeting with them again in the coming days . "
from the palestinian point of view , israeli settlements in the west bank are a major barrier to the peace process .
palestinian leaders say the settlements will make the creation of a viable independent state impossible .
most of the international community considers israeli settlements in the west bank to be in violation of international law , but israel insists they are legitimate .

critics doubt it . one of the hot topics at this year 's iaa commercial vehicles trade show in hanover is the german governent 's nationwide " long truck " field trial planned some time next year .
the trails could lead to new regulations on semi-truck lengths , creating new business opportunities for both makers of long-haul transportation vehicles and logistics companies operating them .
experts say longer trucks could reduce trucking costs by 20 to 25 percent .
" we build long trucks , and the experience of our customers using them in scandinavia , the netherlands and other markets has been good , " detlef hug , a spokesman for german truck maker man , told deutsche welle .
" of course , germany has its own challenges like heavy traffic and hilly terrain .
so that 's why it is a good idea to conduct a nationwide field trial so that we can test fuel and co2 emission reduction , safety , the impact on car drivers and more . "
truck traffic to increase 70 percent there is a sense of political urgency in berlin .
the federal transportation ministry estimates that truck traffic - already choking numerous german highways - will increase by 70 percent over the next 15 years .
and no one knows where all those vehicles should go .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's autobahns look more like a truck parking lot these days three years ago , several german states launched their own field trials – with mixed results .
accompanying studies also painted a blurred picture .
one of the studies , by the technical rwth aachen university , concluded that long trucks are safe and would reduce emissions .
longer vehicles , it noted , hardly use more fuel than current shorter models ; only during acceleration does the additional load make the truck 's engine slightly less efficient .
but another study by the fraunhofer institute for systems and innovative research claimed that while long trucks could relieve roads and the environment in the short term , they would , in the long term , cause a shift from rail to road that would offset any benefits .
" we 're aware of the work the states have done and the results of their tests will flow into a joint working group between the federal and state transportation ministries , " a spokesman from the federal transportation ministry told deutsche welle .
" these tests , however , were on a small scale .
what is needed is a much larger field trial across the entire country to determine the impact on logistics . "
plenty of interest more than 300 companies , including man , have already registered to participate in the federal government 's planned nationwide test , though a final number of participants has yet to be set .
the goal is to test tractor-trailer combinations with a length of 25.25 meters -lrb- 83 feet -rrb- , or 6.5 meters -lrb- 21 feet -rrb- longer than currently allowed .
the gross weight of the vehicles will remain at the current 44 tons for semi-trucks or 44 for " intermodal " container trucks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man has a booth at the iaa commercial vehicles trade show in hanover " we have heard some talk about the planned nationwide field trial testing 60-ton vehicles , " the ministry spokesman said .
" we have no intention to change the weight .
this is all about increasing volume . "
long trucks , the spokesman said , would allow voluminous goods to be transported with one vehicle , for instance , instead of breaking down the item to transport it with three trucks .
critics of heavy and long 60-ton trucks point to a number of problems , such as the damage they could do to roads and bridges because of their added weight and the lack of sufficiently secure guard rails .
yet long trucks also have their critics , too .
" there are a number of issues to be concerned about , " said martin roggermann from the german pro-rail alliance .
" long trucks are more difficult to pass , they need more space for turning at intersections and do n't fit into the current autobahn parking facilities , not too mention safety issues . "
shift from road to rail but roggermann 's biggest bone of contention is that the expected lower operating costs of long trucks could undermine efforts by his organization and others to shift freight off the road and onto rail .
" we are really concerned about the shift from rail to the road , " he said .
" we do n't believe long trucks will result in fewer trucks but in more trucks and in more problems on german roads . "
moreover , roggermann and others worry that if 40-ton long trucks are allowed , it will only be a matter of time before 60-ton " gigaliners " roar down german roads .
scandinavia began with 40-ton vehicles and later allowed the heavier vehicles , he noted .
few experts will disagree that competition for road freight business has become cutthroat in europe , especially since recent eastward european union expansion .
and plenty of them admit that the prospect of allowing larger vehicles to carry more for less will only fuel that competition .

we women are the other half in society . - blue , us all kind of religious signs including christian cross , jewish side curls , and the headscarf should be banned out of the public domain . - lutz , germany french senate approves burqa ban as far as i 'm concerned there is no government on earth that has the right to tell any person what they can or can not wear at any given time .
i also firmly believe that there is no place in politics for anything resembling religion .
as far as i 'm concerned this law infringes on people 's basic human rights to wear whatever they want .

injury trouble and dysfunction in attack have meant their bundesliga campaign is a shambles . five goals , eight points , ninth place .
such is bayern munich 's meager return from the first six matches of the new bundesliga season .
in that bayern had got off to a slow start last year too before finishing as champions , players and club officials had , until recently , been leery of making critical statements .
since saturday 's 2-1 home loss to surprise league leaders mainz , all that has changed .
“ we have too many players who are n't playing up to their usual standard , ” said defender philipp lahm .
“ work-rate , aggressiveness , passion - we 're missing all of it at the moment , ” said bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
the loss left bayern 10 points adrift of mainz , and that wide margin appears to be ringing a few alarm bells on saebenerstrasse .
“ it 's going to be hard to make up for this deficit , ” lahm added in his post-game remarks .
“ we let happen precisely what we did n't want to happen .
it 's going to take a long time to make up 10 points . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's captain in south africa , lahm , speaks his mind at bayern too sitting prettier luckily for bayern , the champions league is a different story .
there , the bavarians can head to switzerland to take on fc basel with their heads held high .
as if to underscore the club 's confidence that all was not yet lost , bayern 's head coach , louis van gaal , signed a one-year contract extension in basel on monday .
the deal keeps him and his supporting cast of coaches on at the club through june 2012 .
two weeks ago , van gaal 's men broke down a dogged as roma defense and got a 2-0 win to top their group .
basel , meanwhile , stumbled to a 2-1 loss in romania to cfr cluj .
if bayern can manage a win at the st. jakob park on tuesday , they could stay in the driver 's seat in group e , with a potentially winnable home-and-away match-up with cluj next on the club 's docket .
some in the club are already looking to the champions league campaign as a corrective to the poor league start .
“ we need to stay calm , ” said hamit altintop , the turkey winger who has begun to see more playing time with franck ribery out injured for the coming weeks .
“ we won the first game and can afford to play it safe - we do n't have to go storming into attack from the get-go . ”
hurting for goals perhaps it would n't do much good to play things hell-for-leather .
it 's in attack that bayern have disappointed the most .
despite starting the potent likes of thomas mueller , toni kroos , ivica olic and miroslav klose on saturday , bayern failed to find the net - relying instead on a mainz own-goal to get on the scoreboard .
this is not to say bayern 's offensive front is n't able to keep the ball , or create chances .
indeed , they had more than 70 percent of the ball and shot it 15 times .
but many of those chances were not of a particularly high standard , and their shooting was poor .
bayern put the ball on target just four times .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben scored 23 goals and set up eight more for bayern last season it would seem that the missing creativity , not to mention finishing , of arjen robben is holding the team back .
the dutchman 's muscle tear will keep him out of the lineup until the new year , and now franck ribery 's injured ankle means he 'll miss another month at least .
bayern could use their offensive potency .
kroos and mueller filled in fairly effectively for robben and ribery on the two wings on saturday , but this left the side bereft of ideas in the middle , where neither strikers olic and klose , nor defensive midfielders bastian schweinsteiger and mark van bommel offered much creativity .
a change of system , perhaps one that brings mueller and / or kroos into the middle , may do the trick - and in truth , it will have to .
bayern 's small squad means that there are no further personnel options left for van gaal should he wish to shake up the offense .
about a month ago , during the transfer-rumor-mad silly season , big-name playmakers like rafael van de vaart were brought up in connection with bayern munich . van gaal told reporters then that he did n't feel he needed to go out and buy any players to bolster the squad .
“ alaba is better ! ” van gaal had said , referring to one of his favorite young charges , the 18-year-old austrian david alaba , who he 'd used as an emergency wingback last year , but whose real strength is in the offensive midfield .
it was a bold statement - but perhaps we 'd agree with him , if we could only see alaba play .
but that poor lad is hurt as well .

opposition parties claim the package will make the poor poorer . german labor minister ursula von der leyen has defended a minimal rise in welfare payments against sharp criticism from opposition parties and trade unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 5 euro increase per month has been branded derisory " the rates are very fair , " she told the daily bild newspaper , following criticism of a rise of 5 euros -lrb- $ 6.70 -rrb- a month which had been agreed by the coalition on sunday .
currently , germany 's 6.5 million " hartz iv " welfare recipients receive up to 359 euros per month .
" the federal statistical office analyzed what people on low earnings were able to spend each month , " said von der leyen , citing sales staff , janitors and hairdressers as examples .
" the calculations show accurately what the subsistence level is . "
' bad news for welfare recipients ' trade unions , as well as opposition parties such as the social democrats and greens , have warned that the rise is not enough and means that the poor will drift deeper into economic difficulties .
however , christian democrat von der leyen said that welfare rates had to be compared with lower level incomes in the working population .
" whoever demands that hartz iv should be higher must justify it by looking at the statistical data , compared with employees who work full time , " said the minister .
" those employees pay for hartz iv through their taxes and , in the end , many of them do not have much more money to spare -lsb- than hartz iv recipients -rsb- . "
no tobacco and alcohol allowance von der leyen defended the fact that the hartz iv would no longer provide an allowance for alcohol and tobacco .
while provision for basic needs was " sacrosanct , " she said , such products did not fall into this category .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will no longer be an allowance for alcohol or cigarettes the minister argued that any attempt by opposition parties to block the reforms in germany 's upper house - the bundesrat , where the ruling coalition has no majority - could not be justified .
chancellor angela merkel and party leaders from coalition partners the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- met to agree the changes on sunday .
monthly benefits for children are set to remain the same at 215 euros , 251 euros and 287 euros for children under age six , aged six to 14 and 14-18 , respectively .
however , the reforms include plans for " non-cash " benefits , such as a chip card that gives needy children access to educational and recreational services .

meanwhile , a ban on west bank construction has ended - the issue is a major sticking point in mideast peace talks . a ship carrying nine jewish activists from germany , britain , israel and the us set sail on sunday to deliver aid to the gaza strip .
the british boat " irene " departed sunday from famagusta in cyprus in protest against israel 's blockade of the palestinian territory .
the israeli foreign ministry called the move a " provocation . "
' a sacred duty ' the activists included 82-year-old holocaust survivor reuven moskovitz .
" it is a sacred duty for me , as a -lsb- holocaust -rsb- survivor , to protest against the persecution , the oppression and the imprisonment of so many people in gaza , including more than 800,000 children , " moskovitz said .
the trip - which was coordinated by the german organization jewish voice for just peace in the near east and the british group jews for justice for palestinians - intends to bring school supplies , musical instruments and fishing nets into gaza .
it comes after israel 's deadly raid of a gaza-bound aid ship last may , resulting in the deaths of nine turkish activists .
israeli defence minister ehud barak has repeatedly warned that israel will intercept any ship nearing gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's may interception of an aid ship proved deadly the activists have vowed to conduct a peaceful sit down should israeli military attempt to deter their entry to the gaza strip .
netanyahu urges restraint the launch of the aid ship on sunday came on the last day of israel 's freeze on settlement building in the occupied territories on the west bank .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu urged israeli settlers in a statement to exercise restraint after the moratorium expires – in an apparent bid to keep alive peace talks with the palestinians .
" the prime minister calls on the residents in judea and samaria -lsb- the west bank -rsb- and the political parties to show restraint and responsibility today and in the future exactly as they showed restraint and responsibility throughout the months of the freeze , " the statement read .
a ' 50-50 ' chance palestinian president mahmud abbas had earlier vowed to abandon peace talks should the jewish settlers recommence construction on occupied land , though he later said in an interview that he would remain in the talks with the agreement of the arab league .
" israel must choose between peace and the continuation of settlements , " he told the united nations in new york on saturday , denouncing israel 's " mentality of expansion and domination " in the west bank .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barak believes there is a 50 percent chance for the moratorium 's extension while abbas 's spokesman told reporters that there was no progress in a us-led push to extend the moratorium , israeli defence minister barak maintained until the last minute that an extension would be possible .
" i think that the chance of achieving a mutually agreed understanding about -lsb- a -rsb- moratorium is 50-50 , " barak said in a bbc interview in new york where he was meeting with us officials , adding , " i think that the chances of having a peace process is much higher . "
settlers to start new constructions as the official moratorium came to an end , israeli settlers were poised to begin construction on new developments in palestinian territory .
settlers and their supporters held a rally in the settlement of revava to mark the end of the freeze .
in another settlement the foundation stone for a new kindergarten was laid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settlement construction has been on hold for 10 months but it was not expected that there would be a massive surge in construction activity .
" we are getting back to business as usual and building but we will respect the prime minister 's request , " said david ha 'ivri , head of the samaria regional council .
over 430,000 jews live in more than 100 settlements across territory in the west bank and east jerusalem that israel captured from jordan in 1967 .

but the invasive searches have stirred privacy concerns . germany began its six-month test period of two full-body scanners at hamburg airport on monday as critics continued to denounce the technology as too invasive .
interior minister thomas de maiziere was one of the first to pass through one of the scanners , saying he did not feel cramped or uncomfortable inside .
“ today is an important step on the way to better security in german airports , ” he said .
the german interior ministry , which is responsible for the project , selected hamburg for the trial run under real airport conditions because it is large , but not so large that technical glitches would seriously disrupt the flow of passenger traffic .
hamburg is germany 's fifth largest airport and serves about 12 million passengers annually .
full-body scanners are already in use in the united states and several european countries but , due to widespread privacy concerns , germany has been slow to test the technology .
until now , the machines had only been tested in the laboratory at the federal police academy in luebeck .
the scanners use low-frequency electromagnetic waves to sweep a schematic representation of the human body to check for concealed weapons or explosives .
passengers walk through a three-meter -lrb- 10 foot -rrb- high and two-meter wide cabin and are scanned by the waves , which the machine 's manufacturer says are 10,000-times weaker than the ordinary electro-smog from cell phones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics , like peter schaar , warn that scanners are too invasive scanners ' too invasive ' , critics warn privacy advocates oppose the use of the technology because they say it is too invasive and could reveal embarrassing details about a passenger .
peter schaar , germany 's federal commissioner for data protection , cautioned that “ very sensitive areas ” of a person 's private life could be revealed , such as breast implants , colostomies or other medical aids .
security experts argue , however , that the scanners are indispensable because they detect things , like plastic explosives and ceramic weapons , which conventional metal detectors would not discover .
this has not stopped some countries , notably italy , from scrapping the scanners .
after a six-month trial at airports in rome , venice and palermo , the machines are no longer in use after being deemed too slow and ineffective .
" we did n't get good results during testing , ” said vito riggio , the president of italy 's aviation authority .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics , like peter schaar , warn that scanners are too invasive scanners ' too invasive ' , critics warn privacy advocates oppose the use of the technology because they say it is too invasive and could reveal embarrassing details about a passenger .
peter schaar , germany 's federal commissioner for data protection , cautioned that “ very sensitive areas ” of a person 's private life could be revealed , such as breast implants , colostomies or other medical aids .
security experts argue , however , that the scanners are indispensable because they detect things , like plastic explosives and ceramic weapons , which conventional metal detectors would not discover .
this has not stopped some countries , notably italy , from scrapping the scanners .
after a six-month trial at airports in rome , venice and palermo , the machines are no longer in use after being deemed too slow and ineffective .
" we did n't get good results during testing , ” said vito riggio , the president of italy 's aviation authority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 27.09.2010 us report exposes fbi 's post-9/11 investigations of greenpeace , peta großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reports states that the fbi misled the justice department in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the us , the federal bureau of investigation -lrb- fbi -rrb- began spying on a number of liberal groups under ambiguous new terror laws , a us department of justice report states . according to the report , the fbi carried out " unreasonable and inconsistent " investigations into environmental pressure group greenpeace , animal rights organization peta and a number of pacifist groups in the united states after 9/11 .
under homeland security laws brought in to safeguard the us from terrorist activities , the report showed that the fbi improperly investigated greenpeace and peta , along with the thomas merton center , a pittsburgh anti-war organization , the catholic worker , another anti-war group , and an individual quaker peace activist between 2001 and 2006 .
according to the inspector general of the department of justice , the five domestic terror investigations carried out by the fbi had " little or no basis " and were " unreasonable and inconsistent with fbi policy . "
the report also stated that the fbi " made false and misleading statements to congress " about the investigations , wrongly classifying them under " domestic terrorism cases " in an effort to pursue surveillance operations against the liberal organizations .
the investigations were based on " potential crimes " including trespassing and vandalism which the fbi misclassified under acts of terror .
the report said that these crimes " could alternatively have been classified differently , " which would have negated the need for anti-terror investigations into the targeted organizations .
the report added that in several cases , the fbi 's justification for investigation was " factually weak " and that there was " little indication of any possible federal crime as opposed to local crime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi were part of the anti-terror fusion groups created after 9/11 " after 9/11 , one of the most worrying aspects of that investigation was the lack of coordination between us security services , " clive walker , professor of criminal justice studies at the university of leeds , told deutsche welle .
" this led to the establishment of fusion groups across the us which were supposed to reduce the barriers between organizations .
they fused policing , intelligence and public security functions . "
" the driving force behind these groups was the fight against terrorism but in most places in the us , there really is n't a terrorist threat - so these well-funded groups , which included the fbi , had to find something to justify their existence , such as going after groups like greenpeace and peta under the guise of domestic terror prevention . "
peta investigation leads to members joining us terror list peta was first put under surveillance in the spring of 2001 , a number of months before the september 11 terror attacks , when the fbi started to investigate possible connections between one of the group 's members and the extremist animal liberation front .
the bureau believed the peta member was providing financial support which could aid activist missions to destroy property or attack research facilities involved in the practice of testing on animals .
after the attacks of 9/11 , the investigation rapidly expanded to cover the entire peta operation , its activities and those of a number of its affiliate organizations .
despite no criminal activity ever being documented , the investigation lasted for nearly six years and led to two innocent individuals being placed on the domestic terror watch list until 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peta protests such as this were monitored by the fbi " the fbi investigation into peta took the form of surveillance of entirely lawful free speech activities , including speeches on college campuses and public demonstrations by activists in chicken costumes and other props peta uses frequently , " harold ullman , vice president of peta germany , told deutsche welle .
" there is no justification for such police state tactics .
people speaking out on behalf of animals should be protected not placed under surveillance . " " the use of mccarthyist tactics against peta and other groups that speak out against cruelty to animals and exploitative corporate and government practices is un-american , unconstitutional , and against the interests of a healthy democracy , " ullman added .
" peta 's effective activism scares well-heeled business interests that abuse animals , but when these outfits used their connections to violate the us constitution , the fbi 's ham-fisted attempt to catch us with our pants down resulted in the fbi being caught with its pants down . " fbi suspected greenpeace was planning alaska pipeline attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi believed greenpeace would take violent action the greenpeace investigation started in 1999 when the fbi launched an operation to prevent the suspected disruption by activists of corporate shareholder meetings of two alaskan energy producers .
the protests never took place but the investigation continued for a further three years regardless . the inspector general 's report stated that that the fbi " articulated little or no basis for suspecting a violation of any federal criminal statute " in the greenpeace case and that the fbi crossed the line when it decided to continue its investigation " beyond the point at which its underlying justification no longer existed . " " we have yet to hold a discussion with the fbi about these investigations , although we will seek such a discussion , " mark floegel , a spokesperson for greenpeace us , told deutsche welle . " we 've only seen the justification in the report itself , which in some cases was based on irresponsible reports from what we presume are third parties . in one section , the report refers to a report that someone at greenpeace expressed a desire to blow up the alaska pipeline .
even a superficial investigation into greenpeace history would show greenpeace has always condemned violence and such an act would violate our principles . " " so far , no compensation or offer of an apology has been forthcoming from the fbi , " he added . both greenpeace and peta told deutsche welle that , to their knowledge , no investigations were carried out into their activities post-9/11 by european security agencies . fbi denies targeting groups on grounds of dissent in response to the department of justice report , the fbi maintained that it had not led any investigation into an organization 's activities based on an issue of free speech and that it had not been instructed to carry out any reforms to its procedures as a result . " after more than four years of investigation and an exhaustive review of hundreds of investigative decisions the fbi made after the september 11 attacks , the office of the inspector general -lrb- oig -rrb- did not uncover even a single instance where the fbi targeted any group or any individual based on the exercise of a first amendment right , " read a statement provided by the fbi to deutsche welle . " while the oig disagreed with a handful of the fbi ’ s investigative determinations over the course of six years , it has not recommended any significant modifications to the fbi ’ s authority to investigate criminal conduct or national security threats . " ambiguous laws lead to terror definition problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror laws after 9/11 were flexible and open to abuse professor clive walker believes that ambiguous language and badly defined terms left the security legislation in the us open to interpretation , a situation which in turn created an environment in which the greenpeace and peta investigations could be carried out under anti-terror laws . " the us laws brought in after 9/11 were pretty flexible but the main problem was their definition of terrorism , " he said .
" it 's very vague and therefore open to interpretation which leads to definitional problems in terms of mission objectives and applications . " " it 's cynical to say that the fbi used this ambiguity to manipulate the laws to suit their needs but the truth is , it is a recurring theme in the bureau 's history , " he added .
" since its formation there have been examples of this , such as the communist scare in the 1950 's and the anti-vietnam war movement in the 1960 's .
defining dissent as a crime is not a new thing . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under homeland security laws brought in to safeguard the us from terrorist activities , the report showed that the fbi improperly investigated greenpeace and peta , along with the thomas merton center , a pittsburgh anti-war organization , the catholic worker , another anti-war group , and an individual quaker peace activist between 2001 and 2006 .
according to the inspector general of the department of justice , the five domestic terror investigations carried out by the fbi had " little or no basis " and were " unreasonable and inconsistent with fbi policy . "
the report also stated that the fbi " made false and misleading statements to congress " about the investigations , wrongly classifying them under " domestic terrorism cases " in an effort to pursue surveillance operations against the liberal organizations .
the investigations were based on " potential crimes " including trespassing and vandalism which the fbi misclassified under acts of terror .
the report said that these crimes " could alternatively have been classified differently , " which would have negated the need for anti-terror investigations into the targeted organizations .
the report added that in several cases , the fbi 's justification for investigation was " factually weak " and that there was " little indication of any possible federal crime as opposed to local crime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi were part of the anti-terror fusion groups created after 9/11 " after 9/11 , one of the most worrying aspects of that investigation was the lack of coordination between us security services , " clive walker , professor of criminal justice studies at the university of leeds , told deutsche welle .
" this led to the establishment of fusion groups across the us which were supposed to reduce the barriers between organizations .
they fused policing , intelligence and public security functions . "
" the driving force behind these groups was the fight against terrorism but in most places in the us , there really is n't a terrorist threat - so these well-funded groups , which included the fbi , had to find something to justify their existence , such as going after groups like greenpeace and peta under the guise of domestic terror prevention . "
peta investigation leads to members joining us terror list peta was first put under surveillance in the spring of 2001 , a number of months before the september 11 terror attacks , when the fbi started to investigate possible connections between one of the group 's members and the extremist animal liberation front .
the bureau believed the peta member was providing financial support which could aid activist missions to destroy property or attack research facilities involved in the practice of testing on animals .
after the attacks of 9/11 , the investigation rapidly expanded to cover the entire peta operation , its activities and those of a number of its affiliate organizations .
despite no criminal activity ever being documented , the investigation lasted for nearly six years and led to two innocent individuals being placed on the domestic terror watch list until 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peta protests such as this were monitored by the fbi " the fbi investigation into peta took the form of surveillance of entirely lawful free speech activities , including speeches on college campuses and public demonstrations by activists in chicken costumes and other props peta uses frequently , " harold ullman , vice president of peta germany , told deutsche welle .
" there is no justification for such police state tactics .
people speaking out on behalf of animals should be protected not placed under surveillance . " " the use of mccarthyist tactics against peta and other groups that speak out against cruelty to animals and exploitative corporate and government practices is un-american , unconstitutional , and against the interests of a healthy democracy , " ullman added .
" peta 's effective activism scares well-heeled business interests that abuse animals , but when these outfits used their connections to violate the us constitution , the fbi 's ham-fisted attempt to catch us with our pants down resulted in the fbi being caught with its pants down . " fbi suspected greenpeace was planning alaska pipeline attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi believed greenpeace would take violent action the greenpeace investigation started in 1999 when the fbi launched an operation to prevent the suspected disruption by activists of corporate shareholder meetings of two alaskan energy producers .
the protests never took place but the investigation continued for a further three years regardless . the inspector general 's report stated that that the fbi " articulated little or no basis for suspecting a violation of any federal criminal statute " in the greenpeace case and that the fbi crossed the line when it decided to continue its investigation " beyond the point at which its underlying justification no longer existed . " " we have yet to hold a discussion with the fbi about these investigations , although we will seek such a discussion , " mark floegel , a spokesperson for greenpeace us , told deutsche welle . " we 've only seen the justification in the report itself , which in some cases was based on irresponsible reports from what we presume are third parties . in one section , the report refers to a report that someone at greenpeace expressed a desire to blow up the alaska pipeline .

speaking to the european parliament 's economic affairs committee , european central bank president jean-claude trichet warned that current oversight on eu states ' budgets is too lax , and called for a board of " wise men and women " to watch over budget discipline .
" what has been lacking is some kind of incentive to manage finances responsibly , " trichet said .
" indeed , a core , absolutely indispensable , element of an effective surveillance mechanism is a functioning mechanism of incentives and sanctions - both financial and non-financial . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet said the eu has been lacking incentives for financial responsibility under the eu 's stability and growth pact , member states must keep their budget deficits within three percent of gross domestic product .
but several member states - most notably greece - have flouted the rules , leading to a decline in the eu 's credibility .
sanctions to be quick and ' semi-automatic ' trichet 's comments support a proposal by european economic commissioner olli rehn to impose " semi-automatic " sanctions against such eu members who break budget rules .
the european commission is to lay out the details of its enforcement plan on wednesday .
reports say rehn would propose fines of 0.2 percent of gdp for countries who repeatedly fail to comply with financial rules .
in addition , countries with slipping competitiveness or whose growth is based on " excessive imbalances " like the credit boom in the baltic states would receive fines of 0.1 percent of gdp .
" sanctions ... need to be triggered early enough in the process so that they are essentially preventive , " rehn said monday .
" this is very important in order to ensure fiscal discipline , and sustainable growth in the eu . "
germany advocates harshness germany , traditionally one of the most fiscally conservative eu members , weighed in on the enforcement plan with finance minister wolfgang schaeuble writing a letter to his counterparts in the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble 's proposals on sanctions are among the strictest " the creation of stronger incentives to prevent and correct excessive government deficits stands at the very core of our endeavors to enforce fiscal and economy governance in the eu , " he wrote .
germany 's proposals have been some of the most draconian in the bloc .
schaeuble also called for the sanctions to affect payments from the eu 's substantial regional development and agricultural funds , and his office is reportedly considering supporting the exclusion of fiscal rule breakers from eu decision making .
meanwhile reports said italy , france and spain - which would all have to make significant reductions to their already-reduced budgets - were likely to oppose the new sanctions .

but the invasive searches have stirred privacy concerns . germany began its six-month test period of two full-body scanners at hamburg airport on monday as critics continued to denounce the technology as too invasive .
interior minister thomas de maiziere was one of the first to pass through one of the scanners , saying he did not feel cramped or uncomfortable inside .
“ today is an important step on the way to better security in german airports , ” he said .
the german interior ministry , which is responsible for the project , selected hamburg for the trial run under real airport conditions because it is large , but not so large that technical glitches would seriously disrupt the flow of passenger traffic .
hamburg is germany 's fifth largest airport and serves about 12 million passengers annually .
full-body scanners are already in use in the united states and several european countries but , due to widespread privacy concerns , germany has been slow to test the technology .
until now , the machines had only been tested in the laboratory at the federal police academy in luebeck .
the scanners use low-frequency electromagnetic waves to sweep a schematic representation of the human body to check for concealed weapons or explosives .
passengers walk through a three-meter -lrb- 10 foot -rrb- high and two-meter wide cabin and are scanned by the waves , which the machine 's manufacturer says are 10,000-times weaker than the ordinary electro-smog from cell phones .

opposition parties claim the package will make the poor poorer . german labor minister ursula von der leyen has defended a minimal rise in welfare payments against sharp criticism from opposition parties and trade unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 5 euro increase per month has been branded derisory " the rates are very fair , " she told the daily bild newspaper , following criticism of a rise of 5 euros -lrb- $ 6.70 -rrb- a month which had been agreed by the coalition on sunday .
currently , germany 's 6.5 million " hartz iv " welfare recipients receive up to 359 euros per month .
" the federal statistical office analyzed what people on low earnings were able to spend each month , " said von der leyen , citing sales staff , janitors and hairdressers as examples .
" the calculations show accurately what the subsistence level is . "
' bad news for welfare recipients ' trade unions , as well as opposition parties such as the social democrats and greens , have warned that the rise is not enough and means that the poor will drift deeper into economic difficulties .
however , christian democrat von der leyen said that welfare rates had to be compared with lower level incomes in the working population .
" whoever demands that hartz iv should be higher must justify it by looking at the statistical data , compared with employees who work full time , " said the minister .
" those employees pay for hartz iv through their taxes and , in the end , many of them do not have much more money to spare -lsb- than hartz iv recipients -rsb- . "
no tobacco and alcohol allowance von der leyen defended the fact that the hartz iv would no longer provide an allowance for alcohol and tobacco .
while provision for basic needs was " sacrosanct , " she said , such products did not fall into this category .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will no longer be an allowance for alcohol or cigarettes the minister argued that any attempt by opposition parties to block the reforms in germany 's upper house - the bundesrat , where the ruling coalition has no majority - could not be justified .
chancellor angela merkel and party leaders from coalition partners the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- met to agree the changes on sunday .
monthly benefits for children are set to remain the same at 215 euros , 251 euros and 287 euros for children under age six , aged six to 14 and 14-18 , respectively .
however , the reforms include plans for " non-cash " benefits , such as a chip card that gives needy children access to educational and recreational services .

dw-world.de merkel 's coalition approves minimal hike to welfare payments the german government sunday agreed to beef up payments to the long-term unemployed by 5 euros -lrb- $ 6.70 -rrb- a month .

" it is a sacred duty for me , as a -lsb- holocaust -rsb- survivor , to protest against the persecution , the oppression and the imprisonment of so many people in gaza , including more than 800,000 children , " moskovitz said .
the trip - which was coordinated by the german organization jewish voice for just peace in the near east and the british group jews for justice for palestinians - intends to bring school supplies , musical instruments and fishing nets into gaza .
it comes after israel 's deadly raid of a gaza-bound aid ship last may , resulting in the deaths of nine turkish activists .
israeli defence minister ehud barak has repeatedly warned that israel will intercept any ship nearing gaza .

netanyahu urges restraint the launch of the aid ship on sunday came on the last day of israel 's freeze on settlement building in the occupied territories on the west bank .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu urged israeli settlers in a statement to exercise restraint after the moratorium expires – in an apparent bid to keep alive peace talks with the palestinians .
" the prime minister calls on the residents in judea and samaria -lsb- the west bank -rsb- and the political parties to show restraint and responsibility today and in the future exactly as they showed restraint and responsibility throughout the months of the freeze , " the statement read .
a ' 50-50 ' chance palestinian president mahmud abbas had earlier vowed to abandon peace talks should the jewish settlers recommence construction on occupied land , though he later said in an interview that he would remain in the talks with the agreement of the arab league .
" israel must choose between peace and the continuation of settlements , " he told the united nations in new york on saturday , denouncing israel 's " mentality of expansion and domination " in the west bank .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barak believes there is a 50 percent chance for the moratorium 's extension while abbas 's spokesman told reporters that there was no progress in a us-led push to extend the moratorium , israeli defence minister barak maintained until the last minute that an extension would be possible .
" i think that the chance of achieving a mutually agreed understanding about -lsb- a -rsb- moratorium is 50-50 , " barak said in a bbc interview in new york where he was meeting with us officials , adding , " i think that the chances of having a peace process is much higher . "
settlers to start new constructions as the official moratorium came to an end , israeli settlers were poised to begin construction on new developments in palestinian territory .
settlers and their supporters held a rally in the settlement of revava to mark the end of the freeze .
in another settlement the foundation stone for a new kindergarten was laid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settlement construction has been on hold for 10 months but it was not expected that there would be a massive surge in construction activity .
" we are getting back to business as usual and building but we will respect the prime minister 's request , " said david ha 'ivri , head of the samaria regional council .
over 430,000 jews live in more than 100 settlements across territory in the west bank and east jerusalem that israel captured from jordan in 1967 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 27.09.2010 limping into champions league fixture , bayern extend with van gaal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is to stay on in munich until the end of the 2011-2012 season fresh off a contract extension with coach louis van gaal , bayern munich are looking for redemption on tuesday in europe .
injury trouble and dysfunction in attack have meant their bundesliga campaign is a shambles . five goals , eight points , ninth place .
such is bayern munich 's meager return from the first six matches of the new bundesliga season .
in that bayern had got off to a slow start last year too before finishing as champions , players and club officials had , until recently , been leery of making critical statements .
since saturday 's 2-1 home loss to surprise league leaders mainz , all that has changed .
“ we have too many players who are n't playing up to their usual standard , ” said defender philipp lahm .
“ work-rate , aggressiveness , passion - we 're missing all of it at the moment , ” said bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
the loss left bayern 10 points adrift of mainz , and that wide margin appears to be ringing a few alarm bells on saebenerstrasse .
“ it 's going to be hard to make up for this deficit , ” lahm added in his post-game remarks .
“ we let happen precisely what we did n't want to happen .
it 's going to take a long time to make up 10 points . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's captain in south africa , lahm , speaks his mind at bayern too sitting prettier luckily for bayern , the champions league is a different story .
there , the bavarians can head to switzerland to take on fc basel with their heads held high .
as if to underscore the club 's confidence that all was not yet lost , bayern 's head coach , louis van gaal , signed a one-year contract extension in basel on monday .
the deal keeps him and his supporting cast of coaches on at the club through june 2012 .
two weeks ago , van gaal 's men broke down a dogged as roma defense and got a 2-0 win to top their group .
basel , meanwhile , stumbled to a 2-1 loss in romania to cfr cluj .
if bayern can manage a win at the st. jakob park on tuesday , they could stay in the driver 's seat in group e , with a potentially winnable home-and-away match-up with cluj next on the club 's docket .
some in the club are already looking to the champions league campaign as a corrective to the poor league start .
“ we need to stay calm , ” said hamit altintop , the turkey winger who has begun to see more playing time with franck ribery out injured for the coming weeks .
“ we won the first game and can afford to play it safe - we do n't have to go storming into attack from the get-go . ”
hurting for goals perhaps it would n't do much good to play things hell-for-leather .
it 's in attack that bayern have disappointed the most .
despite starting the potent likes of thomas mueller , toni kroos , ivica olic and miroslav klose on saturday , bayern failed to find the net - relying instead on a mainz own-goal to get on the scoreboard .
this is not to say bayern 's offensive front is n't able to keep the ball , or create chances .
indeed , they had more than 70 percent of the ball and shot it 15 times .
but many of those chances were not of a particularly high standard , and their shooting was poor .
bayern put the ball on target just four times .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben scored 23 goals and set up eight more for bayern last season it would seem that the missing creativity , not to mention finishing , of arjen robben is holding the team back .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 27.09.2010 limping into champions league fixture , bayern extend with van gaal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is to stay on in munich until the end of the 2011-2012 season fresh off a contract extension with coach louis van gaal , bayern munich are looking for redemption on tuesday in europe .
injury trouble and dysfunction in attack have meant their bundesliga campaign is a shambles . five goals , eight points , ninth place .
such is bayern munich 's meager return from the first six matches of the new bundesliga season .
in that bayern had got off to a slow start last year too before finishing as champions , players and club officials had , until recently , been leery of making critical statements .
since saturday 's 2-1 home loss to surprise league leaders mainz , all that has changed .
“ we have too many players who are n't playing up to their usual standard , ” said defender philipp lahm .
“ work-rate , aggressiveness , passion - we 're missing all of it at the moment , ” said bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
the loss left bayern 10 points adrift of mainz , and that wide margin appears to be ringing a few alarm bells on saebenerstrasse .
“ it 's going to be hard to make up for this deficit , ” lahm added in his post-game remarks .
“ we let happen precisely what we did n't want to happen .
it 's going to take a long time to make up 10 points . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's captain in south africa , lahm , speaks his mind at bayern too sitting prettier luckily for bayern , the champions league is a different story .
there , the bavarians can head to switzerland to take on fc basel with their heads held high .
as if to underscore the club 's confidence that all was not yet lost , bayern 's head coach , louis van gaal , signed a one-year contract extension in basel on monday .
the deal keeps him and his supporting cast of coaches on at the club through june 2012 .
two weeks ago , van gaal 's men broke down a dogged as roma defense and got a 2-0 win to top their group .
basel , meanwhile , stumbled to a 2-1 loss in romania to cfr cluj .
if bayern can manage a win at the st. jakob park on tuesday , they could stay in the driver 's seat in group e , with a potentially winnable home-and-away match-up with cluj next on the club 's docket .
some in the club are already looking to the champions league campaign as a corrective to the poor league start .
“ we need to stay calm , ” said hamit altintop , the turkey winger who has begun to see more playing time with franck ribery out injured for the coming weeks .
“ we won the first game and can afford to play it safe - we do n't have to go storming into attack from the get-go . ”
hurting for goals perhaps it would n't do much good to play things hell-for-leather .
it 's in attack that bayern have disappointed the most .
despite starting the potent likes of thomas mueller , toni kroos , ivica olic and miroslav klose on saturday , bayern failed to find the net - relying instead on a mainz own-goal to get on the scoreboard .
this is not to say bayern 's offensive front is n't able to keep the ball , or create chances .
indeed , they had more than 70 percent of the ball and shot it 15 times .
but many of those chances were not of a particularly high standard , and their shooting was poor .
bayern put the ball on target just four times .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben scored 23 goals and set up eight more for bayern last season it would seem that the missing creativity , not to mention finishing , of arjen robben is holding the team back .
the dutchman 's muscle tear will keep him out of the lineup until the new year , and now franck ribery 's injured ankle means he 'll miss another month at least .
bayern could use their offensive potency .
kroos and mueller filled in fairly effectively for robben and ribery on the two wings on saturday , but this left the side bereft of ideas in the middle , where neither strikers olic and klose , nor defensive midfielders bastian schweinsteiger and mark van bommel offered much creativity .
a change of system , perhaps one that brings mueller and / or kroos into the middle , may do the trick - and in truth , it will have to .

but the invasive searches have stirred privacy concerns . germany began its six-month test period of two full-body scanners at hamburg airport on monday as critics continued to denounce the technology as too invasive .
interior minister thomas de maiziere was one of the first to pass through one of the scanners , saying he did not feel cramped or uncomfortable inside .
“ today is an important step on the way to better security in german airports , ” he said .
the german interior ministry , which is responsible for the project , selected hamburg for the trial run under real airport conditions because it is large , but not so large that technical glitches would seriously disrupt the flow of passenger traffic .
hamburg is germany 's fifth largest airport and serves about 12 million passengers annually .
full-body scanners are already in use in the united states and several european countries but , due to widespread privacy concerns , germany has been slow to test the technology .
until now , the machines had only been tested in the laboratory at the federal police academy in luebeck .
the scanners use low-frequency electromagnetic waves to sweep a schematic representation of the human body to check for concealed weapons or explosives .
passengers walk through a three-meter -lrb- 10 foot -rrb- high and two-meter wide cabin and are scanned by the waves , which the machine 's manufacturer says are 10,000-times weaker than the ordinary electro-smog from cell phones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics , like peter schaar , warn that scanners are too invasive scanners ' too invasive ' , critics warn privacy advocates oppose the use of the technology because they say it is too invasive and could reveal embarrassing details about a passenger .
peter schaar , germany 's federal commissioner for data protection , cautioned that “ very sensitive areas ” of a person 's private life could be revealed , such as breast implants , colostomies or other medical aids .
security experts argue , however , that the scanners are indispensable because they detect things , like plastic explosives and ceramic weapons , which conventional metal detectors would not discover .
this has not stopped some countries , notably italy , from scrapping the scanners .
after a six-month trial at airports in rome , venice and palermo , the machines are no longer in use after being deemed too slow and ineffective .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 5 euro increase per month has been branded derisory " the rates are very fair , " she told the daily bild newspaper , following criticism of a rise of 5 euros -lrb- $ 6.70 -rrb- a month which had been agreed by the coalition on sunday .
currently , germany 's 6.5 million " hartz iv " welfare recipients receive up to 359 euros per month .
" the federal statistical office analyzed what people on low earnings were able to spend each month , " said von der leyen , citing sales staff , janitors and hairdressers as examples .
" the calculations show accurately what the subsistence level is . "
' bad news for welfare recipients ' trade unions , as well as opposition parties such as the social democrats and greens , have warned that the rise is not enough and means that the poor will drift deeper into economic difficulties .
however , christian democrat von der leyen said that welfare rates had to be compared with lower level incomes in the working population .
" whoever demands that hartz iv should be higher must justify it by looking at the statistical data , compared with employees who work full time , " said the minister .
" those employees pay for hartz iv through their taxes and , in the end , many of them do not have much more money to spare -lsb- than hartz iv recipients -rsb- . "
no tobacco and alcohol allowance von der leyen defended the fact that the hartz iv would no longer provide an allowance for alcohol and tobacco .
while provision for basic needs was " sacrosanct , " she said , such products did not fall into this category .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will no longer be an allowance for alcohol or cigarettes the minister argued that any attempt by opposition parties to block the reforms in germany 's upper house - the bundesrat , where the ruling coalition has no majority - could not be justified .

opposition parties claim the package will make the poor poorer . german labor minister ursula von der leyen has defended a minimal rise in welfare payments against sharp criticism from opposition parties and trade unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 5 euro increase per month has been branded derisory " the rates are very fair , " she told the daily bild newspaper , following criticism of a rise of 5 euros -lrb- $ 6.70 -rrb- a month which had been agreed by the coalition on sunday .
currently , germany 's 6.5 million " hartz iv " welfare recipients receive up to 359 euros per month .
" the federal statistical office analyzed what people on low earnings were able to spend each month , " said von der leyen , citing sales staff , janitors and hairdressers as examples .
" the calculations show accurately what the subsistence level is . "
' bad news for welfare recipients ' trade unions , as well as opposition parties such as the social democrats and greens , have warned that the rise is not enough and means that the poor will drift deeper into economic difficulties .
however , christian democrat von der leyen said that welfare rates had to be compared with lower level incomes in the working population .
" whoever demands that hartz iv should be higher must justify it by looking at the statistical data , compared with employees who work full time , " said the minister .
" those employees pay for hartz iv through their taxes and , in the end , many of them do not have much more money to spare -lsb- than hartz iv recipients -rsb- . "
no tobacco and alcohol allowance von der leyen defended the fact that the hartz iv would no longer provide an allowance for alcohol and tobacco .
while provision for basic needs was " sacrosanct , " she said , such products did not fall into this category .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will no longer be an allowance for alcohol or cigarettes the minister argued that any attempt by opposition parties to block the reforms in germany 's upper house - the bundesrat , where the ruling coalition has no majority - could not be justified .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 27.09.2010 us report exposes fbi 's post-9/11 investigations of greenpeace , peta großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reports states that the fbi misled the justice department in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the us , the federal bureau of investigation -lrb- fbi -rrb- began spying on a number of liberal groups under ambiguous new terror laws , a us department of justice report states . according to the report , the fbi carried out " unreasonable and inconsistent " investigations into environmental pressure group greenpeace , animal rights organization peta and a number of pacifist groups in the united states after 9/11 .
under homeland security laws brought in to safeguard the us from terrorist activities , the report showed that the fbi improperly investigated greenpeace and peta , along with the thomas merton center , a pittsburgh anti-war organization , the catholic worker , another anti-war group , and an individual quaker peace activist between 2001 and 2006 .
according to the inspector general of the department of justice , the five domestic terror investigations carried out by the fbi had " little or no basis " and were " unreasonable and inconsistent with fbi policy . "
the report also stated that the fbi " made false and misleading statements to congress " about the investigations , wrongly classifying them under " domestic terrorism cases " in an effort to pursue surveillance operations against the liberal organizations .
the investigations were based on " potential crimes " including trespassing and vandalism which the fbi misclassified under acts of terror .
the report said that these crimes " could alternatively have been classified differently , " which would have negated the need for anti-terror investigations into the targeted organizations .
the report added that in several cases , the fbi 's justification for investigation was " factually weak " and that there was " little indication of any possible federal crime as opposed to local crime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi were part of the anti-terror fusion groups created after 9/11 " after 9/11 , one of the most worrying aspects of that investigation was the lack of coordination between us security services , " clive walker , professor of criminal justice studies at the university of leeds , told deutsche welle .
" this led to the establishment of fusion groups across the us which were supposed to reduce the barriers between organizations .
they fused policing , intelligence and public security functions . "
" the driving force behind these groups was the fight against terrorism but in most places in the us , there really is n't a terrorist threat - so these well-funded groups , which included the fbi , had to find something to justify their existence , such as going after groups like greenpeace and peta under the guise of domestic terror prevention . "
peta investigation leads to members joining us terror list peta was first put under surveillance in the spring of 2001 , a number of months before the september 11 terror attacks , when the fbi started to investigate possible connections between one of the group 's members and the extremist animal liberation front .
the bureau believed the peta member was providing financial support which could aid activist missions to destroy property or attack research facilities involved in the practice of testing on animals .
after the attacks of 9/11 , the investigation rapidly expanded to cover the entire peta operation , its activities and those of a number of its affiliate organizations .
despite no criminal activity ever being documented , the investigation lasted for nearly six years and led to two innocent individuals being placed on the domestic terror watch list until 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peta protests such as this were monitored by the fbi " the fbi investigation into peta took the form of surveillance of entirely lawful free speech activities , including speeches on college campuses and public demonstrations by activists in chicken costumes and other props peta uses frequently , " harold ullman , vice president of peta germany , told deutsche welle .
" there is no justification for such police state tactics .
people speaking out on behalf of animals should be protected not placed under surveillance . " " the use of mccarthyist tactics against peta and other groups that speak out against cruelty to animals and exploitative corporate and government practices is un-american , unconstitutional , and against the interests of a healthy democracy , " ullman added .
" peta 's effective activism scares well-heeled business interests that abuse animals , but when these outfits used their connections to violate the us constitution , the fbi 's ham-fisted attempt to catch us with our pants down resulted in the fbi being caught with its pants down . " fbi suspected greenpeace was planning alaska pipeline attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi believed greenpeace would take violent action the greenpeace investigation started in 1999 when the fbi launched an operation to prevent the suspected disruption by activists of corporate shareholder meetings of two alaskan energy producers .
the protests never took place but the investigation continued for a further three years regardless . the inspector general 's report stated that that the fbi " articulated little or no basis for suspecting a violation of any federal criminal statute " in the greenpeace case and that the fbi crossed the line when it decided to continue its investigation " beyond the point at which its underlying justification no longer existed . " " we have yet to hold a discussion with the fbi about these investigations , although we will seek such a discussion , " mark floegel , a spokesperson for greenpeace us , told deutsche welle . " we 've only seen the justification in the report itself , which in some cases was based on irresponsible reports from what we presume are third parties . in one section , the report refers to a report that someone at greenpeace expressed a desire to blow up the alaska pipeline .
even a superficial investigation into greenpeace history would show greenpeace has always condemned violence and such an act would violate our principles . " " so far , no compensation or offer of an apology has been forthcoming from the fbi , " he added . both greenpeace and peta told deutsche welle that , to their knowledge , no investigations were carried out into their activities post-9/11 by european security agencies . fbi denies targeting groups on grounds of dissent in response to the department of justice report , the fbi maintained that it had not led any investigation into an organization 's activities based on an issue of free speech and that it had not been instructed to carry out any reforms to its procedures as a result . " after more than four years of investigation and an exhaustive review of hundreds of investigative decisions the fbi made after the september 11 attacks , the office of the inspector general -lrb- oig -rrb- did not uncover even a single instance where the fbi targeted any group or any individual based on the exercise of a first amendment right , " read a statement provided by the fbi to deutsche welle . " while the oig disagreed with a handful of the fbi ’ s investigative determinations over the course of six years , it has not recommended any significant modifications to the fbi ’ s authority to investigate criminal conduct or national security threats . " ambiguous laws lead to terror definition problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror laws after 9/11 were flexible and open to abuse professor clive walker believes that ambiguous language and badly defined terms left the security legislation in the us open to interpretation , a situation which in turn created an environment in which the greenpeace and peta investigations could be carried out under anti-terror laws . " the us laws brought in after 9/11 were pretty flexible but the main problem was their definition of terrorism , " he said .
" it 's very vague and therefore open to interpretation which leads to definitional problems in terms of mission objectives and applications . " " it 's cynical to say that the fbi used this ambiguity to manipulate the laws to suit their needs but the truth is , it is a recurring theme in the bureau 's history , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 27.09.2010 us report exposes fbi 's post-9/11 investigations of greenpeace , peta großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reports states that the fbi misled the justice department in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the us , the federal bureau of investigation -lrb- fbi -rrb- began spying on a number of liberal groups under ambiguous new terror laws , a us department of justice report states . according to the report , the fbi carried out " unreasonable and inconsistent " investigations into environmental pressure group greenpeace , animal rights organization peta and a number of pacifist groups in the united states after 9/11 .
under homeland security laws brought in to safeguard the us from terrorist activities , the report showed that the fbi improperly investigated greenpeace and peta , along with the thomas merton center , a pittsburgh anti-war organization , the catholic worker , another anti-war group , and an individual quaker peace activist between 2001 and 2006 .
according to the inspector general of the department of justice , the five domestic terror investigations carried out by the fbi had " little or no basis " and were " unreasonable and inconsistent with fbi policy . "
the report also stated that the fbi " made false and misleading statements to congress " about the investigations , wrongly classifying them under " domestic terrorism cases " in an effort to pursue surveillance operations against the liberal organizations .
the investigations were based on " potential crimes " including trespassing and vandalism which the fbi misclassified under acts of terror .
the report said that these crimes " could alternatively have been classified differently , " which would have negated the need for anti-terror investigations into the targeted organizations .
the report added that in several cases , the fbi 's justification for investigation was " factually weak " and that there was " little indication of any possible federal crime as opposed to local crime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi were part of the anti-terror fusion groups created after 9/11 " after 9/11 , one of the most worrying aspects of that investigation was the lack of coordination between us security services , " clive walker , professor of criminal justice studies at the university of leeds , told deutsche welle .
" this led to the establishment of fusion groups across the us which were supposed to reduce the barriers between organizations .
they fused policing , intelligence and public security functions . "
" the driving force behind these groups was the fight against terrorism but in most places in the us , there really is n't a terrorist threat - so these well-funded groups , which included the fbi , had to find something to justify their existence , such as going after groups like greenpeace and peta under the guise of domestic terror prevention . "
peta investigation leads to members joining us terror list peta was first put under surveillance in the spring of 2001 , a number of months before the september 11 terror attacks , when the fbi started to investigate possible connections between one of the group 's members and the extremist animal liberation front .
the bureau believed the peta member was providing financial support which could aid activist missions to destroy property or attack research facilities involved in the practice of testing on animals .
after the attacks of 9/11 , the investigation rapidly expanded to cover the entire peta operation , its activities and those of a number of its affiliate organizations .
despite no criminal activity ever being documented , the investigation lasted for nearly six years and led to two innocent individuals being placed on the domestic terror watch list until 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peta protests such as this were monitored by the fbi " the fbi investigation into peta took the form of surveillance of entirely lawful free speech activities , including speeches on college campuses and public demonstrations by activists in chicken costumes and other props peta uses frequently , " harold ullman , vice president of peta germany , told deutsche welle .
" there is no justification for such police state tactics .
people speaking out on behalf of animals should be protected not placed under surveillance . " " the use of mccarthyist tactics against peta and other groups that speak out against cruelty to animals and exploitative corporate and government practices is un-american , unconstitutional , and against the interests of a healthy democracy , " ullman added .
" peta 's effective activism scares well-heeled business interests that abuse animals , but when these outfits used their connections to violate the us constitution , the fbi 's ham-fisted attempt to catch us with our pants down resulted in the fbi being caught with its pants down . " fbi suspected greenpeace was planning alaska pipeline attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi believed greenpeace would take violent action the greenpeace investigation started in 1999 when the fbi launched an operation to prevent the suspected disruption by activists of corporate shareholder meetings of two alaskan energy producers .
the protests never took place but the investigation continued for a further three years regardless . the inspector general 's report stated that that the fbi " articulated little or no basis for suspecting a violation of any federal criminal statute " in the greenpeace case and that the fbi crossed the line when it decided to continue its investigation " beyond the point at which its underlying justification no longer existed . " " we have yet to hold a discussion with the fbi about these investigations , although we will seek such a discussion , " mark floegel , a spokesperson for greenpeace us , told deutsche welle . " we 've only seen the justification in the report itself , which in some cases was based on irresponsible reports from what we presume are third parties . in one section , the report refers to a report that someone at greenpeace expressed a desire to blow up the alaska pipeline .
even a superficial investigation into greenpeace history would show greenpeace has always condemned violence and such an act would violate our principles . " " so far , no compensation or offer of an apology has been forthcoming from the fbi , " he added . both greenpeace and peta told deutsche welle that , to their knowledge , no investigations were carried out into their activities post-9/11 by european security agencies . fbi denies targeting groups on grounds of dissent in response to the department of justice report , the fbi maintained that it had not led any investigation into an organization 's activities based on an issue of free speech and that it had not been instructed to carry out any reforms to its procedures as a result . " after more than four years of investigation and an exhaustive review of hundreds of investigative decisions the fbi made after the september 11 attacks , the office of the inspector general -lrb- oig -rrb- did not uncover even a single instance where the fbi targeted any group or any individual based on the exercise of a first amendment right , " read a statement provided by the fbi to deutsche welle . " while the oig disagreed with a handful of the fbi ’ s investigative determinations over the course of six years , it has not recommended any significant modifications to the fbi ’ s authority to investigate criminal conduct or national security threats . " ambiguous laws lead to terror definition problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror laws after 9/11 were flexible and open to abuse professor clive walker believes that ambiguous language and badly defined terms left the security legislation in the us open to interpretation , a situation which in turn created an environment in which the greenpeace and peta investigations could be carried out under anti-terror laws . " the us laws brought in after 9/11 were pretty flexible but the main problem was their definition of terrorism , " he said .
" it 's very vague and therefore open to interpretation which leads to definitional problems in terms of mission objectives and applications . " " it 's cynical to say that the fbi used this ambiguity to manipulate the laws to suit their needs but the truth is , it is a recurring theme in the bureau 's history , " he added .
" since its formation there have been examples of this , such as the communist scare in the 1950 's and the anti-vietnam war movement in the 1960 's .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 27.09.2010 us report exposes fbi 's post-9/11 investigations of greenpeace , peta großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reports states that the fbi misled the justice department in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the us , the federal bureau of investigation -lrb- fbi -rrb- began spying on a number of liberal groups under ambiguous new terror laws , a us department of justice report states . according to the report , the fbi carried out " unreasonable and inconsistent " investigations into environmental pressure group greenpeace , animal rights organization peta and a number of pacifist groups in the united states after 9/11 .
under homeland security laws brought in to safeguard the us from terrorist activities , the report showed that the fbi improperly investigated greenpeace and peta , along with the thomas merton center , a pittsburgh anti-war organization , the catholic worker , another anti-war group , and an individual quaker peace activist between 2001 and 2006 .
according to the inspector general of the department of justice , the five domestic terror investigations carried out by the fbi had " little or no basis " and were " unreasonable and inconsistent with fbi policy . "
the report also stated that the fbi " made false and misleading statements to congress " about the investigations , wrongly classifying them under " domestic terrorism cases " in an effort to pursue surveillance operations against the liberal organizations .
the investigations were based on " potential crimes " including trespassing and vandalism which the fbi misclassified under acts of terror .
the report said that these crimes " could alternatively have been classified differently , " which would have negated the need for anti-terror investigations into the targeted organizations .
the report added that in several cases , the fbi 's justification for investigation was " factually weak " and that there was " little indication of any possible federal crime as opposed to local crime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi were part of the anti-terror fusion groups created after 9/11 " after 9/11 , one of the most worrying aspects of that investigation was the lack of coordination between us security services , " clive walker , professor of criminal justice studies at the university of leeds , told deutsche welle .
" this led to the establishment of fusion groups across the us which were supposed to reduce the barriers between organizations .
they fused policing , intelligence and public security functions . "
" the driving force behind these groups was the fight against terrorism but in most places in the us , there really is n't a terrorist threat - so these well-funded groups , which included the fbi , had to find something to justify their existence , such as going after groups like greenpeace and peta under the guise of domestic terror prevention . "
peta investigation leads to members joining us terror list peta was first put under surveillance in the spring of 2001 , a number of months before the september 11 terror attacks , when the fbi started to investigate possible connections between one of the group 's members and the extremist animal liberation front .
the bureau believed the peta member was providing financial support which could aid activist missions to destroy property or attack research facilities involved in the practice of testing on animals .
after the attacks of 9/11 , the investigation rapidly expanded to cover the entire peta operation , its activities and those of a number of its affiliate organizations .
despite no criminal activity ever being documented , the investigation lasted for nearly six years and led to two innocent individuals being placed on the domestic terror watch list until 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peta protests such as this were monitored by the fbi " the fbi investigation into peta took the form of surveillance of entirely lawful free speech activities , including speeches on college campuses and public demonstrations by activists in chicken costumes and other props peta uses frequently , " harold ullman , vice president of peta germany , told deutsche welle .
" there is no justification for such police state tactics .
people speaking out on behalf of animals should be protected not placed under surveillance . " " the use of mccarthyist tactics against peta and other groups that speak out against cruelty to animals and exploitative corporate and government practices is un-american , unconstitutional , and against the interests of a healthy democracy , " ullman added .
" peta 's effective activism scares well-heeled business interests that abuse animals , but when these outfits used their connections to violate the us constitution , the fbi 's ham-fisted attempt to catch us with our pants down resulted in the fbi being caught with its pants down . " fbi suspected greenpeace was planning alaska pipeline attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi believed greenpeace would take violent action the greenpeace investigation started in 1999 when the fbi launched an operation to prevent the suspected disruption by activists of corporate shareholder meetings of two alaskan energy producers .
the protests never took place but the investigation continued for a further three years regardless . the inspector general 's report stated that that the fbi " articulated little or no basis for suspecting a violation of any federal criminal statute " in the greenpeace case and that the fbi crossed the line when it decided to continue its investigation " beyond the point at which its underlying justification no longer existed . " " we have yet to hold a discussion with the fbi about these investigations , although we will seek such a discussion , " mark floegel , a spokesperson for greenpeace us , told deutsche welle . " we 've only seen the justification in the report itself , which in some cases was based on irresponsible reports from what we presume are third parties . in one section , the report refers to a report that someone at greenpeace expressed a desire to blow up the alaska pipeline .
even a superficial investigation into greenpeace history would show greenpeace has always condemned violence and such an act would violate our principles . " " so far , no compensation or offer of an apology has been forthcoming from the fbi , " he added . both greenpeace and peta told deutsche welle that , to their knowledge , no investigations were carried out into their activities post-9/11 by european security agencies . fbi denies targeting groups on grounds of dissent in response to the department of justice report , the fbi maintained that it had not led any investigation into an organization 's activities based on an issue of free speech and that it had not been instructed to carry out any reforms to its procedures as a result . " after more than four years of investigation and an exhaustive review of hundreds of investigative decisions the fbi made after the september 11 attacks , the office of the inspector general -lrb- oig -rrb- did not uncover even a single instance where the fbi targeted any group or any individual based on the exercise of a first amendment right , " read a statement provided by the fbi to deutsche welle . " while the oig disagreed with a handful of the fbi ’ s investigative determinations over the course of six years , it has not recommended any significant modifications to the fbi ’ s authority to investigate criminal conduct or national security threats . " ambiguous laws lead to terror definition problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror laws after 9/11 were flexible and open to abuse professor clive walker believes that ambiguous language and badly defined terms left the security legislation in the us open to interpretation , a situation which in turn created an environment in which the greenpeace and peta investigations could be carried out under anti-terror laws . " the us laws brought in after 9/11 were pretty flexible but the main problem was their definition of terrorism , " he said .
" it 's very vague and therefore open to interpretation which leads to definitional problems in terms of mission objectives and applications . " " it 's cynical to say that the fbi used this ambiguity to manipulate the laws to suit their needs but the truth is , it is a recurring theme in the bureau 's history , " he added .

opposition parties claim the package will make the poor poorer . german labor minister ursula von der leyen has defended a minimal rise in welfare payments against sharp criticism from opposition parties and trade unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 5 euro increase per month has been branded derisory " the rates are very fair , " she told the daily bild newspaper , following criticism of a rise of 5 euros -lrb- $ 6.70 -rrb- a month which had been agreed by the coalition on sunday .
currently , germany 's 6.5 million " hartz iv " welfare recipients receive up to 359 euros per month .
" the federal statistical office analyzed what people on low earnings were able to spend each month , " said von der leyen , citing sales staff , janitors and hairdressers as examples .
" the calculations show accurately what the subsistence level is . "
' bad news for welfare recipients ' trade unions , as well as opposition parties such as the social democrats and greens , have warned that the rise is not enough and means that the poor will drift deeper into economic difficulties .
however , christian democrat von der leyen said that welfare rates had to be compared with lower level incomes in the working population .
" whoever demands that hartz iv should be higher must justify it by looking at the statistical data , compared with employees who work full time , " said the minister .
" those employees pay for hartz iv through their taxes and , in the end , many of them do not have much more money to spare -lsb- than hartz iv recipients -rsb- . "
no tobacco and alcohol allowance von der leyen defended the fact that the hartz iv would no longer provide an allowance for alcohol and tobacco .
while provision for basic needs was " sacrosanct , " she said , such products did not fall into this category .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will no longer be an allowance for alcohol or cigarettes the minister argued that any attempt by opposition parties to block the reforms in germany 's upper house - the bundesrat , where the ruling coalition has no majority - could not be justified .
chancellor angela merkel and party leaders from coalition partners the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- met to agree the changes on sunday .
monthly benefits for children are set to remain the same at 215 euros , 251 euros and 287 euros for children under age six , aged six to 14 and 14-18 , respectively .
however , the reforms include plans for " non-cash " benefits , such as a chip card that gives needy children access to educational and recreational services .

meanwhile , a ban on west bank construction has ended - the issue is a major sticking point in mideast peace talks . a ship carrying nine jewish activists from germany , britain , israel and the us set sail on sunday to deliver aid to the gaza strip .
the british boat " irene " departed sunday from famagusta in cyprus in protest against israel 's blockade of the palestinian territory .
the israeli foreign ministry called the move a " provocation . "
' a sacred duty ' the activists included 82-year-old holocaust survivor reuven moskovitz .
" it is a sacred duty for me , as a -lsb- holocaust -rsb- survivor , to protest against the persecution , the oppression and the imprisonment of so many people in gaza , including more than 800,000 children , " moskovitz said .
the trip - which was coordinated by the german organization jewish voice for just peace in the near east and the british group jews for justice for palestinians - intends to bring school supplies , musical instruments and fishing nets into gaza .
it comes after israel 's deadly raid of a gaza-bound aid ship last may , resulting in the deaths of nine turkish activists .
israeli defence minister ehud barak has repeatedly warned that israel will intercept any ship nearing gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's may interception of an aid ship proved deadly the activists have vowed to conduct a peaceful sit down should israeli military attempt to deter their entry to the gaza strip .
netanyahu urges restraint the launch of the aid ship on sunday came on the last day of israel 's freeze on settlement building in the occupied territories on the west bank .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu urged israeli settlers in a statement to exercise restraint after the moratorium expires – in an apparent bid to keep alive peace talks with the palestinians .
" the prime minister calls on the residents in judea and samaria -lsb- the west bank -rsb- and the political parties to show restraint and responsibility today and in the future exactly as they showed restraint and responsibility throughout the months of the freeze , " the statement read .
a ' 50-50 ' chance palestinian president mahmud abbas had earlier vowed to abandon peace talks should the jewish settlers recommence construction on occupied land , though he later said in an interview that he would remain in the talks with the agreement of the arab league .
" israel must choose between peace and the continuation of settlements , " he told the united nations in new york on saturday , denouncing israel 's " mentality of expansion and domination " in the west bank .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barak believes there is a 50 percent chance for the moratorium 's extension while abbas 's spokesman told reporters that there was no progress in a us-led push to extend the moratorium , israeli defence minister barak maintained until the last minute that an extension would be possible .
" i think that the chance of achieving a mutually agreed understanding about -lsb- a -rsb- moratorium is 50-50 , " barak said in a bbc interview in new york where he was meeting with us officials , adding , " i think that the chances of having a peace process is much higher . "
settlers to start new constructions as the official moratorium came to an end , israeli settlers were poised to begin construction on new developments in palestinian territory .
settlers and their supporters held a rally in the settlement of revava to mark the end of the freeze .

meanwhile , a ban on west bank construction has ended - the issue is a major sticking point in mideast peace talks . a ship carrying nine jewish activists from germany , britain , israel and the us set sail on sunday to deliver aid to the gaza strip .
the british boat " irene " departed sunday from famagusta in cyprus in protest against israel 's blockade of the palestinian territory .
the israeli foreign ministry called the move a " provocation . "
' a sacred duty ' the activists included 82-year-old holocaust survivor reuven moskovitz .
" it is a sacred duty for me , as a -lsb- holocaust -rsb- survivor , to protest against the persecution , the oppression and the imprisonment of so many people in gaza , including more than 800,000 children , " moskovitz said .
the trip - which was coordinated by the german organization jewish voice for just peace in the near east and the british group jews for justice for palestinians - intends to bring school supplies , musical instruments and fishing nets into gaza .
it comes after israel 's deadly raid of a gaza-bound aid ship last may , resulting in the deaths of nine turkish activists .
israeli defence minister ehud barak has repeatedly warned that israel will intercept any ship nearing gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's may interception of an aid ship proved deadly the activists have vowed to conduct a peaceful sit down should israeli military attempt to deter their entry to the gaza strip .
netanyahu urges restraint the launch of the aid ship on sunday came on the last day of israel 's freeze on settlement building in the occupied territories on the west bank .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu urged israeli settlers in a statement to exercise restraint after the moratorium expires – in an apparent bid to keep alive peace talks with the palestinians .
" the prime minister calls on the residents in judea and samaria -lsb- the west bank -rsb- and the political parties to show restraint and responsibility today and in the future exactly as they showed restraint and responsibility throughout the months of the freeze , " the statement read .
a ' 50-50 ' chance palestinian president mahmud abbas had earlier vowed to abandon peace talks should the jewish settlers recommence construction on occupied land , though he later said in an interview that he would remain in the talks with the agreement of the arab league .
" israel must choose between peace and the continuation of settlements , " he told the united nations in new york on saturday , denouncing israel 's " mentality of expansion and domination " in the west bank .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barak believes there is a 50 percent chance for the moratorium 's extension while abbas 's spokesman told reporters that there was no progress in a us-led push to extend the moratorium , israeli defence minister barak maintained until the last minute that an extension would be possible .
" i think that the chance of achieving a mutually agreed understanding about -lsb- a -rsb- moratorium is 50-50 , " barak said in a bbc interview in new york where he was meeting with us officials , adding , " i think that the chances of having a peace process is much higher . "
settlers to start new constructions as the official moratorium came to an end , israeli settlers were poised to begin construction on new developments in palestinian territory .
settlers and their supporters held a rally in the settlement of revava to mark the end of the freeze .
in another settlement the foundation stone for a new kindergarten was laid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settlement construction has been on hold for 10 months but it was not expected that there would be a massive surge in construction activity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de festivals -pipe- 27.09.2010 distinguished german composer henze is honored at home großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' gisela ! ' pits gritty germany against explosive italy in its culture capital year , germany 's ruhr region is honoring its most distinguished musical son - composer hans werner henze - with a plethora of concerts and events known collectively as " the henze project . " born in the german town of guetersloh in 1926 , hans werner henze is one of germany 's greatest living composers and one of the most significant figures of 20th century classical music .
he 's also been the initiator of numerous projects designed to encourage and nurture young musical talent .
most notably , in 1976 , he founded the cantiere internazionale d 'arte summer academy in montepulciano , which remains a benchmark for progressive music teaching the world over . now , the ruhr valley is honoring henze with a plethora of concerts and events , known collectively as " the henze project . "
in keeping with the composer 's long-standing commitment to encouraging young talent , the jewel in the project 's crown is a new work devised for and with young people . a new composition composed in collaboration with the writers michael kerstan and christian lehnert , " gisela ! - or , the strange and memorable paths of happiness , " is performed by a colorful mix of up-and-coming talent and established professional innovators . several parts are taken by students of essen 's folkswang university , the choir is a youth group from dortmund , and the regional youth ensemble has worked together with cutting-edge contemporary music outfit musikfabrik to create its own distinctive sound . asked by deutsche welle why his work with young people was so important to him , henze answered rather enigmatically : " people are like cats .
when a cat has a litter , all of the kittens are different . each one has a different design , although they come from the same father and mother .
the same goes for -lsb- young -rsb- musicians . "
he said he sees himself not as a teacher , but as an " ally , " henze added .
from che guevara to gisela from oberhausen one noticeable difference between the octogenarian maestro and the up-and-coming generation of composers is that whereas henze 's career has been likened to a seismograph through which the great political and social upheavals of the twentieth century can be read , critics often bemoan the lack of political engagement among contemporary musicians and artists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henze is a national treasure - and an expatriot for his part , henze theorized that political engagement has waned along with certain cultural heroes .
" i think there 's been a sort of withdrawal , " henze said .
" in a funny way , i think it has a lot to do with the death of figures like ernesto -lsb- che -rsb- guevara and rudi dutschke .
somehow , these deaths were followed by a feeling of helplessness , a powerlessness to rebel , however necessary rebellion may be . " henze , who knew both the argentinean revolutionary and the leader of the 1968 german student movement personally , said the political content of his work has never been intentional , but has rather stemmed from his interest in people and his sensitivity to the world around him . music should not be written for an elite , henze insists .
instead , " it should try to reach as wide , and as deep as it can . " from sunny naples to grey oberhausen set in the heartland of germany 's industrial ruhr valley , " gisela ! " looks set to succeed in reaching out to a wider audience by tapping into discourse of regional identity , brought about by essen 's european capital of culture status . " gisela ! " is the story of the eponymous protagonist , a young woman from oberhausen who visits naples with her boyfriend hanspeter , only to fall in love with gennaro , a charismatic italian with a penchant for commedia dell 'arte-style mischief .
determined to prove that her hometown is not the grim and grimy industrial landscape of genarro 's prejudice , but rather part of a sparkling new european capital of culture , gisela takes her new lover home with her . the basic story line could have been drafted by the local tourist board , but the conclusion is a bit more enigmatic .
the inevitable confrontation between the rival lovers is interrupted by the joyful explosion of vesuvius in approbation of gisela 's union with gennaro .
germany 's brand new culture capital seems to have won the blessing of italy 's noble cultural tradition .
however , as the curtain falls , the volcano begins to rain dark ash .
although , in the words of his long-term collaborator michael kerstan , he 's " still very much a german personality , " hans werner henze left germany in 1956 , making italy his permanent home .
unlike gisela , henze has no intentions of returning permanently .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 27.09.2010 limping into champions league fixture , bayern extend with van gaal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is to stay on in munich until the end of the 2011-2012 season fresh off a contract extension with coach louis van gaal , bayern munich are looking for redemption on tuesday in europe .
injury trouble and dysfunction in attack have meant their bundesliga campaign is a shambles . five goals , eight points , ninth place .
such is bayern munich 's meager return from the first six matches of the new bundesliga season .
in that bayern had got off to a slow start last year too before finishing as champions , players and club officials had , until recently , been leery of making critical statements .
since saturday 's 2-1 home loss to surprise league leaders mainz , all that has changed .
“ we have too many players who are n't playing up to their usual standard , ” said defender philipp lahm .
“ work-rate , aggressiveness , passion - we 're missing all of it at the moment , ” said bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
the loss left bayern 10 points adrift of mainz , and that wide margin appears to be ringing a few alarm bells on saebenerstrasse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 27.09.2010 limping into champions league fixture , bayern extend with van gaal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is to stay on in munich until the end of the 2011-2012 season fresh off a contract extension with coach louis van gaal , bayern munich are looking for redemption on tuesday in europe .
injury trouble and dysfunction in attack have meant their bundesliga campaign is a shambles . five goals , eight points , ninth place .
such is bayern munich 's meager return from the first six matches of the new bundesliga season .
in that bayern had got off to a slow start last year too before finishing as champions , players and club officials had , until recently , been leery of making critical statements .
since saturday 's 2-1 home loss to surprise league leaders mainz , all that has changed .
“ we have too many players who are n't playing up to their usual standard , ” said defender philipp lahm .
“ work-rate , aggressiveness , passion - we 're missing all of it at the moment , ” said bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
the loss left bayern 10 points adrift of mainz , and that wide margin appears to be ringing a few alarm bells on saebenerstrasse .
“ it 's going to be hard to make up for this deficit , ” lahm added in his post-game remarks .
“ we let happen precisely what we did n't want to happen .
it 's going to take a long time to make up 10 points . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's captain in south africa , lahm , speaks his mind at bayern too sitting prettier luckily for bayern , the champions league is a different story .
there , the bavarians can head to switzerland to take on fc basel with their heads held high .
as if to underscore the club 's confidence that all was not yet lost , bayern 's head coach , louis van gaal , signed a one-year contract extension in basel on monday .
the deal keeps him and his supporting cast of coaches on at the club through june 2012 .
two weeks ago , van gaal 's men broke down a dogged as roma defense and got a 2-0 win to top their group .
basel , meanwhile , stumbled to a 2-1 loss in romania to cfr cluj .
if bayern can manage a win at the st. jakob park on tuesday , they could stay in the driver 's seat in group e , with a potentially winnable home-and-away match-up with cluj next on the club 's docket .
some in the club are already looking to the champions league campaign as a corrective to the poor league start .
“ we need to stay calm , ” said hamit altintop , the turkey winger who has begun to see more playing time with franck ribery out injured for the coming weeks .
“ we won the first game and can afford to play it safe - we do n't have to go storming into attack from the get-go . ”
hurting for goals perhaps it would n't do much good to play things hell-for-leather .
it 's in attack that bayern have disappointed the most .
despite starting the potent likes of thomas mueller , toni kroos , ivica olic and miroslav klose on saturday , bayern failed to find the net - relying instead on a mainz own-goal to get on the scoreboard .
this is not to say bayern 's offensive front is n't able to keep the ball , or create chances .
indeed , they had more than 70 percent of the ball and shot it 15 times .
but many of those chances were not of a particularly high standard , and their shooting was poor .
bayern put the ball on target just four times .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben scored 23 goals and set up eight more for bayern last season it would seem that the missing creativity , not to mention finishing , of arjen robben is holding the team back .
the dutchman 's muscle tear will keep him out of the lineup until the new year , and now franck ribery 's injured ankle means he 'll miss another month at least .
bayern could use their offensive potency .
kroos and mueller filled in fairly effectively for robben and ribery on the two wings on saturday , but this left the side bereft of ideas in the middle , where neither strikers olic and klose , nor defensive midfielders bastian schweinsteiger and mark van bommel offered much creativity .
a change of system , perhaps one that brings mueller and / or kroos into the middle , may do the trick - and in truth , it will have to .
bayern 's small squad means that there are no further personnel options left for van gaal should he wish to shake up the offense .
about a month ago , during the transfer-rumor-mad silly season , big-name playmakers like rafael van de vaart were brought up in connection with bayern munich . van gaal told reporters then that he did n't feel he needed to go out and buy any players to bolster the squad .
“ alaba is better ! ” van gaal had said , referring to one of his favorite young charges , the 18-year-old austrian david alaba , who he 'd used as an emergency wingback last year , but whose real strength is in the offensive midfield .
it was a bold statement - but perhaps we 'd agree with him , if we could only see alaba play .
but that poor lad is hurt as well .

but whether true unity has been achieved depends on whom you ask .
we examine what reunification does and could mean . one important measure of today 's undivided germany is economic , and on this score , as on so many others , the picture is mixed . huge strides have been made in the past twenty years .
just about every eastern german city and town has been thoroughly renovated .
and while income and other economic indices in the east are only 70 to 80 percent of what they are in the west , costs of living - especially for rent - are commensurately lower , so one could argue most eastern germans are n't that much worse off than their western fellow citizens . " silicon saxony " with its computer chips , and the optical industry in and around the city of jena in thuringia , are two examples of eastern industrial success . " i 'm very impressed with how the people in germany 's new states mastered the considerable challenges after 1989 , " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , who helped negotiate the original unification treaty , told deutsche welle .
" i 'm not disappointed at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some high-tech industries have flourished in the east but not everyone 's a winner .
as of july 2010 , unemployment in the east -lrb- 11.5 % -rrb- was nearly double what it was in the west -lrb- 6.6 % -rrb- , and an astonishing 50 percent of the 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 103 billion -rrb- in annual developmental subsidies transferred from west to east is eaten up by social benefits and welfare payments . " unfortunately , economic processes do n't work along the lines of what is just , " richard schroeder - a respected former professor of philosophy and theology at berlin 's humboldt university - said at a major conference earlier this year .
" we have large numbers of people who were n't pillars of the old system but whose situations have gotten a lot worse after the economic caesura . " some 1.6 million people have relocated from east to west since 1990 , most in search of better job opportunities , and that trend shows no sign of letting up .
moreover , sociologists speak of a " brain drain " from the east since it 's the better educated who make up the majority of those who leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty apartment blocks are a common sight in hoyerswerda it 's not uncommon to see unneeded housing units being torn down in eastern cities .
the most extreme example is hoyerswerda near germany 's border with poland and the czech republic , which has lost half of its population in the past decade . in these respects , two different economic subsets continue to exist .
and dissatisfaction with such differences and inequities has manifested itself politically . the rise and fragmentation of the left the incorporation of what germans call the " new states " into the political system of the federal republic has wrought changes few would have anticipated back in 1990 . the current german chancellor , angela merkel , hails from the east , although many germans tend to forget that fact .
and though most eastern germans vote for one of the western parties , others have sought their own alternative . the left party , the successor to the old socialist party in communist east germany , combined with left-wing fringe parties from the west , has established itself as a mouthpiece for disgruntled easterners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi -lrb- right -rrb- and westerner oskar lafontaine led the left party to prominence " reunification had a structural flaw in that the elites of the east were n't accepted , and not just the political elites , but the pedagogical , scientific and artistic elites as well , " left party parliamentary leader gregor gysi told deutsche welle .
" in the beginning , they had no time for my party , but they were rebuffed and forced back to us because the other parties were n't prepared to accept them . " the ironic result is that while the spd and the greens are leery of cooperating with former communists , the political left is bifurcated , helping merkel 's center-right government to hold on to power . the establishment of the left party as a form of peaceful political protest can be seen as evidence of eastern germans ' adoption of western democracy .
but it has also deepened many western germans ' sense of a cultural divide between them and their fellow citizens . ost- and westalgia one unambiguously positive aspect of reunification has been the removal of political barriers that kept many german families painfully separated during the cold war .
there are no exact figures for how many west and east germans had relatives in the " other " germany , but an average of 26 million care packages were sent annually from west to east during germany 's division - an indication of the personal hardships caused by political division . " those who felt imprisoned were overjoyed at an end to their suffering , " says brigitte klump , an author whose private petitions to the united nations over the course of many years helped some 4,000 people leave communist east germany .
" and naturally i still feel joy when i hear from people who succeeded in integrating into the west . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are n't many east-west marriages ostalgia - eastern germans ' supposed longing for the way things were - is a regular topic in the media , but in polls only around ten percent of easterners say they preferred life under socialism .
and eastern germans ' self-identification as a group decreases the later they were born . meanwhile , around half of western germans say the time before 1989 was better than afterward .
this reflects their fond memories of a period of affluence and clear social consensus and suggests that " westalgia " is far more prevalent than its eastern equivalent . partnerships between eastern and western germans make up only around four percent of all german marriages .
this may be due to the fact that most germans still stay in the places they grew up and maintain long-term social circles .
but the number of " ossis " and " wessis " tying the knot lags significantly behind that of germans and foreigners . " thanks to reunification , germany as a whole has gotten a lot more diverse , and feelings of togetherness have grown , " wolfgang schaeuble said .
" what we still need is time , patience , including patience with one another , and the experience of having successfully solved problems together . " the global factor one oft-neglected aspect of reunification is the contributions made by residents who do not hold german passports and the effects it had on them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners are also part of the story foreigners account for roughly eight percent of germany 's population , and with the removal of the east-west political divide , german society became much more multicultural , with large communities from eastern europe joining the substantial turkish minority that had established itself in the post-war federal republic . " the german immigrant nation is one of many nationalities , including germans from the old federal republic , others from the former east , millions of ethnic germans from eastern europe as well as an immigrant population of non-german descent , " said germany 's leading immigration expert klaus bade .
" former ' guest workers ' make up the majority , but there are also lots of smaller groups from an ever greater variety of backgrounds . " foreigners have an inestimable impact on today 's german society , and immigration is crucial in offsetting population decline , as both western and eastern germans are having fewer and fewer children . but after a boom immediately following the end of the cold war , the number of foreigners in germany has stagnated .
economists and sociologists see this as a worrisome trend because germany needs to increase its workforce to compensate for the aging population entering retirement . two decades on from 1990 , it is more apparent than ever that " reunification " is not a restoration of a past society , but a process of creating something new that is inextricable from globalization .
old national paradigms are coming under ever increasing challenges , so the future of the new federal republic is likely to be influenced just as much by factors from abroad as from within its own borders . author : jefferson chase editor : kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just about every eastern german city and town has been thoroughly renovated .

as of july 2010 , unemployment in the east -lrb- 11.5 % -rrb- was nearly double what it was in the west -lrb- 6.6 % -rrb- , and an astonishing 50 percent of the 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 103 billion -rrb- in annual developmental subsidies transferred from west to east is eaten up by social benefits and welfare payments . " unfortunately , economic processes do n't work along the lines of what is just , " richard schroeder - a respected former professor of philosophy and theology at berlin 's humboldt university - said at a major conference earlier this year .
" we have large numbers of people who were n't pillars of the old system but whose situations have gotten a lot worse after the economic caesura . " some 1.6 million people have relocated from east to west since 1990 , most in search of better job opportunities , and that trend shows no sign of letting up .

and dissatisfaction with such differences and inequities has manifested itself politically . the rise and fragmentation of the left the incorporation of what germans call the " new states " into the political system of the federal republic has wrought changes few would have anticipated back in 1990 . the current german chancellor , angela merkel , hails from the east , although many germans tend to forget that fact .
and though most eastern germans vote for one of the western parties , others have sought their own alternative . the left party , the successor to the old socialist party in communist east germany , combined with left-wing fringe parties from the west , has established itself as a mouthpiece for disgruntled easterners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi -lrb- right -rrb- and westerner oskar lafontaine led the left party to prominence " reunification had a structural flaw in that the elites of the east were n't accepted , and not just the political elites , but the pedagogical , scientific and artistic elites as well , " left party parliamentary leader gregor gysi told deutsche welle .
" in the beginning , they had no time for my party , but they were rebuffed and forced back to us because the other parties were n't prepared to accept them . " the ironic result is that while the spd and the greens are leery of cooperating with former communists , the political left is bifurcated , helping merkel 's center-right government to hold on to power . the establishment of the left party as a form of peaceful political protest can be seen as evidence of eastern germans ' adoption of western democracy .
but it has also deepened many western germans ' sense of a cultural divide between them and their fellow citizens . ost- and westalgia one unambiguously positive aspect of reunification has been the removal of political barriers that kept many german families painfully separated during the cold war .
there are no exact figures for how many west and east germans had relatives in the " other " germany , but an average of 26 million care packages were sent annually from west to east during germany 's division - an indication of the personal hardships caused by political division . " those who felt imprisoned were overjoyed at an end to their suffering , " says brigitte klump , an author whose private petitions to the united nations over the course of many years helped some 4,000 people leave communist east germany .

and eastern germans ' self-identification as a group decreases the later they were born . meanwhile , around half of western germans say the time before 1989 was better than afterward .
this reflects their fond memories of a period of affluence and clear social consensus and suggests that " westalgia " is far more prevalent than its eastern equivalent . partnerships between eastern and western germans make up only around four percent of all german marriages .
this may be due to the fact that most germans still stay in the places they grew up and maintain long-term social circles .
but the number of " ossis " and " wessis " tying the knot lags significantly behind that of germans and foreigners . " thanks to reunification , germany as a whole has gotten a lot more diverse , and feelings of togetherness have grown , " wolfgang schaeuble said .

opposition parties claim the package will make the poor poorer . german labor minister ursula von der leyen has defended a minimal rise in welfare payments against sharp criticism from opposition parties and trade unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 5 euro increase per month has been branded derisory " the rates are very fair , " she told the daily bild newspaper , following criticism of a rise of 5 euros -lrb- $ 6.70 -rrb- a month which had been agreed by the coalition on sunday .
currently , germany 's 6.5 million " hartz iv " welfare recipients receive up to 359 euros per month .
" the federal statistical office analyzed what people on low earnings were able to spend each month , " said von der leyen , citing sales staff , janitors and hairdressers as examples .
" the calculations show accurately what the subsistence level is . "
' bad news for welfare recipients ' trade unions , as well as opposition parties such as the social democrats and greens , have warned that the rise is not enough and means that the poor will drift deeper into economic difficulties .
however , christian democrat von der leyen said that welfare rates had to be compared with lower level incomes in the working population .
" whoever demands that hartz iv should be higher must justify it by looking at the statistical data , compared with employees who work full time , " said the minister .
" those employees pay for hartz iv through their taxes and , in the end , many of them do not have much more money to spare -lsb- than hartz iv recipients -rsb- . "
no tobacco and alcohol allowance von der leyen defended the fact that the hartz iv would no longer provide an allowance for alcohol and tobacco .
while provision for basic needs was " sacrosanct , " she said , such products did not fall into this category .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will no longer be an allowance for alcohol or cigarettes the minister argued that any attempt by opposition parties to block the reforms in germany 's upper house - the bundesrat , where the ruling coalition has no majority - could not be justified .
chancellor angela merkel and party leaders from coalition partners the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- met to agree the changes on sunday .
monthly benefits for children are set to remain the same at 215 euros , 251 euros and 287 euros for children under age six , aged six to 14 and 14-18 , respectively .
however , the reforms include plans for " non-cash " benefits , such as a chip card that gives needy children access to educational and recreational services .

critics doubt it . one of the hot topics at this year 's iaa commercial vehicles trade show in hanover is the german governent 's nationwide " long truck " field trial planned some time next year .
the trails could lead to new regulations on semi-truck lengths , creating new business opportunities for both makers of long-haul transportation vehicles and logistics companies operating them .
experts say longer trucks could reduce trucking costs by 20 to 25 percent .
" we build long trucks , and the experience of our customers using them in scandinavia , the netherlands and other markets has been good , " detlef hug , a spokesman for german truck maker man , told deutsche welle .
" of course , germany has its own challenges like heavy traffic and hilly terrain .
so that 's why it is a good idea to conduct a nationwide field trial so that we can test fuel and co2 emission reduction , safety , the impact on car drivers and more . "
truck traffic to increase 70 percent there is a sense of political urgency in berlin .
the federal transportation ministry estimates that truck traffic - already choking numerous german highways - will increase by 70 percent over the next 15 years .
and no one knows where all those vehicles should go .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's autobahns look more like a truck parking lot these days three years ago , several german states launched their own field trials – with mixed results .
accompanying studies also painted a blurred picture .
one of the studies , by the technical rwth aachen university , concluded that long trucks are safe and would reduce emissions .
longer vehicles , it noted , hardly use more fuel than current shorter models ; only during acceleration does the additional load make the truck 's engine slightly less efficient .
but another study by the fraunhofer institute for systems and innovative research claimed that while long trucks could relieve roads and the environment in the short term , they would , in the long term , cause a shift from rail to road that would offset any benefits .
" we 're aware of the work the states have done and the results of their tests will flow into a joint working group between the federal and state transportation ministries , " a spokesman from the federal transportation ministry told deutsche welle .
" these tests , however , were on a small scale .
what is needed is a much larger field trial across the entire country to determine the impact on logistics . "
plenty of interest more than 300 companies , including man , have already registered to participate in the federal government 's planned nationwide test , though a final number of participants has yet to be set .

critics doubt it . one of the hot topics at this year 's iaa commercial vehicles trade show in hanover is the german governent 's nationwide " long truck " field trial planned some time next year .
the trails could lead to new regulations on semi-truck lengths , creating new business opportunities for both makers of long-haul transportation vehicles and logistics companies operating them .
experts say longer trucks could reduce trucking costs by 20 to 25 percent .
" we build long trucks , and the experience of our customers using them in scandinavia , the netherlands and other markets has been good , " detlef hug , a spokesman for german truck maker man , told deutsche welle .
" of course , germany has its own challenges like heavy traffic and hilly terrain .
so that 's why it is a good idea to conduct a nationwide field trial so that we can test fuel and co2 emission reduction , safety , the impact on car drivers and more . "
truck traffic to increase 70 percent there is a sense of political urgency in berlin .
the federal transportation ministry estimates that truck traffic - already choking numerous german highways - will increase by 70 percent over the next 15 years .
and no one knows where all those vehicles should go .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's autobahns look more like a truck parking lot these days three years ago , several german states launched their own field trials – with mixed results .
accompanying studies also painted a blurred picture .
one of the studies , by the technical rwth aachen university , concluded that long trucks are safe and would reduce emissions .
longer vehicles , it noted , hardly use more fuel than current shorter models ; only during acceleration does the additional load make the truck 's engine slightly less efficient .
but another study by the fraunhofer institute for systems and innovative research claimed that while long trucks could relieve roads and the environment in the short term , they would , in the long term , cause a shift from rail to road that would offset any benefits .
" we 're aware of the work the states have done and the results of their tests will flow into a joint working group between the federal and state transportation ministries , " a spokesman from the federal transportation ministry told deutsche welle .
" these tests , however , were on a small scale .
what is needed is a much larger field trial across the entire country to determine the impact on logistics . "
plenty of interest more than 300 companies , including man , have already registered to participate in the federal government 's planned nationwide test , though a final number of participants has yet to be set .
the goal is to test tractor-trailer combinations with a length of 25.25 meters -lrb- 83 feet -rrb- , or 6.5 meters -lrb- 21 feet -rrb- longer than currently allowed .
the gross weight of the vehicles will remain at the current 44 tons for semi-trucks or 44 for " intermodal " container trucks .

meanwhile , a ban on west bank construction has ended - the issue is a major sticking point in mideast peace talks . a ship carrying nine jewish activists from germany , britain , israel and the us set sail on sunday to deliver aid to the gaza strip .
the british boat " irene " departed sunday from famagusta in cyprus in protest against israel 's blockade of the palestinian territory .
the israeli foreign ministry called the move a " provocation . "
' a sacred duty ' the activists included 82-year-old holocaust survivor reuven moskovitz .
" it is a sacred duty for me , as a -lsb- holocaust -rsb- survivor , to protest against the persecution , the oppression and the imprisonment of so many people in gaza , including more than 800,000 children , " moskovitz said .
the trip - which was coordinated by the german organization jewish voice for just peace in the near east and the british group jews for justice for palestinians - intends to bring school supplies , musical instruments and fishing nets into gaza .
it comes after israel 's deadly raid of a gaza-bound aid ship last may , resulting in the deaths of nine turkish activists .
israeli defence minister ehud barak has repeatedly warned that israel will intercept any ship nearing gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's may interception of an aid ship proved deadly the activists have vowed to conduct a peaceful sit down should israeli military attempt to deter their entry to the gaza strip .
netanyahu urges restraint the launch of the aid ship on sunday came on the last day of israel 's freeze on settlement building in the occupied territories on the west bank .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu urged israeli settlers in a statement to exercise restraint after the moratorium expires – in an apparent bid to keep alive peace talks with the palestinians .
" the prime minister calls on the residents in judea and samaria -lsb- the west bank -rsb- and the political parties to show restraint and responsibility today and in the future exactly as they showed restraint and responsibility throughout the months of the freeze , " the statement read .
a ' 50-50 ' chance palestinian president mahmud abbas had earlier vowed to abandon peace talks should the jewish settlers recommence construction on occupied land , though he later said in an interview that he would remain in the talks with the agreement of the arab league .
" israel must choose between peace and the continuation of settlements , " he told the united nations in new york on saturday , denouncing israel 's " mentality of expansion and domination " in the west bank .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barak believes there is a 50 percent chance for the moratorium 's extension while abbas 's spokesman told reporters that there was no progress in a us-led push to extend the moratorium , israeli defence minister barak maintained until the last minute that an extension would be possible .
" i think that the chance of achieving a mutually agreed understanding about -lsb- a -rsb- moratorium is 50-50 , " barak said in a bbc interview in new york where he was meeting with us officials , adding , " i think that the chances of having a peace process is much higher . "
settlers to start new constructions as the official moratorium came to an end , israeli settlers were poised to begin construction on new developments in palestinian territory .
settlers and their supporters held a rally in the settlement of revava to mark the end of the freeze .
in another settlement the foundation stone for a new kindergarten was laid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settlement construction has been on hold for 10 months but it was not expected that there would be a massive surge in construction activity .
" we are getting back to business as usual and building but we will respect the prime minister 's request , " said david ha 'ivri , head of the samaria regional council .
over 430,000 jews live in more than 100 settlements across territory in the west bank and east jerusalem that israel captured from jordan in 1967 .

the dung is a writer with over half a dozen books on his list of publications . the two men are excited about their latest project – books by german authors translated into vietnamese . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " chronik der wende " about the collapse of east germany has been translated into vietnamese " the first book is finished , " knost said .
" it ’ s the translation of ' chronik der wende , ' almost a non-fiction classic about the collapse of east germany .
this book can now be read by vietnamese speakers . " " chronik der wende " is a popular retrospective of the period between the gdr 's 40th anniversary in early october 1989 and the free parliamentary elections in march 1990 .
the book describes all important events day by day and illustrates them with photographs from the time . vietnamese know little about german history but why should people in vietnam read this book now , more than 20 years after the events took place ?
author the dung claims there is a need for such an introduction as most of his fellow vietnamese know very little about contemporary german history . " very few people in vietnam can really comprehend what happened in germany with the fall of the wall .
that is why i thought we should start our publishing business with this particular book . " vipen editors has also published a volume of essays by east german writer christa wolf , where she analyses the political events of 1989 .
wolf is already known to intellectuals in vietnam as the author of " der geteilte himmel " -lrb- " divided heaven " -rrb- , a novella about the situation in the gdr , which was available in vietnamese in the 1980s .
now readers will have the chance to follow up on her views about germany . books need to be sold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter knost has published books from the developing world for a long time however , running a publishing house is not just a matter of translating and printing .
books also need to be sold .
currently , vipen editors can only circulate small numbers of their books in vietnam .
a few stores in the major cities import the books from berlin . as peter knost explains , they also want to target buyers closer to home : " we can ’ t really reach the vietnamese community via german book stores .
instead , we sell our books at events , public readings , libraries , and so on .
many vietnamese corner shops that sell all kinds of things also have books on display . " several german trade publishers already bring out books in languages such as turkish , arabic , or russian .
with their titles in vietnamese , vipen editors is trying to fill a gap and hoping to turn it into a profitable business . " if everything works out as planned over the next five years , we will have conquered and securely established our market niche . " but the men behind vipen editors know the most crucial aspect of their plan : to find ways to distribute larger numbers of their books not just at home , but in vietnam . author : thomas voelkner editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opposition parties claim the package will make the poor poorer . german labor minister ursula von der leyen has defended a minimal rise in welfare payments against sharp criticism from opposition parties and trade unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 5 euro increase per month has been branded derisory " the rates are very fair , " she told the daily bild newspaper , following criticism of a rise of 5 euros -lrb- $ 6.70 -rrb- a month which had been agreed by the coalition on sunday .
currently , germany 's 6.5 million " hartz iv " welfare recipients receive up to 359 euros per month .
" the federal statistical office analyzed what people on low earnings were able to spend each month , " said von der leyen , citing sales staff , janitors and hairdressers as examples .
" the calculations show accurately what the subsistence level is . "
' bad news for welfare recipients ' trade unions , as well as opposition parties such as the social democrats and greens , have warned that the rise is not enough and means that the poor will drift deeper into economic difficulties .
however , christian democrat von der leyen said that welfare rates had to be compared with lower level incomes in the working population .
" whoever demands that hartz iv should be higher must justify it by looking at the statistical data , compared with employees who work full time , " said the minister .
" those employees pay for hartz iv through their taxes and , in the end , many of them do not have much more money to spare -lsb- than hartz iv recipients -rsb- . "
no tobacco and alcohol allowance von der leyen defended the fact that the hartz iv would no longer provide an allowance for alcohol and tobacco .
while provision for basic needs was " sacrosanct , " she said , such products did not fall into this category .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will no longer be an allowance for alcohol or cigarettes the minister argued that any attempt by opposition parties to block the reforms in germany 's upper house - the bundesrat , where the ruling coalition has no majority - could not be justified .
chancellor angela merkel and party leaders from coalition partners the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- met to agree the changes on sunday .
monthly benefits for children are set to remain the same at 215 euros , 251 euros and 287 euros for children under age six , aged six to 14 and 14-18 , respectively .
however , the reforms include plans for " non-cash " benefits , such as a chip card that gives needy children access to educational and recreational services .

meanwhile , a ban on west bank construction has ended - the issue is a major sticking point in mideast peace talks . a ship carrying nine jewish activists from germany , britain , israel and the us set sail on sunday to deliver aid to the gaza strip .
the british boat " irene " departed sunday from famagusta in cyprus in protest against israel 's blockade of the palestinian territory .
the israeli foreign ministry called the move a " provocation . "
' a sacred duty ' the activists included 82-year-old holocaust survivor reuven moskovitz .
" it is a sacred duty for me , as a -lsb- holocaust -rsb- survivor , to protest against the persecution , the oppression and the imprisonment of so many people in gaza , including more than 800,000 children , " moskovitz said .
the trip - which was coordinated by the german organization jewish voice for just peace in the near east and the british group jews for justice for palestinians - intends to bring school supplies , musical instruments and fishing nets into gaza .
it comes after israel 's deadly raid of a gaza-bound aid ship last may , resulting in the deaths of nine turkish activists .
israeli defence minister ehud barak has repeatedly warned that israel will intercept any ship nearing gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's may interception of an aid ship proved deadly the activists have vowed to conduct a peaceful sit down should israeli military attempt to deter their entry to the gaza strip .
netanyahu urges restraint the launch of the aid ship on sunday came on the last day of israel 's freeze on settlement building in the occupied territories on the west bank .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu urged israeli settlers in a statement to exercise restraint after the moratorium expires – in an apparent bid to keep alive peace talks with the palestinians .
" the prime minister calls on the residents in judea and samaria -lsb- the west bank -rsb- and the political parties to show restraint and responsibility today and in the future exactly as they showed restraint and responsibility throughout the months of the freeze , " the statement read .
a ' 50-50 ' chance palestinian president mahmud abbas had earlier vowed to abandon peace talks should the jewish settlers recommence construction on occupied land , though he later said in an interview that he would remain in the talks with the agreement of the arab league .
" israel must choose between peace and the continuation of settlements , " he told the united nations in new york on saturday , denouncing israel 's " mentality of expansion and domination " in the west bank .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barak believes there is a 50 percent chance for the moratorium 's extension while abbas 's spokesman told reporters that there was no progress in a us-led push to extend the moratorium , israeli defence minister barak maintained until the last minute that an extension would be possible .
" i think that the chance of achieving a mutually agreed understanding about -lsb- a -rsb- moratorium is 50-50 , " barak said in a bbc interview in new york where he was meeting with us officials , adding , " i think that the chances of having a peace process is much higher . "
settlers to start new constructions as the official moratorium came to an end , israeli settlers were poised to begin construction on new developments in palestinian territory .
settlers and their supporters held a rally in the settlement of revava to mark the end of the freeze .
in another settlement the foundation stone for a new kindergarten was laid .

critics doubt it . one of the hot topics at this year 's iaa commercial vehicles trade show in hanover is the german governent 's nationwide " long truck " field trial planned some time next year .
the trails could lead to new regulations on semi-truck lengths , creating new business opportunities for both makers of long-haul transportation vehicles and logistics companies operating them .
experts say longer trucks could reduce trucking costs by 20 to 25 percent .
" we build long trucks , and the experience of our customers using them in scandinavia , the netherlands and other markets has been good , " detlef hug , a spokesman for german truck maker man , told deutsche welle .
" of course , germany has its own challenges like heavy traffic and hilly terrain .
so that 's why it is a good idea to conduct a nationwide field trial so that we can test fuel and co2 emission reduction , safety , the impact on car drivers and more . "
truck traffic to increase 70 percent there is a sense of political urgency in berlin .
the federal transportation ministry estimates that truck traffic - already choking numerous german highways - will increase by 70 percent over the next 15 years .
and no one knows where all those vehicles should go .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's autobahns look more like a truck parking lot these days three years ago , several german states launched their own field trials – with mixed results .
accompanying studies also painted a blurred picture .
one of the studies , by the technical rwth aachen university , concluded that long trucks are safe and would reduce emissions .
longer vehicles , it noted , hardly use more fuel than current shorter models ; only during acceleration does the additional load make the truck 's engine slightly less efficient .
but another study by the fraunhofer institute for systems and innovative research claimed that while long trucks could relieve roads and the environment in the short term , they would , in the long term , cause a shift from rail to road that would offset any benefits .
" we 're aware of the work the states have done and the results of their tests will flow into a joint working group between the federal and state transportation ministries , " a spokesman from the federal transportation ministry told deutsche welle .
" these tests , however , were on a small scale .
what is needed is a much larger field trial across the entire country to determine the impact on logistics . "
plenty of interest more than 300 companies , including man , have already registered to participate in the federal government 's planned nationwide test , though a final number of participants has yet to be set .
the goal is to test tractor-trailer combinations with a length of 25.25 meters -lrb- 83 feet -rrb- , or 6.5 meters -lrb- 21 feet -rrb- longer than currently allowed .
the gross weight of the vehicles will remain at the current 44 tons for semi-trucks or 44 for " intermodal " container trucks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man has a booth at the iaa commercial vehicles trade show in hanover " we have heard some talk about the planned nationwide field trial testing 60-ton vehicles , " the ministry spokesman said .
" we have no intention to change the weight .
this is all about increasing volume . "
long trucks , the spokesman said , would allow voluminous goods to be transported with one vehicle , for instance , instead of breaking down the item to transport it with three trucks .
critics of heavy and long 60-ton trucks point to a number of problems , such as the damage they could do to roads and bridges because of their added weight and the lack of sufficiently secure guard rails .
yet long trucks also have their critics , too .
" there are a number of issues to be concerned about , " said martin roggermann from the german pro-rail alliance .
" long trucks are more difficult to pass , they need more space for turning at intersections and do n't fit into the current autobahn parking facilities , not too mention safety issues . "
shift from road to rail but roggermann 's biggest bone of contention is that the expected lower operating costs of long trucks could undermine efforts by his organization and others to shift freight off the road and onto rail .
" we are really concerned about the shift from rail to the road , " he said .
" we do n't believe long trucks will result in fewer trucks but in more trucks and in more problems on german roads . "
moreover , roggermann and others worry that if 40-ton long trucks are allowed , it will only be a matter of time before 60-ton " gigaliners " roar down german roads .
scandinavia began with 40-ton vehicles and later allowed the heavier vehicles , he noted .
few experts will disagree that competition for road freight business has become cutthroat in europe , especially since recent eastward european union expansion .
and plenty of them admit that the prospect of allowing larger vehicles to carry more for less will only fuel that competition .

iran and middle east share center-stage at the un general assembly should germany be awarded a seat on the un security council ?
my opinion is that germany deserves the seat because this country is a big democratic , economic and political player in the world . - leon , us absolutely !
it is long-overdue .
if germany is " good enough " to be used as the sixth country in the stand-off with iran , it clearly deserves to be permanently seated on the security council .
moreover , the very fact that germany pays the third highest dues to the operation of the un can be argument for giving it a more influential voice .
time to leave world war ii behind ! - r.e. , us german foreign minister pushes for seat on security council absolutely , it is high time that germany is given a seat at the un security council .
the same applies for japan , india and brazil .
hopefully , when this becomes a reality , the un may become more productive in solving the world 's problems . - loyola , us i 'm not sure who i would like to receive the temporary seat on the un security council .
it either has to be canada or germany .
if only we could just change our leaders to someone a bit more liberal in their political thinking .
oh well , can not have everything . - cynthia , canada prominent german feminist weighs in loudly on headscarf debate women deserve freedom .
it breaks my heart to see oppression in germany against women .
we women are the other half in society . - blue , us all kind of religious signs including christian cross , jewish side curls , and the headscarf should be banned out of the public domain . - lutz , germany french senate approves burqa ban as far as i 'm concerned there is no government on earth that has the right to tell any person what they can or can not wear at any given time .
i also firmly believe that there is no place in politics for anything resembling religion .

but the invasive searches have stirred privacy concerns . germany began its six-month test period of two full-body scanners at hamburg airport on monday as critics continued to denounce the technology as too invasive .
interior minister thomas de maiziere was one of the first to pass through one of the scanners , saying he did not feel cramped or uncomfortable inside .
“ today is an important step on the way to better security in german airports , ” he said .
the german interior ministry , which is responsible for the project , selected hamburg for the trial run under real airport conditions because it is large , but not so large that technical glitches would seriously disrupt the flow of passenger traffic .
hamburg is germany 's fifth largest airport and serves about 12 million passengers annually .
full-body scanners are already in use in the united states and several european countries but , due to widespread privacy concerns , germany has been slow to test the technology .
until now , the machines had only been tested in the laboratory at the federal police academy in luebeck .
the scanners use low-frequency electromagnetic waves to sweep a schematic representation of the human body to check for concealed weapons or explosives .
passengers walk through a three-meter -lrb- 10 foot -rrb- high and two-meter wide cabin and are scanned by the waves , which the machine 's manufacturer says are 10,000-times weaker than the ordinary electro-smog from cell phones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics , like peter schaar , warn that scanners are too invasive scanners ' too invasive ' , critics warn privacy advocates oppose the use of the technology because they say it is too invasive and could reveal embarrassing details about a passenger .
peter schaar , germany 's federal commissioner for data protection , cautioned that “ very sensitive areas ” of a person 's private life could be revealed , such as breast implants , colostomies or other medical aids .
security experts argue , however , that the scanners are indispensable because they detect things , like plastic explosives and ceramic weapons , which conventional metal detectors would not discover .
this has not stopped some countries , notably italy , from scrapping the scanners .
after a six-month trial at airports in rome , venice and palermo , the machines are no longer in use after being deemed too slow and ineffective .
" we did n't get good results during testing , ” said vito riggio , the president of italy 's aviation authority .

consumers will now also have warranty repair services in all eu countries . over the weekend , apple managed to defuse a potential legal tangle with the european union 's antitrust regulators by adjusting its iphone policies .
the company agreed to make warranty repair services equally available throughout european union countries , regardless of where a phone was purchased .
it also agreed to loosen restrictions on programming tools used to develop apps , the small programs designed to run on smartphones .
in doing so , the company avoided fines which could have been as high as 10 percent of its yearly turnover .
eu competition commissioner joaquin almunia said in a statement on saturday that " apple 's response to our preliminary investigations shows that the commission can use the competition rules to achieve swift results on the market with clear benefits for consumers . "
market changing rapidly but ian fogg , a london-based analyst for forrester research , said the market is changing at a fast pace , making it difficult for regulators to keep up .
apple 's app store was launched just over two years ago and has grown exponentially .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin almunia is the eu competition commissioner apple has at times struggled to bring consistency into the way it manages the apps in its store , fogg said .
he described apple 's app store as a " curated ecosystem " similar to the amazon kindle store or google 's market for android phone apps .
" i think it makes good business sense for any company that 's curating its ecosystem to be consistent and clear about what is and is n't allowed , because that level playing field enables firms to decide where to invest their efforts , " he told deutsche welle .
" apple 's challenge is the same challenge many firms have in that the products and the markets which are being created are so new that everyone is working out the rules as we go along . "
the european commission said the changes to apple 's policy towards iphone apps will remove limits to independent developers who sometimes were in competition with apple itself .
mobile warranty for mobile phones according to fogg , warranty repair policies vary in the consumer electronics market , but such policies carry added meaning for mobile products such as smartphones .
" for a mobile phone product , having the ability to have the product repaired wherever that person is is very important , " he said .
" it 's much more important for a mobile phone than it would be for a high-definition television , which is likely to be used in the same country that it 's bought in for all of its life . "

speaking to the european parliament 's economic affairs committee , european central bank president jean-claude trichet warned that current oversight on eu states ' budgets is too lax , and called for a board of " wise men and women " to watch over budget discipline .
" what has been lacking is some kind of incentive to manage finances responsibly , " trichet said .
" indeed , a core , absolutely indispensable , element of an effective surveillance mechanism is a functioning mechanism of incentives and sanctions - both financial and non-financial . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet said the eu has been lacking incentives for financial responsibility under the eu 's stability and growth pact , member states must keep their budget deficits within three percent of gross domestic product .
but several member states - most notably greece - have flouted the rules , leading to a decline in the eu 's credibility .
sanctions to be quick and ' semi-automatic ' trichet 's comments support a proposal by european economic commissioner olli rehn to impose " semi-automatic " sanctions against such eu members who break budget rules .
the european commission is to lay out the details of its enforcement plan on wednesday .
reports say rehn would propose fines of 0.2 percent of gdp for countries who repeatedly fail to comply with financial rules .
in addition , countries with slipping competitiveness or whose growth is based on " excessive imbalances " like the credit boom in the baltic states would receive fines of 0.1 percent of gdp .
" sanctions ... need to be triggered early enough in the process so that they are essentially preventive , " rehn said monday .
" this is very important in order to ensure fiscal discipline , and sustainable growth in the eu . "
germany advocates harshness germany , traditionally one of the most fiscally conservative eu members , weighed in on the enforcement plan with finance minister wolfgang schaeuble writing a letter to his counterparts in the eu .

schaeuble also called for the sanctions to affect payments from the eu 's substantial regional development and agricultural funds , and his office is reportedly considering supporting the exclusion of fiscal rule breakers from eu decision making .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 27.09.2010 limping into champions league fixture , bayern extend with van gaal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is to stay on in munich until the end of the 2011-2012 season fresh off a contract extension with coach louis van gaal , bayern munich are looking for redemption on tuesday in europe .
injury trouble and dysfunction in attack have meant their bundesliga campaign is a shambles . five goals , eight points , ninth place .
such is bayern munich 's meager return from the first six matches of the new bundesliga season .
in that bayern had got off to a slow start last year too before finishing as champions , players and club officials had , until recently , been leery of making critical statements .
since saturday 's 2-1 home loss to surprise league leaders mainz , all that has changed .
“ we have too many players who are n't playing up to their usual standard , ” said defender philipp lahm .
“ work-rate , aggressiveness , passion - we 're missing all of it at the moment , ” said bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
the loss left bayern 10 points adrift of mainz , and that wide margin appears to be ringing a few alarm bells on saebenerstrasse .
“ it 's going to be hard to make up for this deficit , ” lahm added in his post-game remarks .
“ we let happen precisely what we did n't want to happen .
it 's going to take a long time to make up 10 points . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's captain in south africa , lahm , speaks his mind at bayern too sitting prettier luckily for bayern , the champions league is a different story .
there , the bavarians can head to switzerland to take on fc basel with their heads held high .
as if to underscore the club 's confidence that all was not yet lost , bayern 's head coach , louis van gaal , signed a one-year contract extension in basel on monday .
the deal keeps him and his supporting cast of coaches on at the club through june 2012 .
two weeks ago , van gaal 's men broke down a dogged as roma defense and got a 2-0 win to top their group .
basel , meanwhile , stumbled to a 2-1 loss in romania to cfr cluj .
if bayern can manage a win at the st. jakob park on tuesday , they could stay in the driver 's seat in group e , with a potentially winnable home-and-away match-up with cluj next on the club 's docket .
some in the club are already looking to the champions league campaign as a corrective to the poor league start .
“ we need to stay calm , ” said hamit altintop , the turkey winger who has begun to see more playing time with franck ribery out injured for the coming weeks .
“ we won the first game and can afford to play it safe - we do n't have to go storming into attack from the get-go . ”
hurting for goals perhaps it would n't do much good to play things hell-for-leather .
it 's in attack that bayern have disappointed the most .
despite starting the potent likes of thomas mueller , toni kroos , ivica olic and miroslav klose on saturday , bayern failed to find the net - relying instead on a mainz own-goal to get on the scoreboard .
this is not to say bayern 's offensive front is n't able to keep the ball , or create chances .
indeed , they had more than 70 percent of the ball and shot it 15 times .
but many of those chances were not of a particularly high standard , and their shooting was poor .
bayern put the ball on target just four times .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben scored 23 goals and set up eight more for bayern last season it would seem that the missing creativity , not to mention finishing , of arjen robben is holding the team back .
the dutchman 's muscle tear will keep him out of the lineup until the new year , and now franck ribery 's injured ankle means he 'll miss another month at least .

“ we won the first game and can afford to play it safe - we do n't have to go storming into attack from the get-go . ”
hurting for goals perhaps it would n't do much good to play things hell-for-leather .
it 's in attack that bayern have disappointed the most .
despite starting the potent likes of thomas mueller , toni kroos , ivica olic and miroslav klose on saturday , bayern failed to find the net - relying instead on a mainz own-goal to get on the scoreboard .
this is not to say bayern 's offensive front is n't able to keep the ball , or create chances .
indeed , they had more than 70 percent of the ball and shot it 15 times .
but many of those chances were not of a particularly high standard , and their shooting was poor .
bayern put the ball on target just four times .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben scored 23 goals and set up eight more for bayern last season it would seem that the missing creativity , not to mention finishing , of arjen robben is holding the team back .
the dutchman 's muscle tear will keep him out of the lineup until the new year , and now franck ribery 's injured ankle means he 'll miss another month at least .
bayern could use their offensive potency .
kroos and mueller filled in fairly effectively for robben and ribery on the two wings on saturday , but this left the side bereft of ideas in the middle , where neither strikers olic and klose , nor defensive midfielders bastian schweinsteiger and mark van bommel offered much creativity .
a change of system , perhaps one that brings mueller and / or kroos into the middle , may do the trick - and in truth , it will have to .
bayern 's small squad means that there are no further personnel options left for van gaal should he wish to shake up the offense .
about a month ago , during the transfer-rumor-mad silly season , big-name playmakers like rafael van de vaart were brought up in connection with bayern munich . van gaal told reporters then that he did n't feel he needed to go out and buy any players to bolster the squad .
“ alaba is better ! ” van gaal had said , referring to one of his favorite young charges , the 18-year-old austrian david alaba , who he 'd used as an emergency wingback last year , but whose real strength is in the offensive midfield .
it was a bold statement - but perhaps we 'd agree with him , if we could only see alaba play .
but that poor lad is hurt as well .

not a month after israeli-palestinian peace talks resumed , their future is in jeopardy . palestinian president mahmoud abbas delayed a decision on withdrawing from direct peace talks with israel on monday as france voiced strong support for the palestinian position .
after meeting with abbas in paris , french president nicolas sarkozy told reporters that france regretted that israel had not listened to " unanimous calls " to extend a 10-month freeze on israeli settlement construction in the west bank .
the settlement freeze " should have been extended to give negotiations a chance , " sarkozy said .
" i say this in front of president abbas : settlement must stop . "
european union weighs in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu disappointed world leaders by not extending the settlement freeze catherine ashton , the european union 's foreign policy chief , expressed similar feelings in a statement given by her spokeswoman , maja kocijancic . " the position of the eu is very clear : settlements are illegal under international law , constitute an obstacle to peace and threaten to make a two-state solution impossible , " kocijancic told german news agency dpa . the united states also expressed disappointment that the settlement freeze had not been extended and announced that its middle east envoy george mitchell was on his way to the region to restart negotiations . the eu and the united states make up half of the middle east quartet charged with pursuing a peace solution .
the other members of the quartet are russia and the united nations .
settlements continue to expand bulldozers in at least two west bank settlements resumed work early on monday just hours after the moratorium expired .
the palestinian leadership had repeatedly threatened to pull out of direct peace talks with israel if the settlements continued to expand .
but abbas said there would be no official palestinian answer to the construction resumption until after a meeting with top arab diplomats on october 4 .
" after all these meetings we may be able to issue a position to clarify what is the palestinian and arab opinion on this matter , after israel has refused to freeze settlements , " he said .
" we will not have swift reactions now . "
sarkozy also invited abbas , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and egyptian president hosni mubarak to meet in paris before the end of october .
bildunterschrift : abbas and sarkouy urged israel to extend its settlement freeze peace talks on the line the settlement construction threatened to end the first direct negotiations since 2008 between israel and the palestinians , which began in washington nearly four weeks ago .
netanyahu said in a statement shortly before the construction freeze expired that israel was " ready to pursue continuous contacts in the coming days to find a way to continue peace talks . "
the united states also said its position that the settlement freeze should continue had not changed .
state department spokesman p.j. crowley said the us is " in close touch with both parties and will be meeting with them again in the coming days . "
from the palestinian point of view , israeli settlements in the west bank are a major barrier to the peace process .
palestinian leaders say the settlements will make the creation of a viable independent state impossible .
most of the international community considers israeli settlements in the west bank to be in violation of international law , but israel insists they are legitimate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de budget -pipe- 27.09.2010 eu and germany push for penalties for deficit offenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excessive budget deficits have hurt the eu 's credibility european union officials are launching an effort to impose sanctions on member states whose budget deficits are out of control , and germany is one of the strongest - and harshest - supporters . the european union needs to penalize members who break the bloc 's rules on borrowing and spending , according to statements made by top eu officials on monday .
speaking to the european parliament 's economic affairs committee , european central bank president jean-claude trichet warned that current oversight on eu states ' budgets is too lax , and called for a board of " wise men and women " to watch over budget discipline .
" what has been lacking is some kind of incentive to manage finances responsibly , " trichet said .
" indeed , a core , absolutely indispensable , element of an effective surveillance mechanism is a functioning mechanism of incentives and sanctions - both financial and non-financial . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet said the eu has been lacking incentives for financial responsibility under the eu 's stability and growth pact , member states must keep their budget deficits within three percent of gross domestic product .
but several member states - most notably greece - have flouted the rules , leading to a decline in the eu 's credibility .
sanctions to be quick and ' semi-automatic ' trichet 's comments support a proposal by european economic commissioner olli rehn to impose " semi-automatic " sanctions against such eu members who break budget rules .
the european commission is to lay out the details of its enforcement plan on wednesday .
reports say rehn would propose fines of 0.2 percent of gdp for countries who repeatedly fail to comply with financial rules .
in addition , countries with slipping competitiveness or whose growth is based on " excessive imbalances " like the credit boom in the baltic states would receive fines of 0.1 percent of gdp .
" sanctions ... need to be triggered early enough in the process so that they are essentially preventive , " rehn said monday .
" this is very important in order to ensure fiscal discipline , and sustainable growth in the eu . "
germany advocates harshness germany , traditionally one of the most fiscally conservative eu members , weighed in on the enforcement plan with finance minister wolfgang schaeuble writing a letter to his counterparts in the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble 's proposals on sanctions are among the strictest " the creation of stronger incentives to prevent and correct excessive government deficits stands at the very core of our endeavors to enforce fiscal and economy governance in the eu , " he wrote .
germany 's proposals have been some of the most draconian in the bloc .
schaeuble also called for the sanctions to affect payments from the eu 's substantial regional development and agricultural funds , and his office is reportedly considering supporting the exclusion of fiscal rule breakers from eu decision making .
meanwhile reports said italy , france and spain - which would all have to make significant reductions to their already-reduced budgets - were likely to oppose the new sanctions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de budget -pipe- 27.09.2010 eu and germany push for penalties for deficit offenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excessive budget deficits have hurt the eu 's credibility european union officials are launching an effort to impose sanctions on member states whose budget deficits are out of control , and germany is one of the strongest - and harshest - supporters . the european union needs to penalize members who break the bloc 's rules on borrowing and spending , according to statements made by top eu officials on monday .
speaking to the european parliament 's economic affairs committee , european central bank president jean-claude trichet warned that current oversight on eu states ' budgets is too lax , and called for a board of " wise men and women " to watch over budget discipline .
" what has been lacking is some kind of incentive to manage finances responsibly , " trichet said .
" indeed , a core , absolutely indispensable , element of an effective surveillance mechanism is a functioning mechanism of incentives and sanctions - both financial and non-financial . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet said the eu has been lacking incentives for financial responsibility under the eu 's stability and growth pact , member states must keep their budget deficits within three percent of gross domestic product .
but several member states - most notably greece - have flouted the rules , leading to a decline in the eu 's credibility .
sanctions to be quick and ' semi-automatic ' trichet 's comments support a proposal by european economic commissioner olli rehn to impose " semi-automatic " sanctions against such eu members who break budget rules .
the european commission is to lay out the details of its enforcement plan on wednesday .
reports say rehn would propose fines of 0.2 percent of gdp for countries who repeatedly fail to comply with financial rules .
in addition , countries with slipping competitiveness or whose growth is based on " excessive imbalances " like the credit boom in the baltic states would receive fines of 0.1 percent of gdp .
" sanctions ... need to be triggered early enough in the process so that they are essentially preventive , " rehn said monday .
" this is very important in order to ensure fiscal discipline , and sustainable growth in the eu . "
germany advocates harshness germany , traditionally one of the most fiscally conservative eu members , weighed in on the enforcement plan with finance minister wolfgang schaeuble writing a letter to his counterparts in the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble 's proposals on sanctions are among the strictest " the creation of stronger incentives to prevent and correct excessive government deficits stands at the very core of our endeavors to enforce fiscal and economy governance in the eu , " he wrote .
germany 's proposals have been some of the most draconian in the bloc .
schaeuble also called for the sanctions to affect payments from the eu 's substantial regional development and agricultural funds , and his office is reportedly considering supporting the exclusion of fiscal rule breakers from eu decision making .
meanwhile reports said italy , france and spain - which would all have to make significant reductions to their already-reduced budgets - were likely to oppose the new sanctions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 27.09.2010 limping into champions league fixture , bayern extend with van gaal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is to stay on in munich until the end of the 2011-2012 season fresh off a contract extension with coach louis van gaal , bayern munich are looking for redemption on tuesday in europe .
injury trouble and dysfunction in attack have meant their bundesliga campaign is a shambles . five goals , eight points , ninth place .
such is bayern munich 's meager return from the first six matches of the new bundesliga season .
in that bayern had got off to a slow start last year too before finishing as champions , players and club officials had , until recently , been leery of making critical statements .
since saturday 's 2-1 home loss to surprise league leaders mainz , all that has changed .
“ we have too many players who are n't playing up to their usual standard , ” said defender philipp lahm .
“ work-rate , aggressiveness , passion - we 're missing all of it at the moment , ” said bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
the loss left bayern 10 points adrift of mainz , and that wide margin appears to be ringing a few alarm bells on saebenerstrasse .
“ it 's going to be hard to make up for this deficit , ” lahm added in his post-game remarks .
“ we let happen precisely what we did n't want to happen .
it 's going to take a long time to make up 10 points . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's captain in south africa , lahm , speaks his mind at bayern too sitting prettier luckily for bayern , the champions league is a different story .
there , the bavarians can head to switzerland to take on fc basel with their heads held high .
as if to underscore the club 's confidence that all was not yet lost , bayern 's head coach , louis van gaal , signed a one-year contract extension in basel on monday .
the deal keeps him and his supporting cast of coaches on at the club through june 2012 .
two weeks ago , van gaal 's men broke down a dogged as roma defense and got a 2-0 win to top their group .
basel , meanwhile , stumbled to a 2-1 loss in romania to cfr cluj .
if bayern can manage a win at the st. jakob park on tuesday , they could stay in the driver 's seat in group e , with a potentially winnable home-and-away match-up with cluj next on the club 's docket .
some in the club are already looking to the champions league campaign as a corrective to the poor league start .
“ we need to stay calm , ” said hamit altintop , the turkey winger who has begun to see more playing time with franck ribery out injured for the coming weeks .
“ we won the first game and can afford to play it safe - we do n't have to go storming into attack from the get-go . ”
hurting for goals perhaps it would n't do much good to play things hell-for-leather .
it 's in attack that bayern have disappointed the most .
despite starting the potent likes of thomas mueller , toni kroos , ivica olic and miroslav klose on saturday , bayern failed to find the net - relying instead on a mainz own-goal to get on the scoreboard .
this is not to say bayern 's offensive front is n't able to keep the ball , or create chances .
indeed , they had more than 70 percent of the ball and shot it 15 times .
but many of those chances were not of a particularly high standard , and their shooting was poor .
bayern put the ball on target just four times .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben scored 23 goals and set up eight more for bayern last season it would seem that the missing creativity , not to mention finishing , of arjen robben is holding the team back .
the dutchman 's muscle tear will keep him out of the lineup until the new year , and now franck ribery 's injured ankle means he 'll miss another month at least .
bayern could use their offensive potency .
kroos and mueller filled in fairly effectively for robben and ribery on the two wings on saturday , but this left the side bereft of ideas in the middle , where neither strikers olic and klose , nor defensive midfielders bastian schweinsteiger and mark van bommel offered much creativity .
a change of system , perhaps one that brings mueller and / or kroos into the middle , may do the trick - and in truth , it will have to .
bayern 's small squad means that there are no further personnel options left for van gaal should he wish to shake up the offense .
about a month ago , during the transfer-rumor-mad silly season , big-name playmakers like rafael van de vaart were brought up in connection with bayern munich . van gaal told reporters then that he did n't feel he needed to go out and buy any players to bolster the squad .
“ alaba is better ! ” van gaal had said , referring to one of his favorite young charges , the 18-year-old austrian david alaba , who he 'd used as an emergency wingback last year , but whose real strength is in the offensive midfield .
it was a bold statement - but perhaps we 'd agree with him , if we could only see alaba play .
but that poor lad is hurt as well .

meanwhile , a ban on west bank construction has ended - the issue is a major sticking point in mideast peace talks . a ship carrying nine jewish activists from germany , britain , israel and the us set sail on sunday to deliver aid to the gaza strip .
the british boat " irene " departed sunday from famagusta in cyprus in protest against israel 's blockade of the palestinian territory .
the israeli foreign ministry called the move a " provocation . "
' a sacred duty ' the activists included 82-year-old holocaust survivor reuven moskovitz .
" it is a sacred duty for me , as a -lsb- holocaust -rsb- survivor , to protest against the persecution , the oppression and the imprisonment of so many people in gaza , including more than 800,000 children , " moskovitz said .
the trip - which was coordinated by the german organization jewish voice for just peace in the near east and the british group jews for justice for palestinians - intends to bring school supplies , musical instruments and fishing nets into gaza .
it comes after israel 's deadly raid of a gaza-bound aid ship last may , resulting in the deaths of nine turkish activists .
israeli defence minister ehud barak has repeatedly warned that israel will intercept any ship nearing gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's may interception of an aid ship proved deadly the activists have vowed to conduct a peaceful sit down should israeli military attempt to deter their entry to the gaza strip .
netanyahu urges restraint the launch of the aid ship on sunday came on the last day of israel 's freeze on settlement building in the occupied territories on the west bank .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu urged israeli settlers in a statement to exercise restraint after the moratorium expires – in an apparent bid to keep alive peace talks with the palestinians .
" the prime minister calls on the residents in judea and samaria -lsb- the west bank -rsb- and the political parties to show restraint and responsibility today and in the future exactly as they showed restraint and responsibility throughout the months of the freeze , " the statement read .
a ' 50-50 ' chance palestinian president mahmud abbas had earlier vowed to abandon peace talks should the jewish settlers recommence construction on occupied land , though he later said in an interview that he would remain in the talks with the agreement of the arab league .
" israel must choose between peace and the continuation of settlements , " he told the united nations in new york on saturday , denouncing israel 's " mentality of expansion and domination " in the west bank .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barak believes there is a 50 percent chance for the moratorium 's extension while abbas 's spokesman told reporters that there was no progress in a us-led push to extend the moratorium , israeli defence minister barak maintained until the last minute that an extension would be possible .
" i think that the chance of achieving a mutually agreed understanding about -lsb- a -rsb- moratorium is 50-50 , " barak said in a bbc interview in new york where he was meeting with us officials , adding , " i think that the chances of having a peace process is much higher . "
settlers to start new constructions as the official moratorium came to an end , israeli settlers were poised to begin construction on new developments in palestinian territory .
settlers and their supporters held a rally in the settlement of revava to mark the end of the freeze .

meanwhile , a ban on west bank construction has ended - the issue is a major sticking point in mideast peace talks . a ship carrying nine jewish activists from germany , britain , israel and the us set sail on sunday to deliver aid to the gaza strip .
the british boat " irene " departed sunday from famagusta in cyprus in protest against israel 's blockade of the palestinian territory .
the israeli foreign ministry called the move a " provocation . "
' a sacred duty ' the activists included 82-year-old holocaust survivor reuven moskovitz .
" it is a sacred duty for me , as a -lsb- holocaust -rsb- survivor , to protest against the persecution , the oppression and the imprisonment of so many people in gaza , including more than 800,000 children , " moskovitz said .
the trip - which was coordinated by the german organization jewish voice for just peace in the near east and the british group jews for justice for palestinians - intends to bring school supplies , musical instruments and fishing nets into gaza .
it comes after israel 's deadly raid of a gaza-bound aid ship last may , resulting in the deaths of nine turkish activists .
israeli defence minister ehud barak has repeatedly warned that israel will intercept any ship nearing gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's may interception of an aid ship proved deadly the activists have vowed to conduct a peaceful sit down should israeli military attempt to deter their entry to the gaza strip .
netanyahu urges restraint the launch of the aid ship on sunday came on the last day of israel 's freeze on settlement building in the occupied territories on the west bank .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu urged israeli settlers in a statement to exercise restraint after the moratorium expires – in an apparent bid to keep alive peace talks with the palestinians .
" the prime minister calls on the residents in judea and samaria -lsb- the west bank -rsb- and the political parties to show restraint and responsibility today and in the future exactly as they showed restraint and responsibility throughout the months of the freeze , " the statement read .
a ' 50-50 ' chance palestinian president mahmud abbas had earlier vowed to abandon peace talks should the jewish settlers recommence construction on occupied land , though he later said in an interview that he would remain in the talks with the agreement of the arab league .
" israel must choose between peace and the continuation of settlements , " he told the united nations in new york on saturday , denouncing israel 's " mentality of expansion and domination " in the west bank .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barak believes there is a 50 percent chance for the moratorium 's extension while abbas 's spokesman told reporters that there was no progress in a us-led push to extend the moratorium , israeli defence minister barak maintained until the last minute that an extension would be possible .
" i think that the chance of achieving a mutually agreed understanding about -lsb- a -rsb- moratorium is 50-50 , " barak said in a bbc interview in new york where he was meeting with us officials , adding , " i think that the chances of having a peace process is much higher . "
settlers to start new constructions as the official moratorium came to an end , israeli settlers were poised to begin construction on new developments in palestinian territory .
settlers and their supporters held a rally in the settlement of revava to mark the end of the freeze .
in another settlement the foundation stone for a new kindergarten was laid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settlement construction has been on hold for 10 months but it was not expected that there would be a massive surge in construction activity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 27.09.2010 us report exposes fbi 's post-9/11 investigations of greenpeace , peta großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reports states that the fbi misled the justice department in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the us , the federal bureau of investigation -lrb- fbi -rrb- began spying on a number of liberal groups under ambiguous new terror laws , a us department of justice report states . according to the report , the fbi carried out " unreasonable and inconsistent " investigations into environmental pressure group greenpeace , animal rights organization peta and a number of pacifist groups in the united states after 9/11 .
under homeland security laws brought in to safeguard the us from terrorist activities , the report showed that the fbi improperly investigated greenpeace and peta , along with the thomas merton center , a pittsburgh anti-war organization , the catholic worker , another anti-war group , and an individual quaker peace activist between 2001 and 2006 .
according to the inspector general of the department of justice , the five domestic terror investigations carried out by the fbi had " little or no basis " and were " unreasonable and inconsistent with fbi policy . "
the report also stated that the fbi " made false and misleading statements to congress " about the investigations , wrongly classifying them under " domestic terrorism cases " in an effort to pursue surveillance operations against the liberal organizations .
the investigations were based on " potential crimes " including trespassing and vandalism which the fbi misclassified under acts of terror .
the report said that these crimes " could alternatively have been classified differently , " which would have negated the need for anti-terror investigations into the targeted organizations .
the report added that in several cases , the fbi 's justification for investigation was " factually weak " and that there was " little indication of any possible federal crime as opposed to local crime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi were part of the anti-terror fusion groups created after 9/11 " after 9/11 , one of the most worrying aspects of that investigation was the lack of coordination between us security services , " clive walker , professor of criminal justice studies at the university of leeds , told deutsche welle .
" this led to the establishment of fusion groups across the us which were supposed to reduce the barriers between organizations .
they fused policing , intelligence and public security functions . "
" the driving force behind these groups was the fight against terrorism but in most places in the us , there really is n't a terrorist threat - so these well-funded groups , which included the fbi , had to find something to justify their existence , such as going after groups like greenpeace and peta under the guise of domestic terror prevention . "
peta investigation leads to members joining us terror list peta was first put under surveillance in the spring of 2001 , a number of months before the september 11 terror attacks , when the fbi started to investigate possible connections between one of the group 's members and the extremist animal liberation front .
the bureau believed the peta member was providing financial support which could aid activist missions to destroy property or attack research facilities involved in the practice of testing on animals .
after the attacks of 9/11 , the investigation rapidly expanded to cover the entire peta operation , its activities and those of a number of its affiliate organizations .
despite no criminal activity ever being documented , the investigation lasted for nearly six years and led to two innocent individuals being placed on the domestic terror watch list until 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peta protests such as this were monitored by the fbi " the fbi investigation into peta took the form of surveillance of entirely lawful free speech activities , including speeches on college campuses and public demonstrations by activists in chicken costumes and other props peta uses frequently , " harold ullman , vice president of peta germany , told deutsche welle .
" there is no justification for such police state tactics .
people speaking out on behalf of animals should be protected not placed under surveillance . " " the use of mccarthyist tactics against peta and other groups that speak out against cruelty to animals and exploitative corporate and government practices is un-american , unconstitutional , and against the interests of a healthy democracy , " ullman added .
" peta 's effective activism scares well-heeled business interests that abuse animals , but when these outfits used their connections to violate the us constitution , the fbi 's ham-fisted attempt to catch us with our pants down resulted in the fbi being caught with its pants down . " fbi suspected greenpeace was planning alaska pipeline attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi believed greenpeace would take violent action the greenpeace investigation started in 1999 when the fbi launched an operation to prevent the suspected disruption by activists of corporate shareholder meetings of two alaskan energy producers .
the protests never took place but the investigation continued for a further three years regardless . the inspector general 's report stated that that the fbi " articulated little or no basis for suspecting a violation of any federal criminal statute " in the greenpeace case and that the fbi crossed the line when it decided to continue its investigation " beyond the point at which its underlying justification no longer existed . " " we have yet to hold a discussion with the fbi about these investigations , although we will seek such a discussion , " mark floegel , a spokesperson for greenpeace us , told deutsche welle . " we 've only seen the justification in the report itself , which in some cases was based on irresponsible reports from what we presume are third parties . in one section , the report refers to a report that someone at greenpeace expressed a desire to blow up the alaska pipeline .
even a superficial investigation into greenpeace history would show greenpeace has always condemned violence and such an act would violate our principles . " " so far , no compensation or offer of an apology has been forthcoming from the fbi , " he added . both greenpeace and peta told deutsche welle that , to their knowledge , no investigations were carried out into their activities post-9/11 by european security agencies . fbi denies targeting groups on grounds of dissent in response to the department of justice report , the fbi maintained that it had not led any investigation into an organization 's activities based on an issue of free speech and that it had not been instructed to carry out any reforms to its procedures as a result . " after more than four years of investigation and an exhaustive review of hundreds of investigative decisions the fbi made after the september 11 attacks , the office of the inspector general -lrb- oig -rrb- did not uncover even a single instance where the fbi targeted any group or any individual based on the exercise of a first amendment right , " read a statement provided by the fbi to deutsche welle . " while the oig disagreed with a handful of the fbi ’ s investigative determinations over the course of six years , it has not recommended any significant modifications to the fbi ’ s authority to investigate criminal conduct or national security threats . " ambiguous laws lead to terror definition problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror laws after 9/11 were flexible and open to abuse professor clive walker believes that ambiguous language and badly defined terms left the security legislation in the us open to interpretation , a situation which in turn created an environment in which the greenpeace and peta investigations could be carried out under anti-terror laws . " the us laws brought in after 9/11 were pretty flexible but the main problem was their definition of terrorism , " he said .
" it 's very vague and therefore open to interpretation which leads to definitional problems in terms of mission objectives and applications . " " it 's cynical to say that the fbi used this ambiguity to manipulate the laws to suit their needs but the truth is , it is a recurring theme in the bureau 's history , " he added .
" since its formation there have been examples of this , such as the communist scare in the 1950 's and the anti-vietnam war movement in the 1960 's .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 27.09.2010 us report exposes fbi 's post-9/11 investigations of greenpeace , peta großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reports states that the fbi misled the justice department in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the us , the federal bureau of investigation -lrb- fbi -rrb- began spying on a number of liberal groups under ambiguous new terror laws , a us department of justice report states . according to the report , the fbi carried out " unreasonable and inconsistent " investigations into environmental pressure group greenpeace , animal rights organization peta and a number of pacifist groups in the united states after 9/11 .
under homeland security laws brought in to safeguard the us from terrorist activities , the report showed that the fbi improperly investigated greenpeace and peta , along with the thomas merton center , a pittsburgh anti-war organization , the catholic worker , another anti-war group , and an individual quaker peace activist between 2001 and 2006 .
according to the inspector general of the department of justice , the five domestic terror investigations carried out by the fbi had " little or no basis " and were " unreasonable and inconsistent with fbi policy . "
the report also stated that the fbi " made false and misleading statements to congress " about the investigations , wrongly classifying them under " domestic terrorism cases " in an effort to pursue surveillance operations against the liberal organizations .
the investigations were based on " potential crimes " including trespassing and vandalism which the fbi misclassified under acts of terror .
the report said that these crimes " could alternatively have been classified differently , " which would have negated the need for anti-terror investigations into the targeted organizations .
the report added that in several cases , the fbi 's justification for investigation was " factually weak " and that there was " little indication of any possible federal crime as opposed to local crime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi were part of the anti-terror fusion groups created after 9/11 " after 9/11 , one of the most worrying aspects of that investigation was the lack of coordination between us security services , " clive walker , professor of criminal justice studies at the university of leeds , told deutsche welle .
" this led to the establishment of fusion groups across the us which were supposed to reduce the barriers between organizations .
they fused policing , intelligence and public security functions . "
" the driving force behind these groups was the fight against terrorism but in most places in the us , there really is n't a terrorist threat - so these well-funded groups , which included the fbi , had to find something to justify their existence , such as going after groups like greenpeace and peta under the guise of domestic terror prevention . "
peta investigation leads to members joining us terror list peta was first put under surveillance in the spring of 2001 , a number of months before the september 11 terror attacks , when the fbi started to investigate possible connections between one of the group 's members and the extremist animal liberation front .
the bureau believed the peta member was providing financial support which could aid activist missions to destroy property or attack research facilities involved in the practice of testing on animals .
after the attacks of 9/11 , the investigation rapidly expanded to cover the entire peta operation , its activities and those of a number of its affiliate organizations .
despite no criminal activity ever being documented , the investigation lasted for nearly six years and led to two innocent individuals being placed on the domestic terror watch list until 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peta protests such as this were monitored by the fbi " the fbi investigation into peta took the form of surveillance of entirely lawful free speech activities , including speeches on college campuses and public demonstrations by activists in chicken costumes and other props peta uses frequently , " harold ullman , vice president of peta germany , told deutsche welle .
" there is no justification for such police state tactics .
people speaking out on behalf of animals should be protected not placed under surveillance . " " the use of mccarthyist tactics against peta and other groups that speak out against cruelty to animals and exploitative corporate and government practices is un-american , unconstitutional , and against the interests of a healthy democracy , " ullman added .
" peta 's effective activism scares well-heeled business interests that abuse animals , but when these outfits used their connections to violate the us constitution , the fbi 's ham-fisted attempt to catch us with our pants down resulted in the fbi being caught with its pants down . " fbi suspected greenpeace was planning alaska pipeline attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi believed greenpeace would take violent action the greenpeace investigation started in 1999 when the fbi launched an operation to prevent the suspected disruption by activists of corporate shareholder meetings of two alaskan energy producers .
the protests never took place but the investigation continued for a further three years regardless . the inspector general 's report stated that that the fbi " articulated little or no basis for suspecting a violation of any federal criminal statute " in the greenpeace case and that the fbi crossed the line when it decided to continue its investigation " beyond the point at which its underlying justification no longer existed . " " we have yet to hold a discussion with the fbi about these investigations , although we will seek such a discussion , " mark floegel , a spokesperson for greenpeace us , told deutsche welle . " we 've only seen the justification in the report itself , which in some cases was based on irresponsible reports from what we presume are third parties . in one section , the report refers to a report that someone at greenpeace expressed a desire to blow up the alaska pipeline .
even a superficial investigation into greenpeace history would show greenpeace has always condemned violence and such an act would violate our principles . " " so far , no compensation or offer of an apology has been forthcoming from the fbi , " he added . both greenpeace and peta told deutsche welle that , to their knowledge , no investigations were carried out into their activities post-9/11 by european security agencies . fbi denies targeting groups on grounds of dissent in response to the department of justice report , the fbi maintained that it had not led any investigation into an organization 's activities based on an issue of free speech and that it had not been instructed to carry out any reforms to its procedures as a result . " after more than four years of investigation and an exhaustive review of hundreds of investigative decisions the fbi made after the september 11 attacks , the office of the inspector general -lrb- oig -rrb- did not uncover even a single instance where the fbi targeted any group or any individual based on the exercise of a first amendment right , " read a statement provided by the fbi to deutsche welle . " while the oig disagreed with a handful of the fbi ’ s investigative determinations over the course of six years , it has not recommended any significant modifications to the fbi ’ s authority to investigate criminal conduct or national security threats . " ambiguous laws lead to terror definition problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror laws after 9/11 were flexible and open to abuse professor clive walker believes that ambiguous language and badly defined terms left the security legislation in the us open to interpretation , a situation which in turn created an environment in which the greenpeace and peta investigations could be carried out under anti-terror laws . " the us laws brought in after 9/11 were pretty flexible but the main problem was their definition of terrorism , " he said .
" it 's very vague and therefore open to interpretation which leads to definitional problems in terms of mission objectives and applications . " " it 's cynical to say that the fbi used this ambiguity to manipulate the laws to suit their needs but the truth is , it is a recurring theme in the bureau 's history , " he added .
" since its formation there have been examples of this , such as the communist scare in the 1950 's and the anti-vietnam war movement in the 1960 's .
defining dissent as a crime is not a new thing . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opposition parties claim the package will make the poor poorer . german labor minister ursula von der leyen has defended a minimal rise in welfare payments against sharp criticism from opposition parties and trade unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 5 euro increase per month has been branded derisory " the rates are very fair , " she told the daily bild newspaper , following criticism of a rise of 5 euros -lrb- $ 6.70 -rrb- a month which had been agreed by the coalition on sunday .
currently , germany 's 6.5 million " hartz iv " welfare recipients receive up to 359 euros per month .
" the federal statistical office analyzed what people on low earnings were able to spend each month , " said von der leyen , citing sales staff , janitors and hairdressers as examples .
" the calculations show accurately what the subsistence level is . "
' bad news for welfare recipients ' trade unions , as well as opposition parties such as the social democrats and greens , have warned that the rise is not enough and means that the poor will drift deeper into economic difficulties .
however , christian democrat von der leyen said that welfare rates had to be compared with lower level incomes in the working population .
" whoever demands that hartz iv should be higher must justify it by looking at the statistical data , compared with employees who work full time , " said the minister .
" those employees pay for hartz iv through their taxes and , in the end , many of them do not have much more money to spare -lsb- than hartz iv recipients -rsb- . "
no tobacco and alcohol allowance von der leyen defended the fact that the hartz iv would no longer provide an allowance for alcohol and tobacco .
while provision for basic needs was " sacrosanct , " she said , such products did not fall into this category .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will no longer be an allowance for alcohol or cigarettes the minister argued that any attempt by opposition parties to block the reforms in germany 's upper house - the bundesrat , where the ruling coalition has no majority - could not be justified .
chancellor angela merkel and party leaders from coalition partners the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- met to agree the changes on sunday .
monthly benefits for children are set to remain the same at 215 euros , 251 euros and 287 euros for children under age six , aged six to 14 and 14-18 , respectively .
however , the reforms include plans for " non-cash " benefits , such as a chip card that gives needy children access to educational and recreational services .

opposition parties claim the package will make the poor poorer . german labor minister ursula von der leyen has defended a minimal rise in welfare payments against sharp criticism from opposition parties and trade unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 5 euro increase per month has been branded derisory " the rates are very fair , " she told the daily bild newspaper , following criticism of a rise of 5 euros -lrb- $ 6.70 -rrb- a month which had been agreed by the coalition on sunday .
currently , germany 's 6.5 million " hartz iv " welfare recipients receive up to 359 euros per month .
" the federal statistical office analyzed what people on low earnings were able to spend each month , " said von der leyen , citing sales staff , janitors and hairdressers as examples .
" the calculations show accurately what the subsistence level is . "
' bad news for welfare recipients ' trade unions , as well as opposition parties such as the social democrats and greens , have warned that the rise is not enough and means that the poor will drift deeper into economic difficulties .
however , christian democrat von der leyen said that welfare rates had to be compared with lower level incomes in the working population .
" whoever demands that hartz iv should be higher must justify it by looking at the statistical data , compared with employees who work full time , " said the minister .
" those employees pay for hartz iv through their taxes and , in the end , many of them do not have much more money to spare -lsb- than hartz iv recipients -rsb- . "
no tobacco and alcohol allowance von der leyen defended the fact that the hartz iv would no longer provide an allowance for alcohol and tobacco .
while provision for basic needs was " sacrosanct , " she said , such products did not fall into this category .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will no longer be an allowance for alcohol or cigarettes the minister argued that any attempt by opposition parties to block the reforms in germany 's upper house - the bundesrat , where the ruling coalition has no majority - could not be justified .
chancellor angela merkel and party leaders from coalition partners the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- met to agree the changes on sunday .
monthly benefits for children are set to remain the same at 215 euros , 251 euros and 287 euros for children under age six , aged six to 14 and 14-18 , respectively .
however , the reforms include plans for " non-cash " benefits , such as a chip card that gives needy children access to educational and recreational services .

consumers will now also have warranty repair services in all eu countries . over the weekend , apple managed to defuse a potential legal tangle with the european union 's antitrust regulators by adjusting its iphone policies .
the company agreed to make warranty repair services equally available throughout european union countries , regardless of where a phone was purchased .
it also agreed to loosen restrictions on programming tools used to develop apps , the small programs designed to run on smartphones .
in doing so , the company avoided fines which could have been as high as 10 percent of its yearly turnover .

" i think it makes good business sense for any company that 's curating its ecosystem to be consistent and clear about what is and is n't allowed , because that level playing field enables firms to decide where to invest their efforts , " he told deutsche welle .

the european commission said the changes to apple 's policy towards iphone apps will remove limits to independent developers who sometimes were in competition with apple itself .

" for a mobile phone product , having the ability to have the product repaired wherever that person is is very important , " he said .
" it 's much more important for a mobile phone than it would be for a high-definition television , which is likely to be used in the same country that it 's bought in for all of its life . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin almunia is the eu competition commissioner apple has at times struggled to bring consistency into the way it manages the apps in its store , fogg said .
he described apple 's app store as a " curated ecosystem " similar to the amazon kindle store or google 's market for android phone apps .
" i think it makes good business sense for any company that 's curating its ecosystem to be consistent and clear about what is and is n't allowed , because that level playing field enables firms to decide where to invest their efforts , " he told deutsche welle .
" apple 's challenge is the same challenge many firms have in that the products and the markets which are being created are so new that everyone is working out the rules as we go along . "
the european commission said the changes to apple 's policy towards iphone apps will remove limits to independent developers who sometimes were in competition with apple itself .
mobile warranty for mobile phones according to fogg , warranty repair policies vary in the consumer electronics market , but such policies carry added meaning for mobile products such as smartphones .
" for a mobile phone product , having the ability to have the product repaired wherever that person is is very important , " he said .
" it 's much more important for a mobile phone than it would be for a high-definition television , which is likely to be used in the same country that it 's bought in for all of its life . "

but the invasive searches have stirred privacy concerns . germany began its six-month test period of two full-body scanners at hamburg airport on monday as critics continued to denounce the technology as too invasive .
interior minister thomas de maiziere was one of the first to pass through one of the scanners , saying he did not feel cramped or uncomfortable inside .
“ today is an important step on the way to better security in german airports , ” he said .
the german interior ministry , which is responsible for the project , selected hamburg for the trial run under real airport conditions because it is large , but not so large that technical glitches would seriously disrupt the flow of passenger traffic .
hamburg is germany 's fifth largest airport and serves about 12 million passengers annually .
full-body scanners are already in use in the united states and several european countries but , due to widespread privacy concerns , germany has been slow to test the technology .
until now , the machines had only been tested in the laboratory at the federal police academy in luebeck .
the scanners use low-frequency electromagnetic waves to sweep a schematic representation of the human body to check for concealed weapons or explosives .
passengers walk through a three-meter -lrb- 10 foot -rrb- high and two-meter wide cabin and are scanned by the waves , which the machine 's manufacturer says are 10,000-times weaker than the ordinary electro-smog from cell phones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics , like peter schaar , warn that scanners are too invasive scanners ' too invasive ' , critics warn privacy advocates oppose the use of the technology because they say it is too invasive and could reveal embarrassing details about a passenger .
peter schaar , germany 's federal commissioner for data protection , cautioned that “ very sensitive areas ” of a person 's private life could be revealed , such as breast implants , colostomies or other medical aids .
security experts argue , however , that the scanners are indispensable because they detect things , like plastic explosives and ceramic weapons , which conventional metal detectors would not discover .
this has not stopped some countries , notably italy , from scrapping the scanners .
after a six-month trial at airports in rome , venice and palermo , the machines are no longer in use after being deemed too slow and ineffective .
" we did n't get good results during testing , ” said vito riggio , the president of italy 's aviation authority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 27.09.2010 us report exposes fbi 's post-9/11 investigations of greenpeace , peta großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reports states that the fbi misled the justice department in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the us , the federal bureau of investigation -lrb- fbi -rrb- began spying on a number of liberal groups under ambiguous new terror laws , a us department of justice report states . according to the report , the fbi carried out " unreasonable and inconsistent " investigations into environmental pressure group greenpeace , animal rights organization peta and a number of pacifist groups in the united states after 9/11 .
under homeland security laws brought in to safeguard the us from terrorist activities , the report showed that the fbi improperly investigated greenpeace and peta , along with the thomas merton center , a pittsburgh anti-war organization , the catholic worker , another anti-war group , and an individual quaker peace activist between 2001 and 2006 .
according to the inspector general of the department of justice , the five domestic terror investigations carried out by the fbi had " little or no basis " and were " unreasonable and inconsistent with fbi policy . "
the report also stated that the fbi " made false and misleading statements to congress " about the investigations , wrongly classifying them under " domestic terrorism cases " in an effort to pursue surveillance operations against the liberal organizations .
the investigations were based on " potential crimes " including trespassing and vandalism which the fbi misclassified under acts of terror .
the report said that these crimes " could alternatively have been classified differently , " which would have negated the need for anti-terror investigations into the targeted organizations .
the report added that in several cases , the fbi 's justification for investigation was " factually weak " and that there was " little indication of any possible federal crime as opposed to local crime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi were part of the anti-terror fusion groups created after 9/11 " after 9/11 , one of the most worrying aspects of that investigation was the lack of coordination between us security services , " clive walker , professor of criminal justice studies at the university of leeds , told deutsche welle .
" this led to the establishment of fusion groups across the us which were supposed to reduce the barriers between organizations .
they fused policing , intelligence and public security functions . "
" the driving force behind these groups was the fight against terrorism but in most places in the us , there really is n't a terrorist threat - so these well-funded groups , which included the fbi , had to find something to justify their existence , such as going after groups like greenpeace and peta under the guise of domestic terror prevention . "
peta investigation leads to members joining us terror list peta was first put under surveillance in the spring of 2001 , a number of months before the september 11 terror attacks , when the fbi started to investigate possible connections between one of the group 's members and the extremist animal liberation front .
the bureau believed the peta member was providing financial support which could aid activist missions to destroy property or attack research facilities involved in the practice of testing on animals .
after the attacks of 9/11 , the investigation rapidly expanded to cover the entire peta operation , its activities and those of a number of its affiliate organizations .
despite no criminal activity ever being documented , the investigation lasted for nearly six years and led to two innocent individuals being placed on the domestic terror watch list until 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peta protests such as this were monitored by the fbi " the fbi investigation into peta took the form of surveillance of entirely lawful free speech activities , including speeches on college campuses and public demonstrations by activists in chicken costumes and other props peta uses frequently , " harold ullman , vice president of peta germany , told deutsche welle .
" there is no justification for such police state tactics .
people speaking out on behalf of animals should be protected not placed under surveillance . " " the use of mccarthyist tactics against peta and other groups that speak out against cruelty to animals and exploitative corporate and government practices is un-american , unconstitutional , and against the interests of a healthy democracy , " ullman added .
" peta 's effective activism scares well-heeled business interests that abuse animals , but when these outfits used their connections to violate the us constitution , the fbi 's ham-fisted attempt to catch us with our pants down resulted in the fbi being caught with its pants down . " fbi suspected greenpeace was planning alaska pipeline attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi believed greenpeace would take violent action the greenpeace investigation started in 1999 when the fbi launched an operation to prevent the suspected disruption by activists of corporate shareholder meetings of two alaskan energy producers .
the protests never took place but the investigation continued for a further three years regardless . the inspector general 's report stated that that the fbi " articulated little or no basis for suspecting a violation of any federal criminal statute " in the greenpeace case and that the fbi crossed the line when it decided to continue its investigation " beyond the point at which its underlying justification no longer existed . " " we have yet to hold a discussion with the fbi about these investigations , although we will seek such a discussion , " mark floegel , a spokesperson for greenpeace us , told deutsche welle . " we 've only seen the justification in the report itself , which in some cases was based on irresponsible reports from what we presume are third parties . in one section , the report refers to a report that someone at greenpeace expressed a desire to blow up the alaska pipeline .
even a superficial investigation into greenpeace history would show greenpeace has always condemned violence and such an act would violate our principles . " " so far , no compensation or offer of an apology has been forthcoming from the fbi , " he added . both greenpeace and peta told deutsche welle that , to their knowledge , no investigations were carried out into their activities post-9/11 by european security agencies . fbi denies targeting groups on grounds of dissent in response to the department of justice report , the fbi maintained that it had not led any investigation into an organization 's activities based on an issue of free speech and that it had not been instructed to carry out any reforms to its procedures as a result . " after more than four years of investigation and an exhaustive review of hundreds of investigative decisions the fbi made after the september 11 attacks , the office of the inspector general -lrb- oig -rrb- did not uncover even a single instance where the fbi targeted any group or any individual based on the exercise of a first amendment right , " read a statement provided by the fbi to deutsche welle . " while the oig disagreed with a handful of the fbi ’ s investigative determinations over the course of six years , it has not recommended any significant modifications to the fbi ’ s authority to investigate criminal conduct or national security threats . " ambiguous laws lead to terror definition problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror laws after 9/11 were flexible and open to abuse professor clive walker believes that ambiguous language and badly defined terms left the security legislation in the us open to interpretation , a situation which in turn created an environment in which the greenpeace and peta investigations could be carried out under anti-terror laws . " the us laws brought in after 9/11 were pretty flexible but the main problem was their definition of terrorism , " he said .
" it 's very vague and therefore open to interpretation which leads to definitional problems in terms of mission objectives and applications . " " it 's cynical to say that the fbi used this ambiguity to manipulate the laws to suit their needs but the truth is , it is a recurring theme in the bureau 's history , " he added .
" since its formation there have been examples of this , such as the communist scare in the 1950 's and the anti-vietnam war movement in the 1960 's .
defining dissent as a crime is not a new thing . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in fact , most of pailin ’ s residents have a strong connection to the khmer rouge movement that devastated this country in the 1970s .
the un-backed tribunal , which is based in phnom penh some 400 kilometers by road from here , says the khmer rouge movement is responsible for 2.2 million deaths from execution , starvation , overwork and illness during the movement ’ s rule of cambodia between 1975 and 1979 .
indicting the surviving leaders is one way of trying to punish some of those believed responsible for what happened . pol pot blamed for the crimes unsurprisingly , the tribunal is not popular in places like pailin .
some people claim that pol pot , the khmer rouge ’ s former leader who died in 1998 , was solely responsible for the crimes the movement committed .
this was a message repeated by mey mak , a deputy governor of pailin , and a former secretary for pol pot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cheung ek genocidal center in pnomh penh in the provincial town hall , mey mak sat at a table along with several of the tribunal ’ s senior staff , including international prosecutor andrew cayley .
facing them sitting on plastic chairs spruced up with silk and cotton coverings sat a crowd of 250 people : monks , nuns , police and soldiers , as well as residents of the province who had been invited to hear the court ’ s message .
most of them were former khmer rouge , and many knew the four people indicted , including the movement ’ s chief ideologue nuon chea , also known as brother number two .
the other three were the former head of state khieu samphan , former foreign minister ieng sary and his wife , the former social affairs minister ieng thirith .
mey mak told the audience that pol pot , who died in 1998 , was to blame .
" so it seems to me that the court has indicted the wrong people , " he explained .
" the hands of these four were not stained with blood .
khieu samphan was responsible for the economy .
ieng sary was foreign minister , which meant he simply travelled in and out of cambodia .
and like them , ieng thirith , the social affairs minister , was under the power of pol pot and could do nothing to influence what happened . "
trial will determine extent of individual responsibility this is not an argument that most cambodians would support .
as court spokesman lars olsen said afterwards , it is something that will be decided at their trial , which is slated to start next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chum mey , a victim of the khmer rouge , was angry when a lenient sentence was handed down to kaing gek eav , alias duch , former s-21 prison commander , in july the trial will try to find out to what extent the four are individually responsible for the crimes committed by the khmer rouge , olsen explained .
after hearing testimonies and evidence , the judges will determine whether all or some of these four indicted persons indeed bear individual criminal responsibility or whether this lies with someone else .
the international prosecutor andrew cayley told those attending that heaping blame for mass crimes on the heads of dead leaders was common enough at other tribunals , and was something he anticipated would form part of the defense . 10 tried for deaths of so many so much for the leaders .
perhaps more importantly , a number of those who attended the meeting in pailin wanted to know how many people the court was looking to prosecute in total .
cayley told them that the case of duch , the former head of the khmer rouge ’ s torture and execution centre known as s-21 , was the first .
he was jailed in july for 30 years after being found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
the four indicted this month comprise the next case and another five are currently under investigation .
" those five may or may not go to trial , depending on the work of the investigating judges and what they find .
so with those 10 , that is it , " cayley said .
this message might have gone down well in pailin but it is less likely to be welcomed outside of the former khmer rouge strongholds , as most cambodians can not understand how such a small number of people is going to end up being tried for the deaths of so many people .
hun sen opposes trials in fact , it is unclear whether even the final five will be prosecuted .
many here believe that the outright opposition to their trials expressed by cambodian prime minister hun sen has effectively ruined the chances of cambodian staff working on their investigations .
for now , only duch has been convicted .
the four elderly leaders will stand trial next year , although it is unlikely that all of them will survive a lengthy trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many cambodians attended the hearings at the un-backed tribunal on the positive side , most of the ex-khmer rouge who came to the court ’ s pailin meeting wanted a copy of the duch verdict , and just as many were keen to visit the court and see it in action .
" they are at least interested in learning more , and that ’ s good , " said court spokesman lars olsen .
" so the fact that they are skeptical about our work , that ’ s ok .
they are skeptical but they want to learn – they are curious , and that ’ s a good starting point . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 27.09.2010 long trucks long for germany 's autobahns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long and even possibly longer : germany considers long trucks with germany 's famed autobahns sometimes looking more like vast truck parking lots than motorways , the government is wondering whether fewer , longer trucks could reduce congestion and emissions .
critics doubt it . one of the hot topics at this year 's iaa commercial vehicles trade show in hanover is the german governent 's nationwide " long truck " field trial planned some time next year .
the trails could lead to new regulations on semi-truck lengths , creating new business opportunities for both makers of long-haul transportation vehicles and logistics companies operating them .
experts say longer trucks could reduce trucking costs by 20 to 25 percent .
" we build long trucks , and the experience of our customers using them in scandinavia , the netherlands and other markets has been good , " detlef hug , a spokesman for german truck maker man , told deutsche welle .
" of course , germany has its own challenges like heavy traffic and hilly terrain .
so that 's why it is a good idea to conduct a nationwide field trial so that we can test fuel and co2 emission reduction , safety , the impact on car drivers and more . "
truck traffic to increase 70 percent there is a sense of political urgency in berlin .
the federal transportation ministry estimates that truck traffic - already choking numerous german highways - will increase by 70 percent over the next 15 years .
and no one knows where all those vehicles should go .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's autobahns look more like a truck parking lot these days three years ago , several german states launched their own field trials – with mixed results .
accompanying studies also painted a blurred picture .
one of the studies , by the technical rwth aachen university , concluded that long trucks are safe and would reduce emissions .
longer vehicles , it noted , hardly use more fuel than current shorter models ; only during acceleration does the additional load make the truck 's engine slightly less efficient .
but another study by the fraunhofer institute for systems and innovative research claimed that while long trucks could relieve roads and the environment in the short term , they would , in the long term , cause a shift from rail to road that would offset any benefits .
" we 're aware of the work the states have done and the results of their tests will flow into a joint working group between the federal and state transportation ministries , " a spokesman from the federal transportation ministry told deutsche welle .
" these tests , however , were on a small scale .
what is needed is a much larger field trial across the entire country to determine the impact on logistics . "
plenty of interest more than 300 companies , including man , have already registered to participate in the federal government 's planned nationwide test , though a final number of participants has yet to be set .
the goal is to test tractor-trailer combinations with a length of 25.25 meters -lrb- 83 feet -rrb- , or 6.5 meters -lrb- 21 feet -rrb- longer than currently allowed .
the gross weight of the vehicles will remain at the current 44 tons for semi-trucks or 44 for " intermodal " container trucks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man has a booth at the iaa commercial vehicles trade show in hanover " we have heard some talk about the planned nationwide field trial testing 60-ton vehicles , " the ministry spokesman said .
" we have no intention to change the weight .
this is all about increasing volume . "
long trucks , the spokesman said , would allow voluminous goods to be transported with one vehicle , for instance , instead of breaking down the item to transport it with three trucks .
critics of heavy and long 60-ton trucks point to a number of problems , such as the damage they could do to roads and bridges because of their added weight and the lack of sufficiently secure guard rails .
yet long trucks also have their critics , too .
" there are a number of issues to be concerned about , " said martin roggermann from the german pro-rail alliance .
" long trucks are more difficult to pass , they need more space for turning at intersections and do n't fit into the current autobahn parking facilities , not too mention safety issues . "
shift from road to rail but roggermann 's biggest bone of contention is that the expected lower operating costs of long trucks could undermine efforts by his organization and others to shift freight off the road and onto rail .
" we are really concerned about the shift from rail to the road , " he said .
" we do n't believe long trucks will result in fewer trucks but in more trucks and in more problems on german roads . "
moreover , roggermann and others worry that if 40-ton long trucks are allowed , it will only be a matter of time before 60-ton " gigaliners " roar down german roads .
scandinavia began with 40-ton vehicles and later allowed the heavier vehicles , he noted .
few experts will disagree that competition for road freight business has become cutthroat in europe , especially since recent eastward european union expansion .
and plenty of them admit that the prospect of allowing larger vehicles to carry more for less will only fuel that competition .

but the invasive searches have stirred privacy concerns . germany began its six-month test period of two full-body scanners at hamburg airport on monday as critics continued to denounce the technology as too invasive .
interior minister thomas de maiziere was one of the first to pass through one of the scanners , saying he did not feel cramped or uncomfortable inside .
“ today is an important step on the way to better security in german airports , ” he said .
the german interior ministry , which is responsible for the project , selected hamburg for the trial run under real airport conditions because it is large , but not so large that technical glitches would seriously disrupt the flow of passenger traffic .
hamburg is germany 's fifth largest airport and serves about 12 million passengers annually .
full-body scanners are already in use in the united states and several european countries but , due to widespread privacy concerns , germany has been slow to test the technology .
until now , the machines had only been tested in the laboratory at the federal police academy in luebeck .
the scanners use low-frequency electromagnetic waves to sweep a schematic representation of the human body to check for concealed weapons or explosives .
passengers walk through a three-meter -lrb- 10 foot -rrb- high and two-meter wide cabin and are scanned by the waves , which the machine 's manufacturer says are 10,000-times weaker than the ordinary electro-smog from cell phones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics , like peter schaar , warn that scanners are too invasive scanners ' too invasive ' , critics warn privacy advocates oppose the use of the technology because they say it is too invasive and could reveal embarrassing details about a passenger .
peter schaar , germany 's federal commissioner for data protection , cautioned that “ very sensitive areas ” of a person 's private life could be revealed , such as breast implants , colostomies or other medical aids .
security experts argue , however , that the scanners are indispensable because they detect things , like plastic explosives and ceramic weapons , which conventional metal detectors would not discover .
this has not stopped some countries , notably italy , from scrapping the scanners .
after a six-month trial at airports in rome , venice and palermo , the machines are no longer in use after being deemed too slow and ineffective .

but the invasive searches have stirred privacy concerns . germany began its six-month test period of two full-body scanners at hamburg airport on monday as critics continued to denounce the technology as too invasive .
interior minister thomas de maiziere was one of the first to pass through one of the scanners , saying he did not feel cramped or uncomfortable inside .
“ today is an important step on the way to better security in german airports , ” he said .
the german interior ministry , which is responsible for the project , selected hamburg for the trial run under real airport conditions because it is large , but not so large that technical glitches would seriously disrupt the flow of passenger traffic .
hamburg is germany 's fifth largest airport and serves about 12 million passengers annually .
full-body scanners are already in use in the united states and several european countries but , due to widespread privacy concerns , germany has been slow to test the technology .
until now , the machines had only been tested in the laboratory at the federal police academy in luebeck .
the scanners use low-frequency electromagnetic waves to sweep a schematic representation of the human body to check for concealed weapons or explosives .
passengers walk through a three-meter -lrb- 10 foot -rrb- high and two-meter wide cabin and are scanned by the waves , which the machine 's manufacturer says are 10,000-times weaker than the ordinary electro-smog from cell phones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics , like peter schaar , warn that scanners are too invasive scanners ' too invasive ' , critics warn privacy advocates oppose the use of the technology because they say it is too invasive and could reveal embarrassing details about a passenger .
peter schaar , germany 's federal commissioner for data protection , cautioned that “ very sensitive areas ” of a person 's private life could be revealed , such as breast implants , colostomies or other medical aids .
security experts argue , however , that the scanners are indispensable because they detect things , like plastic explosives and ceramic weapons , which conventional metal detectors would not discover .
this has not stopped some countries , notably italy , from scrapping the scanners .
after a six-month trial at airports in rome , venice and palermo , the machines are no longer in use after being deemed too slow and ineffective .
" we did n't get good results during testing , ” said vito riggio , the president of italy 's aviation authority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 27.09.2010 long trucks long for germany 's autobahns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long and even possibly longer : germany considers long trucks with germany 's famed autobahns sometimes looking more like vast truck parking lots than motorways , the government is wondering whether fewer , longer trucks could reduce congestion and emissions .
critics doubt it . one of the hot topics at this year 's iaa commercial vehicles trade show in hanover is the german governent 's nationwide " long truck " field trial planned some time next year .
the trails could lead to new regulations on semi-truck lengths , creating new business opportunities for both makers of long-haul transportation vehicles and logistics companies operating them .
experts say longer trucks could reduce trucking costs by 20 to 25 percent .
" we build long trucks , and the experience of our customers using them in scandinavia , the netherlands and other markets has been good , " detlef hug , a spokesman for german truck maker man , told deutsche welle .
" of course , germany has its own challenges like heavy traffic and hilly terrain .
so that 's why it is a good idea to conduct a nationwide field trial so that we can test fuel and co2 emission reduction , safety , the impact on car drivers and more . "
truck traffic to increase 70 percent there is a sense of political urgency in berlin .
the federal transportation ministry estimates that truck traffic - already choking numerous german highways - will increase by 70 percent over the next 15 years .
and no one knows where all those vehicles should go .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's autobahns look more like a truck parking lot these days three years ago , several german states launched their own field trials – with mixed results .
accompanying studies also painted a blurred picture .
one of the studies , by the technical rwth aachen university , concluded that long trucks are safe and would reduce emissions .
longer vehicles , it noted , hardly use more fuel than current shorter models ; only during acceleration does the additional load make the truck 's engine slightly less efficient .
but another study by the fraunhofer institute for systems and innovative research claimed that while long trucks could relieve roads and the environment in the short term , they would , in the long term , cause a shift from rail to road that would offset any benefits .
" we 're aware of the work the states have done and the results of their tests will flow into a joint working group between the federal and state transportation ministries , " a spokesman from the federal transportation ministry told deutsche welle .
" these tests , however , were on a small scale .
what is needed is a much larger field trial across the entire country to determine the impact on logistics . "
plenty of interest more than 300 companies , including man , have already registered to participate in the federal government 's planned nationwide test , though a final number of participants has yet to be set .
the goal is to test tractor-trailer combinations with a length of 25.25 meters -lrb- 83 feet -rrb- , or 6.5 meters -lrb- 21 feet -rrb- longer than currently allowed .
the gross weight of the vehicles will remain at the current 44 tons for semi-trucks or 44 for " intermodal " container trucks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man has a booth at the iaa commercial vehicles trade show in hanover " we have heard some talk about the planned nationwide field trial testing 60-ton vehicles , " the ministry spokesman said .
" we have no intention to change the weight .
this is all about increasing volume . "
long trucks , the spokesman said , would allow voluminous goods to be transported with one vehicle , for instance , instead of breaking down the item to transport it with three trucks .
critics of heavy and long 60-ton trucks point to a number of problems , such as the damage they could do to roads and bridges because of their added weight and the lack of sufficiently secure guard rails .
yet long trucks also have their critics , too .
" there are a number of issues to be concerned about , " said martin roggermann from the german pro-rail alliance .
" long trucks are more difficult to pass , they need more space for turning at intersections and do n't fit into the current autobahn parking facilities , not too mention safety issues . "
shift from road to rail but roggermann 's biggest bone of contention is that the expected lower operating costs of long trucks could undermine efforts by his organization and others to shift freight off the road and onto rail .
" we are really concerned about the shift from rail to the road , " he said .
" we do n't believe long trucks will result in fewer trucks but in more trucks and in more problems on german roads . "
moreover , roggermann and others worry that if 40-ton long trucks are allowed , it will only be a matter of time before 60-ton " gigaliners " roar down german roads .
scandinavia began with 40-ton vehicles and later allowed the heavier vehicles , he noted .
few experts will disagree that competition for road freight business has become cutthroat in europe , especially since recent eastward european union expansion .
and plenty of them admit that the prospect of allowing larger vehicles to carry more for less will only fuel that competition .

injury trouble and dysfunction in attack have meant their bundesliga campaign is a shambles . five goals , eight points , ninth place .
such is bayern munich 's meager return from the first six matches of the new bundesliga season .
in that bayern had got off to a slow start last year too before finishing as champions , players and club officials had , until recently , been leery of making critical statements .
since saturday 's 2-1 home loss to surprise league leaders mainz , all that has changed .
“ we have too many players who are n't playing up to their usual standard , ” said defender philipp lahm .
“ work-rate , aggressiveness , passion - we 're missing all of it at the moment , ” said bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
the loss left bayern 10 points adrift of mainz , and that wide margin appears to be ringing a few alarm bells on saebenerstrasse .
“ it 's going to be hard to make up for this deficit , ” lahm added in his post-game remarks .
“ we let happen precisely what we did n't want to happen .
it 's going to take a long time to make up 10 points . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's captain in south africa , lahm , speaks his mind at bayern too sitting prettier luckily for bayern , the champions league is a different story .
there , the bavarians can head to switzerland to take on fc basel with their heads held high .
as if to underscore the club 's confidence that all was not yet lost , bayern 's head coach , louis van gaal , signed a one-year contract extension in basel on monday .
the deal keeps him and his supporting cast of coaches on at the club through june 2012 .
two weeks ago , van gaal 's men broke down a dogged as roma defense and got a 2-0 win to top their group .
basel , meanwhile , stumbled to a 2-1 loss in romania to cfr cluj .
if bayern can manage a win at the st. jakob park on tuesday , they could stay in the driver 's seat in group e , with a potentially winnable home-and-away match-up with cluj next on the club 's docket .
some in the club are already looking to the champions league campaign as a corrective to the poor league start .
“ we need to stay calm , ” said hamit altintop , the turkey winger who has begun to see more playing time with franck ribery out injured for the coming weeks .
“ we won the first game and can afford to play it safe - we do n't have to go storming into attack from the get-go . ”
hurting for goals perhaps it would n't do much good to play things hell-for-leather .
it 's in attack that bayern have disappointed the most .
despite starting the potent likes of thomas mueller , toni kroos , ivica olic and miroslav klose on saturday , bayern failed to find the net - relying instead on a mainz own-goal to get on the scoreboard .
this is not to say bayern 's offensive front is n't able to keep the ball , or create chances .
indeed , they had more than 70 percent of the ball and shot it 15 times .
but many of those chances were not of a particularly high standard , and their shooting was poor .
bayern put the ball on target just four times .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben scored 23 goals and set up eight more for bayern last season it would seem that the missing creativity , not to mention finishing , of arjen robben is holding the team back .
the dutchman 's muscle tear will keep him out of the lineup until the new year , and now franck ribery 's injured ankle means he 'll miss another month at least .
bayern could use their offensive potency .
kroos and mueller filled in fairly effectively for robben and ribery on the two wings on saturday , but this left the side bereft of ideas in the middle , where neither strikers olic and klose , nor defensive midfielders bastian schweinsteiger and mark van bommel offered much creativity .
a change of system , perhaps one that brings mueller and / or kroos into the middle , may do the trick - and in truth , it will have to .
bayern 's small squad means that there are no further personnel options left for van gaal should he wish to shake up the offense .
about a month ago , during the transfer-rumor-mad silly season , big-name playmakers like rafael van de vaart were brought up in connection with bayern munich . van gaal told reporters then that he did n't feel he needed to go out and buy any players to bolster the squad .
“ alaba is better ! ” van gaal had said , referring to one of his favorite young charges , the 18-year-old austrian david alaba , who he 'd used as an emergency wingback last year , but whose real strength is in the offensive midfield .
it was a bold statement - but perhaps we 'd agree with him , if we could only see alaba play .
but that poor lad is hurt as well .

kroos and mueller filled in fairly effectively for robben and ribery on the two wings on saturday , but this left the side bereft of ideas in the middle , where neither strikers olic and klose , nor defensive midfielders bastian schweinsteiger and mark van bommel offered much creativity .
a change of system , perhaps one that brings mueller and / or kroos into the middle , may do the trick - and in truth , it will have to .
bayern 's small squad means that there are no further personnel options left for van gaal should he wish to shake up the offense .
about a month ago , during the transfer-rumor-mad silly season , big-name playmakers like rafael van de vaart were brought up in connection with bayern munich . van gaal told reporters then that he did n't feel he needed to go out and buy any players to bolster the squad .
“ alaba is better ! ” van gaal had said , referring to one of his favorite young charges , the 18-year-old austrian david alaba , who he 'd used as an emergency wingback last year , but whose real strength is in the offensive midfield .
it was a bold statement - but perhaps we 'd agree with him , if we could only see alaba play .
but that poor lad is hurt as well .

not a month after israeli-palestinian peace talks resumed , their future is in jeopardy . palestinian president mahmoud abbas delayed a decision on withdrawing from direct peace talks with israel on monday as france voiced strong support for the palestinian position .
after meeting with abbas in paris , french president nicolas sarkozy told reporters that france regretted that israel had not listened to " unanimous calls " to extend a 10-month freeze on israeli settlement construction in the west bank .
the settlement freeze " should have been extended to give negotiations a chance , " sarkozy said .
" i say this in front of president abbas : settlement must stop . "
european union weighs in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu disappointed world leaders by not extending the settlement freeze catherine ashton , the european union 's foreign policy chief , expressed similar feelings in a statement given by her spokeswoman , maja kocijancic . " the position of the eu is very clear : settlements are illegal under international law , constitute an obstacle to peace and threaten to make a two-state solution impossible , " kocijancic told german news agency dpa . the united states also expressed disappointment that the settlement freeze had not been extended and announced that its middle east envoy george mitchell was on his way to the region to restart negotiations . the eu and the united states make up half of the middle east quartet charged with pursuing a peace solution .
the other members of the quartet are russia and the united nations .
settlements continue to expand bulldozers in at least two west bank settlements resumed work early on monday just hours after the moratorium expired .
the palestinian leadership had repeatedly threatened to pull out of direct peace talks with israel if the settlements continued to expand .
but abbas said there would be no official palestinian answer to the construction resumption until after a meeting with top arab diplomats on october 4 .
" after all these meetings we may be able to issue a position to clarify what is the palestinian and arab opinion on this matter , after israel has refused to freeze settlements , " he said .
" we will not have swift reactions now . "
sarkozy also invited abbas , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and egyptian president hosni mubarak to meet in paris before the end of october .
bildunterschrift : abbas and sarkouy urged israel to extend its settlement freeze peace talks on the line the settlement construction threatened to end the first direct negotiations since 2008 between israel and the palestinians , which began in washington nearly four weeks ago .
netanyahu said in a statement shortly before the construction freeze expired that israel was " ready to pursue continuous contacts in the coming days to find a way to continue peace talks . "
the united states also said its position that the settlement freeze should continue had not changed .
state department spokesman p.j. crowley said the us is " in close touch with both parties and will be meeting with them again in the coming days . "
from the palestinian point of view , israeli settlements in the west bank are a major barrier to the peace process .
palestinian leaders say the settlements will make the creation of a viable independent state impossible .
most of the international community considers israeli settlements in the west bank to be in violation of international law , but israel insists they are legitimate .

but whether true unity has been achieved depends on whom you ask .
we examine what reunification does and could mean . one important measure of today 's undivided germany is economic , and on this score , as on so many others , the picture is mixed . huge strides have been made in the past twenty years .
just about every eastern german city and town has been thoroughly renovated .
and while income and other economic indices in the east are only 70 to 80 percent of what they are in the west , costs of living - especially for rent - are commensurately lower , so one could argue most eastern germans are n't that much worse off than their western fellow citizens . " silicon saxony " with its computer chips , and the optical industry in and around the city of jena in thuringia , are two examples of eastern industrial success . " i 'm very impressed with how the people in germany 's new states mastered the considerable challenges after 1989 , " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , who helped negotiate the original unification treaty , told deutsche welle .
" i 'm not disappointed at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some high-tech industries have flourished in the east but not everyone 's a winner .
as of july 2010 , unemployment in the east -lrb- 11.5 % -rrb- was nearly double what it was in the west -lrb- 6.6 % -rrb- , and an astonishing 50 percent of the 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 103 billion -rrb- in annual developmental subsidies transferred from west to east is eaten up by social benefits and welfare payments . " unfortunately , economic processes do n't work along the lines of what is just , " richard schroeder - a respected former professor of philosophy and theology at berlin 's humboldt university - said at a major conference earlier this year .
" we have large numbers of people who were n't pillars of the old system but whose situations have gotten a lot worse after the economic caesura . " some 1.6 million people have relocated from east to west since 1990 , most in search of better job opportunities , and that trend shows no sign of letting up .
moreover , sociologists speak of a " brain drain " from the east since it 's the better educated who make up the majority of those who leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty apartment blocks are a common sight in hoyerswerda it 's not uncommon to see unneeded housing units being torn down in eastern cities .
the most extreme example is hoyerswerda near germany 's border with poland and the czech republic , which has lost half of its population in the past decade . in these respects , two different economic subsets continue to exist .
and dissatisfaction with such differences and inequities has manifested itself politically . the rise and fragmentation of the left the incorporation of what germans call the " new states " into the political system of the federal republic has wrought changes few would have anticipated back in 1990 . the current german chancellor , angela merkel , hails from the east , although many germans tend to forget that fact .
and though most eastern germans vote for one of the western parties , others have sought their own alternative . the left party , the successor to the old socialist party in communist east germany , combined with left-wing fringe parties from the west , has established itself as a mouthpiece for disgruntled easterners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi -lrb- right -rrb- and westerner oskar lafontaine led the left party to prominence " reunification had a structural flaw in that the elites of the east were n't accepted , and not just the political elites , but the pedagogical , scientific and artistic elites as well , " left party parliamentary leader gregor gysi told deutsche welle .
" in the beginning , they had no time for my party , but they were rebuffed and forced back to us because the other parties were n't prepared to accept them . " the ironic result is that while the spd and the greens are leery of cooperating with former communists , the political left is bifurcated , helping merkel 's center-right government to hold on to power . the establishment of the left party as a form of peaceful political protest can be seen as evidence of eastern germans ' adoption of western democracy .
but it has also deepened many western germans ' sense of a cultural divide between them and their fellow citizens . ost- and westalgia one unambiguously positive aspect of reunification has been the removal of political barriers that kept many german families painfully separated during the cold war .
there are no exact figures for how many west and east germans had relatives in the " other " germany , but an average of 26 million care packages were sent annually from west to east during germany 's division - an indication of the personal hardships caused by political division . " those who felt imprisoned were overjoyed at an end to their suffering , " says brigitte klump , an author whose private petitions to the united nations over the course of many years helped some 4,000 people leave communist east germany .
" and naturally i still feel joy when i hear from people who succeeded in integrating into the west . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are n't many east-west marriages ostalgia - eastern germans ' supposed longing for the way things were - is a regular topic in the media , but in polls only around ten percent of easterners say they preferred life under socialism .
and eastern germans ' self-identification as a group decreases the later they were born . meanwhile , around half of western germans say the time before 1989 was better than afterward .
this reflects their fond memories of a period of affluence and clear social consensus and suggests that " westalgia " is far more prevalent than its eastern equivalent . partnerships between eastern and western germans make up only around four percent of all german marriages .
this may be due to the fact that most germans still stay in the places they grew up and maintain long-term social circles .
but the number of " ossis " and " wessis " tying the knot lags significantly behind that of germans and foreigners . " thanks to reunification , germany as a whole has gotten a lot more diverse , and feelings of togetherness have grown , " wolfgang schaeuble said .
" what we still need is time , patience , including patience with one another , and the experience of having successfully solved problems together . " the global factor one oft-neglected aspect of reunification is the contributions made by residents who do not hold german passports and the effects it had on them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners are also part of the story foreigners account for roughly eight percent of germany 's population , and with the removal of the east-west political divide , german society became much more multicultural , with large communities from eastern europe joining the substantial turkish minority that had established itself in the post-war federal republic . " the german immigrant nation is one of many nationalities , including germans from the old federal republic , others from the former east , millions of ethnic germans from eastern europe as well as an immigrant population of non-german descent , " said germany 's leading immigration expert klaus bade .
" former ' guest workers ' make up the majority , but there are also lots of smaller groups from an ever greater variety of backgrounds . " foreigners have an inestimable impact on today 's german society , and immigration is crucial in offsetting population decline , as both western and eastern germans are having fewer and fewer children . but after a boom immediately following the end of the cold war , the number of foreigners in germany has stagnated .
economists and sociologists see this as a worrisome trend because germany needs to increase its workforce to compensate for the aging population entering retirement . two decades on from 1990 , it is more apparent than ever that " reunification " is not a restoration of a past society , but a process of creating something new that is inextricable from globalization .

but whether true unity has been achieved depends on whom you ask .
we examine what reunification does and could mean . one important measure of today 's undivided germany is economic , and on this score , as on so many others , the picture is mixed . huge strides have been made in the past twenty years .
just about every eastern german city and town has been thoroughly renovated .
and while income and other economic indices in the east are only 70 to 80 percent of what they are in the west , costs of living - especially for rent - are commensurately lower , so one could argue most eastern germans are n't that much worse off than their western fellow citizens . " silicon saxony " with its computer chips , and the optical industry in and around the city of jena in thuringia , are two examples of eastern industrial success . " i 'm very impressed with how the people in germany 's new states mastered the considerable challenges after 1989 , " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , who helped negotiate the original unification treaty , told deutsche welle .
" i 'm not disappointed at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some high-tech industries have flourished in the east but not everyone 's a winner .
as of july 2010 , unemployment in the east -lrb- 11.5 % -rrb- was nearly double what it was in the west -lrb- 6.6 % -rrb- , and an astonishing 50 percent of the 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 103 billion -rrb- in annual developmental subsidies transferred from west to east is eaten up by social benefits and welfare payments . " unfortunately , economic processes do n't work along the lines of what is just , " richard schroeder - a respected former professor of philosophy and theology at berlin 's humboldt university - said at a major conference earlier this year .
" we have large numbers of people who were n't pillars of the old system but whose situations have gotten a lot worse after the economic caesura . " some 1.6 million people have relocated from east to west since 1990 , most in search of better job opportunities , and that trend shows no sign of letting up .
moreover , sociologists speak of a " brain drain " from the east since it 's the better educated who make up the majority of those who leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty apartment blocks are a common sight in hoyerswerda it 's not uncommon to see unneeded housing units being torn down in eastern cities .
the most extreme example is hoyerswerda near germany 's border with poland and the czech republic , which has lost half of its population in the past decade . in these respects , two different economic subsets continue to exist .
and dissatisfaction with such differences and inequities has manifested itself politically . the rise and fragmentation of the left the incorporation of what germans call the " new states " into the political system of the federal republic has wrought changes few would have anticipated back in 1990 . the current german chancellor , angela merkel , hails from the east , although many germans tend to forget that fact .
and though most eastern germans vote for one of the western parties , others have sought their own alternative . the left party , the successor to the old socialist party in communist east germany , combined with left-wing fringe parties from the west , has established itself as a mouthpiece for disgruntled easterners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi -lrb- right -rrb- and westerner oskar lafontaine led the left party to prominence " reunification had a structural flaw in that the elites of the east were n't accepted , and not just the political elites , but the pedagogical , scientific and artistic elites as well , " left party parliamentary leader gregor gysi told deutsche welle .
" in the beginning , they had no time for my party , but they were rebuffed and forced back to us because the other parties were n't prepared to accept them . " the ironic result is that while the spd and the greens are leery of cooperating with former communists , the political left is bifurcated , helping merkel 's center-right government to hold on to power . the establishment of the left party as a form of peaceful political protest can be seen as evidence of eastern germans ' adoption of western democracy .
but it has also deepened many western germans ' sense of a cultural divide between them and their fellow citizens . ost- and westalgia one unambiguously positive aspect of reunification has been the removal of political barriers that kept many german families painfully separated during the cold war .
there are no exact figures for how many west and east germans had relatives in the " other " germany , but an average of 26 million care packages were sent annually from west to east during germany 's division - an indication of the personal hardships caused by political division . " those who felt imprisoned were overjoyed at an end to their suffering , " says brigitte klump , an author whose private petitions to the united nations over the course of many years helped some 4,000 people leave communist east germany .
" and naturally i still feel joy when i hear from people who succeeded in integrating into the west . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are n't many east-west marriages ostalgia - eastern germans ' supposed longing for the way things were - is a regular topic in the media , but in polls only around ten percent of easterners say they preferred life under socialism .
and eastern germans ' self-identification as a group decreases the later they were born . meanwhile , around half of western germans say the time before 1989 was better than afterward .
this reflects their fond memories of a period of affluence and clear social consensus and suggests that " westalgia " is far more prevalent than its eastern equivalent . partnerships between eastern and western germans make up only around four percent of all german marriages .
this may be due to the fact that most germans still stay in the places they grew up and maintain long-term social circles .
but the number of " ossis " and " wessis " tying the knot lags significantly behind that of germans and foreigners . " thanks to reunification , germany as a whole has gotten a lot more diverse , and feelings of togetherness have grown , " wolfgang schaeuble said .
" what we still need is time , patience , including patience with one another , and the experience of having successfully solved problems together . " the global factor one oft-neglected aspect of reunification is the contributions made by residents who do not hold german passports and the effects it had on them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners are also part of the story foreigners account for roughly eight percent of germany 's population , and with the removal of the east-west political divide , german society became much more multicultural , with large communities from eastern europe joining the substantial turkish minority that had established itself in the post-war federal republic . " the german immigrant nation is one of many nationalities , including germans from the old federal republic , others from the former east , millions of ethnic germans from eastern europe as well as an immigrant population of non-german descent , " said germany 's leading immigration expert klaus bade .
" former ' guest workers ' make up the majority , but there are also lots of smaller groups from an ever greater variety of backgrounds . " foreigners have an inestimable impact on today 's german society , and immigration is crucial in offsetting population decline , as both western and eastern germans are having fewer and fewer children . but after a boom immediately following the end of the cold war , the number of foreigners in germany has stagnated .
economists and sociologists see this as a worrisome trend because germany needs to increase its workforce to compensate for the aging population entering retirement . two decades on from 1990 , it is more apparent than ever that " reunification " is not a restoration of a past society , but a process of creating something new that is inextricable from globalization .
old national paradigms are coming under ever increasing challenges , so the future of the new federal republic is likely to be influenced just as much by factors from abroad as from within its own borders . author : jefferson chase editor : kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just about every eastern german city and town has been thoroughly renovated .

" i 'm not disappointed at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some high-tech industries have flourished in the east but not everyone 's a winner .
as of july 2010 , unemployment in the east -lrb- 11.5 % -rrb- was nearly double what it was in the west -lrb- 6.6 % -rrb- , and an astonishing 50 percent of the 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 103 billion -rrb- in annual developmental subsidies transferred from west to east is eaten up by social benefits and welfare payments . " unfortunately , economic processes do n't work along the lines of what is just , " richard schroeder - a respected former professor of philosophy and theology at berlin 's humboldt university - said at a major conference earlier this year .
" we have large numbers of people who were n't pillars of the old system but whose situations have gotten a lot worse after the economic caesura . " some 1.6 million people have relocated from east to west since 1990 , most in search of better job opportunities , and that trend shows no sign of letting up .
moreover , sociologists speak of a " brain drain " from the east since it 's the better educated who make up the majority of those who leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty apartment blocks are a common sight in hoyerswerda it 's not uncommon to see unneeded housing units being torn down in eastern cities .
the most extreme example is hoyerswerda near germany 's border with poland and the czech republic , which has lost half of its population in the past decade . in these respects , two different economic subsets continue to exist .
and dissatisfaction with such differences and inequities has manifested itself politically . the rise and fragmentation of the left the incorporation of what germans call the " new states " into the political system of the federal republic has wrought changes few would have anticipated back in 1990 . the current german chancellor , angela merkel , hails from the east , although many germans tend to forget that fact .
and though most eastern germans vote for one of the western parties , others have sought their own alternative . the left party , the successor to the old socialist party in communist east germany , combined with left-wing fringe parties from the west , has established itself as a mouthpiece for disgruntled easterners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi -lrb- right -rrb- and westerner oskar lafontaine led the left party to prominence " reunification had a structural flaw in that the elites of the east were n't accepted , and not just the political elites , but the pedagogical , scientific and artistic elites as well , " left party parliamentary leader gregor gysi told deutsche welle .
" in the beginning , they had no time for my party , but they were rebuffed and forced back to us because the other parties were n't prepared to accept them . " the ironic result is that while the spd and the greens are leery of cooperating with former communists , the political left is bifurcated , helping merkel 's center-right government to hold on to power . the establishment of the left party as a form of peaceful political protest can be seen as evidence of eastern germans ' adoption of western democracy .
but it has also deepened many western germans ' sense of a cultural divide between them and their fellow citizens . ost- and westalgia one unambiguously positive aspect of reunification has been the removal of political barriers that kept many german families painfully separated during the cold war .
there are no exact figures for how many west and east germans had relatives in the " other " germany , but an average of 26 million care packages were sent annually from west to east during germany 's division - an indication of the personal hardships caused by political division . " those who felt imprisoned were overjoyed at an end to their suffering , " says brigitte klump , an author whose private petitions to the united nations over the course of many years helped some 4,000 people leave communist east germany .
" and naturally i still feel joy when i hear from people who succeeded in integrating into the west . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are n't many east-west marriages ostalgia - eastern germans ' supposed longing for the way things were - is a regular topic in the media , but in polls only around ten percent of easterners say they preferred life under socialism .
and eastern germans ' self-identification as a group decreases the later they were born . meanwhile , around half of western germans say the time before 1989 was better than afterward .
this reflects their fond memories of a period of affluence and clear social consensus and suggests that " westalgia " is far more prevalent than its eastern equivalent . partnerships between eastern and western germans make up only around four percent of all german marriages .
this may be due to the fact that most germans still stay in the places they grew up and maintain long-term social circles .
but the number of " ossis " and " wessis " tying the knot lags significantly behind that of germans and foreigners . " thanks to reunification , germany as a whole has gotten a lot more diverse , and feelings of togetherness have grown , " wolfgang schaeuble said .
" what we still need is time , patience , including patience with one another , and the experience of having successfully solved problems together .

" in the beginning , they had no time for my party , but they were rebuffed and forced back to us because the other parties were n't prepared to accept them . " the ironic result is that while the spd and the greens are leery of cooperating with former communists , the political left is bifurcated , helping merkel 's center-right government to hold on to power . the establishment of the left party as a form of peaceful political protest can be seen as evidence of eastern germans ' adoption of western democracy .

and dissatisfaction with such differences and inequities has manifested itself politically . the rise and fragmentation of the left the incorporation of what germans call the " new states " into the political system of the federal republic has wrought changes few would have anticipated back in 1990 . the current german chancellor , angela merkel , hails from the east , although many germans tend to forget that fact .
and though most eastern germans vote for one of the western parties , others have sought their own alternative . the left party , the successor to the old socialist party in communist east germany , combined with left-wing fringe parties from the west , has established itself as a mouthpiece for disgruntled easterners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi -lrb- right -rrb- and westerner oskar lafontaine led the left party to prominence " reunification had a structural flaw in that the elites of the east were n't accepted , and not just the political elites , but the pedagogical , scientific and artistic elites as well , " left party parliamentary leader gregor gysi told deutsche welle .
" in the beginning , they had no time for my party , but they were rebuffed and forced back to us because the other parties were n't prepared to accept them . " the ironic result is that while the spd and the greens are leery of cooperating with former communists , the political left is bifurcated , helping merkel 's center-right government to hold on to power . the establishment of the left party as a form of peaceful political protest can be seen as evidence of eastern germans ' adoption of western democracy .
but it has also deepened many western germans ' sense of a cultural divide between them and their fellow citizens . ost- and westalgia one unambiguously positive aspect of reunification has been the removal of political barriers that kept many german families painfully separated during the cold war .
there are no exact figures for how many west and east germans had relatives in the " other " germany , but an average of 26 million care packages were sent annually from west to east during germany 's division - an indication of the personal hardships caused by political division . " those who felt imprisoned were overjoyed at an end to their suffering , " says brigitte klump , an author whose private petitions to the united nations over the course of many years helped some 4,000 people leave communist east germany .
" and naturally i still feel joy when i hear from people who succeeded in integrating into the west . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are n't many east-west marriages ostalgia - eastern germans ' supposed longing for the way things were - is a regular topic in the media , but in polls only around ten percent of easterners say they preferred life under socialism .
and eastern germans ' self-identification as a group decreases the later they were born . meanwhile , around half of western germans say the time before 1989 was better than afterward .
this reflects their fond memories of a period of affluence and clear social consensus and suggests that " westalgia " is far more prevalent than its eastern equivalent . partnerships between eastern and western germans make up only around four percent of all german marriages .
this may be due to the fact that most germans still stay in the places they grew up and maintain long-term social circles .
but the number of " ossis " and " wessis " tying the knot lags significantly behind that of germans and foreigners . " thanks to reunification , germany as a whole has gotten a lot more diverse , and feelings of togetherness have grown , " wolfgang schaeuble said .
" what we still need is time , patience , including patience with one another , and the experience of having successfully solved problems together . " the global factor one oft-neglected aspect of reunification is the contributions made by residents who do not hold german passports and the effects it had on them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners are also part of the story foreigners account for roughly eight percent of germany 's population , and with the removal of the east-west political divide , german society became much more multicultural , with large communities from eastern europe joining the substantial turkish minority that had established itself in the post-war federal republic . " the german immigrant nation is one of many nationalities , including germans from the old federal republic , others from the former east , millions of ethnic germans from eastern europe as well as an immigrant population of non-german descent , " said germany 's leading immigration expert klaus bade .
" former ' guest workers ' make up the majority , but there are also lots of smaller groups from an ever greater variety of backgrounds . " foreigners have an inestimable impact on today 's german society , and immigration is crucial in offsetting population decline , as both western and eastern germans are having fewer and fewer children . but after a boom immediately following the end of the cold war , the number of foreigners in germany has stagnated .
economists and sociologists see this as a worrisome trend because germany needs to increase its workforce to compensate for the aging population entering retirement . two decades on from 1990 , it is more apparent than ever that " reunification " is not a restoration of a past society , but a process of creating something new that is inextricable from globalization .
old national paradigms are coming under ever increasing challenges , so the future of the new federal republic is likely to be influenced just as much by factors from abroad as from within its own borders . author : jefferson chase editor : kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , a ban on west bank construction has ended - the issue is a major sticking point in mideast peace talks . a ship carrying nine jewish activists from germany , britain , israel and the us set sail on sunday to deliver aid to the gaza strip .
the british boat " irene " departed sunday from famagusta in cyprus in protest against israel 's blockade of the palestinian territory .
the israeli foreign ministry called the move a " provocation . "
' a sacred duty ' the activists included 82-year-old holocaust survivor reuven moskovitz .
" it is a sacred duty for me , as a -lsb- holocaust -rsb- survivor , to protest against the persecution , the oppression and the imprisonment of so many people in gaza , including more than 800,000 children , " moskovitz said .
the trip - which was coordinated by the german organization jewish voice for just peace in the near east and the british group jews for justice for palestinians - intends to bring school supplies , musical instruments and fishing nets into gaza .
it comes after israel 's deadly raid of a gaza-bound aid ship last may , resulting in the deaths of nine turkish activists .
israeli defence minister ehud barak has repeatedly warned that israel will intercept any ship nearing gaza .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's may interception of an aid ship proved deadly the activists have vowed to conduct a peaceful sit down should israeli military attempt to deter their entry to the gaza strip .
netanyahu urges restraint the launch of the aid ship on sunday came on the last day of israel 's freeze on settlement building in the occupied territories on the west bank .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu urged israeli settlers in a statement to exercise restraint after the moratorium expires – in an apparent bid to keep alive peace talks with the palestinians .
" the prime minister calls on the residents in judea and samaria -lsb- the west bank -rsb- and the political parties to show restraint and responsibility today and in the future exactly as they showed restraint and responsibility throughout the months of the freeze , " the statement read .
a ' 50-50 ' chance palestinian president mahmud abbas had earlier vowed to abandon peace talks should the jewish settlers recommence construction on occupied land , though he later said in an interview that he would remain in the talks with the agreement of the arab league .
" israel must choose between peace and the continuation of settlements , " he told the united nations in new york on saturday , denouncing israel 's " mentality of expansion and domination " in the west bank .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barak believes there is a 50 percent chance for the moratorium 's extension while abbas 's spokesman told reporters that there was no progress in a us-led push to extend the moratorium , israeli defence minister barak maintained until the last minute that an extension would be possible .
" i think that the chance of achieving a mutually agreed understanding about -lsb- a -rsb- moratorium is 50-50 , " barak said in a bbc interview in new york where he was meeting with us officials , adding , " i think that the chances of having a peace process is much higher . "
settlers to start new constructions as the official moratorium came to an end , israeli settlers were poised to begin construction on new developments in palestinian territory .
settlers and their supporters held a rally in the settlement of revava to mark the end of the freeze .
in another settlement the foundation stone for a new kindergarten was laid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settlement construction has been on hold for 10 months but it was not expected that there would be a massive surge in construction activity .
" we are getting back to business as usual and building but we will respect the prime minister 's request , " said david ha 'ivri , head of the samaria regional council .
over 430,000 jews live in more than 100 settlements across territory in the west bank and east jerusalem that israel captured from jordan in 1967 .

meanwhile , a ban on west bank construction has ended - the issue is a major sticking point in mideast peace talks . a ship carrying nine jewish activists from germany , britain , israel and the us set sail on sunday to deliver aid to the gaza strip .
the british boat " irene " departed sunday from famagusta in cyprus in protest against israel 's blockade of the palestinian territory .
the israeli foreign ministry called the move a " provocation . "
' a sacred duty ' the activists included 82-year-old holocaust survivor reuven moskovitz .
" it is a sacred duty for me , as a -lsb- holocaust -rsb- survivor , to protest against the persecution , the oppression and the imprisonment of so many people in gaza , including more than 800,000 children , " moskovitz said .
the trip - which was coordinated by the german organization jewish voice for just peace in the near east and the british group jews for justice for palestinians - intends to bring school supplies , musical instruments and fishing nets into gaza .
it comes after israel 's deadly raid of a gaza-bound aid ship last may , resulting in the deaths of nine turkish activists .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's may interception of an aid ship proved deadly the activists have vowed to conduct a peaceful sit down should israeli military attempt to deter their entry to the gaza strip .
netanyahu urges restraint the launch of the aid ship on sunday came on the last day of israel 's freeze on settlement building in the occupied territories on the west bank .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu urged israeli settlers in a statement to exercise restraint after the moratorium expires – in an apparent bid to keep alive peace talks with the palestinians .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 5 euro increase per month has been branded derisory " the rates are very fair , " she told the daily bild newspaper , following criticism of a rise of 5 euros -lrb- $ 6.70 -rrb- a month which had been agreed by the coalition on sunday .
currently , germany 's 6.5 million " hartz iv " welfare recipients receive up to 359 euros per month .
" the federal statistical office analyzed what people on low earnings were able to spend each month , " said von der leyen , citing sales staff , janitors and hairdressers as examples .
" the calculations show accurately what the subsistence level is . "
' bad news for welfare recipients ' trade unions , as well as opposition parties such as the social democrats and greens , have warned that the rise is not enough and means that the poor will drift deeper into economic difficulties .
however , christian democrat von der leyen said that welfare rates had to be compared with lower level incomes in the working population .
" whoever demands that hartz iv should be higher must justify it by looking at the statistical data , compared with employees who work full time , " said the minister .
" those employees pay for hartz iv through their taxes and , in the end , many of them do not have much more money to spare -lsb- than hartz iv recipients -rsb- . "
no tobacco and alcohol allowance von der leyen defended the fact that the hartz iv would no longer provide an allowance for alcohol and tobacco .
while provision for basic needs was " sacrosanct , " she said , such products did not fall into this category .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will no longer be an allowance for alcohol or cigarettes the minister argued that any attempt by opposition parties to block the reforms in germany 's upper house - the bundesrat , where the ruling coalition has no majority - could not be justified .
chancellor angela merkel and party leaders from coalition partners the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- met to agree the changes on sunday .
monthly benefits for children are set to remain the same at 215 euros , 251 euros and 287 euros for children under age six , aged six to 14 and 14-18 , respectively .
however , the reforms include plans for " non-cash " benefits , such as a chip card that gives needy children access to educational and recreational services .

but the invasive searches have stirred privacy concerns . germany began its six-month test period of two full-body scanners at hamburg airport on monday as critics continued to denounce the technology as too invasive .
interior minister thomas de maiziere was one of the first to pass through one of the scanners , saying he did not feel cramped or uncomfortable inside .
“ today is an important step on the way to better security in german airports , ” he said .
the german interior ministry , which is responsible for the project , selected hamburg for the trial run under real airport conditions because it is large , but not so large that technical glitches would seriously disrupt the flow of passenger traffic .
hamburg is germany 's fifth largest airport and serves about 12 million passengers annually .
full-body scanners are already in use in the united states and several european countries but , due to widespread privacy concerns , germany has been slow to test the technology .
until now , the machines had only been tested in the laboratory at the federal police academy in luebeck .
the scanners use low-frequency electromagnetic waves to sweep a schematic representation of the human body to check for concealed weapons or explosives .
passengers walk through a three-meter -lrb- 10 foot -rrb- high and two-meter wide cabin and are scanned by the waves , which the machine 's manufacturer says are 10,000-times weaker than the ordinary electro-smog from cell phones .

peter schaar , germany 's federal commissioner for data protection , cautioned that “ very sensitive areas ” of a person 's private life could be revealed , such as breast implants , colostomies or other medical aids .
security experts argue , however , that the scanners are indispensable because they detect things , like plastic explosives and ceramic weapons , which conventional metal detectors would not discover .
this has not stopped some countries , notably italy , from scrapping the scanners .
after a six-month trial at airports in rome , venice and palermo , the machines are no longer in use after being deemed too slow and ineffective .

but the invasive searches have stirred privacy concerns . germany began its six-month test period of two full-body scanners at hamburg airport on monday as critics continued to denounce the technology as too invasive .
interior minister thomas de maiziere was one of the first to pass through one of the scanners , saying he did not feel cramped or uncomfortable inside .
“ today is an important step on the way to better security in german airports , ” he said .
the german interior ministry , which is responsible for the project , selected hamburg for the trial run under real airport conditions because it is large , but not so large that technical glitches would seriously disrupt the flow of passenger traffic .
hamburg is germany 's fifth largest airport and serves about 12 million passengers annually .
full-body scanners are already in use in the united states and several european countries but , due to widespread privacy concerns , germany has been slow to test the technology .
until now , the machines had only been tested in the laboratory at the federal police academy in luebeck .
the scanners use low-frequency electromagnetic waves to sweep a schematic representation of the human body to check for concealed weapons or explosives .
passengers walk through a three-meter -lrb- 10 foot -rrb- high and two-meter wide cabin and are scanned by the waves , which the machine 's manufacturer says are 10,000-times weaker than the ordinary electro-smog from cell phones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics , like peter schaar , warn that scanners are too invasive scanners ' too invasive ' , critics warn privacy advocates oppose the use of the technology because they say it is too invasive and could reveal embarrassing details about a passenger .
peter schaar , germany 's federal commissioner for data protection , cautioned that “ very sensitive areas ” of a person 's private life could be revealed , such as breast implants , colostomies or other medical aids .
security experts argue , however , that the scanners are indispensable because they detect things , like plastic explosives and ceramic weapons , which conventional metal detectors would not discover .
this has not stopped some countries , notably italy , from scrapping the scanners .
after a six-month trial at airports in rome , venice and palermo , the machines are no longer in use after being deemed too slow and ineffective .

injury trouble and dysfunction in attack have meant their bundesliga campaign is a shambles . five goals , eight points , ninth place .
such is bayern munich 's meager return from the first six matches of the new bundesliga season .
in that bayern had got off to a slow start last year too before finishing as champions , players and club officials had , until recently , been leery of making critical statements .
since saturday 's 2-1 home loss to surprise league leaders mainz , all that has changed .
“ we have too many players who are n't playing up to their usual standard , ” said defender philipp lahm .
“ work-rate , aggressiveness , passion - we 're missing all of it at the moment , ” said bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
the loss left bayern 10 points adrift of mainz , and that wide margin appears to be ringing a few alarm bells on saebenerstrasse .
“ it 's going to be hard to make up for this deficit , ” lahm added in his post-game remarks .
“ we let happen precisely what we did n't want to happen .
it 's going to take a long time to make up 10 points . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's captain in south africa , lahm , speaks his mind at bayern too sitting prettier luckily for bayern , the champions league is a different story .
there , the bavarians can head to switzerland to take on fc basel with their heads held high .
as if to underscore the club 's confidence that all was not yet lost , bayern 's head coach , louis van gaal , signed a one-year contract extension in basel on monday .
the deal keeps him and his supporting cast of coaches on at the club through june 2012 .
two weeks ago , van gaal 's men broke down a dogged as roma defense and got a 2-0 win to top their group .
basel , meanwhile , stumbled to a 2-1 loss in romania to cfr cluj .
if bayern can manage a win at the st. jakob park on tuesday , they could stay in the driver 's seat in group e , with a potentially winnable home-and-away match-up with cluj next on the club 's docket .
some in the club are already looking to the champions league campaign as a corrective to the poor league start .
“ we need to stay calm , ” said hamit altintop , the turkey winger who has begun to see more playing time with franck ribery out injured for the coming weeks .
“ we won the first game and can afford to play it safe - we do n't have to go storming into attack from the get-go . ”
hurting for goals perhaps it would n't do much good to play things hell-for-leather .
it 's in attack that bayern have disappointed the most .
despite starting the potent likes of thomas mueller , toni kroos , ivica olic and miroslav klose on saturday , bayern failed to find the net - relying instead on a mainz own-goal to get on the scoreboard .
this is not to say bayern 's offensive front is n't able to keep the ball , or create chances .
indeed , they had more than 70 percent of the ball and shot it 15 times .
but many of those chances were not of a particularly high standard , and their shooting was poor .
bayern put the ball on target just four times .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben scored 23 goals and set up eight more for bayern last season it would seem that the missing creativity , not to mention finishing , of arjen robben is holding the team back .
the dutchman 's muscle tear will keep him out of the lineup until the new year , and now franck ribery 's injured ankle means he 'll miss another month at least .
bayern could use their offensive potency .
kroos and mueller filled in fairly effectively for robben and ribery on the two wings on saturday , but this left the side bereft of ideas in the middle , where neither strikers olic and klose , nor defensive midfielders bastian schweinsteiger and mark van bommel offered much creativity .
a change of system , perhaps one that brings mueller and / or kroos into the middle , may do the trick - and in truth , it will have to .
bayern 's small squad means that there are no further personnel options left for van gaal should he wish to shake up the offense .
about a month ago , during the transfer-rumor-mad silly season , big-name playmakers like rafael van de vaart were brought up in connection with bayern munich . van gaal told reporters then that he did n't feel he needed to go out and buy any players to bolster the squad .
“ alaba is better ! ” van gaal had said , referring to one of his favorite young charges , the 18-year-old austrian david alaba , who he 'd used as an emergency wingback last year , but whose real strength is in the offensive midfield .
it was a bold statement - but perhaps we 'd agree with him , if we could only see alaba play .
but that poor lad is hurt as well .

injury trouble and dysfunction in attack have meant their bundesliga campaign is a shambles . five goals , eight points , ninth place .
such is bayern munich 's meager return from the first six matches of the new bundesliga season .
in that bayern had got off to a slow start last year too before finishing as champions , players and club officials had , until recently , been leery of making critical statements .
since saturday 's 2-1 home loss to surprise league leaders mainz , all that has changed .
“ we have too many players who are n't playing up to their usual standard , ” said defender philipp lahm .
“ work-rate , aggressiveness , passion - we 're missing all of it at the moment , ” said bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
the loss left bayern 10 points adrift of mainz , and that wide margin appears to be ringing a few alarm bells on saebenerstrasse .
“ it 's going to be hard to make up for this deficit , ” lahm added in his post-game remarks .
“ we let happen precisely what we did n't want to happen .
it 's going to take a long time to make up 10 points . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's captain in south africa , lahm , speaks his mind at bayern too sitting prettier luckily for bayern , the champions league is a different story .
there , the bavarians can head to switzerland to take on fc basel with their heads held high .
as if to underscore the club 's confidence that all was not yet lost , bayern 's head coach , louis van gaal , signed a one-year contract extension in basel on monday .
the deal keeps him and his supporting cast of coaches on at the club through june 2012 .
two weeks ago , van gaal 's men broke down a dogged as roma defense and got a 2-0 win to top their group .
basel , meanwhile , stumbled to a 2-1 loss in romania to cfr cluj .
if bayern can manage a win at the st. jakob park on tuesday , they could stay in the driver 's seat in group e , with a potentially winnable home-and-away match-up with cluj next on the club 's docket .
some in the club are already looking to the champions league campaign as a corrective to the poor league start .
“ we need to stay calm , ” said hamit altintop , the turkey winger who has begun to see more playing time with franck ribery out injured for the coming weeks .
“ we won the first game and can afford to play it safe - we do n't have to go storming into attack from the get-go . ”
hurting for goals perhaps it would n't do much good to play things hell-for-leather .
it 's in attack that bayern have disappointed the most .
despite starting the potent likes of thomas mueller , toni kroos , ivica olic and miroslav klose on saturday , bayern failed to find the net - relying instead on a mainz own-goal to get on the scoreboard .
this is not to say bayern 's offensive front is n't able to keep the ball , or create chances .
indeed , they had more than 70 percent of the ball and shot it 15 times .
but many of those chances were not of a particularly high standard , and their shooting was poor .
bayern put the ball on target just four times .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben scored 23 goals and set up eight more for bayern last season it would seem that the missing creativity , not to mention finishing , of arjen robben is holding the team back .
the dutchman 's muscle tear will keep him out of the lineup until the new year , and now franck ribery 's injured ankle means he 'll miss another month at least .
bayern could use their offensive potency .
kroos and mueller filled in fairly effectively for robben and ribery on the two wings on saturday , but this left the side bereft of ideas in the middle , where neither strikers olic and klose , nor defensive midfielders bastian schweinsteiger and mark van bommel offered much creativity .
a change of system , perhaps one that brings mueller and / or kroos into the middle , may do the trick - and in truth , it will have to .
bayern 's small squad means that there are no further personnel options left for van gaal should he wish to shake up the offense .
about a month ago , during the transfer-rumor-mad silly season , big-name playmakers like rafael van de vaart were brought up in connection with bayern munich . van gaal told reporters then that he did n't feel he needed to go out and buy any players to bolster the squad .
“ alaba is better ! ” van gaal had said , referring to one of his favorite young charges , the 18-year-old austrian david alaba , who he 'd used as an emergency wingback last year , but whose real strength is in the offensive midfield .
it was a bold statement - but perhaps we 'd agree with him , if we could only see alaba play .
but that poor lad is hurt as well .

iran and middle east share center-stage at the un general assembly should germany be awarded a seat on the un security council ?
my opinion is that germany deserves the seat because this country is a big democratic , economic and political player in the world . - leon , us absolutely !
it is long-overdue .
if germany is " good enough " to be used as the sixth country in the stand-off with iran , it clearly deserves to be permanently seated on the security council .
moreover , the very fact that germany pays the third highest dues to the operation of the un can be argument for giving it a more influential voice .
time to leave world war ii behind ! - r.e. , us german foreign minister pushes for seat on security council absolutely , it is high time that germany is given a seat at the un security council .
the same applies for japan , india and brazil .
hopefully , when this becomes a reality , the un may become more productive in solving the world 's problems . - loyola , us i 'm not sure who i would like to receive the temporary seat on the un security council .
it either has to be canada or germany .
if only we could just change our leaders to someone a bit more liberal in their political thinking .
oh well , can not have everything . - cynthia , canada prominent german feminist weighs in loudly on headscarf debate women deserve freedom .
it breaks my heart to see oppression in germany against women .
we women are the other half in society . - blue , us all kind of religious signs including christian cross , jewish side curls , and the headscarf should be banned out of the public domain . - lutz , germany french senate approves burqa ban as far as i 'm concerned there is no government on earth that has the right to tell any person what they can or can not wear at any given time .
i also firmly believe that there is no place in politics for anything resembling religion .
as far as i 'm concerned this law infringes on people 's basic human rights to wear whatever they want .
religion belongs where it lies .
it does not belong in policy making and law enforcement .
there is no place for religion in government it is a spiritual matter which is unique to individuals . - saaly , australia compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not a month after israeli-palestinian peace talks resumed , their future is in jeopardy . palestinian president mahmoud abbas delayed a decision on withdrawing from direct peace talks with israel on monday as france voiced strong support for the palestinian position .
after meeting with abbas in paris , french president nicolas sarkozy told reporters that france regretted that israel had not listened to " unanimous calls " to extend a 10-month freeze on israeli settlement construction in the west bank .
the settlement freeze " should have been extended to give negotiations a chance , " sarkozy said .
" i say this in front of president abbas : settlement must stop . "

" the position of the eu is very clear : settlements are illegal under international law , constitute an obstacle to peace and threaten to make a two-state solution impossible , " kocijancic told german news agency dpa . the united states also expressed disappointment that the settlement freeze had not been extended and announced that its middle east envoy george mitchell was on his way to the region to restart negotiations . the eu and the united states make up half of the middle east quartet charged with pursuing a peace solution .
the other members of the quartet are russia and the united nations .
settlements continue to expand bulldozers in at least two west bank settlements resumed work early on monday just hours after the moratorium expired .
the palestinian leadership had repeatedly threatened to pull out of direct peace talks with israel if the settlements continued to expand .
but abbas said there would be no official palestinian answer to the construction resumption until after a meeting with top arab diplomats on october 4 .
" after all these meetings we may be able to issue a position to clarify what is the palestinian and arab opinion on this matter , after israel has refused to freeze settlements , " he said .

the united states also said its position that the settlement freeze should continue had not changed .
state department spokesman p.j. crowley said the us is " in close touch with both parties and will be meeting with them again in the coming days . "
from the palestinian point of view , israeli settlements in the west bank are a major barrier to the peace process .
palestinian leaders say the settlements will make the creation of a viable independent state impossible .
most of the international community considers israeli settlements in the west bank to be in violation of international law , but israel insists they are legitimate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 27.09.2010 long trucks long for germany 's autobahns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long and even possibly longer : germany considers long trucks with germany 's famed autobahns sometimes looking more like vast truck parking lots than motorways , the government is wondering whether fewer , longer trucks could reduce congestion and emissions .
critics doubt it . one of the hot topics at this year 's iaa commercial vehicles trade show in hanover is the german governent 's nationwide " long truck " field trial planned some time next year .
the trails could lead to new regulations on semi-truck lengths , creating new business opportunities for both makers of long-haul transportation vehicles and logistics companies operating them .
experts say longer trucks could reduce trucking costs by 20 to 25 percent .
" we build long trucks , and the experience of our customers using them in scandinavia , the netherlands and other markets has been good , " detlef hug , a spokesman for german truck maker man , told deutsche welle .
" of course , germany has its own challenges like heavy traffic and hilly terrain .
so that 's why it is a good idea to conduct a nationwide field trial so that we can test fuel and co2 emission reduction , safety , the impact on car drivers and more . "
truck traffic to increase 70 percent there is a sense of political urgency in berlin .
the federal transportation ministry estimates that truck traffic - already choking numerous german highways - will increase by 70 percent over the next 15 years .
and no one knows where all those vehicles should go .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's autobahns look more like a truck parking lot these days three years ago , several german states launched their own field trials – with mixed results .
accompanying studies also painted a blurred picture .
one of the studies , by the technical rwth aachen university , concluded that long trucks are safe and would reduce emissions .
longer vehicles , it noted , hardly use more fuel than current shorter models ; only during acceleration does the additional load make the truck 's engine slightly less efficient .
but another study by the fraunhofer institute for systems and innovative research claimed that while long trucks could relieve roads and the environment in the short term , they would , in the long term , cause a shift from rail to road that would offset any benefits .
" we 're aware of the work the states have done and the results of their tests will flow into a joint working group between the federal and state transportation ministries , " a spokesman from the federal transportation ministry told deutsche welle .
" these tests , however , were on a small scale .
what is needed is a much larger field trial across the entire country to determine the impact on logistics . "
plenty of interest more than 300 companies , including man , have already registered to participate in the federal government 's planned nationwide test , though a final number of participants has yet to be set .
the goal is to test tractor-trailer combinations with a length of 25.25 meters -lrb- 83 feet -rrb- , or 6.5 meters -lrb- 21 feet -rrb- longer than currently allowed .
the gross weight of the vehicles will remain at the current 44 tons for semi-trucks or 44 for " intermodal " container trucks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man has a booth at the iaa commercial vehicles trade show in hanover " we have heard some talk about the planned nationwide field trial testing 60-ton vehicles , " the ministry spokesman said .
" we have no intention to change the weight .
this is all about increasing volume . "
long trucks , the spokesman said , would allow voluminous goods to be transported with one vehicle , for instance , instead of breaking down the item to transport it with three trucks .
critics of heavy and long 60-ton trucks point to a number of problems , such as the damage they could do to roads and bridges because of their added weight and the lack of sufficiently secure guard rails .
yet long trucks also have their critics , too .
" there are a number of issues to be concerned about , " said martin roggermann from the german pro-rail alliance .
" long trucks are more difficult to pass , they need more space for turning at intersections and do n't fit into the current autobahn parking facilities , not too mention safety issues . "
shift from road to rail but roggermann 's biggest bone of contention is that the expected lower operating costs of long trucks could undermine efforts by his organization and others to shift freight off the road and onto rail .

critics doubt it . one of the hot topics at this year 's iaa commercial vehicles trade show in hanover is the german governent 's nationwide " long truck " field trial planned some time next year .
the trails could lead to new regulations on semi-truck lengths , creating new business opportunities for both makers of long-haul transportation vehicles and logistics companies operating them .
experts say longer trucks could reduce trucking costs by 20 to 25 percent .
" we build long trucks , and the experience of our customers using them in scandinavia , the netherlands and other markets has been good , " detlef hug , a spokesman for german truck maker man , told deutsche welle .
" of course , germany has its own challenges like heavy traffic and hilly terrain .
so that 's why it is a good idea to conduct a nationwide field trial so that we can test fuel and co2 emission reduction , safety , the impact on car drivers and more . "
truck traffic to increase 70 percent there is a sense of political urgency in berlin .
the federal transportation ministry estimates that truck traffic - already choking numerous german highways - will increase by 70 percent over the next 15 years .
and no one knows where all those vehicles should go .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's autobahns look more like a truck parking lot these days three years ago , several german states launched their own field trials – with mixed results .
accompanying studies also painted a blurred picture .
one of the studies , by the technical rwth aachen university , concluded that long trucks are safe and would reduce emissions .
longer vehicles , it noted , hardly use more fuel than current shorter models ; only during acceleration does the additional load make the truck 's engine slightly less efficient .
but another study by the fraunhofer institute for systems and innovative research claimed that while long trucks could relieve roads and the environment in the short term , they would , in the long term , cause a shift from rail to road that would offset any benefits .
" we 're aware of the work the states have done and the results of their tests will flow into a joint working group between the federal and state transportation ministries , " a spokesman from the federal transportation ministry told deutsche welle .
" these tests , however , were on a small scale .
what is needed is a much larger field trial across the entire country to determine the impact on logistics . "
plenty of interest more than 300 companies , including man , have already registered to participate in the federal government 's planned nationwide test , though a final number of participants has yet to be set .
the goal is to test tractor-trailer combinations with a length of 25.25 meters -lrb- 83 feet -rrb- , or 6.5 meters -lrb- 21 feet -rrb- longer than currently allowed .
the gross weight of the vehicles will remain at the current 44 tons for semi-trucks or 44 for " intermodal " container trucks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man has a booth at the iaa commercial vehicles trade show in hanover " we have heard some talk about the planned nationwide field trial testing 60-ton vehicles , " the ministry spokesman said .
" we have no intention to change the weight .
this is all about increasing volume . "
long trucks , the spokesman said , would allow voluminous goods to be transported with one vehicle , for instance , instead of breaking down the item to transport it with three trucks .
critics of heavy and long 60-ton trucks point to a number of problems , such as the damage they could do to roads and bridges because of their added weight and the lack of sufficiently secure guard rails .
yet long trucks also have their critics , too .
" there are a number of issues to be concerned about , " said martin roggermann from the german pro-rail alliance .
" long trucks are more difficult to pass , they need more space for turning at intersections and do n't fit into the current autobahn parking facilities , not too mention safety issues . "
shift from road to rail but roggermann 's biggest bone of contention is that the expected lower operating costs of long trucks could undermine efforts by his organization and others to shift freight off the road and onto rail .
" we are really concerned about the shift from rail to the road , " he said .
" we do n't believe long trucks will result in fewer trucks but in more trucks and in more problems on german roads . "

sejdiu , a 58-year-old former law professor , was elected twice to the presidency - a mainly ceremonial position .
but he remained head of the democratic league of kosovo -lrb- ldk -rrb- - the second largest party and currently the junior partner in prime minister hashim thaci 's government .
the court decision , published on friday , found sejdiu 's dual role to be in " serious violation " of the constitution .
thirty-two members of parliament had filed a legal complaint .
speaking to reporters on monday , sejdiu said he disagreed with the court 's ruling but would respect it .
" over these years i have worked so that the republic of kosovo would have democratic institutions , " he said .
" i was convinced that keeping the function of the president of the democratic league of kosovo without exercising it did not violate the constitution .
the court had a different opinion and i respect the ruling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sejdiu 's ldk party is part of prime minister hasim thaci 's coalition government talks with serbia sejdiu 's resignation comes weeks after serbia , which has not recognized kosovo following its 2008 unilateral declaration of independence , said it would hold direct talks with pristina on practical matters .
belgrade 's refusal to recognize kosovo as an independent country is a major stumbling block to its goal of joining the european union .
meanwhile kosovo was given a major boost by the international court of justice in july , which found its secession from serbia to be in line with international law .
seventy countries currently recognize kosovo 's independence , including the majority of the european union 's 27 member states , as well as the united states .
under a provision in kosovo 's constitution , the speaker of parliament , jakup krasniqi , is to become interim president while parliament has 60 days to appoint a permanent replacement .

consumers will now also have warranty repair services in all eu countries . over the weekend , apple managed to defuse a potential legal tangle with the european union 's antitrust regulators by adjusting its iphone policies .
the company agreed to make warranty repair services equally available throughout european union countries , regardless of where a phone was purchased .
it also agreed to loosen restrictions on programming tools used to develop apps , the small programs designed to run on smartphones .
in doing so , the company avoided fines which could have been as high as 10 percent of its yearly turnover .

" i think it makes good business sense for any company that 's curating its ecosystem to be consistent and clear about what is and is n't allowed , because that level playing field enables firms to decide where to invest their efforts , " he told deutsche welle .
" apple 's challenge is the same challenge many firms have in that the products and the markets which are being created are so new that everyone is working out the rules as we go along . "
the european commission said the changes to apple 's policy towards iphone apps will remove limits to independent developers who sometimes were in competition with apple itself .
mobile warranty for mobile phones according to fogg , warranty repair policies vary in the consumer electronics market , but such policies carry added meaning for mobile products such as smartphones .
" for a mobile phone product , having the ability to have the product repaired wherever that person is is very important , " he said .
" it 's much more important for a mobile phone than it would be for a high-definition television , which is likely to be used in the same country that it 's bought in for all of its life . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de budget -pipe- 27.09.2010 eu and germany push for penalties for deficit offenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excessive budget deficits have hurt the eu 's credibility european union officials are launching an effort to impose sanctions on member states whose budget deficits are out of control , and germany is one of the strongest - and harshest - supporters . the european union needs to penalize members who break the bloc 's rules on borrowing and spending , according to statements made by top eu officials on monday .
speaking to the european parliament 's economic affairs committee , european central bank president jean-claude trichet warned that current oversight on eu states ' budgets is too lax , and called for a board of " wise men and women " to watch over budget discipline .
" what has been lacking is some kind of incentive to manage finances responsibly , " trichet said .
" indeed , a core , absolutely indispensable , element of an effective surveillance mechanism is a functioning mechanism of incentives and sanctions - both financial and non-financial . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet said the eu has been lacking incentives for financial responsibility under the eu 's stability and growth pact , member states must keep their budget deficits within three percent of gross domestic product .
but several member states - most notably greece - have flouted the rules , leading to a decline in the eu 's credibility .
sanctions to be quick and ' semi-automatic ' trichet 's comments support a proposal by european economic commissioner olli rehn to impose " semi-automatic " sanctions against such eu members who break budget rules .
the european commission is to lay out the details of its enforcement plan on wednesday .
reports say rehn would propose fines of 0.2 percent of gdp for countries who repeatedly fail to comply with financial rules .
in addition , countries with slipping competitiveness or whose growth is based on " excessive imbalances " like the credit boom in the baltic states would receive fines of 0.1 percent of gdp .
" sanctions ... need to be triggered early enough in the process so that they are essentially preventive , " rehn said monday .
" this is very important in order to ensure fiscal discipline , and sustainable growth in the eu . "
germany advocates harshness germany , traditionally one of the most fiscally conservative eu members , weighed in on the enforcement plan with finance minister wolfgang schaeuble writing a letter to his counterparts in the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble 's proposals on sanctions are among the strictest " the creation of stronger incentives to prevent and correct excessive government deficits stands at the very core of our endeavors to enforce fiscal and economy governance in the eu , " he wrote .
germany 's proposals have been some of the most draconian in the bloc .
schaeuble also called for the sanctions to affect payments from the eu 's substantial regional development and agricultural funds , and his office is reportedly considering supporting the exclusion of fiscal rule breakers from eu decision making .
meanwhile reports said italy , france and spain - which would all have to make significant reductions to their already-reduced budgets - were likely to oppose the new sanctions .

speaking to the european parliament 's economic affairs committee , european central bank president jean-claude trichet warned that current oversight on eu states ' budgets is too lax , and called for a board of " wise men and women " to watch over budget discipline .
" what has been lacking is some kind of incentive to manage finances responsibly , " trichet said .
" indeed , a core , absolutely indispensable , element of an effective surveillance mechanism is a functioning mechanism of incentives and sanctions - both financial and non-financial . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet said the eu has been lacking incentives for financial responsibility under the eu 's stability and growth pact , member states must keep their budget deficits within three percent of gross domestic product .
but several member states - most notably greece - have flouted the rules , leading to a decline in the eu 's credibility .
sanctions to be quick and ' semi-automatic ' trichet 's comments support a proposal by european economic commissioner olli rehn to impose " semi-automatic " sanctions against such eu members who break budget rules .
the european commission is to lay out the details of its enforcement plan on wednesday .
reports say rehn would propose fines of 0.2 percent of gdp for countries who repeatedly fail to comply with financial rules .
in addition , countries with slipping competitiveness or whose growth is based on " excessive imbalances " like the credit boom in the baltic states would receive fines of 0.1 percent of gdp .
" sanctions ... need to be triggered early enough in the process so that they are essentially preventive , " rehn said monday .
" this is very important in order to ensure fiscal discipline , and sustainable growth in the eu . "
germany advocates harshness germany , traditionally one of the most fiscally conservative eu members , weighed in on the enforcement plan with finance minister wolfgang schaeuble writing a letter to his counterparts in the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble 's proposals on sanctions are among the strictest " the creation of stronger incentives to prevent and correct excessive government deficits stands at the very core of our endeavors to enforce fiscal and economy governance in the eu , " he wrote .
germany 's proposals have been some of the most draconian in the bloc .
schaeuble also called for the sanctions to affect payments from the eu 's substantial regional development and agricultural funds , and his office is reportedly considering supporting the exclusion of fiscal rule breakers from eu decision making .
meanwhile reports said italy , france and spain - which would all have to make significant reductions to their already-reduced budgets - were likely to oppose the new sanctions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : deutsche welle multimedia package : 20 years of reunification gdr dissidents made history - then disappeared into it beaten by reunification , andre hunger gives up east-west couples defy claim that reunited germans remain worlds apart east germany 's doping program casts long shadow over victims german reunification -pipe- 27.09.2010 reunified germany is a nation of many faces and variable success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a site of division , berlin 's brandenburg gate is now a symbol of unity two decades after the cold war , germany has made great progress in overcoming social divisions .
but whether true unity has been achieved depends on whom you ask .
we examine what reunification does and could mean . one important measure of today 's undivided germany is economic , and on this score , as on so many others , the picture is mixed . huge strides have been made in the past twenty years .
just about every eastern german city and town has been thoroughly renovated .
and while income and other economic indices in the east are only 70 to 80 percent of what they are in the west , costs of living - especially for rent - are commensurately lower , so one could argue most eastern germans are n't that much worse off than their western fellow citizens . " silicon saxony " with its computer chips , and the optical industry in and around the city of jena in thuringia , are two examples of eastern industrial success . " i 'm very impressed with how the people in germany 's new states mastered the considerable challenges after 1989 , " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , who helped negotiate the original unification treaty , told deutsche welle .
" i 'm not disappointed at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some high-tech industries have flourished in the east but not everyone 's a winner .
as of july 2010 , unemployment in the east -lrb- 11.5 % -rrb- was nearly double what it was in the west -lrb- 6.6 % -rrb- , and an astonishing 50 percent of the 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 103 billion -rrb- in annual developmental subsidies transferred from west to east is eaten up by social benefits and welfare payments . " unfortunately , economic processes do n't work along the lines of what is just , " richard schroeder - a respected former professor of philosophy and theology at berlin 's humboldt university - said at a major conference earlier this year .
" we have large numbers of people who were n't pillars of the old system but whose situations have gotten a lot worse after the economic caesura . " some 1.6 million people have relocated from east to west since 1990 , most in search of better job opportunities , and that trend shows no sign of letting up .
moreover , sociologists speak of a " brain drain " from the east since it 's the better educated who make up the majority of those who leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty apartment blocks are a common sight in hoyerswerda it 's not uncommon to see unneeded housing units being torn down in eastern cities .
the most extreme example is hoyerswerda near germany 's border with poland and the czech republic , which has lost half of its population in the past decade . in these respects , two different economic subsets continue to exist .
and dissatisfaction with such differences and inequities has manifested itself politically . the rise and fragmentation of the left the incorporation of what germans call the " new states " into the political system of the federal republic has wrought changes few would have anticipated back in 1990 . the current german chancellor , angela merkel , hails from the east , although many germans tend to forget that fact .
and though most eastern germans vote for one of the western parties , others have sought their own alternative . the left party , the successor to the old socialist party in communist east germany , combined with left-wing fringe parties from the west , has established itself as a mouthpiece for disgruntled easterners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi -lrb- right -rrb- and westerner oskar lafontaine led the left party to prominence " reunification had a structural flaw in that the elites of the east were n't accepted , and not just the political elites , but the pedagogical , scientific and artistic elites as well , " left party parliamentary leader gregor gysi told deutsche welle .
" in the beginning , they had no time for my party , but they were rebuffed and forced back to us because the other parties were n't prepared to accept them . " the ironic result is that while the spd and the greens are leery of cooperating with former communists , the political left is bifurcated , helping merkel 's center-right government to hold on to power . the establishment of the left party as a form of peaceful political protest can be seen as evidence of eastern germans ' adoption of western democracy .
but it has also deepened many western germans ' sense of a cultural divide between them and their fellow citizens . ost- and westalgia one unambiguously positive aspect of reunification has been the removal of political barriers that kept many german families painfully separated during the cold war .
there are no exact figures for how many west and east germans had relatives in the " other " germany , but an average of 26 million care packages were sent annually from west to east during germany 's division - an indication of the personal hardships caused by political division . " those who felt imprisoned were overjoyed at an end to their suffering , " says brigitte klump , an author whose private petitions to the united nations over the course of many years helped some 4,000 people leave communist east germany .
" and naturally i still feel joy when i hear from people who succeeded in integrating into the west . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are n't many east-west marriages ostalgia - eastern germans ' supposed longing for the way things were - is a regular topic in the media , but in polls only around ten percent of easterners say they preferred life under socialism .
and eastern germans ' self-identification as a group decreases the later they were born . meanwhile , around half of western germans say the time before 1989 was better than afterward .

but whether true unity has been achieved depends on whom you ask .
we examine what reunification does and could mean . one important measure of today 's undivided germany is economic , and on this score , as on so many others , the picture is mixed . huge strides have been made in the past twenty years .
just about every eastern german city and town has been thoroughly renovated .
and while income and other economic indices in the east are only 70 to 80 percent of what they are in the west , costs of living - especially for rent - are commensurately lower , so one could argue most eastern germans are n't that much worse off than their western fellow citizens .

" i 'm not disappointed at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some high-tech industries have flourished in the east but not everyone 's a winner .
as of july 2010 , unemployment in the east -lrb- 11.5 % -rrb- was nearly double what it was in the west -lrb- 6.6 % -rrb- , and an astonishing 50 percent of the 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 103 billion -rrb- in annual developmental subsidies transferred from west to east is eaten up by social benefits and welfare payments . " unfortunately , economic processes do n't work along the lines of what is just , " richard schroeder - a respected former professor of philosophy and theology at berlin 's humboldt university - said at a major conference earlier this year .
" we have large numbers of people who were n't pillars of the old system but whose situations have gotten a lot worse after the economic caesura . " some 1.6 million people have relocated from east to west since 1990 , most in search of better job opportunities , and that trend shows no sign of letting up .
moreover , sociologists speak of a " brain drain " from the east since it 's the better educated who make up the majority of those who leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty apartment blocks are a common sight in hoyerswerda it 's not uncommon to see unneeded housing units being torn down in eastern cities .
the most extreme example is hoyerswerda near germany 's border with poland and the czech republic , which has lost half of its population in the past decade . in these respects , two different economic subsets continue to exist .
and dissatisfaction with such differences and inequities has manifested itself politically . the rise and fragmentation of the left the incorporation of what germans call the " new states " into the political system of the federal republic has wrought changes few would have anticipated back in 1990 . the current german chancellor , angela merkel , hails from the east , although many germans tend to forget that fact .
and though most eastern germans vote for one of the western parties , others have sought their own alternative . the left party , the successor to the old socialist party in communist east germany , combined with left-wing fringe parties from the west , has established itself as a mouthpiece for disgruntled easterners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi -lrb- right -rrb- and westerner oskar lafontaine led the left party to prominence " reunification had a structural flaw in that the elites of the east were n't accepted , and not just the political elites , but the pedagogical , scientific and artistic elites as well , " left party parliamentary leader gregor gysi told deutsche welle .
" in the beginning , they had no time for my party , but they were rebuffed and forced back to us because the other parties were n't prepared to accept them . " the ironic result is that while the spd and the greens are leery of cooperating with former communists , the political left is bifurcated , helping merkel 's center-right government to hold on to power . the establishment of the left party as a form of peaceful political protest can be seen as evidence of eastern germans ' adoption of western democracy .
but it has also deepened many western germans ' sense of a cultural divide between them and their fellow citizens . ost- and westalgia one unambiguously positive aspect of reunification has been the removal of political barriers that kept many german families painfully separated during the cold war .
there are no exact figures for how many west and east germans had relatives in the " other " germany , but an average of 26 million care packages were sent annually from west to east during germany 's division - an indication of the personal hardships caused by political division . " those who felt imprisoned were overjoyed at an end to their suffering , " says brigitte klump , an author whose private petitions to the united nations over the course of many years helped some 4,000 people leave communist east germany .
" and naturally i still feel joy when i hear from people who succeeded in integrating into the west . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are n't many east-west marriages ostalgia - eastern germans ' supposed longing for the way things were - is a regular topic in the media , but in polls only around ten percent of easterners say they preferred life under socialism .

" the ironic result is that while the spd and the greens are leery of cooperating with former communists , the political left is bifurcated , helping merkel 's center-right government to hold on to power . the establishment of the left party as a form of peaceful political protest can be seen as evidence of eastern germans ' adoption of western democracy .
but it has also deepened many western germans ' sense of a cultural divide between them and their fellow citizens . ost- and westalgia one unambiguously positive aspect of reunification has been the removal of political barriers that kept many german families painfully separated during the cold war .
there are no exact figures for how many west and east germans had relatives in the " other " germany , but an average of 26 million care packages were sent annually from west to east during germany 's division - an indication of the personal hardships caused by political division . " those who felt imprisoned were overjoyed at an end to their suffering , " says brigitte klump , an author whose private petitions to the united nations over the course of many years helped some 4,000 people leave communist east germany .
" and naturally i still feel joy when i hear from people who succeeded in integrating into the west . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are n't many east-west marriages ostalgia - eastern germans ' supposed longing for the way things were - is a regular topic in the media , but in polls only around ten percent of easterners say they preferred life under socialism .
and eastern germans ' self-identification as a group decreases the later they were born . meanwhile , around half of western germans say the time before 1989 was better than afterward .
this reflects their fond memories of a period of affluence and clear social consensus and suggests that " westalgia " is far more prevalent than its eastern equivalent . partnerships between eastern and western germans make up only around four percent of all german marriages .
this may be due to the fact that most germans still stay in the places they grew up and maintain long-term social circles .
but the number of " ossis " and " wessis " tying the knot lags significantly behind that of germans and foreigners . " thanks to reunification , germany as a whole has gotten a lot more diverse , and feelings of togetherness have grown , " wolfgang schaeuble said .
" what we still need is time , patience , including patience with one another , and the experience of having successfully solved problems together . " the global factor one oft-neglected aspect of reunification is the contributions made by residents who do not hold german passports and the effects it had on them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners are also part of the story foreigners account for roughly eight percent of germany 's population , and with the removal of the east-west political divide , german society became much more multicultural , with large communities from eastern europe joining the substantial turkish minority that had established itself in the post-war federal republic . " the german immigrant nation is one of many nationalities , including germans from the old federal republic , others from the former east , millions of ethnic germans from eastern europe as well as an immigrant population of non-german descent , " said germany 's leading immigration expert klaus bade .
" former ' guest workers ' make up the majority , but there are also lots of smaller groups from an ever greater variety of backgrounds . " foreigners have an inestimable impact on today 's german society , and immigration is crucial in offsetting population decline , as both western and eastern germans are having fewer and fewer children . but after a boom immediately following the end of the cold war , the number of foreigners in germany has stagnated .
economists and sociologists see this as a worrisome trend because germany needs to increase its workforce to compensate for the aging population entering retirement . two decades on from 1990 , it is more apparent than ever that " reunification " is not a restoration of a past society , but a process of creating something new that is inextricable from globalization .
old national paradigms are coming under ever increasing challenges , so the future of the new federal republic is likely to be influenced just as much by factors from abroad as from within its own borders . author : jefferson chase editor : kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 27.09.2010 long trucks long for germany 's autobahns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long and even possibly longer : germany considers long trucks with germany 's famed autobahns sometimes looking more like vast truck parking lots than motorways , the government is wondering whether fewer , longer trucks could reduce congestion and emissions .
critics doubt it . one of the hot topics at this year 's iaa commercial vehicles trade show in hanover is the german governent 's nationwide " long truck " field trial planned some time next year .
the trails could lead to new regulations on semi-truck lengths , creating new business opportunities for both makers of long-haul transportation vehicles and logistics companies operating them .
experts say longer trucks could reduce trucking costs by 20 to 25 percent .
" we build long trucks , and the experience of our customers using them in scandinavia , the netherlands and other markets has been good , " detlef hug , a spokesman for german truck maker man , told deutsche welle .
" of course , germany has its own challenges like heavy traffic and hilly terrain .
so that 's why it is a good idea to conduct a nationwide field trial so that we can test fuel and co2 emission reduction , safety , the impact on car drivers and more . "
truck traffic to increase 70 percent there is a sense of political urgency in berlin .
the federal transportation ministry estimates that truck traffic - already choking numerous german highways - will increase by 70 percent over the next 15 years .
and no one knows where all those vehicles should go .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's autobahns look more like a truck parking lot these days three years ago , several german states launched their own field trials – with mixed results .
accompanying studies also painted a blurred picture .
one of the studies , by the technical rwth aachen university , concluded that long trucks are safe and would reduce emissions .
longer vehicles , it noted , hardly use more fuel than current shorter models ; only during acceleration does the additional load make the truck 's engine slightly less efficient .
but another study by the fraunhofer institute for systems and innovative research claimed that while long trucks could relieve roads and the environment in the short term , they would , in the long term , cause a shift from rail to road that would offset any benefits .
" we 're aware of the work the states have done and the results of their tests will flow into a joint working group between the federal and state transportation ministries , " a spokesman from the federal transportation ministry told deutsche welle .
" these tests , however , were on a small scale .
what is needed is a much larger field trial across the entire country to determine the impact on logistics . "
plenty of interest more than 300 companies , including man , have already registered to participate in the federal government 's planned nationwide test , though a final number of participants has yet to be set .
the goal is to test tractor-trailer combinations with a length of 25.25 meters -lrb- 83 feet -rrb- , or 6.5 meters -lrb- 21 feet -rrb- longer than currently allowed .
the gross weight of the vehicles will remain at the current 44 tons for semi-trucks or 44 for " intermodal " container trucks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man has a booth at the iaa commercial vehicles trade show in hanover " we have heard some talk about the planned nationwide field trial testing 60-ton vehicles , " the ministry spokesman said .
" we have no intention to change the weight .
this is all about increasing volume . "
long trucks , the spokesman said , would allow voluminous goods to be transported with one vehicle , for instance , instead of breaking down the item to transport it with three trucks .
critics of heavy and long 60-ton trucks point to a number of problems , such as the damage they could do to roads and bridges because of their added weight and the lack of sufficiently secure guard rails .
yet long trucks also have their critics , too .
" there are a number of issues to be concerned about , " said martin roggermann from the german pro-rail alliance .
" long trucks are more difficult to pass , they need more space for turning at intersections and do n't fit into the current autobahn parking facilities , not too mention safety issues . "
shift from road to rail but roggermann 's biggest bone of contention is that the expected lower operating costs of long trucks could undermine efforts by his organization and others to shift freight off the road and onto rail .
" we are really concerned about the shift from rail to the road , " he said .
" we do n't believe long trucks will result in fewer trucks but in more trucks and in more problems on german roads . "
moreover , roggermann and others worry that if 40-ton long trucks are allowed , it will only be a matter of time before 60-ton " gigaliners " roar down german roads .
scandinavia began with 40-ton vehicles and later allowed the heavier vehicles , he noted .
few experts will disagree that competition for road freight business has become cutthroat in europe , especially since recent eastward european union expansion .
and plenty of them admit that the prospect of allowing larger vehicles to carry more for less will only fuel that competition .

critics doubt it . one of the hot topics at this year 's iaa commercial vehicles trade show in hanover is the german governent 's nationwide " long truck " field trial planned some time next year .
the trails could lead to new regulations on semi-truck lengths , creating new business opportunities for both makers of long-haul transportation vehicles and logistics companies operating them .
experts say longer trucks could reduce trucking costs by 20 to 25 percent .
" we build long trucks , and the experience of our customers using them in scandinavia , the netherlands and other markets has been good , " detlef hug , a spokesman for german truck maker man , told deutsche welle .
" of course , germany has its own challenges like heavy traffic and hilly terrain .
so that 's why it is a good idea to conduct a nationwide field trial so that we can test fuel and co2 emission reduction , safety , the impact on car drivers and more . "

longer vehicles , it noted , hardly use more fuel than current shorter models ; only during acceleration does the additional load make the truck 's engine slightly less efficient .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
iran and middle east share center-stage at the un general assembly should germany be awarded a seat on the un security council ?
my opinion is that germany deserves the seat because this country is a big democratic , economic and political player in the world . - leon , us absolutely !
it is long-overdue .
if germany is " good enough " to be used as the sixth country in the stand-off with iran , it clearly deserves to be permanently seated on the security council .
moreover , the very fact that germany pays the third highest dues to the operation of the un can be argument for giving it a more influential voice .
time to leave world war ii behind ! - r.e. , us german foreign minister pushes for seat on security council absolutely , it is high time that germany is given a seat at the un security council .
the same applies for japan , india and brazil .
hopefully , when this becomes a reality , the un may become more productive in solving the world 's problems . - loyola , us i 'm not sure who i would like to receive the temporary seat on the un security council .
it either has to be canada or germany .
if only we could just change our leaders to someone a bit more liberal in their political thinking .
oh well , can not have everything . - cynthia , canada prominent german feminist weighs in loudly on headscarf debate women deserve freedom .
it breaks my heart to see oppression in germany against women .
we women are the other half in society . - blue , us all kind of religious signs including christian cross , jewish side curls , and the headscarf should be banned out of the public domain . - lutz , germany french senate approves burqa ban as far as i 'm concerned there is no government on earth that has the right to tell any person what they can or can not wear at any given time .
i also firmly believe that there is no place in politics for anything resembling religion .
as far as i 'm concerned this law infringes on people 's basic human rights to wear whatever they want .
religion belongs where it lies .
it does not belong in policy making and law enforcement .
there is no place for religion in government it is a spiritual matter which is unique to individuals . - saaly , australia compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de iran and middle east share center-stage at the un general assembly european and us delegations have walked out of the un general assembly in protest during a speech by the iranian president .

-lrb- 25.09.2010 -rrb- prominent german feminist weighs in loudly on headscarf debate germany 's best known and most outspoken feminist has called for a ban on headscarves for girls in german schools .
her new book , a plea for integration over islamism , is likely to stir controversy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.09.2010 what now for britain 's labour party ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ed miliband must now distance himself from his own kingmakers labour 's new party chief ed miliband has declared an end to the era of ' new labour . '
but where now for the party that lost four million voters between 1997 and 2010 ?
and can miliband win the support of the middle class ? two days into his leadership , ed miliband proclaimed a new era for britain 's opposition labour party .
during a labour party conference in manchester , the new leader declared an end to the centrist " new labour " movement rung in by former prime minister tony blair .
" new labour was right for its time ... but it came to be associated with a particular style and nature of politics , " the former energy minister told his party .
miliband - dubbed by his conservative opponents as " red ed " -wanted to signal that labour had " cut itself off from its blairite past , that it 's a new start for the labour party , " according to tony travers , director of the london school of economics ' lse research center .
an end to the fraternal ' soap opera ' ed miliband won the party leadership on saturday after a five-month , neck-and-neck contest against his brother , the former foreign secretary david miliband , five years his senior . david miliband threw his full support behind his victorious younger brother and urged labour delegates in manchester to end their " soap-opera " politics .
speculation flew on monday at labour 's manchester conference as to what role david miliband would take within the party , a question with which the older of the two brothers appeared to be grappling himself .
bildunterschrift : while david miliband 's future remains unclear , his full support is behind his brother the brother to the left although many see the two brothers as politically identical , ed miliband 's campaign platform leaned further left than his brother 's , appealing to labour 's traditional working-class supporters .
ed miliband 's less-than-two-percent victory over his brother came on the back of support from labor union members , while david miliband garnered support from parliament and more middle-class party members .
ed miliband has aligned himself with the working class , supporting so-called " living wage " pay , as an increase to minimum-wage pay .
he favors a " graduation tax , " as well , which would see tax money from well-earning university graduates supporting britain 's universities .
" he 's also talked about a commission that should look at high earnings , " said thomas kielinger , london correspondent for the german national newspaper die welt . " he 's toying with the idea of leveling off the huge differences in earnings that you find in britain . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former foreign secretary david miliband had been the frontrunner between a rock and a hard place ed miliband succeeds gordon brown as chief of labour at a rocky time in the party 's history .
in may , after 13 years in government , labour lost britain 's general election with only 29 percent of the vote .
according to kielinger , four million voters left labour between 1997 and 2010 . in order to broaden his base , miliband now faces the challenge of distancing himself from his unionist kingmakers without alienating their support .
" whoever wants to come to power can not afford to be merely left-wing , left-leaning with all these goodie-goodie subjects that people of lesser income would demand .
he must be very careful he speaks to the middle ground , " kielinger said .
ed miliband was aware of this fact when he said in a bbc television interview that his leadership would not be " about some lurch to the left . "
" i am for the center-ground of politics , but it is about defining where the center ground is , " labour 's new chief said .
upcoming austerity measures in the days between october 4 and 7 , labour 's parliamentary party is to present miliband its choices for his shadow cabinet .
miliband must then assign posts to the elected cabinet members by october 10 - just 10 days before conservative prime minister david cameron 's coalition government releases its spending review .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rivalry between brown and blair dominated ' new labour ' recent opinion polls show that the british public understands the need for austerity measures .
miliband has indicated that he is ready to accept some of the cuts while oposing others .
and yet to challenge cameron 's coalition government , miliband must convince the british public his nickname " red ed " is false - and that despite his family history : the milibands ' father , ralph , was one of the leading marxist theorists of his generation .

speaking to the european parliament 's economic affairs committee , european central bank president jean-claude trichet warned that current oversight on eu states ' budgets is too lax , and called for a board of " wise men and women " to watch over budget discipline .
" what has been lacking is some kind of incentive to manage finances responsibly , " trichet said .
" indeed , a core , absolutely indispensable , element of an effective surveillance mechanism is a functioning mechanism of incentives and sanctions - both financial and non-financial . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet said the eu has been lacking incentives for financial responsibility under the eu 's stability and growth pact , member states must keep their budget deficits within three percent of gross domestic product .
but several member states - most notably greece - have flouted the rules , leading to a decline in the eu 's credibility .
sanctions to be quick and ' semi-automatic ' trichet 's comments support a proposal by european economic commissioner olli rehn to impose " semi-automatic " sanctions against such eu members who break budget rules .
the european commission is to lay out the details of its enforcement plan on wednesday .
reports say rehn would propose fines of 0.2 percent of gdp for countries who repeatedly fail to comply with financial rules .
in addition , countries with slipping competitiveness or whose growth is based on " excessive imbalances " like the credit boom in the baltic states would receive fines of 0.1 percent of gdp .
" sanctions ... need to be triggered early enough in the process so that they are essentially preventive , " rehn said monday .
" this is very important in order to ensure fiscal discipline , and sustainable growth in the eu . "
germany advocates harshness germany , traditionally one of the most fiscally conservative eu members , weighed in on the enforcement plan with finance minister wolfgang schaeuble writing a letter to his counterparts in the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble 's proposals on sanctions are among the strictest " the creation of stronger incentives to prevent and correct excessive government deficits stands at the very core of our endeavors to enforce fiscal and economy governance in the eu , " he wrote .
germany 's proposals have been some of the most draconian in the bloc .
schaeuble also called for the sanctions to affect payments from the eu 's substantial regional development and agricultural funds , and his office is reportedly considering supporting the exclusion of fiscal rule breakers from eu decision making .
meanwhile reports said italy , france and spain - which would all have to make significant reductions to their already-reduced budgets - were likely to oppose the new sanctions .

speaking to the european parliament 's economic affairs committee , european central bank president jean-claude trichet warned that current oversight on eu states ' budgets is too lax , and called for a board of " wise men and women " to watch over budget discipline .
" what has been lacking is some kind of incentive to manage finances responsibly , " trichet said .
" indeed , a core , absolutely indispensable , element of an effective surveillance mechanism is a functioning mechanism of incentives and sanctions - both financial and non-financial . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet said the eu has been lacking incentives for financial responsibility under the eu 's stability and growth pact , member states must keep their budget deficits within three percent of gross domestic product .
but several member states - most notably greece - have flouted the rules , leading to a decline in the eu 's credibility .
sanctions to be quick and ' semi-automatic ' trichet 's comments support a proposal by european economic commissioner olli rehn to impose " semi-automatic " sanctions against such eu members who break budget rules .
the european commission is to lay out the details of its enforcement plan on wednesday .
reports say rehn would propose fines of 0.2 percent of gdp for countries who repeatedly fail to comply with financial rules .
in addition , countries with slipping competitiveness or whose growth is based on " excessive imbalances " like the credit boom in the baltic states would receive fines of 0.1 percent of gdp .
" sanctions ... need to be triggered early enough in the process so that they are essentially preventive , " rehn said monday .
" this is very important in order to ensure fiscal discipline , and sustainable growth in the eu . "
germany advocates harshness germany , traditionally one of the most fiscally conservative eu members , weighed in on the enforcement plan with finance minister wolfgang schaeuble writing a letter to his counterparts in the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble 's proposals on sanctions are among the strictest " the creation of stronger incentives to prevent and correct excessive government deficits stands at the very core of our endeavors to enforce fiscal and economy governance in the eu , " he wrote .
germany 's proposals have been some of the most draconian in the bloc .
schaeuble also called for the sanctions to affect payments from the eu 's substantial regional development and agricultural funds , and his office is reportedly considering supporting the exclusion of fiscal rule breakers from eu decision making .
meanwhile reports said italy , france and spain - which would all have to make significant reductions to their already-reduced budgets - were likely to oppose the new sanctions .

'
but where now for the party that lost four million voters between 1997 and 2010 ?
and can miliband win the support of the middle class ? two days into his leadership , ed miliband proclaimed a new era for britain 's opposition labour party .
during a labour party conference in manchester , the new leader declared an end to the centrist " new labour " movement rung in by former prime minister tony blair .
" new labour was right for its time ... but it came to be associated with a particular style and nature of politics , " the former energy minister told his party .
miliband - dubbed by his conservative opponents as " red ed " -wanted to signal that labour had " cut itself off from its blairite past , that it 's a new start for the labour party , " according to tony travers , director of the london school of economics ' lse research center .
an end to the fraternal ' soap opera ' ed miliband won the party leadership on saturday after a five-month , neck-and-neck contest against his brother , the former foreign secretary david miliband , five years his senior . david miliband threw his full support behind his victorious younger brother and urged labour delegates in manchester to end their " soap-opera " politics .
speculation flew on monday at labour 's manchester conference as to what role david miliband would take within the party , a question with which the older of the two brothers appeared to be grappling himself .
bildunterschrift : while david miliband 's future remains unclear , his full support is behind his brother the brother to the left although many see the two brothers as politically identical , ed miliband 's campaign platform leaned further left than his brother 's , appealing to labour 's traditional working-class supporters .
ed miliband 's less-than-two-percent victory over his brother came on the back of support from labor union members , while david miliband garnered support from parliament and more middle-class party members .
ed miliband has aligned himself with the working class , supporting so-called " living wage " pay , as an increase to minimum-wage pay .
he favors a " graduation tax , " as well , which would see tax money from well-earning university graduates supporting britain 's universities .
" he 's also talked about a commission that should look at high earnings , " said thomas kielinger , london correspondent for the german national newspaper die welt . " he 's toying with the idea of leveling off the huge differences in earnings that you find in britain . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former foreign secretary david miliband had been the frontrunner between a rock and a hard place ed miliband succeeds gordon brown as chief of labour at a rocky time in the party 's history .
in may , after 13 years in government , labour lost britain 's general election with only 29 percent of the vote .
according to kielinger , four million voters left labour between 1997 and 2010 . in order to broaden his base , miliband now faces the challenge of distancing himself from his unionist kingmakers without alienating their support .
" whoever wants to come to power can not afford to be merely left-wing , left-leaning with all these goodie-goodie subjects that people of lesser income would demand .
he must be very careful he speaks to the middle ground , " kielinger said .
ed miliband was aware of this fact when he said in a bbc television interview that his leadership would not be " about some lurch to the left . "
" i am for the center-ground of politics , but it is about defining where the center ground is , " labour 's new chief said .
upcoming austerity measures in the days between october 4 and 7 , labour 's parliamentary party is to present miliband its choices for his shadow cabinet .
miliband must then assign posts to the elected cabinet members by october 10 - just 10 days before conservative prime minister david cameron 's coalition government releases its spending review .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rivalry between brown and blair dominated ' new labour ' recent opinion polls show that the british public understands the need for austerity measures .
miliband has indicated that he is ready to accept some of the cuts while oposing others .
and yet to challenge cameron 's coalition government , miliband must convince the british public his nickname " red ed " is false - and that despite his family history : the milibands ' father , ralph , was one of the leading marxist theorists of his generation .

in fact , most of pailin ’ s residents have a strong connection to the khmer rouge movement that devastated this country in the 1970s .
the un-backed tribunal , which is based in phnom penh some 400 kilometers by road from here , says the khmer rouge movement is responsible for 2.2 million deaths from execution , starvation , overwork and illness during the movement ’ s rule of cambodia between 1975 and 1979 .
indicting the surviving leaders is one way of trying to punish some of those believed responsible for what happened . pol pot blamed for the crimes unsurprisingly , the tribunal is not popular in places like pailin .
some people claim that pol pot , the khmer rouge ’ s former leader who died in 1998 , was solely responsible for the crimes the movement committed .
this was a message repeated by mey mak , a deputy governor of pailin , and a former secretary for pol pot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cheung ek genocidal center in pnomh penh in the provincial town hall , mey mak sat at a table along with several of the tribunal ’ s senior staff , including international prosecutor andrew cayley .
facing them sitting on plastic chairs spruced up with silk and cotton coverings sat a crowd of 250 people : monks , nuns , police and soldiers , as well as residents of the province who had been invited to hear the court ’ s message .
most of them were former khmer rouge , and many knew the four people indicted , including the movement ’ s chief ideologue nuon chea , also known as brother number two .
the other three were the former head of state khieu samphan , former foreign minister ieng sary and his wife , the former social affairs minister ieng thirith .
mey mak told the audience that pol pot , who died in 1998 , was to blame .
" so it seems to me that the court has indicted the wrong people , " he explained .
" the hands of these four were not stained with blood .
khieu samphan was responsible for the economy .
ieng sary was foreign minister , which meant he simply travelled in and out of cambodia .
and like them , ieng thirith , the social affairs minister , was under the power of pol pot and could do nothing to influence what happened . "
trial will determine extent of individual responsibility this is not an argument that most cambodians would support .
as court spokesman lars olsen said afterwards , it is something that will be decided at their trial , which is slated to start next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chum mey , a victim of the khmer rouge , was angry when a lenient sentence was handed down to kaing gek eav , alias duch , former s-21 prison commander , in july the trial will try to find out to what extent the four are individually responsible for the crimes committed by the khmer rouge , olsen explained .
after hearing testimonies and evidence , the judges will determine whether all or some of these four indicted persons indeed bear individual criminal responsibility or whether this lies with someone else .
the international prosecutor andrew cayley told those attending that heaping blame for mass crimes on the heads of dead leaders was common enough at other tribunals , and was something he anticipated would form part of the defense . 10 tried for deaths of so many so much for the leaders .
perhaps more importantly , a number of those who attended the meeting in pailin wanted to know how many people the court was looking to prosecute in total .
cayley told them that the case of duch , the former head of the khmer rouge ’ s torture and execution centre known as s-21 , was the first .
he was jailed in july for 30 years after being found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
the four indicted this month comprise the next case and another five are currently under investigation .
" those five may or may not go to trial , depending on the work of the investigating judges and what they find .
so with those 10 , that is it , " cayley said .
this message might have gone down well in pailin but it is less likely to be welcomed outside of the former khmer rouge strongholds , as most cambodians can not understand how such a small number of people is going to end up being tried for the deaths of so many people .
hun sen opposes trials in fact , it is unclear whether even the final five will be prosecuted .
many here believe that the outright opposition to their trials expressed by cambodian prime minister hun sen has effectively ruined the chances of cambodian staff working on their investigations .
for now , only duch has been convicted .
the four elderly leaders will stand trial next year , although it is unlikely that all of them will survive a lengthy trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many cambodians attended the hearings at the un-backed tribunal on the positive side , most of the ex-khmer rouge who came to the court ’ s pailin meeting wanted a copy of the duch verdict , and just as many were keen to visit the court and see it in action .
" they are at least interested in learning more , and that ’ s good , " said court spokesman lars olsen .
" so the fact that they are skeptical about our work , that ’ s ok .
they are skeptical but they want to learn – they are curious , and that ’ s a good starting point . "

most of them were former khmer rouge , and many knew the four people indicted , including the movement ’ s chief ideologue nuon chea , also known as brother number two .
the other three were the former head of state khieu samphan , former foreign minister ieng sary and his wife , the former social affairs minister ieng thirith .
mey mak told the audience that pol pot , who died in 1998 , was to blame .
" so it seems to me that the court has indicted the wrong people , " he explained .
" the hands of these four were not stained with blood .
khieu samphan was responsible for the economy .
ieng sary was foreign minister , which meant he simply travelled in and out of cambodia .
and like them , ieng thirith , the social affairs minister , was under the power of pol pot and could do nothing to influence what happened . "
trial will determine extent of individual responsibility this is not an argument that most cambodians would support .
as court spokesman lars olsen said afterwards , it is something that will be decided at their trial , which is slated to start next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chum mey , a victim of the khmer rouge , was angry when a lenient sentence was handed down to kaing gek eav , alias duch , former s-21 prison commander , in july the trial will try to find out to what extent the four are individually responsible for the crimes committed by the khmer rouge , olsen explained .
after hearing testimonies and evidence , the judges will determine whether all or some of these four indicted persons indeed bear individual criminal responsibility or whether this lies with someone else .
the international prosecutor andrew cayley told those attending that heaping blame for mass crimes on the heads of dead leaders was common enough at other tribunals , and was something he anticipated would form part of the defense . 10 tried for deaths of so many so much for the leaders .
perhaps more importantly , a number of those who attended the meeting in pailin wanted to know how many people the court was looking to prosecute in total .
cayley told them that the case of duch , the former head of the khmer rouge ’ s torture and execution centre known as s-21 , was the first .
he was jailed in july for 30 years after being found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
the four indicted this month comprise the next case and another five are currently under investigation .
" those five may or may not go to trial , depending on the work of the investigating judges and what they find .
so with those 10 , that is it , " cayley said .
this message might have gone down well in pailin but it is less likely to be welcomed outside of the former khmer rouge strongholds , as most cambodians can not understand how such a small number of people is going to end up being tried for the deaths of so many people .
hun sen opposes trials in fact , it is unclear whether even the final five will be prosecuted .
many here believe that the outright opposition to their trials expressed by cambodian prime minister hun sen has effectively ruined the chances of cambodian staff working on their investigations .
for now , only duch has been convicted .
the four elderly leaders will stand trial next year , although it is unlikely that all of them will survive a lengthy trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many cambodians attended the hearings at the un-backed tribunal on the positive side , most of the ex-khmer rouge who came to the court ’ s pailin meeting wanted a copy of the duch verdict , and just as many were keen to visit the court and see it in action .
" they are at least interested in learning more , and that ’ s good , " said court spokesman lars olsen .
" so the fact that they are skeptical about our work , that ’ s ok .
they are skeptical but they want to learn – they are curious , and that ’ s a good starting point . "

in fact , most of pailin ’ s residents have a strong connection to the khmer rouge movement that devastated this country in the 1970s .
the un-backed tribunal , which is based in phnom penh some 400 kilometers by road from here , says the khmer rouge movement is responsible for 2.2 million deaths from execution , starvation , overwork and illness during the movement ’ s rule of cambodia between 1975 and 1979 .
indicting the surviving leaders is one way of trying to punish some of those believed responsible for what happened . pol pot blamed for the crimes unsurprisingly , the tribunal is not popular in places like pailin .
some people claim that pol pot , the khmer rouge ’ s former leader who died in 1998 , was solely responsible for the crimes the movement committed .
this was a message repeated by mey mak , a deputy governor of pailin , and a former secretary for pol pot .

not a month after israeli-palestinian peace talks resumed , their future is in jeopardy . palestinian president mahmoud abbas delayed a decision on withdrawing from direct peace talks with israel on monday as france voiced strong support for the palestinian position .
after meeting with abbas in paris , french president nicolas sarkozy told reporters that france regretted that israel had not listened to " unanimous calls " to extend a 10-month freeze on israeli settlement construction in the west bank .
the settlement freeze " should have been extended to give negotiations a chance , " sarkozy said .
" i say this in front of president abbas : settlement must stop . "
european union weighs in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu disappointed world leaders by not extending the settlement freeze catherine ashton , the european union 's foreign policy chief , expressed similar feelings in a statement given by her spokeswoman , maja kocijancic . " the position of the eu is very clear : settlements are illegal under international law , constitute an obstacle to peace and threaten to make a two-state solution impossible , " kocijancic told german news agency dpa . the united states also expressed disappointment that the settlement freeze had not been extended and announced that its middle east envoy george mitchell was on his way to the region to restart negotiations . the eu and the united states make up half of the middle east quartet charged with pursuing a peace solution .
the other members of the quartet are russia and the united nations .
settlements continue to expand bulldozers in at least two west bank settlements resumed work early on monday just hours after the moratorium expired .
the palestinian leadership had repeatedly threatened to pull out of direct peace talks with israel if the settlements continued to expand .
but abbas said there would be no official palestinian answer to the construction resumption until after a meeting with top arab diplomats on october 4 .
" after all these meetings we may be able to issue a position to clarify what is the palestinian and arab opinion on this matter , after israel has refused to freeze settlements , " he said .
" we will not have swift reactions now . "
sarkozy also invited abbas , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and egyptian president hosni mubarak to meet in paris before the end of october .
bildunterschrift : abbas and sarkouy urged israel to extend its settlement freeze peace talks on the line the settlement construction threatened to end the first direct negotiations since 2008 between israel and the palestinians , which began in washington nearly four weeks ago .
netanyahu said in a statement shortly before the construction freeze expired that israel was " ready to pursue continuous contacts in the coming days to find a way to continue peace talks . "
the united states also said its position that the settlement freeze should continue had not changed .
state department spokesman p.j. crowley said the us is " in close touch with both parties and will be meeting with them again in the coming days . "
from the palestinian point of view , israeli settlements in the west bank are a major barrier to the peace process .
palestinian leaders say the settlements will make the creation of a viable independent state impossible .
most of the international community considers israeli settlements in the west bank to be in violation of international law , but israel insists they are legitimate .

not a month after israeli-palestinian peace talks resumed , their future is in jeopardy . palestinian president mahmoud abbas delayed a decision on withdrawing from direct peace talks with israel on monday as france voiced strong support for the palestinian position .
after meeting with abbas in paris , french president nicolas sarkozy told reporters that france regretted that israel had not listened to " unanimous calls " to extend a 10-month freeze on israeli settlement construction in the west bank .
the settlement freeze " should have been extended to give negotiations a chance , " sarkozy said .

" the position of the eu is very clear : settlements are illegal under international law , constitute an obstacle to peace and threaten to make a two-state solution impossible , " kocijancic told german news agency dpa . the united states also expressed disappointment that the settlement freeze had not been extended and announced that its middle east envoy george mitchell was on his way to the region to restart negotiations . the eu and the united states make up half of the middle east quartet charged with pursuing a peace solution .
the other members of the quartet are russia and the united nations .
settlements continue to expand bulldozers in at least two west bank settlements resumed work early on monday just hours after the moratorium expired .
the palestinian leadership had repeatedly threatened to pull out of direct peace talks with israel if the settlements continued to expand .
but abbas said there would be no official palestinian answer to the construction resumption until after a meeting with top arab diplomats on october 4 .
" after all these meetings we may be able to issue a position to clarify what is the palestinian and arab opinion on this matter , after israel has refused to freeze settlements , " he said .
" we will not have swift reactions now . "

the united states also said its position that the settlement freeze should continue had not changed .

from the palestinian point of view , israeli settlements in the west bank are a major barrier to the peace process .

most of the international community considers israeli settlements in the west bank to be in violation of international law , but israel insists they are legitimate .

sejdiu , a 58-year-old former law professor , was elected twice to the presidency - a mainly ceremonial position .
but he remained head of the democratic league of kosovo -lrb- ldk -rrb- - the second largest party and currently the junior partner in prime minister hashim thaci 's government .
the court decision , published on friday , found sejdiu 's dual role to be in " serious violation " of the constitution .
thirty-two members of parliament had filed a legal complaint .
speaking to reporters on monday , sejdiu said he disagreed with the court 's ruling but would respect it .
" over these years i have worked so that the republic of kosovo would have democratic institutions , " he said .
" i was convinced that keeping the function of the president of the democratic league of kosovo without exercising it did not violate the constitution .
the court had a different opinion and i respect the ruling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sejdiu 's ldk party is part of prime minister hasim thaci 's coalition government talks with serbia sejdiu 's resignation comes weeks after serbia , which has not recognized kosovo following its 2008 unilateral declaration of independence , said it would hold direct talks with pristina on practical matters .
belgrade 's refusal to recognize kosovo as an independent country is a major stumbling block to its goal of joining the european union .
meanwhile kosovo was given a major boost by the international court of justice in july , which found its secession from serbia to be in line with international law .
seventy countries currently recognize kosovo 's independence , including the majority of the european union 's 27 member states , as well as the united states .
under a provision in kosovo 's constitution , the speaker of parliament , jakup krasniqi , is to become interim president while parliament has 60 days to appoint a permanent replacement .

'
but where now for the party that lost four million voters between 1997 and 2010 ?
and can miliband win the support of the middle class ? two days into his leadership , ed miliband proclaimed a new era for britain 's opposition labour party .
during a labour party conference in manchester , the new leader declared an end to the centrist " new labour " movement rung in by former prime minister tony blair .
" new labour was right for its time ... but it came to be associated with a particular style and nature of politics , " the former energy minister told his party .
miliband - dubbed by his conservative opponents as " red ed " -wanted to signal that labour had " cut itself off from its blairite past , that it 's a new start for the labour party , " according to tony travers , director of the london school of economics ' lse research center .
an end to the fraternal ' soap opera ' ed miliband won the party leadership on saturday after a five-month , neck-and-neck contest against his brother , the former foreign secretary david miliband , five years his senior . david miliband threw his full support behind his victorious younger brother and urged labour delegates in manchester to end their " soap-opera " politics .
speculation flew on monday at labour 's manchester conference as to what role david miliband would take within the party , a question with which the older of the two brothers appeared to be grappling himself .
bildunterschrift : while david miliband 's future remains unclear , his full support is behind his brother the brother to the left although many see the two brothers as politically identical , ed miliband 's campaign platform leaned further left than his brother 's , appealing to labour 's traditional working-class supporters .
ed miliband 's less-than-two-percent victory over his brother came on the back of support from labor union members , while david miliband garnered support from parliament and more middle-class party members .
ed miliband has aligned himself with the working class , supporting so-called " living wage " pay , as an increase to minimum-wage pay .
he favors a " graduation tax , " as well , which would see tax money from well-earning university graduates supporting britain 's universities .
" he 's also talked about a commission that should look at high earnings , " said thomas kielinger , london correspondent for the german national newspaper die welt . " he 's toying with the idea of leveling off the huge differences in earnings that you find in britain . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former foreign secretary david miliband had been the frontrunner between a rock and a hard place ed miliband succeeds gordon brown as chief of labour at a rocky time in the party 's history .
in may , after 13 years in government , labour lost britain 's general election with only 29 percent of the vote .
according to kielinger , four million voters left labour between 1997 and 2010 . in order to broaden his base , miliband now faces the challenge of distancing himself from his unionist kingmakers without alienating their support .
" whoever wants to come to power can not afford to be merely left-wing , left-leaning with all these goodie-goodie subjects that people of lesser income would demand .
he must be very careful he speaks to the middle ground , " kielinger said .
ed miliband was aware of this fact when he said in a bbc television interview that his leadership would not be " about some lurch to the left . "
" i am for the center-ground of politics , but it is about defining where the center ground is , " labour 's new chief said .
upcoming austerity measures in the days between october 4 and 7 , labour 's parliamentary party is to present miliband its choices for his shadow cabinet .
miliband must then assign posts to the elected cabinet members by october 10 - just 10 days before conservative prime minister david cameron 's coalition government releases its spending review .

miliband has indicated that he is ready to accept some of the cuts while oposing others .
and yet to challenge cameron 's coalition government , miliband must convince the british public his nickname " red ed " is false - and that despite his family history : the milibands ' father , ralph , was one of the leading marxist theorists of his generation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reforms -pipe- 27.09.2010 opposition unleashes broadside at hartz iv benefit increase großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is trying to make a new start after eight months of agonizing , the reform of germany 's unemployment benefit known as hartz iv has boiled down to an increase of five euros a month .
the social democratic party has seized the chance to express outrage . when germany 's constitutional court ruled in february that the regulations on germany 's unemployment benefit system needed to be reformed , most assumed this would mean the regular allowance would be increased .
the system , known colloquially as hartz iv , has been a source of tension in germany ever since its introduction five years ago , and this year 's court ruling seemed to confirm critics ' opinions that it did not provide an adequate living .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the labor minister was at pains to explain the details of the reform but after extensive agonizing over an already strapped budget , chancellor angela merkel 's government has settled on an increase of five euros -lrb- $ 6.70 -rrb- - from 359 euros a month to 364 euros . labor minister ursula von der leyen defended the meager increase on the grounds that the court 's ruling had only specified that the calculations needed to be made more transparently .
re-interpreting the court ruling " the constitutional court said firstly that statistical model - the income and consumption data on which our calculations are made - is fine , the minister said at a press conference on monday .
" secondly , the court said that the standard rates are not too low , but you have to calculate them cleanly , transparently , and on an empirical basis . "
the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was quick to express its outrage .
the center-left party is currently in the midst of a key conference in berlin .
following last year 's disastrous election for the spd , and the distinctly depressing opinion poll ratings since then , it is casting about for chances to present a revitalized agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nahles ridiculed the five-euro increase in hartz iv thus the spd seized on monday 's timely opportunity to draw a clear line between itself and merkel 's government .
the spd 's general secretary , andrea nahles , was particularly unforgiving .
" five euros is a joke , to be honest , " she said at the party conference .
" you can only arrive at that figure if you have massively manipulated the requirements outlined by the constitutional court . "
hypocrisy ?
the government , led by merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , has been quick to point out that this criticism is odd , given that the spd introduced the current benefit system under then-chancellor gerhard schroeder in 2005 . " the spd and green party 's criticism of the moderate increase in the hartz iv allowance is dishonest , " said hermann groehe , the cdu 's general secretary .
" let 's not forget that the current rates are a spd - green party decision , and the spd always defended them as sufficient as long as they were in government . "
but the uproar that the minimal benefit increase has sparked is unlikely to go away , and is equally unlikely to win the government many new voters .
and an extra five euros a month does n't seem like a sum that stands to significantly improve the lot of the five million people currently living on the hartz iv benefit .
but the government 's new 620-million-euro education package , announced simultaneously , does aim to address a perhaps more pressing concern - the well-being of the children of germany 's unemployed .

the social democratic party has seized the chance to express outrage . when germany 's constitutional court ruled in february that the regulations on germany 's unemployment benefit system needed to be reformed , most assumed this would mean the regular allowance would be increased .
the system , known colloquially as hartz iv , has been a source of tension in germany ever since its introduction five years ago , and this year 's court ruling seemed to confirm critics ' opinions that it did not provide an adequate living .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the labor minister was at pains to explain the details of the reform but after extensive agonizing over an already strapped budget , chancellor angela merkel 's government has settled on an increase of five euros -lrb- $ 6.70 -rrb- - from 359 euros a month to 364 euros . labor minister ursula von der leyen defended the meager increase on the grounds that the court 's ruling had only specified that the calculations needed to be made more transparently .
re-interpreting the court ruling " the constitutional court said firstly that statistical model - the income and consumption data on which our calculations are made - is fine , the minister said at a press conference on monday .
" secondly , the court said that the standard rates are not too low , but you have to calculate them cleanly , transparently , and on an empirical basis . "
the opposition social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was quick to express its outrage .
the center-left party is currently in the midst of a key conference in berlin .
following last year 's disastrous election for the spd , and the distinctly depressing opinion poll ratings since then , it is casting about for chances to present a revitalized agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nahles ridiculed the five-euro increase in hartz iv thus the spd seized on monday 's timely opportunity to draw a clear line between itself and merkel 's government .
the spd 's general secretary , andrea nahles , was particularly unforgiving .
" five euros is a joke , to be honest , " she said at the party conference .
" you can only arrive at that figure if you have massively manipulated the requirements outlined by the constitutional court . "
hypocrisy ?
the government , led by merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , has been quick to point out that this criticism is odd , given that the spd introduced the current benefit system under then-chancellor gerhard schroeder in 2005 . " the spd and green party 's criticism of the moderate increase in the hartz iv allowance is dishonest , " said hermann groehe , the cdu 's general secretary .
" let 's not forget that the current rates are a spd - green party decision , and the spd always defended them as sufficient as long as they were in government . "
but the uproar that the minimal benefit increase has sparked is unlikely to go away , and is equally unlikely to win the government many new voters .
and an extra five euros a month does n't seem like a sum that stands to significantly improve the lot of the five million people currently living on the hartz iv benefit .
but the government 's new 620-million-euro education package , announced simultaneously , does aim to address a perhaps more pressing concern - the well-being of the children of germany 's unemployed .

'
but where now for the party that lost four million voters between 1997 and 2010 ?
and can miliband win the support of the middle class ? two days into his leadership , ed miliband proclaimed a new era for britain 's opposition labour party .
during a labour party conference in manchester , the new leader declared an end to the centrist " new labour " movement rung in by former prime minister tony blair .
" new labour was right for its time ... but it came to be associated with a particular style and nature of politics , " the former energy minister told his party .
miliband - dubbed by his conservative opponents as " red ed " -wanted to signal that labour had " cut itself off from its blairite past , that it 's a new start for the labour party , " according to tony travers , director of the london school of economics ' lse research center .

according to kielinger , four million voters left labour between 1997 and 2010 . in order to broaden his base , miliband now faces the challenge of distancing himself from his unionist kingmakers without alienating their support .
" whoever wants to come to power can not afford to be merely left-wing , left-leaning with all these goodie-goodie subjects that people of lesser income would demand .
he must be very careful he speaks to the middle ground , " kielinger said .

the social democratic party has seized the chance to express outrage . when germany 's constitutional court ruled in february that the regulations on germany 's unemployment benefit system needed to be reformed , most assumed this would mean the regular allowance would be increased .
the system , known colloquially as hartz iv , has been a source of tension in germany ever since its introduction five years ago , and this year 's court ruling seemed to confirm critics ' opinions that it did not provide an adequate living .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the labor minister was at pains to explain the details of the reform but after extensive agonizing over an already strapped budget , chancellor angela merkel 's government has settled on an increase of five euros -lrb- $ 6.70 -rrb- - from 359 euros a month to 364 euros . labor minister ursula von der leyen defended the meager increase on the grounds that the court 's ruling had only specified that the calculations needed to be made more transparently .

the social democratic party has seized the chance to express outrage . when germany 's constitutional court ruled in february that the regulations on germany 's unemployment benefit system needed to be reformed , most assumed this would mean the regular allowance would be increased .
the system , known colloquially as hartz iv , has been a source of tension in germany ever since its introduction five years ago , and this year 's court ruling seemed to confirm critics ' opinions that it did not provide an adequate living .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the labor minister was at pains to explain the details of the reform but after extensive agonizing over an already strapped budget , chancellor angela merkel 's government has settled on an increase of five euros -lrb- $ 6.70 -rrb- - from 359 euros a month to 364 euros . labor minister ursula von der leyen defended the meager increase on the grounds that the court 's ruling had only specified that the calculations needed to be made more transparently .

consumers will now also have warranty repair services in all eu countries . over the weekend , apple managed to defuse a potential legal tangle with the european union 's antitrust regulators by adjusting its iphone policies .
the company agreed to make warranty repair services equally available throughout european union countries , regardless of where a phone was purchased .
it also agreed to loosen restrictions on programming tools used to develop apps , the small programs designed to run on smartphones .
in doing so , the company avoided fines which could have been as high as 10 percent of its yearly turnover .
eu competition commissioner joaquin almunia said in a statement on saturday that " apple 's response to our preliminary investigations shows that the commission can use the competition rules to achieve swift results on the market with clear benefits for consumers . "
market changing rapidly but ian fogg , a london-based analyst for forrester research , said the market is changing at a fast pace , making it difficult for regulators to keep up .
apple 's app store was launched just over two years ago and has grown exponentially .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin almunia is the eu competition commissioner apple has at times struggled to bring consistency into the way it manages the apps in its store , fogg said .
he described apple 's app store as a " curated ecosystem " similar to the amazon kindle store or google 's market for android phone apps .
" i think it makes good business sense for any company that 's curating its ecosystem to be consistent and clear about what is and is n't allowed , because that level playing field enables firms to decide where to invest their efforts , " he told deutsche welle .
" apple 's challenge is the same challenge many firms have in that the products and the markets which are being created are so new that everyone is working out the rules as we go along . "
the european commission said the changes to apple 's policy towards iphone apps will remove limits to independent developers who sometimes were in competition with apple itself .
mobile warranty for mobile phones according to fogg , warranty repair policies vary in the consumer electronics market , but such policies carry added meaning for mobile products such as smartphones .
" for a mobile phone product , having the ability to have the product repaired wherever that person is is very important , " he said .
" it 's much more important for a mobile phone than it would be for a high-definition television , which is likely to be used in the same country that it 's bought in for all of its life . "

iran and middle east share center-stage at the un general assembly should germany be awarded a seat on the un security council ?
my opinion is that germany deserves the seat because this country is a big democratic , economic and political player in the world . - leon , us absolutely !
it is long-overdue .
if germany is " good enough " to be used as the sixth country in the stand-off with iran , it clearly deserves to be permanently seated on the security council .
moreover , the very fact that germany pays the third highest dues to the operation of the un can be argument for giving it a more influential voice .
time to leave world war ii behind ! - r.e. , us german foreign minister pushes for seat on security council absolutely , it is high time that germany is given a seat at the un security council .
the same applies for japan , india and brazil .
hopefully , when this becomes a reality , the un may become more productive in solving the world 's problems . - loyola , us i 'm not sure who i would like to receive the temporary seat on the un security council .
it either has to be canada or germany .

it breaks my heart to see oppression in germany against women .
we women are the other half in society . - blue , us all kind of religious signs including christian cross , jewish side curls , and the headscarf should be banned out of the public domain . - lutz , germany french senate approves burqa ban as far as i 'm concerned there is no government on earth that has the right to tell any person what they can or can not wear at any given time .
i also firmly believe that there is no place in politics for anything resembling religion .
as far as i 'm concerned this law infringes on people 's basic human rights to wear whatever they want .
religion belongs where it lies .
it does not belong in policy making and law enforcement .
there is no place for religion in government it is a spiritual matter which is unique to individuals . - saaly , australia compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 27.09.2010 long trucks long for germany 's autobahns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long and even possibly longer : germany considers long trucks with germany 's famed autobahns sometimes looking more like vast truck parking lots than motorways , the government is wondering whether fewer , longer trucks could reduce congestion and emissions .
critics doubt it . one of the hot topics at this year 's iaa commercial vehicles trade show in hanover is the german governent 's nationwide " long truck " field trial planned some time next year .
the trails could lead to new regulations on semi-truck lengths , creating new business opportunities for both makers of long-haul transportation vehicles and logistics companies operating them .
experts say longer trucks could reduce trucking costs by 20 to 25 percent .
" we build long trucks , and the experience of our customers using them in scandinavia , the netherlands and other markets has been good , " detlef hug , a spokesman for german truck maker man , told deutsche welle .
" of course , germany has its own challenges like heavy traffic and hilly terrain .
so that 's why it is a good idea to conduct a nationwide field trial so that we can test fuel and co2 emission reduction , safety , the impact on car drivers and more . "
truck traffic to increase 70 percent there is a sense of political urgency in berlin .
the federal transportation ministry estimates that truck traffic - already choking numerous german highways - will increase by 70 percent over the next 15 years .
and no one knows where all those vehicles should go .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's autobahns look more like a truck parking lot these days three years ago , several german states launched their own field trials – with mixed results .
accompanying studies also painted a blurred picture .
one of the studies , by the technical rwth aachen university , concluded that long trucks are safe and would reduce emissions .
longer vehicles , it noted , hardly use more fuel than current shorter models ; only during acceleration does the additional load make the truck 's engine slightly less efficient .
but another study by the fraunhofer institute for systems and innovative research claimed that while long trucks could relieve roads and the environment in the short term , they would , in the long term , cause a shift from rail to road that would offset any benefits .
" we 're aware of the work the states have done and the results of their tests will flow into a joint working group between the federal and state transportation ministries , " a spokesman from the federal transportation ministry told deutsche welle .
" these tests , however , were on a small scale .
what is needed is a much larger field trial across the entire country to determine the impact on logistics . "
plenty of interest more than 300 companies , including man , have already registered to participate in the federal government 's planned nationwide test , though a final number of participants has yet to be set .
the goal is to test tractor-trailer combinations with a length of 25.25 meters -lrb- 83 feet -rrb- , or 6.5 meters -lrb- 21 feet -rrb- longer than currently allowed .
the gross weight of the vehicles will remain at the current 44 tons for semi-trucks or 44 for " intermodal " container trucks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man has a booth at the iaa commercial vehicles trade show in hanover " we have heard some talk about the planned nationwide field trial testing 60-ton vehicles , " the ministry spokesman said .
" we have no intention to change the weight .
this is all about increasing volume . "
long trucks , the spokesman said , would allow voluminous goods to be transported with one vehicle , for instance , instead of breaking down the item to transport it with three trucks .
critics of heavy and long 60-ton trucks point to a number of problems , such as the damage they could do to roads and bridges because of their added weight and the lack of sufficiently secure guard rails .
yet long trucks also have their critics , too .
" there are a number of issues to be concerned about , " said martin roggermann from the german pro-rail alliance .
" long trucks are more difficult to pass , they need more space for turning at intersections and do n't fit into the current autobahn parking facilities , not too mention safety issues . "
shift from road to rail but roggermann 's biggest bone of contention is that the expected lower operating costs of long trucks could undermine efforts by his organization and others to shift freight off the road and onto rail .
" we are really concerned about the shift from rail to the road , " he said .
" we do n't believe long trucks will result in fewer trucks but in more trucks and in more problems on german roads . "
moreover , roggermann and others worry that if 40-ton long trucks are allowed , it will only be a matter of time before 60-ton " gigaliners " roar down german roads .
scandinavia began with 40-ton vehicles and later allowed the heavier vehicles , he noted .
few experts will disagree that competition for road freight business has become cutthroat in europe , especially since recent eastward european union expansion .
and plenty of them admit that the prospect of allowing larger vehicles to carry more for less will only fuel that competition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 27.09.2010 berlin publisher focuses on german books in vietnamese großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one berlin publisher is promoting german books in vietnamese at the recent international book fair in hanoi , several german publishers and the goethe institute organized a stand with 800 titles .
a small berlin-based firm that focuses on books in vietnamese was also there . peter knost is a proud man .
he holds up the first two books published by vipen editors , a company he recently founded with his vietnamese colleague the dung .
the two are not newcomers to the world of publishing .
peter knost used to edit books for a berlin-based group of authors from asia , africa , and latin america , and has worked as a sales representative for various publishing houses .
the dung is a writer with over half a dozen books on his list of publications . the two men are excited about their latest project – books by german authors translated into vietnamese . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " chronik der wende " about the collapse of east germany has been translated into vietnamese " the first book is finished , " knost said .
" it ’ s the translation of ' chronik der wende , ' almost a non-fiction classic about the collapse of east germany .
this book can now be read by vietnamese speakers . " " chronik der wende " is a popular retrospective of the period between the gdr 's 40th anniversary in early october 1989 and the free parliamentary elections in march 1990 .
the book describes all important events day by day and illustrates them with photographs from the time . vietnamese know little about german history but why should people in vietnam read this book now , more than 20 years after the events took place ?
author the dung claims there is a need for such an introduction as most of his fellow vietnamese know very little about contemporary german history . " very few people in vietnam can really comprehend what happened in germany with the fall of the wall .
that is why i thought we should start our publishing business with this particular book . " vipen editors has also published a volume of essays by east german writer christa wolf , where she analyses the political events of 1989 .
wolf is already known to intellectuals in vietnam as the author of " der geteilte himmel " -lrb- " divided heaven " -rrb- , a novella about the situation in the gdr , which was available in vietnamese in the 1980s .
now readers will have the chance to follow up on her views about germany . books need to be sold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter knost has published books from the developing world for a long time however , running a publishing house is not just a matter of translating and printing .
books also need to be sold .
currently , vipen editors can only circulate small numbers of their books in vietnam .
a few stores in the major cities import the books from berlin . as peter knost explains , they also want to target buyers closer to home : " we can ’ t really reach the vietnamese community via german book stores .
instead , we sell our books at events , public readings , libraries , and so on .
many vietnamese corner shops that sell all kinds of things also have books on display . " several german trade publishers already bring out books in languages such as turkish , arabic , or russian .
with their titles in vietnamese , vipen editors is trying to fill a gap and hoping to turn it into a profitable business . " if everything works out as planned over the next five years , we will have conquered and securely established our market niche . " but the men behind vipen editors know the most crucial aspect of their plan : to find ways to distribute larger numbers of their books not just at home , but in vietnam . author : thomas voelkner editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de budget -pipe- 27.09.2010 eu and germany push for penalties for deficit offenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : excessive budget deficits have hurt the eu 's credibility european union officials are launching an effort to impose sanctions on member states whose budget deficits are out of control , and germany is one of the strongest - and harshest - supporters . the european union needs to penalize members who break the bloc 's rules on borrowing and spending , according to statements made by top eu officials on monday .
speaking to the european parliament 's economic affairs committee , european central bank president jean-claude trichet warned that current oversight on eu states ' budgets is too lax , and called for a board of " wise men and women " to watch over budget discipline .
" what has been lacking is some kind of incentive to manage finances responsibly , " trichet said .
" indeed , a core , absolutely indispensable , element of an effective surveillance mechanism is a functioning mechanism of incentives and sanctions - both financial and non-financial . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet said the eu has been lacking incentives for financial responsibility under the eu 's stability and growth pact , member states must keep their budget deficits within three percent of gross domestic product .
but several member states - most notably greece - have flouted the rules , leading to a decline in the eu 's credibility .
sanctions to be quick and ' semi-automatic ' trichet 's comments support a proposal by european economic commissioner olli rehn to impose " semi-automatic " sanctions against such eu members who break budget rules .
the european commission is to lay out the details of its enforcement plan on wednesday .
reports say rehn would propose fines of 0.2 percent of gdp for countries who repeatedly fail to comply with financial rules .
in addition , countries with slipping competitiveness or whose growth is based on " excessive imbalances " like the credit boom in the baltic states would receive fines of 0.1 percent of gdp .
" sanctions ... need to be triggered early enough in the process so that they are essentially preventive , " rehn said monday .
" this is very important in order to ensure fiscal discipline , and sustainable growth in the eu . "
germany advocates harshness germany , traditionally one of the most fiscally conservative eu members , weighed in on the enforcement plan with finance minister wolfgang schaeuble writing a letter to his counterparts in the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble 's proposals on sanctions are among the strictest " the creation of stronger incentives to prevent and correct excessive government deficits stands at the very core of our endeavors to enforce fiscal and economy governance in the eu , " he wrote .
germany 's proposals have been some of the most draconian in the bloc .
schaeuble also called for the sanctions to affect payments from the eu 's substantial regional development and agricultural funds , and his office is reportedly considering supporting the exclusion of fiscal rule breakers from eu decision making .
meanwhile reports said italy , france and spain - which would all have to make significant reductions to their already-reduced budgets - were likely to oppose the new sanctions .

sanctions to be quick and ' semi-automatic ' trichet 's comments support a proposal by european economic commissioner olli rehn to impose " semi-automatic " sanctions against such eu members who break budget rules .

iran and middle east share center-stage at the un general assembly should germany be awarded a seat on the un security council ?
my opinion is that germany deserves the seat because this country is a big democratic , economic and political player in the world . - leon , us absolutely !
it is long-overdue .
if germany is " good enough " to be used as the sixth country in the stand-off with iran , it clearly deserves to be permanently seated on the security council .
moreover , the very fact that germany pays the third highest dues to the operation of the un can be argument for giving it a more influential voice .
time to leave world war ii behind ! - r.e. , us german foreign minister pushes for seat on security council absolutely , it is high time that germany is given a seat at the un security council .
the same applies for japan , india and brazil .
hopefully , when this becomes a reality , the un may become more productive in solving the world 's problems . - loyola , us i 'm not sure who i would like to receive the temporary seat on the un security council .
it either has to be canada or germany .
if only we could just change our leaders to someone a bit more liberal in their political thinking .
oh well , can not have everything . - cynthia , canada prominent german feminist weighs in loudly on headscarf debate women deserve freedom .
it breaks my heart to see oppression in germany against women .
we women are the other half in society . - blue , us all kind of religious signs including christian cross , jewish side curls , and the headscarf should be banned out of the public domain . - lutz , germany french senate approves burqa ban as far as i 'm concerned there is no government on earth that has the right to tell any person what they can or can not wear at any given time .
i also firmly believe that there is no place in politics for anything resembling religion .
as far as i 'm concerned this law infringes on people 's basic human rights to wear whatever they want .
religion belongs where it lies .
it does not belong in policy making and law enforcement .
there is no place for religion in government it is a spiritual matter which is unique to individuals . - saaly , australia compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not a month after israeli-palestinian peace talks resumed , their future is in jeopardy . palestinian president mahmoud abbas delayed a decision on withdrawing from direct peace talks with israel on monday as france voiced strong support for the palestinian position .
after meeting with abbas in paris , french president nicolas sarkozy told reporters that france regretted that israel had not listened to " unanimous calls " to extend a 10-month freeze on israeli settlement construction in the west bank .
the settlement freeze " should have been extended to give negotiations a chance , " sarkozy said .
" i say this in front of president abbas : settlement must stop . "
european union weighs in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu disappointed world leaders by not extending the settlement freeze catherine ashton , the european union 's foreign policy chief , expressed similar feelings in a statement given by her spokeswoman , maja kocijancic . " the position of the eu is very clear : settlements are illegal under international law , constitute an obstacle to peace and threaten to make a two-state solution impossible , " kocijancic told german news agency dpa . the united states also expressed disappointment that the settlement freeze had not been extended and announced that its middle east envoy george mitchell was on his way to the region to restart negotiations . the eu and the united states make up half of the middle east quartet charged with pursuing a peace solution .
the other members of the quartet are russia and the united nations .
settlements continue to expand bulldozers in at least two west bank settlements resumed work early on monday just hours after the moratorium expired .
the palestinian leadership had repeatedly threatened to pull out of direct peace talks with israel if the settlements continued to expand .
but abbas said there would be no official palestinian answer to the construction resumption until after a meeting with top arab diplomats on october 4 .
" after all these meetings we may be able to issue a position to clarify what is the palestinian and arab opinion on this matter , after israel has refused to freeze settlements , " he said .
" we will not have swift reactions now . "
sarkozy also invited abbas , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and egyptian president hosni mubarak to meet in paris before the end of october .
bildunterschrift : abbas and sarkouy urged israel to extend its settlement freeze peace talks on the line the settlement construction threatened to end the first direct negotiations since 2008 between israel and the palestinians , which began in washington nearly four weeks ago .
netanyahu said in a statement shortly before the construction freeze expired that israel was " ready to pursue continuous contacts in the coming days to find a way to continue peace talks . "
the united states also said its position that the settlement freeze should continue had not changed .
state department spokesman p.j. crowley said the us is " in close touch with both parties and will be meeting with them again in the coming days . "
from the palestinian point of view , israeli settlements in the west bank are a major barrier to the peace process .
palestinian leaders say the settlements will make the creation of a viable independent state impossible .
most of the international community considers israeli settlements in the west bank to be in violation of international law , but israel insists they are legitimate .

not a month after israeli-palestinian peace talks resumed , their future is in jeopardy . palestinian president mahmoud abbas delayed a decision on withdrawing from direct peace talks with israel on monday as france voiced strong support for the palestinian position .
after meeting with abbas in paris , french president nicolas sarkozy told reporters that france regretted that israel had not listened to " unanimous calls " to extend a 10-month freeze on israeli settlement construction in the west bank .
the settlement freeze " should have been extended to give negotiations a chance , " sarkozy said .
" i say this in front of president abbas : settlement must stop . "
european union weighs in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu disappointed world leaders by not extending the settlement freeze catherine ashton , the european union 's foreign policy chief , expressed similar feelings in a statement given by her spokeswoman , maja kocijancic . " the position of the eu is very clear : settlements are illegal under international law , constitute an obstacle to peace and threaten to make a two-state solution impossible , " kocijancic told german news agency dpa . the united states also expressed disappointment that the settlement freeze had not been extended and announced that its middle east envoy george mitchell was on his way to the region to restart negotiations . the eu and the united states make up half of the middle east quartet charged with pursuing a peace solution .
the other members of the quartet are russia and the united nations .
settlements continue to expand bulldozers in at least two west bank settlements resumed work early on monday just hours after the moratorium expired .
the palestinian leadership had repeatedly threatened to pull out of direct peace talks with israel if the settlements continued to expand .
but abbas said there would be no official palestinian answer to the construction resumption until after a meeting with top arab diplomats on october 4 .
" after all these meetings we may be able to issue a position to clarify what is the palestinian and arab opinion on this matter , after israel has refused to freeze settlements , " he said .
" we will not have swift reactions now . "
sarkozy also invited abbas , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and egyptian president hosni mubarak to meet in paris before the end of october .
bildunterschrift : abbas and sarkouy urged israel to extend its settlement freeze peace talks on the line the settlement construction threatened to end the first direct negotiations since 2008 between israel and the palestinians , which began in washington nearly four weeks ago .
netanyahu said in a statement shortly before the construction freeze expired that israel was " ready to pursue continuous contacts in the coming days to find a way to continue peace talks . "
the united states also said its position that the settlement freeze should continue had not changed .
state department spokesman p.j. crowley said the us is " in close touch with both parties and will be meeting with them again in the coming days . "
from the palestinian point of view , israeli settlements in the west bank are a major barrier to the peace process .
palestinian leaders say the settlements will make the creation of a viable independent state impossible .
most of the international community considers israeli settlements in the west bank to be in violation of international law , but israel insists they are legitimate .

iran and middle east share center-stage at the un general assembly should germany be awarded a seat on the un security council ?
my opinion is that germany deserves the seat because this country is a big democratic , economic and political player in the world . - leon , us absolutely !
it is long-overdue .
if germany is " good enough " to be used as the sixth country in the stand-off with iran , it clearly deserves to be permanently seated on the security council .
moreover , the very fact that germany pays the third highest dues to the operation of the un can be argument for giving it a more influential voice .
time to leave world war ii behind ! - r.e. , us german foreign minister pushes for seat on security council absolutely , it is high time that germany is given a seat at the un security council .
the same applies for japan , india and brazil .
hopefully , when this becomes a reality , the un may become more productive in solving the world 's problems . - loyola , us i 'm not sure who i would like to receive the temporary seat on the un security council .
it either has to be canada or germany .
if only we could just change our leaders to someone a bit more liberal in their political thinking .
oh well , can not have everything . - cynthia , canada prominent german feminist weighs in loudly on headscarf debate women deserve freedom .
it breaks my heart to see oppression in germany against women .
we women are the other half in society . - blue , us all kind of religious signs including christian cross , jewish side curls , and the headscarf should be banned out of the public domain . - lutz , germany french senate approves burqa ban as far as i 'm concerned there is no government on earth that has the right to tell any person what they can or can not wear at any given time .
i also firmly believe that there is no place in politics for anything resembling religion .
as far as i 'm concerned this law infringes on people 's basic human rights to wear whatever they want .
religion belongs where it lies .
it does not belong in policy making and law enforcement .
there is no place for religion in government it is a spiritual matter which is unique to individuals . - saaly , australia compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speaking to the european parliament 's economic affairs committee , european central bank president jean-claude trichet warned that current oversight on eu states ' budgets is too lax , and called for a board of " wise men and women " to watch over budget discipline .
" what has been lacking is some kind of incentive to manage finances responsibly , " trichet said .
" indeed , a core , absolutely indispensable , element of an effective surveillance mechanism is a functioning mechanism of incentives and sanctions - both financial and non-financial . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet said the eu has been lacking incentives for financial responsibility under the eu 's stability and growth pact , member states must keep their budget deficits within three percent of gross domestic product .
but several member states - most notably greece - have flouted the rules , leading to a decline in the eu 's credibility .
sanctions to be quick and ' semi-automatic ' trichet 's comments support a proposal by european economic commissioner olli rehn to impose " semi-automatic " sanctions against such eu members who break budget rules .
the european commission is to lay out the details of its enforcement plan on wednesday .
reports say rehn would propose fines of 0.2 percent of gdp for countries who repeatedly fail to comply with financial rules .
in addition , countries with slipping competitiveness or whose growth is based on " excessive imbalances " like the credit boom in the baltic states would receive fines of 0.1 percent of gdp .
" sanctions ... need to be triggered early enough in the process so that they are essentially preventive , " rehn said monday .
" this is very important in order to ensure fiscal discipline , and sustainable growth in the eu . "
germany advocates harshness germany , traditionally one of the most fiscally conservative eu members , weighed in on the enforcement plan with finance minister wolfgang schaeuble writing a letter to his counterparts in the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble 's proposals on sanctions are among the strictest " the creation of stronger incentives to prevent and correct excessive government deficits stands at the very core of our endeavors to enforce fiscal and economy governance in the eu , " he wrote .
germany 's proposals have been some of the most draconian in the bloc .
schaeuble also called for the sanctions to affect payments from the eu 's substantial regional development and agricultural funds , and his office is reportedly considering supporting the exclusion of fiscal rule breakers from eu decision making .
meanwhile reports said italy , france and spain - which would all have to make significant reductions to their already-reduced budgets - were likely to oppose the new sanctions .

not a month after israeli-palestinian peace talks resumed , their future is in jeopardy . palestinian president mahmoud abbas delayed a decision on withdrawing from direct peace talks with israel on monday as france voiced strong support for the palestinian position .
after meeting with abbas in paris , french president nicolas sarkozy told reporters that france regretted that israel had not listened to " unanimous calls " to extend a 10-month freeze on israeli settlement construction in the west bank .
the settlement freeze " should have been extended to give negotiations a chance , " sarkozy said .
" i say this in front of president abbas : settlement must stop . "
european union weighs in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu disappointed world leaders by not extending the settlement freeze catherine ashton , the european union 's foreign policy chief , expressed similar feelings in a statement given by her spokeswoman , maja kocijancic . " the position of the eu is very clear : settlements are illegal under international law , constitute an obstacle to peace and threaten to make a two-state solution impossible , " kocijancic told german news agency dpa . the united states also expressed disappointment that the settlement freeze had not been extended and announced that its middle east envoy george mitchell was on his way to the region to restart negotiations . the eu and the united states make up half of the middle east quartet charged with pursuing a peace solution .
the other members of the quartet are russia and the united nations .
settlements continue to expand bulldozers in at least two west bank settlements resumed work early on monday just hours after the moratorium expired .
the palestinian leadership had repeatedly threatened to pull out of direct peace talks with israel if the settlements continued to expand .
but abbas said there would be no official palestinian answer to the construction resumption until after a meeting with top arab diplomats on october 4 .
" after all these meetings we may be able to issue a position to clarify what is the palestinian and arab opinion on this matter , after israel has refused to freeze settlements , " he said .
" we will not have swift reactions now . "
sarkozy also invited abbas , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and egyptian president hosni mubarak to meet in paris before the end of october .
bildunterschrift : abbas and sarkouy urged israel to extend its settlement freeze peace talks on the line the settlement construction threatened to end the first direct negotiations since 2008 between israel and the palestinians , which began in washington nearly four weeks ago .
netanyahu said in a statement shortly before the construction freeze expired that israel was " ready to pursue continuous contacts in the coming days to find a way to continue peace talks . "
the united states also said its position that the settlement freeze should continue had not changed .
state department spokesman p.j. crowley said the us is " in close touch with both parties and will be meeting with them again in the coming days . "
from the palestinian point of view , israeli settlements in the west bank are a major barrier to the peace process .
palestinian leaders say the settlements will make the creation of a viable independent state impossible .
most of the international community considers israeli settlements in the west bank to be in violation of international law , but israel insists they are legitimate .

not a month after israeli-palestinian peace talks resumed , their future is in jeopardy . palestinian president mahmoud abbas delayed a decision on withdrawing from direct peace talks with israel on monday as france voiced strong support for the palestinian position .
after meeting with abbas in paris , french president nicolas sarkozy told reporters that france regretted that israel had not listened to " unanimous calls " to extend a 10-month freeze on israeli settlement construction in the west bank .
the settlement freeze " should have been extended to give negotiations a chance , " sarkozy said .
" i say this in front of president abbas : settlement must stop . "
european union weighs in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu disappointed world leaders by not extending the settlement freeze catherine ashton , the european union 's foreign policy chief , expressed similar feelings in a statement given by her spokeswoman , maja kocijancic . " the position of the eu is very clear : settlements are illegal under international law , constitute an obstacle to peace and threaten to make a two-state solution impossible , " kocijancic told german news agency dpa . the united states also expressed disappointment that the settlement freeze had not been extended and announced that its middle east envoy george mitchell was on his way to the region to restart negotiations . the eu and the united states make up half of the middle east quartet charged with pursuing a peace solution .
the other members of the quartet are russia and the united nations .
settlements continue to expand bulldozers in at least two west bank settlements resumed work early on monday just hours after the moratorium expired .
the palestinian leadership had repeatedly threatened to pull out of direct peace talks with israel if the settlements continued to expand .
but abbas said there would be no official palestinian answer to the construction resumption until after a meeting with top arab diplomats on october 4 .
" after all these meetings we may be able to issue a position to clarify what is the palestinian and arab opinion on this matter , after israel has refused to freeze settlements , " he said .
" we will not have swift reactions now . "
sarkozy also invited abbas , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and egyptian president hosni mubarak to meet in paris before the end of october .
bildunterschrift : abbas and sarkouy urged israel to extend its settlement freeze peace talks on the line the settlement construction threatened to end the first direct negotiations since 2008 between israel and the palestinians , which began in washington nearly four weeks ago .
netanyahu said in a statement shortly before the construction freeze expired that israel was " ready to pursue continuous contacts in the coming days to find a way to continue peace talks . "
the united states also said its position that the settlement freeze should continue had not changed .
state department spokesman p.j. crowley said the us is " in close touch with both parties and will be meeting with them again in the coming days . "
from the palestinian point of view , israeli settlements in the west bank are a major barrier to the peace process .
palestinian leaders say the settlements will make the creation of a viable independent state impossible .
most of the international community considers israeli settlements in the west bank to be in violation of international law , but israel insists they are legitimate .

consumers will now also have warranty repair services in all eu countries . over the weekend , apple managed to defuse a potential legal tangle with the european union 's antitrust regulators by adjusting its iphone policies .
the company agreed to make warranty repair services equally available throughout european union countries , regardless of where a phone was purchased .
it also agreed to loosen restrictions on programming tools used to develop apps , the small programs designed to run on smartphones .
in doing so , the company avoided fines which could have been as high as 10 percent of its yearly turnover .
eu competition commissioner joaquin almunia said in a statement on saturday that " apple 's response to our preliminary investigations shows that the commission can use the competition rules to achieve swift results on the market with clear benefits for consumers . "
market changing rapidly but ian fogg , a london-based analyst for forrester research , said the market is changing at a fast pace , making it difficult for regulators to keep up .
apple 's app store was launched just over two years ago and has grown exponentially .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin almunia is the eu competition commissioner apple has at times struggled to bring consistency into the way it manages the apps in its store , fogg said .
he described apple 's app store as a " curated ecosystem " similar to the amazon kindle store or google 's market for android phone apps .
" i think it makes good business sense for any company that 's curating its ecosystem to be consistent and clear about what is and is n't allowed , because that level playing field enables firms to decide where to invest their efforts , " he told deutsche welle .
" apple 's challenge is the same challenge many firms have in that the products and the markets which are being created are so new that everyone is working out the rules as we go along . "
the european commission said the changes to apple 's policy towards iphone apps will remove limits to independent developers who sometimes were in competition with apple itself .
mobile warranty for mobile phones according to fogg , warranty repair policies vary in the consumer electronics market , but such policies carry added meaning for mobile products such as smartphones .
" for a mobile phone product , having the ability to have the product repaired wherever that person is is very important , " he said .
" it 's much more important for a mobile phone than it would be for a high-definition television , which is likely to be used in the same country that it 's bought in for all of its life . "

iran and middle east share center-stage at the un general assembly should germany be awarded a seat on the un security council ?
my opinion is that germany deserves the seat because this country is a big democratic , economic and political player in the world . - leon , us absolutely !
it is long-overdue .
if germany is " good enough " to be used as the sixth country in the stand-off with iran , it clearly deserves to be permanently seated on the security council .
moreover , the very fact that germany pays the third highest dues to the operation of the un can be argument for giving it a more influential voice .
time to leave world war ii behind ! - r.e. , us german foreign minister pushes for seat on security council absolutely , it is high time that germany is given a seat at the un security council .
the same applies for japan , india and brazil .
hopefully , when this becomes a reality , the un may become more productive in solving the world 's problems . - loyola , us i 'm not sure who i would like to receive the temporary seat on the un security council .
it either has to be canada or germany .
if only we could just change our leaders to someone a bit more liberal in their political thinking .
oh well , can not have everything . - cynthia , canada prominent german feminist weighs in loudly on headscarf debate women deserve freedom .
it breaks my heart to see oppression in germany against women .
we women are the other half in society . - blue , us all kind of religious signs including christian cross , jewish side curls , and the headscarf should be banned out of the public domain . - lutz , germany french senate approves burqa ban as far as i 'm concerned there is no government on earth that has the right to tell any person what they can or can not wear at any given time .
i also firmly believe that there is no place in politics for anything resembling religion .
as far as i 'm concerned this law infringes on people 's basic human rights to wear whatever they want .
religion belongs where it lies .
it does not belong in policy making and law enforcement .
there is no place for religion in government it is a spiritual matter which is unique to individuals . - saaly , australia compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics doubt it . one of the hot topics at this year 's iaa commercial vehicles trade show in hanover is the german governent 's nationwide " long truck " field trial planned some time next year .
the trails could lead to new regulations on semi-truck lengths , creating new business opportunities for both makers of long-haul transportation vehicles and logistics companies operating them .
experts say longer trucks could reduce trucking costs by 20 to 25 percent .
" we build long trucks , and the experience of our customers using them in scandinavia , the netherlands and other markets has been good , " detlef hug , a spokesman for german truck maker man , told deutsche welle .
" of course , germany has its own challenges like heavy traffic and hilly terrain .
so that 's why it is a good idea to conduct a nationwide field trial so that we can test fuel and co2 emission reduction , safety , the impact on car drivers and more . "
truck traffic to increase 70 percent there is a sense of political urgency in berlin .
the federal transportation ministry estimates that truck traffic - already choking numerous german highways - will increase by 70 percent over the next 15 years .
and no one knows where all those vehicles should go .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's autobahns look more like a truck parking lot these days three years ago , several german states launched their own field trials – with mixed results .
accompanying studies also painted a blurred picture .
one of the studies , by the technical rwth aachen university , concluded that long trucks are safe and would reduce emissions .
longer vehicles , it noted , hardly use more fuel than current shorter models ; only during acceleration does the additional load make the truck 's engine slightly less efficient .
but another study by the fraunhofer institute for systems and innovative research claimed that while long trucks could relieve roads and the environment in the short term , they would , in the long term , cause a shift from rail to road that would offset any benefits .
" we 're aware of the work the states have done and the results of their tests will flow into a joint working group between the federal and state transportation ministries , " a spokesman from the federal transportation ministry told deutsche welle .
" these tests , however , were on a small scale .
what is needed is a much larger field trial across the entire country to determine the impact on logistics . "
plenty of interest more than 300 companies , including man , have already registered to participate in the federal government 's planned nationwide test , though a final number of participants has yet to be set .
the goal is to test tractor-trailer combinations with a length of 25.25 meters -lrb- 83 feet -rrb- , or 6.5 meters -lrb- 21 feet -rrb- longer than currently allowed .
the gross weight of the vehicles will remain at the current 44 tons for semi-trucks or 44 for " intermodal " container trucks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man has a booth at the iaa commercial vehicles trade show in hanover " we have heard some talk about the planned nationwide field trial testing 60-ton vehicles , " the ministry spokesman said .
" we have no intention to change the weight .
this is all about increasing volume . "
long trucks , the spokesman said , would allow voluminous goods to be transported with one vehicle , for instance , instead of breaking down the item to transport it with three trucks .
critics of heavy and long 60-ton trucks point to a number of problems , such as the damage they could do to roads and bridges because of their added weight and the lack of sufficiently secure guard rails .
yet long trucks also have their critics , too .
" there are a number of issues to be concerned about , " said martin roggermann from the german pro-rail alliance .
" long trucks are more difficult to pass , they need more space for turning at intersections and do n't fit into the current autobahn parking facilities , not too mention safety issues . "
shift from road to rail but roggermann 's biggest bone of contention is that the expected lower operating costs of long trucks could undermine efforts by his organization and others to shift freight off the road and onto rail .
" we are really concerned about the shift from rail to the road , " he said .
" we do n't believe long trucks will result in fewer trucks but in more trucks and in more problems on german roads . "
moreover , roggermann and others worry that if 40-ton long trucks are allowed , it will only be a matter of time before 60-ton " gigaliners " roar down german roads .
scandinavia began with 40-ton vehicles and later allowed the heavier vehicles , he noted .
few experts will disagree that competition for road freight business has become cutthroat in europe , especially since recent eastward european union expansion .
and plenty of them admit that the prospect of allowing larger vehicles to carry more for less will only fuel that competition .

longer vehicles , it noted , hardly use more fuel than current shorter models ; only during acceleration does the additional load make the truck 's engine slightly less efficient .

long trucks , the spokesman said , would allow voluminous goods to be transported with one vehicle , for instance , instead of breaking down the item to transport it with three trucks .
critics of heavy and long 60-ton trucks point to a number of problems , such as the damage they could do to roads and bridges because of their added weight and the lack of sufficiently secure guard rails .

sejdiu , a 58-year-old former law professor , was elected twice to the presidency - a mainly ceremonial position .
but he remained head of the democratic league of kosovo -lrb- ldk -rrb- - the second largest party and currently the junior partner in prime minister hashim thaci 's government .
the court decision , published on friday , found sejdiu 's dual role to be in " serious violation " of the constitution .
thirty-two members of parliament had filed a legal complaint .
speaking to reporters on monday , sejdiu said he disagreed with the court 's ruling but would respect it .
" over these years i have worked so that the republic of kosovo would have democratic institutions , " he said .
" i was convinced that keeping the function of the president of the democratic league of kosovo without exercising it did not violate the constitution .
the court had a different opinion and i respect the ruling . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sejdiu 's ldk party is part of prime minister hasim thaci 's coalition government talks with serbia sejdiu 's resignation comes weeks after serbia , which has not recognized kosovo following its 2008 unilateral declaration of independence , said it would hold direct talks with pristina on practical matters .
belgrade 's refusal to recognize kosovo as an independent country is a major stumbling block to its goal of joining the european union .
meanwhile kosovo was given a major boost by the international court of justice in july , which found its secession from serbia to be in line with international law .
seventy countries currently recognize kosovo 's independence , including the majority of the european union 's 27 member states , as well as the united states .
under a provision in kosovo 's constitution , the speaker of parliament , jakup krasniqi , is to become interim president while parliament has 60 days to appoint a permanent replacement .

consumers will now also have warranty repair services in all eu countries . over the weekend , apple managed to defuse a potential legal tangle with the european union 's antitrust regulators by adjusting its iphone policies .
the company agreed to make warranty repair services equally available throughout european union countries , regardless of where a phone was purchased .
it also agreed to loosen restrictions on programming tools used to develop apps , the small programs designed to run on smartphones .
in doing so , the company avoided fines which could have been as high as 10 percent of its yearly turnover .
eu competition commissioner joaquin almunia said in a statement on saturday that " apple 's response to our preliminary investigations shows that the commission can use the competition rules to achieve swift results on the market with clear benefits for consumers . "
market changing rapidly but ian fogg , a london-based analyst for forrester research , said the market is changing at a fast pace , making it difficult for regulators to keep up .
apple 's app store was launched just over two years ago and has grown exponentially .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin almunia is the eu competition commissioner apple has at times struggled to bring consistency into the way it manages the apps in its store , fogg said .
he described apple 's app store as a " curated ecosystem " similar to the amazon kindle store or google 's market for android phone apps .
" i think it makes good business sense for any company that 's curating its ecosystem to be consistent and clear about what is and is n't allowed , because that level playing field enables firms to decide where to invest their efforts , " he told deutsche welle .
" apple 's challenge is the same challenge many firms have in that the products and the markets which are being created are so new that everyone is working out the rules as we go along . "
the european commission said the changes to apple 's policy towards iphone apps will remove limits to independent developers who sometimes were in competition with apple itself .
mobile warranty for mobile phones according to fogg , warranty repair policies vary in the consumer electronics market , but such policies carry added meaning for mobile products such as smartphones .
" for a mobile phone product , having the ability to have the product repaired wherever that person is is very important , " he said .
" it 's much more important for a mobile phone than it would be for a high-definition television , which is likely to be used in the same country that it 's bought in for all of its life . "

consumers will now also have warranty repair services in all eu countries . over the weekend , apple managed to defuse a potential legal tangle with the european union 's antitrust regulators by adjusting its iphone policies .
the company agreed to make warranty repair services equally available throughout european union countries , regardless of where a phone was purchased .
it also agreed to loosen restrictions on programming tools used to develop apps , the small programs designed to run on smartphones .
in doing so , the company avoided fines which could have been as high as 10 percent of its yearly turnover .
eu competition commissioner joaquin almunia said in a statement on saturday that " apple 's response to our preliminary investigations shows that the commission can use the competition rules to achieve swift results on the market with clear benefits for consumers . "
market changing rapidly but ian fogg , a london-based analyst for forrester research , said the market is changing at a fast pace , making it difficult for regulators to keep up .
apple 's app store was launched just over two years ago and has grown exponentially .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin almunia is the eu competition commissioner apple has at times struggled to bring consistency into the way it manages the apps in its store , fogg said .
he described apple 's app store as a " curated ecosystem " similar to the amazon kindle store or google 's market for android phone apps .
" i think it makes good business sense for any company that 's curating its ecosystem to be consistent and clear about what is and is n't allowed , because that level playing field enables firms to decide where to invest their efforts , " he told deutsche welle .
" apple 's challenge is the same challenge many firms have in that the products and the markets which are being created are so new that everyone is working out the rules as we go along . "
the european commission said the changes to apple 's policy towards iphone apps will remove limits to independent developers who sometimes were in competition with apple itself .
mobile warranty for mobile phones according to fogg , warranty repair policies vary in the consumer electronics market , but such policies carry added meaning for mobile products such as smartphones .
" for a mobile phone product , having the ability to have the product repaired wherever that person is is very important , " he said .
" it 's much more important for a mobile phone than it would be for a high-definition television , which is likely to be used in the same country that it 's bought in for all of its life . "

but whether true unity has been achieved depends on whom you ask .
we examine what reunification does and could mean . one important measure of today 's undivided germany is economic , and on this score , as on so many others , the picture is mixed . huge strides have been made in the past twenty years .
just about every eastern german city and town has been thoroughly renovated .
and while income and other economic indices in the east are only 70 to 80 percent of what they are in the west , costs of living - especially for rent - are commensurately lower , so one could argue most eastern germans are n't that much worse off than their western fellow citizens . " silicon saxony " with its computer chips , and the optical industry in and around the city of jena in thuringia , are two examples of eastern industrial success . " i 'm very impressed with how the people in germany 's new states mastered the considerable challenges after 1989 , " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , who helped negotiate the original unification treaty , told deutsche welle .
" i 'm not disappointed at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some high-tech industries have flourished in the east but not everyone 's a winner .
as of july 2010 , unemployment in the east -lrb- 11.5 % -rrb- was nearly double what it was in the west -lrb- 6.6 % -rrb- , and an astonishing 50 percent of the 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 103 billion -rrb- in annual developmental subsidies transferred from west to east is eaten up by social benefits and welfare payments . " unfortunately , economic processes do n't work along the lines of what is just , " richard schroeder - a respected former professor of philosophy and theology at berlin 's humboldt university - said at a major conference earlier this year .
" we have large numbers of people who were n't pillars of the old system but whose situations have gotten a lot worse after the economic caesura . " some 1.6 million people have relocated from east to west since 1990 , most in search of better job opportunities , and that trend shows no sign of letting up .
moreover , sociologists speak of a " brain drain " from the east since it 's the better educated who make up the majority of those who leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty apartment blocks are a common sight in hoyerswerda it 's not uncommon to see unneeded housing units being torn down in eastern cities .
the most extreme example is hoyerswerda near germany 's border with poland and the czech republic , which has lost half of its population in the past decade . in these respects , two different economic subsets continue to exist .
and dissatisfaction with such differences and inequities has manifested itself politically . the rise and fragmentation of the left the incorporation of what germans call the " new states " into the political system of the federal republic has wrought changes few would have anticipated back in 1990 . the current german chancellor , angela merkel , hails from the east , although many germans tend to forget that fact .
and though most eastern germans vote for one of the western parties , others have sought their own alternative . the left party , the successor to the old socialist party in communist east germany , combined with left-wing fringe parties from the west , has established itself as a mouthpiece for disgruntled easterners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi -lrb- right -rrb- and westerner oskar lafontaine led the left party to prominence " reunification had a structural flaw in that the elites of the east were n't accepted , and not just the political elites , but the pedagogical , scientific and artistic elites as well , " left party parliamentary leader gregor gysi told deutsche welle .
" in the beginning , they had no time for my party , but they were rebuffed and forced back to us because the other parties were n't prepared to accept them . " the ironic result is that while the spd and the greens are leery of cooperating with former communists , the political left is bifurcated , helping merkel 's center-right government to hold on to power . the establishment of the left party as a form of peaceful political protest can be seen as evidence of eastern germans ' adoption of western democracy .
but it has also deepened many western germans ' sense of a cultural divide between them and their fellow citizens . ost- and westalgia one unambiguously positive aspect of reunification has been the removal of political barriers that kept many german families painfully separated during the cold war .
there are no exact figures for how many west and east germans had relatives in the " other " germany , but an average of 26 million care packages were sent annually from west to east during germany 's division - an indication of the personal hardships caused by political division . " those who felt imprisoned were overjoyed at an end to their suffering , " says brigitte klump , an author whose private petitions to the united nations over the course of many years helped some 4,000 people leave communist east germany .
" and naturally i still feel joy when i hear from people who succeeded in integrating into the west . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are n't many east-west marriages ostalgia - eastern germans ' supposed longing for the way things were - is a regular topic in the media , but in polls only around ten percent of easterners say they preferred life under socialism .
and eastern germans ' self-identification as a group decreases the later they were born . meanwhile , around half of western germans say the time before 1989 was better than afterward .
this reflects their fond memories of a period of affluence and clear social consensus and suggests that " westalgia " is far more prevalent than its eastern equivalent . partnerships between eastern and western germans make up only around four percent of all german marriages .
this may be due to the fact that most germans still stay in the places they grew up and maintain long-term social circles .
but the number of " ossis " and " wessis " tying the knot lags significantly behind that of germans and foreigners . " thanks to reunification , germany as a whole has gotten a lot more diverse , and feelings of togetherness have grown , " wolfgang schaeuble said .
" what we still need is time , patience , including patience with one another , and the experience of having successfully solved problems together . " the global factor one oft-neglected aspect of reunification is the contributions made by residents who do not hold german passports and the effects it had on them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners are also part of the story foreigners account for roughly eight percent of germany 's population , and with the removal of the east-west political divide , german society became much more multicultural , with large communities from eastern europe joining the substantial turkish minority that had established itself in the post-war federal republic . " the german immigrant nation is one of many nationalities , including germans from the old federal republic , others from the former east , millions of ethnic germans from eastern europe as well as an immigrant population of non-german descent , " said germany 's leading immigration expert klaus bade .
" former ' guest workers ' make up the majority , but there are also lots of smaller groups from an ever greater variety of backgrounds . " foreigners have an inestimable impact on today 's german society , and immigration is crucial in offsetting population decline , as both western and eastern germans are having fewer and fewer children . but after a boom immediately following the end of the cold war , the number of foreigners in germany has stagnated .
economists and sociologists see this as a worrisome trend because germany needs to increase its workforce to compensate for the aging population entering retirement . two decades on from 1990 , it is more apparent than ever that " reunification " is not a restoration of a past society , but a process of creating something new that is inextricable from globalization .
old national paradigms are coming under ever increasing challenges , so the future of the new federal republic is likely to be influenced just as much by factors from abroad as from within its own borders . author : jefferson chase editor : kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just about every eastern german city and town has been thoroughly renovated .

" i 'm not disappointed at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some high-tech industries have flourished in the east but not everyone 's a winner .
as of july 2010 , unemployment in the east -lrb- 11.5 % -rrb- was nearly double what it was in the west -lrb- 6.6 % -rrb- , and an astonishing 50 percent of the 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 103 billion -rrb- in annual developmental subsidies transferred from west to east is eaten up by social benefits and welfare payments . " unfortunately , economic processes do n't work along the lines of what is just , " richard schroeder - a respected former professor of philosophy and theology at berlin 's humboldt university - said at a major conference earlier this year .
" we have large numbers of people who were n't pillars of the old system but whose situations have gotten a lot worse after the economic caesura . " some 1.6 million people have relocated from east to west since 1990 , most in search of better job opportunities , and that trend shows no sign of letting up .
moreover , sociologists speak of a " brain drain " from the east since it 's the better educated who make up the majority of those who leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty apartment blocks are a common sight in hoyerswerda it 's not uncommon to see unneeded housing units being torn down in eastern cities .
the most extreme example is hoyerswerda near germany 's border with poland and the czech republic , which has lost half of its population in the past decade . in these respects , two different economic subsets continue to exist .
and dissatisfaction with such differences and inequities has manifested itself politically . the rise and fragmentation of the left the incorporation of what germans call the " new states " into the political system of the federal republic has wrought changes few would have anticipated back in 1990 . the current german chancellor , angela merkel , hails from the east , although many germans tend to forget that fact .
and though most eastern germans vote for one of the western parties , others have sought their own alternative . the left party , the successor to the old socialist party in communist east germany , combined with left-wing fringe parties from the west , has established itself as a mouthpiece for disgruntled easterners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi -lrb- right -rrb- and westerner oskar lafontaine led the left party to prominence " reunification had a structural flaw in that the elites of the east were n't accepted , and not just the political elites , but the pedagogical , scientific and artistic elites as well , " left party parliamentary leader gregor gysi told deutsche welle .
" in the beginning , they had no time for my party , but they were rebuffed and forced back to us because the other parties were n't prepared to accept them . " the ironic result is that while the spd and the greens are leery of cooperating with former communists , the political left is bifurcated , helping merkel 's center-right government to hold on to power . the establishment of the left party as a form of peaceful political protest can be seen as evidence of eastern germans ' adoption of western democracy .
but it has also deepened many western germans ' sense of a cultural divide between them and their fellow citizens . ost- and westalgia one unambiguously positive aspect of reunification has been the removal of political barriers that kept many german families painfully separated during the cold war .
there are no exact figures for how many west and east germans had relatives in the " other " germany , but an average of 26 million care packages were sent annually from west to east during germany 's division - an indication of the personal hardships caused by political division . " those who felt imprisoned were overjoyed at an end to their suffering , " says brigitte klump , an author whose private petitions to the united nations over the course of many years helped some 4,000 people leave communist east germany .
" and naturally i still feel joy when i hear from people who succeeded in integrating into the west . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are n't many east-west marriages ostalgia - eastern germans ' supposed longing for the way things were - is a regular topic in the media , but in polls only around ten percent of easterners say they preferred life under socialism .
and eastern germans ' self-identification as a group decreases the later they were born . meanwhile , around half of western germans say the time before 1989 was better than afterward .
this reflects their fond memories of a period of affluence and clear social consensus and suggests that " westalgia " is far more prevalent than its eastern equivalent . partnerships between eastern and western germans make up only around four percent of all german marriages .
this may be due to the fact that most germans still stay in the places they grew up and maintain long-term social circles .
but the number of " ossis " and " wessis " tying the knot lags significantly behind that of germans and foreigners . " thanks to reunification , germany as a whole has gotten a lot more diverse , and feelings of togetherness have grown , " wolfgang schaeuble said .
" what we still need is time , patience , including patience with one another , and the experience of having successfully solved problems together . " the global factor one oft-neglected aspect of reunification is the contributions made by residents who do not hold german passports and the effects it had on them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners are also part of the story foreigners account for roughly eight percent of germany 's population , and with the removal of the east-west political divide , german society became much more multicultural , with large communities from eastern europe joining the substantial turkish minority that had established itself in the post-war federal republic . " the german immigrant nation is one of many nationalities , including germans from the old federal republic , others from the former east , millions of ethnic germans from eastern europe as well as an immigrant population of non-german descent , " said germany 's leading immigration expert klaus bade .
" former ' guest workers ' make up the majority , but there are also lots of smaller groups from an ever greater variety of backgrounds .

but whether true unity has been achieved depends on whom you ask .
we examine what reunification does and could mean . one important measure of today 's undivided germany is economic , and on this score , as on so many others , the picture is mixed . huge strides have been made in the past twenty years .
just about every eastern german city and town has been thoroughly renovated .
and while income and other economic indices in the east are only 70 to 80 percent of what they are in the west , costs of living - especially for rent - are commensurately lower , so one could argue most eastern germans are n't that much worse off than their western fellow citizens . " silicon saxony " with its computer chips , and the optical industry in and around the city of jena in thuringia , are two examples of eastern industrial success . " i 'm very impressed with how the people in germany 's new states mastered the considerable challenges after 1989 , " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , who helped negotiate the original unification treaty , told deutsche welle .
" i 'm not disappointed at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some high-tech industries have flourished in the east but not everyone 's a winner .
as of july 2010 , unemployment in the east -lrb- 11.5 % -rrb- was nearly double what it was in the west -lrb- 6.6 % -rrb- , and an astonishing 50 percent of the 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 103 billion -rrb- in annual developmental subsidies transferred from west to east is eaten up by social benefits and welfare payments . " unfortunately , economic processes do n't work along the lines of what is just , " richard schroeder - a respected former professor of philosophy and theology at berlin 's humboldt university - said at a major conference earlier this year .
" we have large numbers of people who were n't pillars of the old system but whose situations have gotten a lot worse after the economic caesura . " some 1.6 million people have relocated from east to west since 1990 , most in search of better job opportunities , and that trend shows no sign of letting up .
moreover , sociologists speak of a " brain drain " from the east since it 's the better educated who make up the majority of those who leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty apartment blocks are a common sight in hoyerswerda it 's not uncommon to see unneeded housing units being torn down in eastern cities .
the most extreme example is hoyerswerda near germany 's border with poland and the czech republic , which has lost half of its population in the past decade . in these respects , two different economic subsets continue to exist .
and dissatisfaction with such differences and inequities has manifested itself politically . the rise and fragmentation of the left the incorporation of what germans call the " new states " into the political system of the federal republic has wrought changes few would have anticipated back in 1990 . the current german chancellor , angela merkel , hails from the east , although many germans tend to forget that fact .
and though most eastern germans vote for one of the western parties , others have sought their own alternative . the left party , the successor to the old socialist party in communist east germany , combined with left-wing fringe parties from the west , has established itself as a mouthpiece for disgruntled easterners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi -lrb- right -rrb- and westerner oskar lafontaine led the left party to prominence " reunification had a structural flaw in that the elites of the east were n't accepted , and not just the political elites , but the pedagogical , scientific and artistic elites as well , " left party parliamentary leader gregor gysi told deutsche welle .
" in the beginning , they had no time for my party , but they were rebuffed and forced back to us because the other parties were n't prepared to accept them . " the ironic result is that while the spd and the greens are leery of cooperating with former communists , the political left is bifurcated , helping merkel 's center-right government to hold on to power . the establishment of the left party as a form of peaceful political protest can be seen as evidence of eastern germans ' adoption of western democracy .
but it has also deepened many western germans ' sense of a cultural divide between them and their fellow citizens . ost- and westalgia one unambiguously positive aspect of reunification has been the removal of political barriers that kept many german families painfully separated during the cold war .
there are no exact figures for how many west and east germans had relatives in the " other " germany , but an average of 26 million care packages were sent annually from west to east during germany 's division - an indication of the personal hardships caused by political division . " those who felt imprisoned were overjoyed at an end to their suffering , " says brigitte klump , an author whose private petitions to the united nations over the course of many years helped some 4,000 people leave communist east germany .
" and naturally i still feel joy when i hear from people who succeeded in integrating into the west .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 27.09.2010 us report exposes fbi 's post-9/11 investigations of greenpeace , peta großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reports states that the fbi misled the justice department in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the us , the federal bureau of investigation -lrb- fbi -rrb- began spying on a number of liberal groups under ambiguous new terror laws , a us department of justice report states . according to the report , the fbi carried out " unreasonable and inconsistent " investigations into environmental pressure group greenpeace , animal rights organization peta and a number of pacifist groups in the united states after 9/11 .
under homeland security laws brought in to safeguard the us from terrorist activities , the report showed that the fbi improperly investigated greenpeace and peta , along with the thomas merton center , a pittsburgh anti-war organization , the catholic worker , another anti-war group , and an individual quaker peace activist between 2001 and 2006 .
according to the inspector general of the department of justice , the five domestic terror investigations carried out by the fbi had " little or no basis " and were " unreasonable and inconsistent with fbi policy . "
the report also stated that the fbi " made false and misleading statements to congress " about the investigations , wrongly classifying them under " domestic terrorism cases " in an effort to pursue surveillance operations against the liberal organizations .
the investigations were based on " potential crimes " including trespassing and vandalism which the fbi misclassified under acts of terror .
the report said that these crimes " could alternatively have been classified differently , " which would have negated the need for anti-terror investigations into the targeted organizations .
the report added that in several cases , the fbi 's justification for investigation was " factually weak " and that there was " little indication of any possible federal crime as opposed to local crime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi were part of the anti-terror fusion groups created after 9/11 " after 9/11 , one of the most worrying aspects of that investigation was the lack of coordination between us security services , " clive walker , professor of criminal justice studies at the university of leeds , told deutsche welle .
" this led to the establishment of fusion groups across the us which were supposed to reduce the barriers between organizations .
they fused policing , intelligence and public security functions . "
" the driving force behind these groups was the fight against terrorism but in most places in the us , there really is n't a terrorist threat - so these well-funded groups , which included the fbi , had to find something to justify their existence , such as going after groups like greenpeace and peta under the guise of domestic terror prevention . "
peta investigation leads to members joining us terror list peta was first put under surveillance in the spring of 2001 , a number of months before the september 11 terror attacks , when the fbi started to investigate possible connections between one of the group 's members and the extremist animal liberation front .
the bureau believed the peta member was providing financial support which could aid activist missions to destroy property or attack research facilities involved in the practice of testing on animals .
after the attacks of 9/11 , the investigation rapidly expanded to cover the entire peta operation , its activities and those of a number of its affiliate organizations .
despite no criminal activity ever being documented , the investigation lasted for nearly six years and led to two innocent individuals being placed on the domestic terror watch list until 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peta protests such as this were monitored by the fbi " the fbi investigation into peta took the form of surveillance of entirely lawful free speech activities , including speeches on college campuses and public demonstrations by activists in chicken costumes and other props peta uses frequently , " harold ullman , vice president of peta germany , told deutsche welle .

under homeland security laws brought in to safeguard the us from terrorist activities , the report showed that the fbi improperly investigated greenpeace and peta , along with the thomas merton center , a pittsburgh anti-war organization , the catholic worker , another anti-war group , and an individual quaker peace activist between 2001 and 2006 .
according to the inspector general of the department of justice , the five domestic terror investigations carried out by the fbi had " little or no basis " and were " unreasonable and inconsistent with fbi policy . "
the report also stated that the fbi " made false and misleading statements to congress " about the investigations , wrongly classifying them under " domestic terrorism cases " in an effort to pursue surveillance operations against the liberal organizations .
the investigations were based on " potential crimes " including trespassing and vandalism which the fbi misclassified under acts of terror .
the report said that these crimes " could alternatively have been classified differently , " which would have negated the need for anti-terror investigations into the targeted organizations .
the report added that in several cases , the fbi 's justification for investigation was " factually weak " and that there was " little indication of any possible federal crime as opposed to local crime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi were part of the anti-terror fusion groups created after 9/11 " after 9/11 , one of the most worrying aspects of that investigation was the lack of coordination between us security services , " clive walker , professor of criminal justice studies at the university of leeds , told deutsche welle .
" this led to the establishment of fusion groups across the us which were supposed to reduce the barriers between organizations .
they fused policing , intelligence and public security functions . "
" the driving force behind these groups was the fight against terrorism but in most places in the us , there really is n't a terrorist threat - so these well-funded groups , which included the fbi , had to find something to justify their existence , such as going after groups like greenpeace and peta under the guise of domestic terror prevention . "
peta investigation leads to members joining us terror list peta was first put under surveillance in the spring of 2001 , a number of months before the september 11 terror attacks , when the fbi started to investigate possible connections between one of the group 's members and the extremist animal liberation front .
the bureau believed the peta member was providing financial support which could aid activist missions to destroy property or attack research facilities involved in the practice of testing on animals .
after the attacks of 9/11 , the investigation rapidly expanded to cover the entire peta operation , its activities and those of a number of its affiliate organizations .
despite no criminal activity ever being documented , the investigation lasted for nearly six years and led to two innocent individuals being placed on the domestic terror watch list until 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peta protests such as this were monitored by the fbi " the fbi investigation into peta took the form of surveillance of entirely lawful free speech activities , including speeches on college campuses and public demonstrations by activists in chicken costumes and other props peta uses frequently , " harold ullman , vice president of peta germany , told deutsche welle .
" there is no justification for such police state tactics .

' pits gritty germany against explosive italy in its culture capital year , germany 's ruhr region is honoring its most distinguished musical son - composer hans werner henze - with a plethora of concerts and events known collectively as " the henze project . " born in the german town of guetersloh in 1926 , hans werner henze is one of germany 's greatest living composers and one of the most significant figures of 20th century classical music .
he 's also been the initiator of numerous projects designed to encourage and nurture young musical talent .
most notably , in 1976 , he founded the cantiere internazionale d 'arte summer academy in montepulciano , which remains a benchmark for progressive music teaching the world over . now , the ruhr valley is honoring henze with a plethora of concerts and events , known collectively as " the henze project . "
in keeping with the composer 's long-standing commitment to encouraging young talent , the jewel in the project 's crown is a new work devised for and with young people . a new composition composed in collaboration with the writers michael kerstan and christian lehnert , " gisela ! - or , the strange and memorable paths of happiness , " is performed by a colorful mix of up-and-coming talent and established professional innovators . several parts are taken by students of essen 's folkswang university , the choir is a youth group from dortmund , and the regional youth ensemble has worked together with cutting-edge contemporary music outfit musikfabrik to create its own distinctive sound . asked by deutsche welle why his work with young people was so important to him , henze answered rather enigmatically : " people are like cats .
when a cat has a litter , all of the kittens are different . each one has a different design , although they come from the same father and mother .
the same goes for -lsb- young -rsb- musicians . "
he said he sees himself not as a teacher , but as an " ally , " henze added .
from che guevara to gisela from oberhausen one noticeable difference between the octogenarian maestro and the up-and-coming generation of composers is that whereas henze 's career has been likened to a seismograph through which the great political and social upheavals of the twentieth century can be read , critics often bemoan the lack of political engagement among contemporary musicians and artists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henze is a national treasure - and an expatriot for his part , henze theorized that political engagement has waned along with certain cultural heroes .
" i think there 's been a sort of withdrawal , " henze said .
" in a funny way , i think it has a lot to do with the death of figures like ernesto -lsb- che -rsb- guevara and rudi dutschke .
somehow , these deaths were followed by a feeling of helplessness , a powerlessness to rebel , however necessary rebellion may be . " henze , who knew both the argentinean revolutionary and the leader of the 1968 german student movement personally , said the political content of his work has never been intentional , but has rather stemmed from his interest in people and his sensitivity to the world around him . music should not be written for an elite , henze insists .
instead , " it should try to reach as wide , and as deep as it can . " from sunny naples to grey oberhausen set in the heartland of germany 's industrial ruhr valley , " gisela ! " looks set to succeed in reaching out to a wider audience by tapping into discourse of regional identity , brought about by essen 's european capital of culture status . " gisela ! " is the story of the eponymous protagonist , a young woman from oberhausen who visits naples with her boyfriend hanspeter , only to fall in love with gennaro , a charismatic italian with a penchant for commedia dell 'arte-style mischief .
determined to prove that her hometown is not the grim and grimy industrial landscape of genarro 's prejudice , but rather part of a sparkling new european capital of culture , gisela takes her new lover home with her . the basic story line could have been drafted by the local tourist board , but the conclusion is a bit more enigmatic .
the inevitable confrontation between the rival lovers is interrupted by the joyful explosion of vesuvius in approbation of gisela 's union with gennaro .
germany 's brand new culture capital seems to have won the blessing of italy 's noble cultural tradition .
however , as the curtain falls , the volcano begins to rain dark ash .
although , in the words of his long-term collaborator michael kerstan , he 's " still very much a german personality , " hans werner henze left germany in 1956 , making italy his permanent home .
unlike gisela , henze has no intentions of returning permanently .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 27.09.2010 us report exposes fbi 's post-9/11 investigations of greenpeace , peta großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reports states that the fbi misled the justice department in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the us , the federal bureau of investigation -lrb- fbi -rrb- began spying on a number of liberal groups under ambiguous new terror laws , a us department of justice report states . according to the report , the fbi carried out " unreasonable and inconsistent " investigations into environmental pressure group greenpeace , animal rights organization peta and a number of pacifist groups in the united states after 9/11 .
under homeland security laws brought in to safeguard the us from terrorist activities , the report showed that the fbi improperly investigated greenpeace and peta , along with the thomas merton center , a pittsburgh anti-war organization , the catholic worker , another anti-war group , and an individual quaker peace activist between 2001 and 2006 .
according to the inspector general of the department of justice , the five domestic terror investigations carried out by the fbi had " little or no basis " and were " unreasonable and inconsistent with fbi policy . "
the report also stated that the fbi " made false and misleading statements to congress " about the investigations , wrongly classifying them under " domestic terrorism cases " in an effort to pursue surveillance operations against the liberal organizations .
the investigations were based on " potential crimes " including trespassing and vandalism which the fbi misclassified under acts of terror .
the report said that these crimes " could alternatively have been classified differently , " which would have negated the need for anti-terror investigations into the targeted organizations .
the report added that in several cases , the fbi 's justification for investigation was " factually weak " and that there was " little indication of any possible federal crime as opposed to local crime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi were part of the anti-terror fusion groups created after 9/11 " after 9/11 , one of the most worrying aspects of that investigation was the lack of coordination between us security services , " clive walker , professor of criminal justice studies at the university of leeds , told deutsche welle .
" this led to the establishment of fusion groups across the us which were supposed to reduce the barriers between organizations .
they fused policing , intelligence and public security functions . "
" the driving force behind these groups was the fight against terrorism but in most places in the us , there really is n't a terrorist threat - so these well-funded groups , which included the fbi , had to find something to justify their existence , such as going after groups like greenpeace and peta under the guise of domestic terror prevention . "
peta investigation leads to members joining us terror list peta was first put under surveillance in the spring of 2001 , a number of months before the september 11 terror attacks , when the fbi started to investigate possible connections between one of the group 's members and the extremist animal liberation front .
the bureau believed the peta member was providing financial support which could aid activist missions to destroy property or attack research facilities involved in the practice of testing on animals .
after the attacks of 9/11 , the investigation rapidly expanded to cover the entire peta operation , its activities and those of a number of its affiliate organizations .
despite no criminal activity ever being documented , the investigation lasted for nearly six years and led to two innocent individuals being placed on the domestic terror watch list until 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peta protests such as this were monitored by the fbi " the fbi investigation into peta took the form of surveillance of entirely lawful free speech activities , including speeches on college campuses and public demonstrations by activists in chicken costumes and other props peta uses frequently , " harold ullman , vice president of peta germany , told deutsche welle .
" there is no justification for such police state tactics .
people speaking out on behalf of animals should be protected not placed under surveillance . " " the use of mccarthyist tactics against peta and other groups that speak out against cruelty to animals and exploitative corporate and government practices is un-american , unconstitutional , and against the interests of a healthy democracy , " ullman added .
" peta 's effective activism scares well-heeled business interests that abuse animals , but when these outfits used their connections to violate the us constitution , the fbi 's ham-fisted attempt to catch us with our pants down resulted in the fbi being caught with its pants down . " fbi suspected greenpeace was planning alaska pipeline attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi believed greenpeace would take violent action the greenpeace investigation started in 1999 when the fbi launched an operation to prevent the suspected disruption by activists of corporate shareholder meetings of two alaskan energy producers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 27.09.2010 us report exposes fbi 's post-9/11 investigations of greenpeace , peta großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reports states that the fbi misled the justice department in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the us , the federal bureau of investigation -lrb- fbi -rrb- began spying on a number of liberal groups under ambiguous new terror laws , a us department of justice report states . according to the report , the fbi carried out " unreasonable and inconsistent " investigations into environmental pressure group greenpeace , animal rights organization peta and a number of pacifist groups in the united states after 9/11 .
under homeland security laws brought in to safeguard the us from terrorist activities , the report showed that the fbi improperly investigated greenpeace and peta , along with the thomas merton center , a pittsburgh anti-war organization , the catholic worker , another anti-war group , and an individual quaker peace activist between 2001 and 2006 .
according to the inspector general of the department of justice , the five domestic terror investigations carried out by the fbi had " little or no basis " and were " unreasonable and inconsistent with fbi policy . "
the report also stated that the fbi " made false and misleading statements to congress " about the investigations , wrongly classifying them under " domestic terrorism cases " in an effort to pursue surveillance operations against the liberal organizations .
the investigations were based on " potential crimes " including trespassing and vandalism which the fbi misclassified under acts of terror .
the report said that these crimes " could alternatively have been classified differently , " which would have negated the need for anti-terror investigations into the targeted organizations .
the report added that in several cases , the fbi 's justification for investigation was " factually weak " and that there was " little indication of any possible federal crime as opposed to local crime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi were part of the anti-terror fusion groups created after 9/11 " after 9/11 , one of the most worrying aspects of that investigation was the lack of coordination between us security services , " clive walker , professor of criminal justice studies at the university of leeds , told deutsche welle .
" this led to the establishment of fusion groups across the us which were supposed to reduce the barriers between organizations .
they fused policing , intelligence and public security functions . "
" the driving force behind these groups was the fight against terrorism but in most places in the us , there really is n't a terrorist threat - so these well-funded groups , which included the fbi , had to find something to justify their existence , such as going after groups like greenpeace and peta under the guise of domestic terror prevention . "
peta investigation leads to members joining us terror list peta was first put under surveillance in the spring of 2001 , a number of months before the september 11 terror attacks , when the fbi started to investigate possible connections between one of the group 's members and the extremist animal liberation front .
the bureau believed the peta member was providing financial support which could aid activist missions to destroy property or attack research facilities involved in the practice of testing on animals .
after the attacks of 9/11 , the investigation rapidly expanded to cover the entire peta operation , its activities and those of a number of its affiliate organizations .
despite no criminal activity ever being documented , the investigation lasted for nearly six years and led to two innocent individuals being placed on the domestic terror watch list until 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peta protests such as this were monitored by the fbi " the fbi investigation into peta took the form of surveillance of entirely lawful free speech activities , including speeches on college campuses and public demonstrations by activists in chicken costumes and other props peta uses frequently , " harold ullman , vice president of peta germany , told deutsche welle .
" there is no justification for such police state tactics .
people speaking out on behalf of animals should be protected not placed under surveillance . " " the use of mccarthyist tactics against peta and other groups that speak out against cruelty to animals and exploitative corporate and government practices is un-american , unconstitutional , and against the interests of a healthy democracy , " ullman added .
" peta 's effective activism scares well-heeled business interests that abuse animals , but when these outfits used their connections to violate the us constitution , the fbi 's ham-fisted attempt to catch us with our pants down resulted in the fbi being caught with its pants down . " fbi suspected greenpeace was planning alaska pipeline attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi believed greenpeace would take violent action the greenpeace investigation started in 1999 when the fbi launched an operation to prevent the suspected disruption by activists of corporate shareholder meetings of two alaskan energy producers .
the protests never took place but the investigation continued for a further three years regardless . the inspector general 's report stated that that the fbi " articulated little or no basis for suspecting a violation of any federal criminal statute " in the greenpeace case and that the fbi crossed the line when it decided to continue its investigation " beyond the point at which its underlying justification no longer existed . " " we have yet to hold a discussion with the fbi about these investigations , although we will seek such a discussion , " mark floegel , a spokesperson for greenpeace us , told deutsche welle . " we 've only seen the justification in the report itself , which in some cases was based on irresponsible reports from what we presume are third parties . in one section , the report refers to a report that someone at greenpeace expressed a desire to blow up the alaska pipeline .
even a superficial investigation into greenpeace history would show greenpeace has always condemned violence and such an act would violate our principles . " " so far , no compensation or offer of an apology has been forthcoming from the fbi , " he added . both greenpeace and peta told deutsche welle that , to their knowledge , no investigations were carried out into their activities post-9/11 by european security agencies . fbi denies targeting groups on grounds of dissent in response to the department of justice report , the fbi maintained that it had not led any investigation into an organization 's activities based on an issue of free speech and that it had not been instructed to carry out any reforms to its procedures as a result . " after more than four years of investigation and an exhaustive review of hundreds of investigative decisions the fbi made after the september 11 attacks , the office of the inspector general -lrb- oig -rrb- did not uncover even a single instance where the fbi targeted any group or any individual based on the exercise of a first amendment right , " read a statement provided by the fbi to deutsche welle . " while the oig disagreed with a handful of the fbi ’ s investigative determinations over the course of six years , it has not recommended any significant modifications to the fbi ’ s authority to investigate criminal conduct or national security threats . " ambiguous laws lead to terror definition problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror laws after 9/11 were flexible and open to abuse professor clive walker believes that ambiguous language and badly defined terms left the security legislation in the us open to interpretation , a situation which in turn created an environment in which the greenpeace and peta investigations could be carried out under anti-terror laws . " the us laws brought in after 9/11 were pretty flexible but the main problem was their definition of terrorism , " he said .
" it 's very vague and therefore open to interpretation which leads to definitional problems in terms of mission objectives and applications . " " it 's cynical to say that the fbi used this ambiguity to manipulate the laws to suit their needs but the truth is , it is a recurring theme in the bureau 's history , " he added .
" since its formation there have been examples of this , such as the communist scare in the 1950 's and the anti-vietnam war movement in the 1960 's .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 27.09.2010 us report exposes fbi 's post-9/11 investigations of greenpeace , peta großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reports states that the fbi misled the justice department in the wake of the september 11 , 2001 attacks on the us , the federal bureau of investigation -lrb- fbi -rrb- began spying on a number of liberal groups under ambiguous new terror laws , a us department of justice report states . according to the report , the fbi carried out " unreasonable and inconsistent " investigations into environmental pressure group greenpeace , animal rights organization peta and a number of pacifist groups in the united states after 9/11 .
under homeland security laws brought in to safeguard the us from terrorist activities , the report showed that the fbi improperly investigated greenpeace and peta , along with the thomas merton center , a pittsburgh anti-war organization , the catholic worker , another anti-war group , and an individual quaker peace activist between 2001 and 2006 .
according to the inspector general of the department of justice , the five domestic terror investigations carried out by the fbi had " little or no basis " and were " unreasonable and inconsistent with fbi policy . "
the report also stated that the fbi " made false and misleading statements to congress " about the investigations , wrongly classifying them under " domestic terrorism cases " in an effort to pursue surveillance operations against the liberal organizations .
the investigations were based on " potential crimes " including trespassing and vandalism which the fbi misclassified under acts of terror .
the report said that these crimes " could alternatively have been classified differently , " which would have negated the need for anti-terror investigations into the targeted organizations .
the report added that in several cases , the fbi 's justification for investigation was " factually weak " and that there was " little indication of any possible federal crime as opposed to local crime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi were part of the anti-terror fusion groups created after 9/11 " after 9/11 , one of the most worrying aspects of that investigation was the lack of coordination between us security services , " clive walker , professor of criminal justice studies at the university of leeds , told deutsche welle .
" this led to the establishment of fusion groups across the us which were supposed to reduce the barriers between organizations .
they fused policing , intelligence and public security functions . "
" the driving force behind these groups was the fight against terrorism but in most places in the us , there really is n't a terrorist threat - so these well-funded groups , which included the fbi , had to find something to justify their existence , such as going after groups like greenpeace and peta under the guise of domestic terror prevention . "
peta investigation leads to members joining us terror list peta was first put under surveillance in the spring of 2001 , a number of months before the september 11 terror attacks , when the fbi started to investigate possible connections between one of the group 's members and the extremist animal liberation front .
the bureau believed the peta member was providing financial support which could aid activist missions to destroy property or attack research facilities involved in the practice of testing on animals .
after the attacks of 9/11 , the investigation rapidly expanded to cover the entire peta operation , its activities and those of a number of its affiliate organizations .
despite no criminal activity ever being documented , the investigation lasted for nearly six years and led to two innocent individuals being placed on the domestic terror watch list until 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peta protests such as this were monitored by the fbi " the fbi investigation into peta took the form of surveillance of entirely lawful free speech activities , including speeches on college campuses and public demonstrations by activists in chicken costumes and other props peta uses frequently , " harold ullman , vice president of peta germany , told deutsche welle .
" there is no justification for such police state tactics .
people speaking out on behalf of animals should be protected not placed under surveillance . " " the use of mccarthyist tactics against peta and other groups that speak out against cruelty to animals and exploitative corporate and government practices is un-american , unconstitutional , and against the interests of a healthy democracy , " ullman added .
" peta 's effective activism scares well-heeled business interests that abuse animals , but when these outfits used their connections to violate the us constitution , the fbi 's ham-fisted attempt to catch us with our pants down resulted in the fbi being caught with its pants down . " fbi suspected greenpeace was planning alaska pipeline attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi believed greenpeace would take violent action the greenpeace investigation started in 1999 when the fbi launched an operation to prevent the suspected disruption by activists of corporate shareholder meetings of two alaskan energy producers .
the protests never took place but the investigation continued for a further three years regardless . the inspector general 's report stated that that the fbi " articulated little or no basis for suspecting a violation of any federal criminal statute " in the greenpeace case and that the fbi crossed the line when it decided to continue its investigation " beyond the point at which its underlying justification no longer existed . " " we have yet to hold a discussion with the fbi about these investigations , although we will seek such a discussion , " mark floegel , a spokesperson for greenpeace us , told deutsche welle . " we 've only seen the justification in the report itself , which in some cases was based on irresponsible reports from what we presume are third parties . in one section , the report refers to a report that someone at greenpeace expressed a desire to blow up the alaska pipeline .
even a superficial investigation into greenpeace history would show greenpeace has always condemned violence and such an act would violate our principles . " " so far , no compensation or offer of an apology has been forthcoming from the fbi , " he added . both greenpeace and peta told deutsche welle that , to their knowledge , no investigations were carried out into their activities post-9/11 by european security agencies . fbi denies targeting groups on grounds of dissent in response to the department of justice report , the fbi maintained that it had not led any investigation into an organization 's activities based on an issue of free speech and that it had not been instructed to carry out any reforms to its procedures as a result . " after more than four years of investigation and an exhaustive review of hundreds of investigative decisions the fbi made after the september 11 attacks , the office of the inspector general -lrb- oig -rrb- did not uncover even a single instance where the fbi targeted any group or any individual based on the exercise of a first amendment right , " read a statement provided by the fbi to deutsche welle . " while the oig disagreed with a handful of the fbi ’ s investigative determinations over the course of six years , it has not recommended any significant modifications to the fbi ’ s authority to investigate criminal conduct or national security threats . " ambiguous laws lead to terror definition problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror laws after 9/11 were flexible and open to abuse professor clive walker believes that ambiguous language and badly defined terms left the security legislation in the us open to interpretation , a situation which in turn created an environment in which the greenpeace and peta investigations could be carried out under anti-terror laws . " the us laws brought in after 9/11 were pretty flexible but the main problem was their definition of terrorism , " he said .
" it 's very vague and therefore open to interpretation which leads to definitional problems in terms of mission objectives and applications . " " it 's cynical to say that the fbi used this ambiguity to manipulate the laws to suit their needs but the truth is , it is a recurring theme in the bureau 's history , " he added .

under homeland security laws brought in to safeguard the us from terrorist activities , the report showed that the fbi improperly investigated greenpeace and peta , along with the thomas merton center , a pittsburgh anti-war organization , the catholic worker , another anti-war group , and an individual quaker peace activist between 2001 and 2006 .
according to the inspector general of the department of justice , the five domestic terror investigations carried out by the fbi had " little or no basis " and were " unreasonable and inconsistent with fbi policy . "
the report also stated that the fbi " made false and misleading statements to congress " about the investigations , wrongly classifying them under " domestic terrorism cases " in an effort to pursue surveillance operations against the liberal organizations .
the investigations were based on " potential crimes " including trespassing and vandalism which the fbi misclassified under acts of terror .
the report said that these crimes " could alternatively have been classified differently , " which would have negated the need for anti-terror investigations into the targeted organizations .
the report added that in several cases , the fbi 's justification for investigation was " factually weak " and that there was " little indication of any possible federal crime as opposed to local crime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi were part of the anti-terror fusion groups created after 9/11 " after 9/11 , one of the most worrying aspects of that investigation was the lack of coordination between us security services , " clive walker , professor of criminal justice studies at the university of leeds , told deutsche welle .
" this led to the establishment of fusion groups across the us which were supposed to reduce the barriers between organizations .
they fused policing , intelligence and public security functions . "
" the driving force behind these groups was the fight against terrorism but in most places in the us , there really is n't a terrorist threat - so these well-funded groups , which included the fbi , had to find something to justify their existence , such as going after groups like greenpeace and peta under the guise of domestic terror prevention . "
peta investigation leads to members joining us terror list peta was first put under surveillance in the spring of 2001 , a number of months before the september 11 terror attacks , when the fbi started to investigate possible connections between one of the group 's members and the extremist animal liberation front .
the bureau believed the peta member was providing financial support which could aid activist missions to destroy property or attack research facilities involved in the practice of testing on animals .
after the attacks of 9/11 , the investigation rapidly expanded to cover the entire peta operation , its activities and those of a number of its affiliate organizations .
despite no criminal activity ever being documented , the investigation lasted for nearly six years and led to two innocent individuals being placed on the domestic terror watch list until 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peta protests such as this were monitored by the fbi " the fbi investigation into peta took the form of surveillance of entirely lawful free speech activities , including speeches on college campuses and public demonstrations by activists in chicken costumes and other props peta uses frequently , " harold ullman , vice president of peta germany , told deutsche welle .
" there is no justification for such police state tactics .
people speaking out on behalf of animals should be protected not placed under surveillance . " " the use of mccarthyist tactics against peta and other groups that speak out against cruelty to animals and exploitative corporate and government practices is un-american , unconstitutional , and against the interests of a healthy democracy , " ullman added .
" peta 's effective activism scares well-heeled business interests that abuse animals , but when these outfits used their connections to violate the us constitution , the fbi 's ham-fisted attempt to catch us with our pants down resulted in the fbi being caught with its pants down . " fbi suspected greenpeace was planning alaska pipeline attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi believed greenpeace would take violent action the greenpeace investigation started in 1999 when the fbi launched an operation to prevent the suspected disruption by activists of corporate shareholder meetings of two alaskan energy producers .
the protests never took place but the investigation continued for a further three years regardless . the inspector general 's report stated that that the fbi " articulated little or no basis for suspecting a violation of any federal criminal statute " in the greenpeace case and that the fbi crossed the line when it decided to continue its investigation " beyond the point at which its underlying justification no longer existed . " " we have yet to hold a discussion with the fbi about these investigations , although we will seek such a discussion , " mark floegel , a spokesperson for greenpeace us , told deutsche welle . " we 've only seen the justification in the report itself , which in some cases was based on irresponsible reports from what we presume are third parties . in one section , the report refers to a report that someone at greenpeace expressed a desire to blow up the alaska pipeline .
even a superficial investigation into greenpeace history would show greenpeace has always condemned violence and such an act would violate our principles . " " so far , no compensation or offer of an apology has been forthcoming from the fbi , " he added . both greenpeace and peta told deutsche welle that , to their knowledge , no investigations were carried out into their activities post-9/11 by european security agencies . fbi denies targeting groups on grounds of dissent in response to the department of justice report , the fbi maintained that it had not led any investigation into an organization 's activities based on an issue of free speech and that it had not been instructed to carry out any reforms to its procedures as a result . " after more than four years of investigation and an exhaustive review of hundreds of investigative decisions the fbi made after the september 11 attacks , the office of the inspector general -lrb- oig -rrb- did not uncover even a single instance where the fbi targeted any group or any individual based on the exercise of a first amendment right , " read a statement provided by the fbi to deutsche welle . " while the oig disagreed with a handful of the fbi ’ s investigative determinations over the course of six years , it has not recommended any significant modifications to the fbi ’ s authority to investigate criminal conduct or national security threats . " ambiguous laws lead to terror definition problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror laws after 9/11 were flexible and open to abuse professor clive walker believes that ambiguous language and badly defined terms left the security legislation in the us open to interpretation , a situation which in turn created an environment in which the greenpeace and peta investigations could be carried out under anti-terror laws . " the us laws brought in after 9/11 were pretty flexible but the main problem was their definition of terrorism , " he said .
" it 's very vague and therefore open to interpretation which leads to definitional problems in terms of mission objectives and applications . " " it 's cynical to say that the fbi used this ambiguity to manipulate the laws to suit their needs but the truth is , it is a recurring theme in the bureau 's history , " he added .
" since its formation there have been examples of this , such as the communist scare in the 1950 's and the anti-vietnam war movement in the 1960 's .

under homeland security laws brought in to safeguard the us from terrorist activities , the report showed that the fbi improperly investigated greenpeace and peta , along with the thomas merton center , a pittsburgh anti-war organization , the catholic worker , another anti-war group , and an individual quaker peace activist between 2001 and 2006 .
according to the inspector general of the department of justice , the five domestic terror investigations carried out by the fbi had " little or no basis " and were " unreasonable and inconsistent with fbi policy . "
the report also stated that the fbi " made false and misleading statements to congress " about the investigations , wrongly classifying them under " domestic terrorism cases " in an effort to pursue surveillance operations against the liberal organizations .
the investigations were based on " potential crimes " including trespassing and vandalism which the fbi misclassified under acts of terror .
the report said that these crimes " could alternatively have been classified differently , " which would have negated the need for anti-terror investigations into the targeted organizations .
the report added that in several cases , the fbi 's justification for investigation was " factually weak " and that there was " little indication of any possible federal crime as opposed to local crime . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi were part of the anti-terror fusion groups created after 9/11 " after 9/11 , one of the most worrying aspects of that investigation was the lack of coordination between us security services , " clive walker , professor of criminal justice studies at the university of leeds , told deutsche welle .
" this led to the establishment of fusion groups across the us which were supposed to reduce the barriers between organizations .
they fused policing , intelligence and public security functions . "
" the driving force behind these groups was the fight against terrorism but in most places in the us , there really is n't a terrorist threat - so these well-funded groups , which included the fbi , had to find something to justify their existence , such as going after groups like greenpeace and peta under the guise of domestic terror prevention . "
peta investigation leads to members joining us terror list peta was first put under surveillance in the spring of 2001 , a number of months before the september 11 terror attacks , when the fbi started to investigate possible connections between one of the group 's members and the extremist animal liberation front .
the bureau believed the peta member was providing financial support which could aid activist missions to destroy property or attack research facilities involved in the practice of testing on animals .
after the attacks of 9/11 , the investigation rapidly expanded to cover the entire peta operation , its activities and those of a number of its affiliate organizations .
despite no criminal activity ever being documented , the investigation lasted for nearly six years and led to two innocent individuals being placed on the domestic terror watch list until 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peta protests such as this were monitored by the fbi " the fbi investigation into peta took the form of surveillance of entirely lawful free speech activities , including speeches on college campuses and public demonstrations by activists in chicken costumes and other props peta uses frequently , " harold ullman , vice president of peta germany , told deutsche welle .
" there is no justification for such police state tactics .
people speaking out on behalf of animals should be protected not placed under surveillance . " " the use of mccarthyist tactics against peta and other groups that speak out against cruelty to animals and exploitative corporate and government practices is un-american , unconstitutional , and against the interests of a healthy democracy , " ullman added .
" peta 's effective activism scares well-heeled business interests that abuse animals , but when these outfits used their connections to violate the us constitution , the fbi 's ham-fisted attempt to catch us with our pants down resulted in the fbi being caught with its pants down . " fbi suspected greenpeace was planning alaska pipeline attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fbi believed greenpeace would take violent action the greenpeace investigation started in 1999 when the fbi launched an operation to prevent the suspected disruption by activists of corporate shareholder meetings of two alaskan energy producers .
the protests never took place but the investigation continued for a further three years regardless . the inspector general 's report stated that that the fbi " articulated little or no basis for suspecting a violation of any federal criminal statute " in the greenpeace case and that the fbi crossed the line when it decided to continue its investigation " beyond the point at which its underlying justification no longer existed . " " we have yet to hold a discussion with the fbi about these investigations , although we will seek such a discussion , " mark floegel , a spokesperson for greenpeace us , told deutsche welle . " we 've only seen the justification in the report itself , which in some cases was based on irresponsible reports from what we presume are third parties . in one section , the report refers to a report that someone at greenpeace expressed a desire to blow up the alaska pipeline .
even a superficial investigation into greenpeace history would show greenpeace has always condemned violence and such an act would violate our principles . " " so far , no compensation or offer of an apology has been forthcoming from the fbi , " he added . both greenpeace and peta told deutsche welle that , to their knowledge , no investigations were carried out into their activities post-9/11 by european security agencies . fbi denies targeting groups on grounds of dissent in response to the department of justice report , the fbi maintained that it had not led any investigation into an organization 's activities based on an issue of free speech and that it had not been instructed to carry out any reforms to its procedures as a result . " after more than four years of investigation and an exhaustive review of hundreds of investigative decisions the fbi made after the september 11 attacks , the office of the inspector general -lrb- oig -rrb- did not uncover even a single instance where the fbi targeted any group or any individual based on the exercise of a first amendment right , " read a statement provided by the fbi to deutsche welle . " while the oig disagreed with a handful of the fbi ’ s investigative determinations over the course of six years , it has not recommended any significant modifications to the fbi ’ s authority to investigate criminal conduct or national security threats . " ambiguous laws lead to terror definition problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror laws after 9/11 were flexible and open to abuse professor clive walker believes that ambiguous language and badly defined terms left the security legislation in the us open to interpretation , a situation which in turn created an environment in which the greenpeace and peta investigations could be carried out under anti-terror laws . " the us laws brought in after 9/11 were pretty flexible but the main problem was their definition of terrorism , " he said .
" it 's very vague and therefore open to interpretation which leads to definitional problems in terms of mission objectives and applications . " " it 's cynical to say that the fbi used this ambiguity to manipulate the laws to suit their needs but the truth is , it is a recurring theme in the bureau 's history , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : deutsche welle multimedia package : 20 years of reunification gdr dissidents made history - then disappeared into it beaten by reunification , andre hunger gives up east-west couples defy claim that reunited germans remain worlds apart east germany 's doping program casts long shadow over victims german reunification -pipe- 27.09.2010 reunified germany is a nation of many faces and variable success großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once a site of division , berlin 's brandenburg gate is now a symbol of unity two decades after the cold war , germany has made great progress in overcoming social divisions .
but whether true unity has been achieved depends on whom you ask .
we examine what reunification does and could mean . one important measure of today 's undivided germany is economic , and on this score , as on so many others , the picture is mixed . huge strides have been made in the past twenty years .
just about every eastern german city and town has been thoroughly renovated .
and while income and other economic indices in the east are only 70 to 80 percent of what they are in the west , costs of living - especially for rent - are commensurately lower , so one could argue most eastern germans are n't that much worse off than their western fellow citizens . " silicon saxony " with its computer chips , and the optical industry in and around the city of jena in thuringia , are two examples of eastern industrial success . " i 'm very impressed with how the people in germany 's new states mastered the considerable challenges after 1989 , " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , who helped negotiate the original unification treaty , told deutsche welle .
" i 'm not disappointed at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some high-tech industries have flourished in the east but not everyone 's a winner .
as of july 2010 , unemployment in the east -lrb- 11.5 % -rrb- was nearly double what it was in the west -lrb- 6.6 % -rrb- , and an astonishing 50 percent of the 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 103 billion -rrb- in annual developmental subsidies transferred from west to east is eaten up by social benefits and welfare payments . " unfortunately , economic processes do n't work along the lines of what is just , " richard schroeder - a respected former professor of philosophy and theology at berlin 's humboldt university - said at a major conference earlier this year .
" we have large numbers of people who were n't pillars of the old system but whose situations have gotten a lot worse after the economic caesura . " some 1.6 million people have relocated from east to west since 1990 , most in search of better job opportunities , and that trend shows no sign of letting up .
moreover , sociologists speak of a " brain drain " from the east since it 's the better educated who make up the majority of those who leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty apartment blocks are a common sight in hoyerswerda it 's not uncommon to see unneeded housing units being torn down in eastern cities .
the most extreme example is hoyerswerda near germany 's border with poland and the czech republic , which has lost half of its population in the past decade . in these respects , two different economic subsets continue to exist .
and dissatisfaction with such differences and inequities has manifested itself politically . the rise and fragmentation of the left the incorporation of what germans call the " new states " into the political system of the federal republic has wrought changes few would have anticipated back in 1990 . the current german chancellor , angela merkel , hails from the east , although many germans tend to forget that fact .
and though most eastern germans vote for one of the western parties , others have sought their own alternative . the left party , the successor to the old socialist party in communist east germany , combined with left-wing fringe parties from the west , has established itself as a mouthpiece for disgruntled easterners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi -lrb- right -rrb- and westerner oskar lafontaine led the left party to prominence " reunification had a structural flaw in that the elites of the east were n't accepted , and not just the political elites , but the pedagogical , scientific and artistic elites as well , " left party parliamentary leader gregor gysi told deutsche welle .
" in the beginning , they had no time for my party , but they were rebuffed and forced back to us because the other parties were n't prepared to accept them . " the ironic result is that while the spd and the greens are leery of cooperating with former communists , the political left is bifurcated , helping merkel 's center-right government to hold on to power . the establishment of the left party as a form of peaceful political protest can be seen as evidence of eastern germans ' adoption of western democracy .
but it has also deepened many western germans ' sense of a cultural divide between them and their fellow citizens . ost- and westalgia one unambiguously positive aspect of reunification has been the removal of political barriers that kept many german families painfully separated during the cold war .
there are no exact figures for how many west and east germans had relatives in the " other " germany , but an average of 26 million care packages were sent annually from west to east during germany 's division - an indication of the personal hardships caused by political division . " those who felt imprisoned were overjoyed at an end to their suffering , " says brigitte klump , an author whose private petitions to the united nations over the course of many years helped some 4,000 people leave communist east germany .
" and naturally i still feel joy when i hear from people who succeeded in integrating into the west . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are n't many east-west marriages ostalgia - eastern germans ' supposed longing for the way things were - is a regular topic in the media , but in polls only around ten percent of easterners say they preferred life under socialism .
and eastern germans ' self-identification as a group decreases the later they were born . meanwhile , around half of western germans say the time before 1989 was better than afterward .
this reflects their fond memories of a period of affluence and clear social consensus and suggests that " westalgia " is far more prevalent than its eastern equivalent . partnerships between eastern and western germans make up only around four percent of all german marriages .
this may be due to the fact that most germans still stay in the places they grew up and maintain long-term social circles .
but the number of " ossis " and " wessis " tying the knot lags significantly behind that of germans and foreigners . " thanks to reunification , germany as a whole has gotten a lot more diverse , and feelings of togetherness have grown , " wolfgang schaeuble said .
" what we still need is time , patience , including patience with one another , and the experience of having successfully solved problems together . " the global factor one oft-neglected aspect of reunification is the contributions made by residents who do not hold german passports and the effects it had on them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners are also part of the story foreigners account for roughly eight percent of germany 's population , and with the removal of the east-west political divide , german society became much more multicultural , with large communities from eastern europe joining the substantial turkish minority that had established itself in the post-war federal republic . " the german immigrant nation is one of many nationalities , including germans from the old federal republic , others from the former east , millions of ethnic germans from eastern europe as well as an immigrant population of non-german descent , " said germany 's leading immigration expert klaus bade .
" former ' guest workers ' make up the majority , but there are also lots of smaller groups from an ever greater variety of backgrounds . " foreigners have an inestimable impact on today 's german society , and immigration is crucial in offsetting population decline , as both western and eastern germans are having fewer and fewer children . but after a boom immediately following the end of the cold war , the number of foreigners in germany has stagnated .
economists and sociologists see this as a worrisome trend because germany needs to increase its workforce to compensate for the aging population entering retirement . two decades on from 1990 , it is more apparent than ever that " reunification " is not a restoration of a past society , but a process of creating something new that is inextricable from globalization .
old national paradigms are coming under ever increasing challenges , so the future of the new federal republic is likely to be influenced just as much by factors from abroad as from within its own borders . author : jefferson chase editor : kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but whether true unity has been achieved depends on whom you ask .
we examine what reunification does and could mean . one important measure of today 's undivided germany is economic , and on this score , as on so many others , the picture is mixed . huge strides have been made in the past twenty years .
just about every eastern german city and town has been thoroughly renovated .
and while income and other economic indices in the east are only 70 to 80 percent of what they are in the west , costs of living - especially for rent - are commensurately lower , so one could argue most eastern germans are n't that much worse off than their western fellow citizens . " silicon saxony " with its computer chips , and the optical industry in and around the city of jena in thuringia , are two examples of eastern industrial success . " i 'm very impressed with how the people in germany 's new states mastered the considerable challenges after 1989 , " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , who helped negotiate the original unification treaty , told deutsche welle .
" i 'm not disappointed at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some high-tech industries have flourished in the east but not everyone 's a winner .
as of july 2010 , unemployment in the east -lrb- 11.5 % -rrb- was nearly double what it was in the west -lrb- 6.6 % -rrb- , and an astonishing 50 percent of the 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 103 billion -rrb- in annual developmental subsidies transferred from west to east is eaten up by social benefits and welfare payments . " unfortunately , economic processes do n't work along the lines of what is just , " richard schroeder - a respected former professor of philosophy and theology at berlin 's humboldt university - said at a major conference earlier this year .
" we have large numbers of people who were n't pillars of the old system but whose situations have gotten a lot worse after the economic caesura . " some 1.6 million people have relocated from east to west since 1990 , most in search of better job opportunities , and that trend shows no sign of letting up .
moreover , sociologists speak of a " brain drain " from the east since it 's the better educated who make up the majority of those who leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty apartment blocks are a common sight in hoyerswerda it 's not uncommon to see unneeded housing units being torn down in eastern cities .
the most extreme example is hoyerswerda near germany 's border with poland and the czech republic , which has lost half of its population in the past decade . in these respects , two different economic subsets continue to exist .
and dissatisfaction with such differences and inequities has manifested itself politically . the rise and fragmentation of the left the incorporation of what germans call the " new states " into the political system of the federal republic has wrought changes few would have anticipated back in 1990 . the current german chancellor , angela merkel , hails from the east , although many germans tend to forget that fact .
and though most eastern germans vote for one of the western parties , others have sought their own alternative . the left party , the successor to the old socialist party in communist east germany , combined with left-wing fringe parties from the west , has established itself as a mouthpiece for disgruntled easterners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi -lrb- right -rrb- and westerner oskar lafontaine led the left party to prominence " reunification had a structural flaw in that the elites of the east were n't accepted , and not just the political elites , but the pedagogical , scientific and artistic elites as well , " left party parliamentary leader gregor gysi told deutsche welle .
" in the beginning , they had no time for my party , but they were rebuffed and forced back to us because the other parties were n't prepared to accept them . " the ironic result is that while the spd and the greens are leery of cooperating with former communists , the political left is bifurcated , helping merkel 's center-right government to hold on to power . the establishment of the left party as a form of peaceful political protest can be seen as evidence of eastern germans ' adoption of western democracy .
but it has also deepened many western germans ' sense of a cultural divide between them and their fellow citizens . ost- and westalgia one unambiguously positive aspect of reunification has been the removal of political barriers that kept many german families painfully separated during the cold war .
there are no exact figures for how many west and east germans had relatives in the " other " germany , but an average of 26 million care packages were sent annually from west to east during germany 's division - an indication of the personal hardships caused by political division . " those who felt imprisoned were overjoyed at an end to their suffering , " says brigitte klump , an author whose private petitions to the united nations over the course of many years helped some 4,000 people leave communist east germany .

and eastern germans ' self-identification as a group decreases the later they were born . meanwhile , around half of western germans say the time before 1989 was better than afterward .
this reflects their fond memories of a period of affluence and clear social consensus and suggests that " westalgia " is far more prevalent than its eastern equivalent . partnerships between eastern and western germans make up only around four percent of all german marriages .
this may be due to the fact that most germans still stay in the places they grew up and maintain long-term social circles .
but the number of " ossis " and " wessis " tying the knot lags significantly behind that of germans and foreigners . " thanks to reunification , germany as a whole has gotten a lot more diverse , and feelings of togetherness have grown , " wolfgang schaeuble said .

" the german immigrant nation is one of many nationalities , including germans from the old federal republic , others from the former east , millions of ethnic germans from eastern europe as well as an immigrant population of non-german descent , " said germany 's leading immigration expert klaus bade .

but whether true unity has been achieved depends on whom you ask .
we examine what reunification does and could mean . one important measure of today 's undivided germany is economic , and on this score , as on so many others , the picture is mixed . huge strides have been made in the past twenty years .
just about every eastern german city and town has been thoroughly renovated .
and while income and other economic indices in the east are only 70 to 80 percent of what they are in the west , costs of living - especially for rent - are commensurately lower , so one could argue most eastern germans are n't that much worse off than their western fellow citizens . " silicon saxony " with its computer chips , and the optical industry in and around the city of jena in thuringia , are two examples of eastern industrial success . " i 'm very impressed with how the people in germany 's new states mastered the considerable challenges after 1989 , " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , who helped negotiate the original unification treaty , told deutsche welle .
" i 'm not disappointed at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some high-tech industries have flourished in the east but not everyone 's a winner .
as of july 2010 , unemployment in the east -lrb- 11.5 % -rrb- was nearly double what it was in the west -lrb- 6.6 % -rrb- , and an astonishing 50 percent of the 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 103 billion -rrb- in annual developmental subsidies transferred from west to east is eaten up by social benefits and welfare payments . " unfortunately , economic processes do n't work along the lines of what is just , " richard schroeder - a respected former professor of philosophy and theology at berlin 's humboldt university - said at a major conference earlier this year .
" we have large numbers of people who were n't pillars of the old system but whose situations have gotten a lot worse after the economic caesura . " some 1.6 million people have relocated from east to west since 1990 , most in search of better job opportunities , and that trend shows no sign of letting up .
moreover , sociologists speak of a " brain drain " from the east since it 's the better educated who make up the majority of those who leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty apartment blocks are a common sight in hoyerswerda it 's not uncommon to see unneeded housing units being torn down in eastern cities .
the most extreme example is hoyerswerda near germany 's border with poland and the czech republic , which has lost half of its population in the past decade . in these respects , two different economic subsets continue to exist .
and dissatisfaction with such differences and inequities has manifested itself politically . the rise and fragmentation of the left the incorporation of what germans call the " new states " into the political system of the federal republic has wrought changes few would have anticipated back in 1990 . the current german chancellor , angela merkel , hails from the east , although many germans tend to forget that fact .
and though most eastern germans vote for one of the western parties , others have sought their own alternative . the left party , the successor to the old socialist party in communist east germany , combined with left-wing fringe parties from the west , has established itself as a mouthpiece for disgruntled easterners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi -lrb- right -rrb- and westerner oskar lafontaine led the left party to prominence " reunification had a structural flaw in that the elites of the east were n't accepted , and not just the political elites , but the pedagogical , scientific and artistic elites as well , " left party parliamentary leader gregor gysi told deutsche welle .
" in the beginning , they had no time for my party , but they were rebuffed and forced back to us because the other parties were n't prepared to accept them . " the ironic result is that while the spd and the greens are leery of cooperating with former communists , the political left is bifurcated , helping merkel 's center-right government to hold on to power . the establishment of the left party as a form of peaceful political protest can be seen as evidence of eastern germans ' adoption of western democracy .
but it has also deepened many western germans ' sense of a cultural divide between them and their fellow citizens . ost- and westalgia one unambiguously positive aspect of reunification has been the removal of political barriers that kept many german families painfully separated during the cold war .
there are no exact figures for how many west and east germans had relatives in the " other " germany , but an average of 26 million care packages were sent annually from west to east during germany 's division - an indication of the personal hardships caused by political division . " those who felt imprisoned were overjoyed at an end to their suffering , " says brigitte klump , an author whose private petitions to the united nations over the course of many years helped some 4,000 people leave communist east germany .
" and naturally i still feel joy when i hear from people who succeeded in integrating into the west . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are n't many east-west marriages ostalgia - eastern germans ' supposed longing for the way things were - is a regular topic in the media , but in polls only around ten percent of easterners say they preferred life under socialism .
and eastern germans ' self-identification as a group decreases the later they were born . meanwhile , around half of western germans say the time before 1989 was better than afterward .
this reflects their fond memories of a period of affluence and clear social consensus and suggests that " westalgia " is far more prevalent than its eastern equivalent . partnerships between eastern and western germans make up only around four percent of all german marriages .
this may be due to the fact that most germans still stay in the places they grew up and maintain long-term social circles .
but the number of " ossis " and " wessis " tying the knot lags significantly behind that of germans and foreigners . " thanks to reunification , germany as a whole has gotten a lot more diverse , and feelings of togetherness have grown , " wolfgang schaeuble said .
" what we still need is time , patience , including patience with one another , and the experience of having successfully solved problems together . " the global factor one oft-neglected aspect of reunification is the contributions made by residents who do not hold german passports and the effects it had on them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners are also part of the story foreigners account for roughly eight percent of germany 's population , and with the removal of the east-west political divide , german society became much more multicultural , with large communities from eastern europe joining the substantial turkish minority that had established itself in the post-war federal republic . " the german immigrant nation is one of many nationalities , including germans from the old federal republic , others from the former east , millions of ethnic germans from eastern europe as well as an immigrant population of non-german descent , " said germany 's leading immigration expert klaus bade .
" former ' guest workers ' make up the majority , but there are also lots of smaller groups from an ever greater variety of backgrounds . " foreigners have an inestimable impact on today 's german society , and immigration is crucial in offsetting population decline , as both western and eastern germans are having fewer and fewer children . but after a boom immediately following the end of the cold war , the number of foreigners in germany has stagnated .
economists and sociologists see this as a worrisome trend because germany needs to increase its workforce to compensate for the aging population entering retirement . two decades on from 1990 , it is more apparent than ever that " reunification " is not a restoration of a past society , but a process of creating something new that is inextricable from globalization .
old national paradigms are coming under ever increasing challenges , so the future of the new federal republic is likely to be influenced just as much by factors from abroad as from within its own borders . author : jefferson chase editor : kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de festivals -pipe- 27.09.2010 distinguished german composer henze is honored at home großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' gisela ! ' pits gritty germany against explosive italy in its culture capital year , germany 's ruhr region is honoring its most distinguished musical son - composer hans werner henze - with a plethora of concerts and events known collectively as " the henze project . " born in the german town of guetersloh in 1926 , hans werner henze is one of germany 's greatest living composers and one of the most significant figures of 20th century classical music .
he 's also been the initiator of numerous projects designed to encourage and nurture young musical talent .
most notably , in 1976 , he founded the cantiere internazionale d 'arte summer academy in montepulciano , which remains a benchmark for progressive music teaching the world over . now , the ruhr valley is honoring henze with a plethora of concerts and events , known collectively as " the henze project . "
in keeping with the composer 's long-standing commitment to encouraging young talent , the jewel in the project 's crown is a new work devised for and with young people . a new composition composed in collaboration with the writers michael kerstan and christian lehnert , " gisela ! - or , the strange and memorable paths of happiness , " is performed by a colorful mix of up-and-coming talent and established professional innovators . several parts are taken by students of essen 's folkswang university , the choir is a youth group from dortmund , and the regional youth ensemble has worked together with cutting-edge contemporary music outfit musikfabrik to create its own distinctive sound . asked by deutsche welle why his work with young people was so important to him , henze answered rather enigmatically : " people are like cats .
when a cat has a litter , all of the kittens are different . each one has a different design , although they come from the same father and mother .
the same goes for -lsb- young -rsb- musicians . "
he said he sees himself not as a teacher , but as an " ally , " henze added .
from che guevara to gisela from oberhausen one noticeable difference between the octogenarian maestro and the up-and-coming generation of composers is that whereas henze 's career has been likened to a seismograph through which the great political and social upheavals of the twentieth century can be read , critics often bemoan the lack of political engagement among contemporary musicians and artists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henze is a national treasure - and an expatriot for his part , henze theorized that political engagement has waned along with certain cultural heroes .
" i think there 's been a sort of withdrawal , " henze said .
" in a funny way , i think it has a lot to do with the death of figures like ernesto -lsb- che -rsb- guevara and rudi dutschke .
somehow , these deaths were followed by a feeling of helplessness , a powerlessness to rebel , however necessary rebellion may be . " henze , who knew both the argentinean revolutionary and the leader of the 1968 german student movement personally , said the political content of his work has never been intentional , but has rather stemmed from his interest in people and his sensitivity to the world around him . music should not be written for an elite , henze insists .
instead , " it should try to reach as wide , and as deep as it can . " from sunny naples to grey oberhausen set in the heartland of germany 's industrial ruhr valley , " gisela ! " looks set to succeed in reaching out to a wider audience by tapping into discourse of regional identity , brought about by essen 's european capital of culture status . " gisela ! " is the story of the eponymous protagonist , a young woman from oberhausen who visits naples with her boyfriend hanspeter , only to fall in love with gennaro , a charismatic italian with a penchant for commedia dell 'arte-style mischief .
determined to prove that her hometown is not the grim and grimy industrial landscape of genarro 's prejudice , but rather part of a sparkling new european capital of culture , gisela takes her new lover home with her . the basic story line could have been drafted by the local tourist board , but the conclusion is a bit more enigmatic .
the inevitable confrontation between the rival lovers is interrupted by the joyful explosion of vesuvius in approbation of gisela 's union with gennaro .
germany 's brand new culture capital seems to have won the blessing of italy 's noble cultural tradition .
however , as the curtain falls , the volcano begins to rain dark ash .
although , in the words of his long-term collaborator michael kerstan , he 's " still very much a german personality , " hans werner henze left germany in 1956 , making italy his permanent home .
unlike gisela , henze has no intentions of returning permanently .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 27.09.2010 limping into champions league fixture , bayern extend with van gaal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is to stay on in munich until the end of the 2011-2012 season fresh off a contract extension with coach louis van gaal , bayern munich are looking for redemption on tuesday in europe .
injury trouble and dysfunction in attack have meant their bundesliga campaign is a shambles . five goals , eight points , ninth place .
such is bayern munich 's meager return from the first six matches of the new bundesliga season .
in that bayern had got off to a slow start last year too before finishing as champions , players and club officials had , until recently , been leery of making critical statements .
since saturday 's 2-1 home loss to surprise league leaders mainz , all that has changed .
“ we have too many players who are n't playing up to their usual standard , ” said defender philipp lahm .
“ work-rate , aggressiveness , passion - we 're missing all of it at the moment , ” said bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
the loss left bayern 10 points adrift of mainz , and that wide margin appears to be ringing a few alarm bells on saebenerstrasse .
“ it 's going to be hard to make up for this deficit , ” lahm added in his post-game remarks .
“ we let happen precisely what we did n't want to happen .
it 's going to take a long time to make up 10 points . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's captain in south africa , lahm , speaks his mind at bayern too sitting prettier luckily for bayern , the champions league is a different story .
there , the bavarians can head to switzerland to take on fc basel with their heads held high .
as if to underscore the club 's confidence that all was not yet lost , bayern 's head coach , louis van gaal , signed a one-year contract extension in basel on monday .
the deal keeps him and his supporting cast of coaches on at the club through june 2012 .
two weeks ago , van gaal 's men broke down a dogged as roma defense and got a 2-0 win to top their group .
basel , meanwhile , stumbled to a 2-1 loss in romania to cfr cluj .
if bayern can manage a win at the st. jakob park on tuesday , they could stay in the driver 's seat in group e , with a potentially winnable home-and-away match-up with cluj next on the club 's docket .
some in the club are already looking to the champions league campaign as a corrective to the poor league start .
“ we need to stay calm , ” said hamit altintop , the turkey winger who has begun to see more playing time with franck ribery out injured for the coming weeks .
“ we won the first game and can afford to play it safe - we do n't have to go storming into attack from the get-go . ”
hurting for goals perhaps it would n't do much good to play things hell-for-leather .
it 's in attack that bayern have disappointed the most .
despite starting the potent likes of thomas mueller , toni kroos , ivica olic and miroslav klose on saturday , bayern failed to find the net - relying instead on a mainz own-goal to get on the scoreboard .
this is not to say bayern 's offensive front is n't able to keep the ball , or create chances .
indeed , they had more than 70 percent of the ball and shot it 15 times .
but many of those chances were not of a particularly high standard , and their shooting was poor .
bayern put the ball on target just four times .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben scored 23 goals and set up eight more for bayern last season it would seem that the missing creativity , not to mention finishing , of arjen robben is holding the team back .
the dutchman 's muscle tear will keep him out of the lineup until the new year , and now franck ribery 's injured ankle means he 'll miss another month at least .
bayern could use their offensive potency .
kroos and mueller filled in fairly effectively for robben and ribery on the two wings on saturday , but this left the side bereft of ideas in the middle , where neither strikers olic and klose , nor defensive midfielders bastian schweinsteiger and mark van bommel offered much creativity .
a change of system , perhaps one that brings mueller and / or kroos into the middle , may do the trick - and in truth , it will have to .
bayern 's small squad means that there are no further personnel options left for van gaal should he wish to shake up the offense .
about a month ago , during the transfer-rumor-mad silly season , big-name playmakers like rafael van de vaart were brought up in connection with bayern munich . van gaal told reporters then that he did n't feel he needed to go out and buy any players to bolster the squad .
“ alaba is better ! ” van gaal had said , referring to one of his favorite young charges , the 18-year-old austrian david alaba , who he 'd used as an emergency wingback last year , but whose real strength is in the offensive midfield .
it was a bold statement - but perhaps we 'd agree with him , if we could only see alaba play .
but that poor lad is hurt as well .

consumers will now also have warranty repair services in all eu countries . over the weekend , apple managed to defuse a potential legal tangle with the european union 's antitrust regulators by adjusting its iphone policies .
the company agreed to make warranty repair services equally available throughout european union countries , regardless of where a phone was purchased .
it also agreed to loosen restrictions on programming tools used to develop apps , the small programs designed to run on smartphones .

critics doubt it . one of the hot topics at this year 's iaa commercial vehicles trade show in hanover is the german governent 's nationwide " long truck " field trial planned some time next year .
the trails could lead to new regulations on semi-truck lengths , creating new business opportunities for both makers of long-haul transportation vehicles and logistics companies operating them .
experts say longer trucks could reduce trucking costs by 20 to 25 percent .
" we build long trucks , and the experience of our customers using them in scandinavia , the netherlands and other markets has been good , " detlef hug , a spokesman for german truck maker man , told deutsche welle .
" of course , germany has its own challenges like heavy traffic and hilly terrain .
so that 's why it is a good idea to conduct a nationwide field trial so that we can test fuel and co2 emission reduction , safety , the impact on car drivers and more . "
truck traffic to increase 70 percent there is a sense of political urgency in berlin .
the federal transportation ministry estimates that truck traffic - already choking numerous german highways - will increase by 70 percent over the next 15 years .
and no one knows where all those vehicles should go .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's autobahns look more like a truck parking lot these days three years ago , several german states launched their own field trials – with mixed results .
accompanying studies also painted a blurred picture .
one of the studies , by the technical rwth aachen university , concluded that long trucks are safe and would reduce emissions .
longer vehicles , it noted , hardly use more fuel than current shorter models ; only during acceleration does the additional load make the truck 's engine slightly less efficient .
but another study by the fraunhofer institute for systems and innovative research claimed that while long trucks could relieve roads and the environment in the short term , they would , in the long term , cause a shift from rail to road that would offset any benefits .
" we 're aware of the work the states have done and the results of their tests will flow into a joint working group between the federal and state transportation ministries , " a spokesman from the federal transportation ministry told deutsche welle .
" these tests , however , were on a small scale .
what is needed is a much larger field trial across the entire country to determine the impact on logistics . "
plenty of interest more than 300 companies , including man , have already registered to participate in the federal government 's planned nationwide test , though a final number of participants has yet to be set .
the goal is to test tractor-trailer combinations with a length of 25.25 meters -lrb- 83 feet -rrb- , or 6.5 meters -lrb- 21 feet -rrb- longer than currently allowed .
the gross weight of the vehicles will remain at the current 44 tons for semi-trucks or 44 for " intermodal " container trucks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man has a booth at the iaa commercial vehicles trade show in hanover " we have heard some talk about the planned nationwide field trial testing 60-ton vehicles , " the ministry spokesman said .
" we have no intention to change the weight .
this is all about increasing volume . "
long trucks , the spokesman said , would allow voluminous goods to be transported with one vehicle , for instance , instead of breaking down the item to transport it with three trucks .
critics of heavy and long 60-ton trucks point to a number of problems , such as the damage they could do to roads and bridges because of their added weight and the lack of sufficiently secure guard rails .
yet long trucks also have their critics , too .
" there are a number of issues to be concerned about , " said martin roggermann from the german pro-rail alliance .
" long trucks are more difficult to pass , they need more space for turning at intersections and do n't fit into the current autobahn parking facilities , not too mention safety issues . "
shift from road to rail but roggermann 's biggest bone of contention is that the expected lower operating costs of long trucks could undermine efforts by his organization and others to shift freight off the road and onto rail .
" we are really concerned about the shift from rail to the road , " he said .
" we do n't believe long trucks will result in fewer trucks but in more trucks and in more problems on german roads . "
moreover , roggermann and others worry that if 40-ton long trucks are allowed , it will only be a matter of time before 60-ton " gigaliners " roar down german roads .
scandinavia began with 40-ton vehicles and later allowed the heavier vehicles , he noted .
few experts will disagree that competition for road freight business has become cutthroat in europe , especially since recent eastward european union expansion .
and plenty of them admit that the prospect of allowing larger vehicles to carry more for less will only fuel that competition .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homburger said she could not understand the bonuses paid the parliamentary leader of the pro-business free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , birgit homburger , told the german tagesspiegel newspaper that " a new culture of responsibility must be created using new legal parameters . "
" i can not understand these bonuses , " she said in the interview , which was also published on the fdp 's website .
" for me these events prove once again that we need a new culture of responsibility in the economy . "
earlier this month , the german government defended the bonus payouts to employees of hypo real estate , which was taken into state ownership when it faced collapse during the financial crisis , as " not inappropriate . "
it said that the one-time payments were necessary to hold on to experienced managers , despite the bank having to rely on government bailouts .
' culture of responsibility missing ' homburger , on the other hand , said that a culture of responsibility present in other industries was missing in the capital-based enterprises and the financial sector - and that external action was necessary to prevent failure from being rewarded .
" all appeals in this direction have so far been without the desired effect , as the excesses of recent years have shown , " said homburger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competition commissioner almunia said he had doubts about the bank 's viability " for that reason i would like new rules .
those who take decisions must also be responsible for their consequences . "
high-profile victim hypo real estate was germany 's highest-profile victim of the financial crisis and had to be nationalized in 2009 .
it initially received almost 8 billion euros in state funds and more than 100 billion euros in state guarantees .
the bank was the only german institution to fail eu-wide " stress tests " in july , which led to the government offering it a further 40 billion euros in guarantees .
on friday , the european union 's competition commissioner joaquin almunia said he had " doubts " about the long-term viability of the bank , although the european commission granted temporary approval for state support to continue .

' pits gritty germany against explosive italy in its culture capital year , germany 's ruhr region is honoring its most distinguished musical son - composer hans werner henze - with a plethora of concerts and events known collectively as " the henze project . " born in the german town of guetersloh in 1926 , hans werner henze is one of germany 's greatest living composers and one of the most significant figures of 20th century classical music .
he 's also been the initiator of numerous projects designed to encourage and nurture young musical talent .
most notably , in 1976 , he founded the cantiere internazionale d 'arte summer academy in montepulciano , which remains a benchmark for progressive music teaching the world over . now , the ruhr valley is honoring henze with a plethora of concerts and events , known collectively as " the henze project . "
in keeping with the composer 's long-standing commitment to encouraging young talent , the jewel in the project 's crown is a new work devised for and with young people . a new composition composed in collaboration with the writers michael kerstan and christian lehnert , " gisela ! - or , the strange and memorable paths of happiness , " is performed by a colorful mix of up-and-coming talent and established professional innovators . several parts are taken by students of essen 's folkswang university , the choir is a youth group from dortmund , and the regional youth ensemble has worked together with cutting-edge contemporary music outfit musikfabrik to create its own distinctive sound . asked by deutsche welle why his work with young people was so important to him , henze answered rather enigmatically : " people are like cats .
when a cat has a litter , all of the kittens are different . each one has a different design , although they come from the same father and mother .
the same goes for -lsb- young -rsb- musicians . "
he said he sees himself not as a teacher , but as an " ally , " henze added .
from che guevara to gisela from oberhausen one noticeable difference between the octogenarian maestro and the up-and-coming generation of composers is that whereas henze 's career has been likened to a seismograph through which the great political and social upheavals of the twentieth century can be read , critics often bemoan the lack of political engagement among contemporary musicians and artists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henze is a national treasure - and an expatriot for his part , henze theorized that political engagement has waned along with certain cultural heroes .
" i think there 's been a sort of withdrawal , " henze said .
" in a funny way , i think it has a lot to do with the death of figures like ernesto -lsb- che -rsb- guevara and rudi dutschke .
somehow , these deaths were followed by a feeling of helplessness , a powerlessness to rebel , however necessary rebellion may be . " henze , who knew both the argentinean revolutionary and the leader of the 1968 german student movement personally , said the political content of his work has never been intentional , but has rather stemmed from his interest in people and his sensitivity to the world around him . music should not be written for an elite , henze insists .
instead , " it should try to reach as wide , and as deep as it can . " from sunny naples to grey oberhausen set in the heartland of germany 's industrial ruhr valley , " gisela ! " looks set to succeed in reaching out to a wider audience by tapping into discourse of regional identity , brought about by essen 's european capital of culture status . " gisela ! " is the story of the eponymous protagonist , a young woman from oberhausen who visits naples with her boyfriend hanspeter , only to fall in love with gennaro , a charismatic italian with a penchant for commedia dell 'arte-style mischief .
determined to prove that her hometown is not the grim and grimy industrial landscape of genarro 's prejudice , but rather part of a sparkling new european capital of culture , gisela takes her new lover home with her . the basic story line could have been drafted by the local tourist board , but the conclusion is a bit more enigmatic .
the inevitable confrontation between the rival lovers is interrupted by the joyful explosion of vesuvius in approbation of gisela 's union with gennaro .
germany 's brand new culture capital seems to have won the blessing of italy 's noble cultural tradition .
however , as the curtain falls , the volcano begins to rain dark ash .
although , in the words of his long-term collaborator michael kerstan , he 's " still very much a german personality , " hans werner henze left germany in 1956 , making italy his permanent home .
unlike gisela , henze has no intentions of returning permanently .

but the invasive searches have stirred privacy concerns . germany began its six-month test period of two full-body scanners at hamburg airport on monday as critics continued to denounce the technology as too invasive .
interior minister thomas de maiziere was one of the first to pass through one of the scanners , saying he did not feel cramped or uncomfortable inside .
“ today is an important step on the way to better security in german airports , ” he said .
the german interior ministry , which is responsible for the project , selected hamburg for the trial run under real airport conditions because it is large , but not so large that technical glitches would seriously disrupt the flow of passenger traffic .
hamburg is germany 's fifth largest airport and serves about 12 million passengers annually .
full-body scanners are already in use in the united states and several european countries but , due to widespread privacy concerns , germany has been slow to test the technology .
until now , the machines had only been tested in the laboratory at the federal police academy in luebeck .
the scanners use low-frequency electromagnetic waves to sweep a schematic representation of the human body to check for concealed weapons or explosives .
passengers walk through a three-meter -lrb- 10 foot -rrb- high and two-meter wide cabin and are scanned by the waves , which the machine 's manufacturer says are 10,000-times weaker than the ordinary electro-smog from cell phones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics , like peter schaar , warn that scanners are too invasive scanners ' too invasive ' , critics warn privacy advocates oppose the use of the technology because they say it is too invasive and could reveal embarrassing details about a passenger .
peter schaar , germany 's federal commissioner for data protection , cautioned that “ very sensitive areas ” of a person 's private life could be revealed , such as breast implants , colostomies or other medical aids .
security experts argue , however , that the scanners are indispensable because they detect things , like plastic explosives and ceramic weapons , which conventional metal detectors would not discover .
this has not stopped some countries , notably italy , from scrapping the scanners .
after a six-month trial at airports in rome , venice and palermo , the machines are no longer in use after being deemed too slow and ineffective .

but the invasive searches have stirred privacy concerns . germany began its six-month test period of two full-body scanners at hamburg airport on monday as critics continued to denounce the technology as too invasive .
interior minister thomas de maiziere was one of the first to pass through one of the scanners , saying he did not feel cramped or uncomfortable inside .
“ today is an important step on the way to better security in german airports , ” he said .
the german interior ministry , which is responsible for the project , selected hamburg for the trial run under real airport conditions because it is large , but not so large that technical glitches would seriously disrupt the flow of passenger traffic .
hamburg is germany 's fifth largest airport and serves about 12 million passengers annually .
full-body scanners are already in use in the united states and several european countries but , due to widespread privacy concerns , germany has been slow to test the technology .
until now , the machines had only been tested in the laboratory at the federal police academy in luebeck .
the scanners use low-frequency electromagnetic waves to sweep a schematic representation of the human body to check for concealed weapons or explosives .
passengers walk through a three-meter -lrb- 10 foot -rrb- high and two-meter wide cabin and are scanned by the waves , which the machine 's manufacturer says are 10,000-times weaker than the ordinary electro-smog from cell phones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics , like peter schaar , warn that scanners are too invasive scanners ' too invasive ' , critics warn privacy advocates oppose the use of the technology because they say it is too invasive and could reveal embarrassing details about a passenger .
peter schaar , germany 's federal commissioner for data protection , cautioned that “ very sensitive areas ” of a person 's private life could be revealed , such as breast implants , colostomies or other medical aids .
security experts argue , however , that the scanners are indispensable because they detect things , like plastic explosives and ceramic weapons , which conventional metal detectors would not discover .
this has not stopped some countries , notably italy , from scrapping the scanners .
after a six-month trial at airports in rome , venice and palermo , the machines are no longer in use after being deemed too slow and ineffective .
" we did n't get good results during testing , ” said vito riggio , the president of italy 's aviation authority .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homburger said she could not understand the bonuses paid the parliamentary leader of the pro-business free democrat party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , birgit homburger , told the german tagesspiegel newspaper that " a new culture of responsibility must be created using new legal parameters . "
" i can not understand these bonuses , " she said in the interview , which was also published on the fdp 's website .
" for me these events prove once again that we need a new culture of responsibility in the economy . "
earlier this month , the german government defended the bonus payouts to employees of hypo real estate , which was taken into state ownership when it faced collapse during the financial crisis , as " not inappropriate . "
it said that the one-time payments were necessary to hold on to experienced managers , despite the bank having to rely on government bailouts .
' culture of responsibility missing ' homburger , on the other hand , said that a culture of responsibility present in other industries was missing in the capital-based enterprises and the financial sector - and that external action was necessary to prevent failure from being rewarded .
" all appeals in this direction have so far been without the desired effect , as the excesses of recent years have shown , " said homburger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competition commissioner almunia said he had doubts about the bank 's viability " for that reason i would like new rules .
those who take decisions must also be responsible for their consequences . "

meanwhile , a ban on west bank construction has ended - the issue is a major sticking point in mideast peace talks . a ship carrying nine jewish activists from germany , britain , israel and the us set sail on sunday to deliver aid to the gaza strip .
the british boat " irene " departed sunday from famagusta in cyprus in protest against israel 's blockade of the palestinian territory .
the israeli foreign ministry called the move a " provocation . "
' a sacred duty ' the activists included 82-year-old holocaust survivor reuven moskovitz .
" it is a sacred duty for me , as a -lsb- holocaust -rsb- survivor , to protest against the persecution , the oppression and the imprisonment of so many people in gaza , including more than 800,000 children , " moskovitz said .
the trip - which was coordinated by the german organization jewish voice for just peace in the near east and the british group jews for justice for palestinians - intends to bring school supplies , musical instruments and fishing nets into gaza .
it comes after israel 's deadly raid of a gaza-bound aid ship last may , resulting in the deaths of nine turkish activists .
israeli defence minister ehud barak has repeatedly warned that israel will intercept any ship nearing gaza .

netanyahu urges restraint the launch of the aid ship on sunday came on the last day of israel 's freeze on settlement building in the occupied territories on the west bank .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu urged israeli settlers in a statement to exercise restraint after the moratorium expires – in an apparent bid to keep alive peace talks with the palestinians .
" the prime minister calls on the residents in judea and samaria -lsb- the west bank -rsb- and the political parties to show restraint and responsibility today and in the future exactly as they showed restraint and responsibility throughout the months of the freeze , " the statement read .
a ' 50-50 ' chance palestinian president mahmud abbas had earlier vowed to abandon peace talks should the jewish settlers recommence construction on occupied land , though he later said in an interview that he would remain in the talks with the agreement of the arab league .
" israel must choose between peace and the continuation of settlements , " he told the united nations in new york on saturday , denouncing israel 's " mentality of expansion and domination " in the west bank .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barak believes there is a 50 percent chance for the moratorium 's extension while abbas 's spokesman told reporters that there was no progress in a us-led push to extend the moratorium , israeli defence minister barak maintained until the last minute that an extension would be possible .
" i think that the chance of achieving a mutually agreed understanding about -lsb- a -rsb- moratorium is 50-50 , " barak said in a bbc interview in new york where he was meeting with us officials , adding , " i think that the chances of having a peace process is much higher . "
settlers to start new constructions as the official moratorium came to an end , israeli settlers were poised to begin construction on new developments in palestinian territory .
settlers and their supporters held a rally in the settlement of revava to mark the end of the freeze .
in another settlement the foundation stone for a new kindergarten was laid .

" the prime minister calls on the residents in judea and samaria -lsb- the west bank -rsb- and the political parties to show restraint and responsibility today and in the future exactly as they showed restraint and responsibility throughout the months of the freeze , " the statement read .
a ' 50-50 ' chance palestinian president mahmud abbas had earlier vowed to abandon peace talks should the jewish settlers recommence construction on occupied land , though he later said in an interview that he would remain in the talks with the agreement of the arab league .
" israel must choose between peace and the continuation of settlements , " he told the united nations in new york on saturday , denouncing israel 's " mentality of expansion and domination " in the west bank .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barak believes there is a 50 percent chance for the moratorium 's extension while abbas 's spokesman told reporters that there was no progress in a us-led push to extend the moratorium , israeli defence minister barak maintained until the last minute that an extension would be possible .
" i think that the chance of achieving a mutually agreed understanding about -lsb- a -rsb- moratorium is 50-50 , " barak said in a bbc interview in new york where he was meeting with us officials , adding , " i think that the chances of having a peace process is much higher . "
settlers to start new constructions as the official moratorium came to an end , israeli settlers were poised to begin construction on new developments in palestinian territory .
settlers and their supporters held a rally in the settlement of revava to mark the end of the freeze .
in another settlement the foundation stone for a new kindergarten was laid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settlement construction has been on hold for 10 months but it was not expected that there would be a massive surge in construction activity .
" we are getting back to business as usual and building but we will respect the prime minister 's request , " said david ha 'ivri , head of the samaria regional council .
over 430,000 jews live in more than 100 settlements across territory in the west bank and east jerusalem that israel captured from jordan in 1967 .

the british boat " irene " departed sunday from famagusta in cyprus in protest against israel 's blockade of the palestinian territory .

the trip - which was coordinated by the german organization jewish voice for just peace in the near east and the british group jews for justice for palestinians - intends to bring school supplies , musical instruments and fishing nets into gaza .

speaking to the european parliament 's economic affairs committee , european central bank president jean-claude trichet warned that current oversight on eu states ' budgets is too lax , and called for a board of " wise men and women " to watch over budget discipline .
" what has been lacking is some kind of incentive to manage finances responsibly , " trichet said .
" indeed , a core , absolutely indispensable , element of an effective surveillance mechanism is a functioning mechanism of incentives and sanctions - both financial and non-financial . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet said the eu has been lacking incentives for financial responsibility under the eu 's stability and growth pact , member states must keep their budget deficits within three percent of gross domestic product .
but several member states - most notably greece - have flouted the rules , leading to a decline in the eu 's credibility .
sanctions to be quick and ' semi-automatic ' trichet 's comments support a proposal by european economic commissioner olli rehn to impose " semi-automatic " sanctions against such eu members who break budget rules .
the european commission is to lay out the details of its enforcement plan on wednesday .
reports say rehn would propose fines of 0.2 percent of gdp for countries who repeatedly fail to comply with financial rules .
in addition , countries with slipping competitiveness or whose growth is based on " excessive imbalances " like the credit boom in the baltic states would receive fines of 0.1 percent of gdp .
" sanctions ... need to be triggered early enough in the process so that they are essentially preventive , " rehn said monday .
" this is very important in order to ensure fiscal discipline , and sustainable growth in the eu . "
germany advocates harshness germany , traditionally one of the most fiscally conservative eu members , weighed in on the enforcement plan with finance minister wolfgang schaeuble writing a letter to his counterparts in the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble 's proposals on sanctions are among the strictest " the creation of stronger incentives to prevent and correct excessive government deficits stands at the very core of our endeavors to enforce fiscal and economy governance in the eu , " he wrote .
germany 's proposals have been some of the most draconian in the bloc .
schaeuble also called for the sanctions to affect payments from the eu 's substantial regional development and agricultural funds , and his office is reportedly considering supporting the exclusion of fiscal rule breakers from eu decision making .
meanwhile reports said italy , france and spain - which would all have to make significant reductions to their already-reduced budgets - were likely to oppose the new sanctions .

opposition parties claim the package will make the poor poorer . german labor minister ursula von der leyen has defended a minimal rise in welfare payments against sharp criticism from opposition parties and trade unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 5 euro increase per month has been branded derisory " the rates are very fair , " she told the daily bild newspaper , following criticism of a rise of 5 euros -lrb- $ 6.70 -rrb- a month which had been agreed by the coalition on sunday .
currently , germany 's 6.5 million " hartz iv " welfare recipients receive up to 359 euros per month .
" the federal statistical office analyzed what people on low earnings were able to spend each month , " said von der leyen , citing sales staff , janitors and hairdressers as examples .
" the calculations show accurately what the subsistence level is . "
' bad news for welfare recipients ' trade unions , as well as opposition parties such as the social democrats and greens , have warned that the rise is not enough and means that the poor will drift deeper into economic difficulties .
however , christian democrat von der leyen said that welfare rates had to be compared with lower level incomes in the working population .
" whoever demands that hartz iv should be higher must justify it by looking at the statistical data , compared with employees who work full time , " said the minister .
" those employees pay for hartz iv through their taxes and , in the end , many of them do not have much more money to spare -lsb- than hartz iv recipients -rsb- . "
no tobacco and alcohol allowance von der leyen defended the fact that the hartz iv would no longer provide an allowance for alcohol and tobacco .
while provision for basic needs was " sacrosanct , " she said , such products did not fall into this category .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will no longer be an allowance for alcohol or cigarettes the minister argued that any attempt by opposition parties to block the reforms in germany 's upper house - the bundesrat , where the ruling coalition has no majority - could not be justified .
chancellor angela merkel and party leaders from coalition partners the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- met to agree the changes on sunday .
monthly benefits for children are set to remain the same at 215 euros , 251 euros and 287 euros for children under age six , aged six to 14 and 14-18 , respectively .
however , the reforms include plans for " non-cash " benefits , such as a chip card that gives needy children access to educational and recreational services .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de consumer electronics -pipe- 27.09.2010 apple sidesteps eu probe with changes to iphone policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple iphone warranties will now apply throughout the eu the european commission has dropped a probe into apple after the company agreed to change its policy toward iphone app developers .
consumers will now also have warranty repair services in all eu countries . over the weekend , apple managed to defuse a potential legal tangle with the european union 's antitrust regulators by adjusting its iphone policies .
the company agreed to make warranty repair services equally available throughout european union countries , regardless of where a phone was purchased .
it also agreed to loosen restrictions on programming tools used to develop apps , the small programs designed to run on smartphones .
in doing so , the company avoided fines which could have been as high as 10 percent of its yearly turnover .
eu competition commissioner joaquin almunia said in a statement on saturday that " apple 's response to our preliminary investigations shows that the commission can use the competition rules to achieve swift results on the market with clear benefits for consumers . "
market changing rapidly but ian fogg , a london-based analyst for forrester research , said the market is changing at a fast pace , making it difficult for regulators to keep up .
apple 's app store was launched just over two years ago and has grown exponentially .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joaquin almunia is the eu competition commissioner apple has at times struggled to bring consistency into the way it manages the apps in its store , fogg said .
he described apple 's app store as a " curated ecosystem " similar to the amazon kindle store or google 's market for android phone apps .
" i think it makes good business sense for any company that 's curating its ecosystem to be consistent and clear about what is and is n't allowed , because that level playing field enables firms to decide where to invest their efforts , " he told deutsche welle .
" apple 's challenge is the same challenge many firms have in that the products and the markets which are being created are so new that everyone is working out the rules as we go along . "
the european commission said the changes to apple 's policy towards iphone apps will remove limits to independent developers who sometimes were in competition with apple itself .
mobile warranty for mobile phones according to fogg , warranty repair policies vary in the consumer electronics market , but such policies carry added meaning for mobile products such as smartphones .
" for a mobile phone product , having the ability to have the product repaired wherever that person is is very important , " he said .
" it 's much more important for a mobile phone than it would be for a high-definition television , which is likely to be used in the same country that it 's bought in for all of its life . "

but the invasive searches have stirred privacy concerns . germany began its six-month test period of two full-body scanners at hamburg airport on monday as critics continued to denounce the technology as too invasive .
interior minister thomas de maiziere was one of the first to pass through one of the scanners , saying he did not feel cramped or uncomfortable inside .
“ today is an important step on the way to better security in german airports , ” he said .
the german interior ministry , which is responsible for the project , selected hamburg for the trial run under real airport conditions because it is large , but not so large that technical glitches would seriously disrupt the flow of passenger traffic .
hamburg is germany 's fifth largest airport and serves about 12 million passengers annually .
full-body scanners are already in use in the united states and several european countries but , due to widespread privacy concerns , germany has been slow to test the technology .
until now , the machines had only been tested in the laboratory at the federal police academy in luebeck .
the scanners use low-frequency electromagnetic waves to sweep a schematic representation of the human body to check for concealed weapons or explosives .
passengers walk through a three-meter -lrb- 10 foot -rrb- high and two-meter wide cabin and are scanned by the waves , which the machine 's manufacturer says are 10,000-times weaker than the ordinary electro-smog from cell phones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics , like peter schaar , warn that scanners are too invasive scanners ' too invasive ' , critics warn privacy advocates oppose the use of the technology because they say it is too invasive and could reveal embarrassing details about a passenger .
peter schaar , germany 's federal commissioner for data protection , cautioned that “ very sensitive areas ” of a person 's private life could be revealed , such as breast implants , colostomies or other medical aids .
security experts argue , however , that the scanners are indispensable because they detect things , like plastic explosives and ceramic weapons , which conventional metal detectors would not discover .
this has not stopped some countries , notably italy , from scrapping the scanners .
after a six-month trial at airports in rome , venice and palermo , the machines are no longer in use after being deemed too slow and ineffective .
" we did n't get good results during testing , ” said vito riggio , the president of italy 's aviation authority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 27.09.2010 limping into champions league fixture , bayern extend with van gaal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van gaal is to stay on in munich until the end of the 2011-2012 season fresh off a contract extension with coach louis van gaal , bayern munich are looking for redemption on tuesday in europe .
injury trouble and dysfunction in attack have meant their bundesliga campaign is a shambles . five goals , eight points , ninth place .
such is bayern munich 's meager return from the first six matches of the new bundesliga season .
in that bayern had got off to a slow start last year too before finishing as champions , players and club officials had , until recently , been leery of making critical statements .
since saturday 's 2-1 home loss to surprise league leaders mainz , all that has changed .
“ we have too many players who are n't playing up to their usual standard , ” said defender philipp lahm .
“ work-rate , aggressiveness , passion - we 're missing all of it at the moment , ” said bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
the loss left bayern 10 points adrift of mainz , and that wide margin appears to be ringing a few alarm bells on saebenerstrasse .
“ it 's going to be hard to make up for this deficit , ” lahm added in his post-game remarks .
“ we let happen precisely what we did n't want to happen .
it 's going to take a long time to make up 10 points . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's captain in south africa , lahm , speaks his mind at bayern too sitting prettier luckily for bayern , the champions league is a different story .
there , the bavarians can head to switzerland to take on fc basel with their heads held high .
as if to underscore the club 's confidence that all was not yet lost , bayern 's head coach , louis van gaal , signed a one-year contract extension in basel on monday .
the deal keeps him and his supporting cast of coaches on at the club through june 2012 .
two weeks ago , van gaal 's men broke down a dogged as roma defense and got a 2-0 win to top their group .
basel , meanwhile , stumbled to a 2-1 loss in romania to cfr cluj .
if bayern can manage a win at the st. jakob park on tuesday , they could stay in the driver 's seat in group e , with a potentially winnable home-and-away match-up with cluj next on the club 's docket .
some in the club are already looking to the champions league campaign as a corrective to the poor league start .
“ we need to stay calm , ” said hamit altintop , the turkey winger who has begun to see more playing time with franck ribery out injured for the coming weeks .
“ we won the first game and can afford to play it safe - we do n't have to go storming into attack from the get-go . ”
hurting for goals perhaps it would n't do much good to play things hell-for-leather .
it 's in attack that bayern have disappointed the most .
despite starting the potent likes of thomas mueller , toni kroos , ivica olic and miroslav klose on saturday , bayern failed to find the net - relying instead on a mainz own-goal to get on the scoreboard .
this is not to say bayern 's offensive front is n't able to keep the ball , or create chances .
indeed , they had more than 70 percent of the ball and shot it 15 times .
but many of those chances were not of a particularly high standard , and their shooting was poor .
bayern put the ball on target just four times .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben scored 23 goals and set up eight more for bayern last season it would seem that the missing creativity , not to mention finishing , of arjen robben is holding the team back .
the dutchman 's muscle tear will keep him out of the lineup until the new year , and now franck ribery 's injured ankle means he 'll miss another month at least .
bayern could use their offensive potency .
kroos and mueller filled in fairly effectively for robben and ribery on the two wings on saturday , but this left the side bereft of ideas in the middle , where neither strikers olic and klose , nor defensive midfielders bastian schweinsteiger and mark van bommel offered much creativity .
a change of system , perhaps one that brings mueller and / or kroos into the middle , may do the trick - and in truth , it will have to .
bayern 's small squad means that there are no further personnel options left for van gaal should he wish to shake up the offense .
about a month ago , during the transfer-rumor-mad silly season , big-name playmakers like rafael van de vaart were brought up in connection with bayern munich . van gaal told reporters then that he did n't feel he needed to go out and buy any players to bolster the squad .
“ alaba is better ! ” van gaal had said , referring to one of his favorite young charges , the 18-year-old austrian david alaba , who he 'd used as an emergency wingback last year , but whose real strength is in the offensive midfield .
it was a bold statement - but perhaps we 'd agree with him , if we could only see alaba play .
but that poor lad is hurt as well .

but whether true unity has been achieved depends on whom you ask .
we examine what reunification does and could mean . one important measure of today 's undivided germany is economic , and on this score , as on so many others , the picture is mixed . huge strides have been made in the past twenty years .
just about every eastern german city and town has been thoroughly renovated .
and while income and other economic indices in the east are only 70 to 80 percent of what they are in the west , costs of living - especially for rent - are commensurately lower , so one could argue most eastern germans are n't that much worse off than their western fellow citizens . " silicon saxony " with its computer chips , and the optical industry in and around the city of jena in thuringia , are two examples of eastern industrial success . " i 'm very impressed with how the people in germany 's new states mastered the considerable challenges after 1989 , " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , who helped negotiate the original unification treaty , told deutsche welle .
" i 'm not disappointed at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some high-tech industries have flourished in the east but not everyone 's a winner .
as of july 2010 , unemployment in the east -lrb- 11.5 % -rrb- was nearly double what it was in the west -lrb- 6.6 % -rrb- , and an astonishing 50 percent of the 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 103 billion -rrb- in annual developmental subsidies transferred from west to east is eaten up by social benefits and welfare payments . " unfortunately , economic processes do n't work along the lines of what is just , " richard schroeder - a respected former professor of philosophy and theology at berlin 's humboldt university - said at a major conference earlier this year .
" we have large numbers of people who were n't pillars of the old system but whose situations have gotten a lot worse after the economic caesura . " some 1.6 million people have relocated from east to west since 1990 , most in search of better job opportunities , and that trend shows no sign of letting up .
moreover , sociologists speak of a " brain drain " from the east since it 's the better educated who make up the majority of those who leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty apartment blocks are a common sight in hoyerswerda it 's not uncommon to see unneeded housing units being torn down in eastern cities .
the most extreme example is hoyerswerda near germany 's border with poland and the czech republic , which has lost half of its population in the past decade . in these respects , two different economic subsets continue to exist .
and dissatisfaction with such differences and inequities has manifested itself politically . the rise and fragmentation of the left the incorporation of what germans call the " new states " into the political system of the federal republic has wrought changes few would have anticipated back in 1990 . the current german chancellor , angela merkel , hails from the east , although many germans tend to forget that fact .
and though most eastern germans vote for one of the western parties , others have sought their own alternative . the left party , the successor to the old socialist party in communist east germany , combined with left-wing fringe parties from the west , has established itself as a mouthpiece for disgruntled easterners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi -lrb- right -rrb- and westerner oskar lafontaine led the left party to prominence " reunification had a structural flaw in that the elites of the east were n't accepted , and not just the political elites , but the pedagogical , scientific and artistic elites as well , " left party parliamentary leader gregor gysi told deutsche welle .
" in the beginning , they had no time for my party , but they were rebuffed and forced back to us because the other parties were n't prepared to accept them . " the ironic result is that while the spd and the greens are leery of cooperating with former communists , the political left is bifurcated , helping merkel 's center-right government to hold on to power . the establishment of the left party as a form of peaceful political protest can be seen as evidence of eastern germans ' adoption of western democracy .
but it has also deepened many western germans ' sense of a cultural divide between them and their fellow citizens . ost- and westalgia one unambiguously positive aspect of reunification has been the removal of political barriers that kept many german families painfully separated during the cold war .
there are no exact figures for how many west and east germans had relatives in the " other " germany , but an average of 26 million care packages were sent annually from west to east during germany 's division - an indication of the personal hardships caused by political division . " those who felt imprisoned were overjoyed at an end to their suffering , " says brigitte klump , an author whose private petitions to the united nations over the course of many years helped some 4,000 people leave communist east germany .
" and naturally i still feel joy when i hear from people who succeeded in integrating into the west . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are n't many east-west marriages ostalgia - eastern germans ' supposed longing for the way things were - is a regular topic in the media , but in polls only around ten percent of easterners say they preferred life under socialism .
and eastern germans ' self-identification as a group decreases the later they were born . meanwhile , around half of western germans say the time before 1989 was better than afterward .
this reflects their fond memories of a period of affluence and clear social consensus and suggests that " westalgia " is far more prevalent than its eastern equivalent . partnerships between eastern and western germans make up only around four percent of all german marriages .
this may be due to the fact that most germans still stay in the places they grew up and maintain long-term social circles .
but the number of " ossis " and " wessis " tying the knot lags significantly behind that of germans and foreigners . " thanks to reunification , germany as a whole has gotten a lot more diverse , and feelings of togetherness have grown , " wolfgang schaeuble said .
" what we still need is time , patience , including patience with one another , and the experience of having successfully solved problems together . " the global factor one oft-neglected aspect of reunification is the contributions made by residents who do not hold german passports and the effects it had on them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners are also part of the story foreigners account for roughly eight percent of germany 's population , and with the removal of the east-west political divide , german society became much more multicultural , with large communities from eastern europe joining the substantial turkish minority that had established itself in the post-war federal republic . " the german immigrant nation is one of many nationalities , including germans from the old federal republic , others from the former east , millions of ethnic germans from eastern europe as well as an immigrant population of non-german descent , " said germany 's leading immigration expert klaus bade .
" former ' guest workers ' make up the majority , but there are also lots of smaller groups from an ever greater variety of backgrounds . " foreigners have an inestimable impact on today 's german society , and immigration is crucial in offsetting population decline , as both western and eastern germans are having fewer and fewer children . but after a boom immediately following the end of the cold war , the number of foreigners in germany has stagnated .
economists and sociologists see this as a worrisome trend because germany needs to increase its workforce to compensate for the aging population entering retirement . two decades on from 1990 , it is more apparent than ever that " reunification " is not a restoration of a past society , but a process of creating something new that is inextricable from globalization .
old national paradigms are coming under ever increasing challenges , so the future of the new federal republic is likely to be influenced just as much by factors from abroad as from within its own borders . author : jefferson chase editor : kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and dissatisfaction with such differences and inequities has manifested itself politically . the rise and fragmentation of the left the incorporation of what germans call the " new states " into the political system of the federal republic has wrought changes few would have anticipated back in 1990 . the current german chancellor , angela merkel , hails from the east , although many germans tend to forget that fact .
and though most eastern germans vote for one of the western parties , others have sought their own alternative . the left party , the successor to the old socialist party in communist east germany , combined with left-wing fringe parties from the west , has established itself as a mouthpiece for disgruntled easterners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gysi -lrb- right -rrb- and westerner oskar lafontaine led the left party to prominence " reunification had a structural flaw in that the elites of the east were n't accepted , and not just the political elites , but the pedagogical , scientific and artistic elites as well , " left party parliamentary leader gregor gysi told deutsche welle .
" in the beginning , they had no time for my party , but they were rebuffed and forced back to us because the other parties were n't prepared to accept them . " the ironic result is that while the spd and the greens are leery of cooperating with former communists , the political left is bifurcated , helping merkel 's center-right government to hold on to power . the establishment of the left party as a form of peaceful political protest can be seen as evidence of eastern germans ' adoption of western democracy .
but it has also deepened many western germans ' sense of a cultural divide between them and their fellow citizens . ost- and westalgia one unambiguously positive aspect of reunification has been the removal of political barriers that kept many german families painfully separated during the cold war .
there are no exact figures for how many west and east germans had relatives in the " other " germany , but an average of 26 million care packages were sent annually from west to east during germany 's division - an indication of the personal hardships caused by political division . " those who felt imprisoned were overjoyed at an end to their suffering , " says brigitte klump , an author whose private petitions to the united nations over the course of many years helped some 4,000 people leave communist east germany .
" and naturally i still feel joy when i hear from people who succeeded in integrating into the west . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are n't many east-west marriages ostalgia - eastern germans ' supposed longing for the way things were - is a regular topic in the media , but in polls only around ten percent of easterners say they preferred life under socialism .
and eastern germans ' self-identification as a group decreases the later they were born . meanwhile , around half of western germans say the time before 1989 was better than afterward .
this reflects their fond memories of a period of affluence and clear social consensus and suggests that " westalgia " is far more prevalent than its eastern equivalent . partnerships between eastern and western germans make up only around four percent of all german marriages .
this may be due to the fact that most germans still stay in the places they grew up and maintain long-term social circles .
but the number of " ossis " and " wessis " tying the knot lags significantly behind that of germans and foreigners . " thanks to reunification , germany as a whole has gotten a lot more diverse , and feelings of togetherness have grown , " wolfgang schaeuble said .
" what we still need is time , patience , including patience with one another , and the experience of having successfully solved problems together . " the global factor one oft-neglected aspect of reunification is the contributions made by residents who do not hold german passports and the effects it had on them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners are also part of the story foreigners account for roughly eight percent of germany 's population , and with the removal of the east-west political divide , german society became much more multicultural , with large communities from eastern europe joining the substantial turkish minority that had established itself in the post-war federal republic . " the german immigrant nation is one of many nationalities , including germans from the old federal republic , others from the former east , millions of ethnic germans from eastern europe as well as an immigrant population of non-german descent , " said germany 's leading immigration expert klaus bade .
" former ' guest workers ' make up the majority , but there are also lots of smaller groups from an ever greater variety of backgrounds . " foreigners have an inestimable impact on today 's german society , and immigration is crucial in offsetting population decline , as both western and eastern germans are having fewer and fewer children . but after a boom immediately following the end of the cold war , the number of foreigners in germany has stagnated .
economists and sociologists see this as a worrisome trend because germany needs to increase its workforce to compensate for the aging population entering retirement . two decades on from 1990 , it is more apparent than ever that " reunification " is not a restoration of a past society , but a process of creating something new that is inextricable from globalization .
old national paradigms are coming under ever increasing challenges , so the future of the new federal republic is likely to be influenced just as much by factors from abroad as from within its own borders . author : jefferson chase editor : kristin zeier send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
