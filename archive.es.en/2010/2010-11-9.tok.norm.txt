" the negotiations with croatia are now in their final phase , " the european commission said in its annual report on the progress of would-be eu members .
the commission pointed to widespread corruption and organized crime problems in other western balkan applicant countries as the biggest hurdle to their joining the bloc in the short term , although it did announce that montenegro was ready for full candidate status , saying the country 's democracy " is largely in line with european principles and standards . "
montenegro 's application has already been recognized by the eu , and with the commission 's approval , member states will now debate whether to grant the country candidate status and begin the process of negotiating membership .
croatia , iceland , turkey and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia are the four candidates that have already reached this final phase of the accession process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks voted for constitutional changes meant to appease brussels in a september referendum turkey began its official negotiations five years ago , but the eu acknowledged in its report that the process has hit rather rocky ground .
" negotiations advanced , albeit rather slowly , " the commission said of accession talks with ankara .
several stumbling blocks despite praising constitutional reforms designed to fight corruption , wrest some political power away from the military , and improve the protection of human rights as " a step in the right direction , " the commission said that turkey was still lagging behind in areas like press freedom , freedom of expression and religion , the rights of women and trade unions , and the integration of the kurdish minority in the country .
" the pace of reform in turkey dictates the pace of the accession process , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle said in berlin , shortly after the report was released .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the division of cyprus has soured turkish relations with eu members greece and cyprus the european commission also called on turkey to open trade ties with cyprus and redouble diplomatic efforts with the country , describing the need for progress in this area as " urgent . "
eu member state cyprus and turkey are locked in a territorial dispute over the northern part of the island , which has been occupied by turkish forces since 1974 .
reunification talks have stalled , and turkey says it will not open trade ties with cyprus until the problem is resolved .
and while cyprus tries to slow turkey 's accession into the eu , turkey is using its membership of nato to hamper cyprus ' bid to join that alliance .
another problem facing turkey 's membership bid that did not get highlighted in the eu commission 's annual report is the sheer size of the country .
a 2009 census put turkey 's population at 72 million , which would make it the second most populous member of the bloc .
" that means turkey would be represented in the european parliament with a number of mps to reflect its size , and the size of its population would also mean a lot of weight in decisions in the council of ministers , " the head of the eu program at the german council on foreign relations , almut moeller , told deutsche welle .
moeller said that eu insiders often talk about the influence turkey would wield in the bloc , and the affect it would have on the larger countries and their power structure .
" this is a sensitively calibrated order that has been around for a while now , and in the past we have only seen smaller and medium-sized countries entering the bloc .
they have relatively little impact on the big players , but imagine what a country this size would mean for the old order , for the amount of power currently shared between france and germany in the eu , for instance . "
gul : ' strategic imperative ' to let turkey in five years ago , there was an outpouring of pro-european sentiment and euphoria in turkey when the country began the final phase of the eu accession process .
but the mood seems to be souring as other applicants make much smoother process towards membership in the bloc .
on monday , brussels announced plans to grant visa-free travel within the eu 's open-border schengen zone to people from albania and bosnia , and the turkish newspaper haber tuerk responded by proclaiming on tuesday 's front page : " everyone 's allowed into the eu , except us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president gul thinks the eu is short-sighted not to welcome turkey citizens from every balkan country except kosovo , which some eu members consider a part of serbia , are now free to travel within the eu 's open-border area , while turks have to seek special visas .
" the eu will not be weaker , but stronger both politically and economically with turkey 's membership , " turkish president abdullah gul said in a speech in london on monday .
" given the fact that the international balance of power tends to shift towards the east and asia , it is , indeed , a strategic imperative for the eu to have turkey as a member . "
gul , speaking to the chatham house think-tank after receiving the organization 's annual prize for statesmanship , said it was " sad to observe " that some european leaders did not recognize the role turkey could play within the eu .
" this short-sighted vision is the major impediment before the idea of the eu as a global actor , capable of assuming greater responsibilities on political and security issues , complementing its economic clout , " the turkish president said .
in his speech , gul also announced that neighboring iran had asked turkey to host another round of talks with un security council members and germany on tehran 's nuclear program , alluding to the diplomatic role his country might play for the eu .
however , turkey 's international activities were also singled out by the eu for veiled criticism on tuesday , after the country defied the us and eu to vote against tougher un sanctions for iran earlier this year .
" turkey 's foreign policy has become more active in its wider neighborhood , " the commission 's report said .
" this is an asset for the european union , provided it is developed as a complement to turkey 's accession process and in coordination with the eu . "

the downside is the impact this has on the environment .
but the country is taking meausres on climate protection - even more than some industrialized nations . in may 2009 , cyclone aila swept through the ganges delta .
tidal waves flooded a number of islands , devastating homes and farmland and claiming 300 lives .
200,000 people became climate refugees , and were forced to abandon their homes .
tropical cyclones are not uncommon in the world 's largest delta .
but to many , aila served a grim reminder of climate change , with greenpeace maintaining the destruction caused was in consonance with the predictions made by scientists , who had warned that storms would become more frequent and more damaging due to climate change .
aila also served as a reminder that the ganges delta is one of asia 's climate hotspots , vulnerable to some of the worst manifestations of climate change .
here , the effects of global warming are well underway – while in europe and north america , they are still only the subject of conferences and media debates . unique threat the challenges faced by people living on the ganges delta include the threat of rising sea levels caused mostly by subsidence in the region and partly by climate change .
if this continues , the result will be mass displacement .
higher temperatures related to climate change could also bring about more severe flooding of the delta , because of increased melting of snow and glaciers in the himalayas .
bildunterschrift : only a fraction of those displaced by aila had access to food and drinking water according to the experts , if climate change continues unchecked , the consequences for india will be devastating .
according to us economist william cline from the peterson institute for international economics in washington , india 's crop yield could drop by two thirds by 2080 as a result of global warming .
the institute 's statistics show that india is more at threat than any other region on the planet .
it 's not as though india is one of the planet 's biggest polluters .
the climate footprint of the seventh largest country in the world is commensurate with the size of its population - which is over 1 billion .
its carbon emissions are considerably lower than those of the us and china .
this is due largely to the country 's widespread poverty .
but as the indian economy gathers pace , the fear is that environmental issues will be sidelined .
demand for energy is rising as the middle-class buys more cars , tvs and better housing .
much of that energy comes from coal oil and gas , the main sources for planet-warming carbon dioxide .
but the country 's politicians are aware of the need for a low-carbon growth path .
learning from others ' mistakes " we need to put electricity into people 's homes and do it cleanly , " said india 's environment minister jairam ramesh last year - stressing that rich and poor nations inevitably have different approaches to tackling climate change . " you in the west need to live with only one car rather than three .
for you it 's about luxury .
for us it is about survival . "
india is especially active in the field of renewable energies , explains martin kaiser , director of international climate policy at greenpeace germany .
" india was quick to recognize that renewables could become a major growth market within its own economy , and got in on the act very early , " he says .
" it was a good move , because when an emerging economy invests in these technologies and contributes to their widespread use , they appear significantly more credible than the leading industrialized nations , who might just be keen to make money from them .
they become role models for other developing nations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy is popular in many developing nations today , india ranks 5th in the world with a total wind power capacity of 10,925 mw , or 3 percent of all electricity produced in the country .
experts predict that by 2030 , wind power will be supplying 15 percent of india 's energy needs . india is at pains to avoid the mistakes made by the industrialized nations .
large companies are now legally bound to hire energy managers , whose primary task is to ensure energy-efficient production , and are responsible for implement energy-saving measures .
they also report on the companies ' carbon footprint to india 's licensing authorities .
even the poverty-stricken population living on the ganges delta contributes to the fight against climate change by using solar energy .
mini solar units provide enough energy for a couple of energy-saving lamps and a radio or tv , and 50 percent of the 4.5 million people who live in the sundarbans in the lower part of the delta own one , according to geetanjali solar enterprise , an indian manufacturer of solar products and equipment .
that 's a much higher percentage of the population than in the major european cities and the us .

the key speaker at the event was a controversial choice , attacked by german jewish groups for his criticism of israel .
the 1938 kristallnacht is considered to be the first nazi-sanctioned nation-wide attack against jews .
mobs sought out and torched jewish-owned shops , homes and synagogues around the country .
many were murdered , while tens of thousands were deported to nazi concentration camps .
key speaker at the frankfurt st paul 's church ceremony was german-born french author alfred grosser .
as expected , grosser launched into a critique of israeli policies towards the palestinians , saying it could not be expected that those in gaza could " understand the horror of assassinations , if you do not show great sympathy in understanding the suffering in the gaza strip . "
the announcement that grosser would speak at the anniversary ceremony had led to fierce objections from germany 's central council of jews and others in the country 's jewish community .
many threatened to walk out of the proceedings if grosser entered into a diatribe against the jewish state .
grosser said he felt justified in criticizing israel as he considered the country to be part of europe , adding that everybody should be held accountable to western values .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grosser has taken an interest in the israel-palestine conflict despite the 85-year-old 's comments , none of the attendees at the service walked out .
members of the central council of jews attending the ceremony said grosser had not crossed the line in his speech .
focus on israel grosser comes from a jewish family which immigrated to france in 1933 .
the political scientist and author of numerous books and essays is seen as an important pioneer in post-war franco-german understanding .
in recent years he has become increasingly interested in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
his 2009 book " von auschwitz nach jerusalem " -lrb- from auschwitz to jerusalem -rrb- caused controversy as he dealt with the permissibility of questioning the policies of israel .
meanwhile , the president of the central council of jews in germany has used the kristallnacht anniversary to warn of rising anti-semitism in the country .
president charlotte knobloch called for more civil courage from germans to fight xenophobia and anti-semitism .
she stressed that young germans should take a more active roll in remembering the crimes of the nazi era .

wittenberg 's grandfather was a rabbi there during the so-called kristallnacht , or night of broken glass .
all throughout germany and austria , jewish homes , business , and synagogues were ransacked and thousands of jews were deported to concentration camps .
now , accompanied by his dog mitzpah , he is carrying the torch by foot and by ferry .
in london , he will use it to symbolically light the eternal flame of a new synagogue for his own congregation .
the three-week project also serves as a fundraiser to support a variety of charities and interfaith projects .
deutsche welle spoke with the rabbi in cologne , at the midway point through his walk .
deutsche welle : rabbi wittenberg , can you tell me where the idea came from to take this walk , and what the journey is really all about ?
jonathan wittenberg : it was really when i was rereading my grandfather 's memoirs , at the 70th anniversary of kristallnacht .
i just wanted to remember what had happened to him .
and i read there how he was called by the gestapo on the 10th of november , on the allegation that he had the keys to the westend synagogue , which he did n't . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rabbi stopped at maria-laach abbey , in germany 's eifel region he wrote that he came to the main synagogue ; the fire brigade was there , and they were doing nothing .
he heard people in the crowd say -lsb- … -rsb- that the interior of the westend synagogue had been destroyed - wrecked and trashed - but that the eternal light -lsb- a constant flame that is lit in every synagogue ; eds . -rsb- was still burning .
and people took that for a miracle .
this spoke to me .
my own synagogue is building a new building .
we 've been working on it for 15 years and it 's nearing completion .
and i had the thought , because i am a lover of walking , of coming to frankfurt , of lighting a symbolic flame , and bringing it back to london to light our new eternal light . so you made ' light ' the subject of your walk ?
i was very struck by this idea , of light that burns despite darkness .
it 's an image that speaks to me in all kinds of ways as a rabbi .
i encounter a lot of darkness people struggle with .
i see the courage of people in facing illness , in facing death .
i also see the courage of people in a political context .
one of the organizations i am supporting on this walk is the parents ' circle , made up of parents who 've lost children on both sides of the israeli-palestinian conflict .
this group of parents , instead of blaming the others , instead of hating , they 're saying , ' well , this is a message that we need understanding . '
tell me about the ' eternal light ' that you are carrying .
how did you get it , and how are you transporting it ?
very simply , it 's an electric torch - a flashlight .
it 's symbolic .
i 'm not an olympic runner , and nobody 's going to let me into a cafe along the way with a great big torch on fire .
but what i did n't want to do was just to come by plane and take the torch and just fly back .
there 's no substance to something like that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the route traverses german wine country the trip began at the westend synagogue on october 24 .
i was there with a group of about 20 people from london who came to share the start of the journey .
the ceremony where i took the light was simple , just a couple of verses : " god is my light , and my salvation . "
one of the people with us was a hazzan -lsb- a singer trained to accompany jewish religious services ; eds . -rsb- who very beautifully sang those verses .
coincidentally , that day was the celebration of the 100-year anniversary of the westend synagogue .
i was invited to speak .
it was very , very moving .
my grandfather - my mother 's father - had been the main rabbi there for almost 30 years .
he died in 1975 .
what do you feel you 've learned about light along the way so far ?
my understanding of the meaning of light is constantly growing and constantly changing .
and just as light expands , so my understanding of it has expanded .
there is the beautiful natural light , while walking along the main and rhine rivers .
and then there is the tremendous amount of kindness i 've met in very ordinary circumstances .
on the second day , i was walking with a friend of mine who is a protestant minister .
i needed something to eat , and we went into a place - it turned out to be in a castle along the hiking trail , a very posh place .
i asked , ' can i have some bread please ? '
and the man came back with a basket of fruit and all kinds of bread .
i took out my purse to pay , and he said , ' no , please take it .
it 's a gift . '
i had n't told him what i was doing but it was obvious that i was somehow … en route .
i 've encountered that kind of kindness all along .
that is a kind of light .
you 're not just trekking on this trip - you 're visiting various religious sites , holding talks with social-interest groups , and visiting jewish monuments .
has that added to your understanding of light ?
yes .
there have been moments of contact with people who are engaged with what was the jewish past in germany .
we stopped in the town of bingen , at the study group for judaism there .
i asked the lady who leads it , ' why do you do this ? '
she was n't jewish , did n't have jewish ancestors .
none of them did .
she said she did it because her father had a close relationship to the jewish community and had been helped by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rabbi stopped at a thai buddhist center along the way have you found anything unexpected so far ?
well , walking in the lower rhineland up to cologne , i 've thought a lot about the shoah , obviously .
but i 've also been conscious that here was a thousand years of jewish creative history .
we were in a tiny village , st. goar .
and in that tiny rhineland village , the sefer ha-maharil , which is a key work in the progression of ashkenazy jewish law , was composed .
it still affects our practices today .
so , i had n't expected to feel such continuity with jewish culture as i have felt - this sense of jewish history , of learning , creativity , and study .
i expected to feel far more estranged .
your grandfather was german , and you speak excellent german although you yourself are english .
has this walk raised any thoughts about your own german ancestry ?
i 've been to germany many times before , but never for this long .
my grandfather loved the german jewish culture .
unlike many , he did n't teach us to hate germany .
he said we should differentiate between nazism and german culture .
i think there are a lot of questions to be asked about whether that differentiation could be made quite as neatly as that .
but that was certainly his attitude , so i have n't had to overcome an inner revulsion to being in germany - i never had it .
and i deeply do n't believe you can blame one generation for what another generation did .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the second fundraising walk wittenberg has taken with his dog , mitzpah but there is no doubt that there is a legacy .
and i think finding ways to face that legacy together as much as possible - you ca n't do it with major perpetrators - but with people who are struggling with what the past has meant to them , i think enabling that kind of conversation is very important .
was being on this trip during kristallnacht , the night of broken glass , part of your plan ?
on november 9 i 'll be in holland , since i 've been asked to speak there .
it would have made more sense to be in germany , but that 's where it worked out .
in any case i definitely wanted to be traveling the route on kristallnacht .
towards the end of the walk i pick up the route of the kindertransporte , -lsb- the name given to the movement to rescue some 10,000 jewish children from the nazis by sending them to live in the uk , just prior to the outbreak of world war ii ; eds . -rsb-
so that 's something i find deeply moving .
i 'm guessing you are something of a strange sight in the german countryside - a rabbi wearing a yarmulke and a backpack , with a dog in tow .
have you gotten some odd reactions ?
not at all - although people do keep stopping me to tell me that the flashlight in my backpack has been left on .
they do n't know i 've done it on purpose .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the route traverses german wine country the trip began at the westend synagogue on october 24 .
i was there with a group of about 20 people from london who came to share the start of the journey .
the ceremony where i took the light was simple , just a couple of verses : " god is my light , and my salvation . "
one of the people with us was a hazzan -lsb- a singer trained to accompany jewish religious services ; eds . -rsb- who very beautifully sang those verses .
coincidentally , that day was the celebration of the 100-year anniversary of the westend synagogue .
i was invited to speak .
it was very , very moving .
my grandfather - my mother 's father - had been the main rabbi there for almost 30 years .
he died in 1975 .
what do you feel you 've learned about light along the way so far ?
my understanding of the meaning of light is constantly growing and constantly changing .
and just as light expands , so my understanding of it has expanded .
there is the beautiful natural light , while walking along the main and rhine rivers .
and then there is the tremendous amount of kindness i 've met in very ordinary circumstances .
on the second day , i was walking with a friend of mine who is a protestant minister .
i needed something to eat , and we went into a place - it turned out to be in a castle along the hiking trail , a very posh place .
i asked , ' can i have some bread please ? '
and the man came back with a basket of fruit and all kinds of bread .
i took out my purse to pay , and he said , ' no , please take it .
it 's a gift . '
i had n't told him what i was doing but it was obvious that i was somehow … en route .
i 've encountered that kind of kindness all along .
that is a kind of light .
you 're not just trekking on this trip - you 're visiting various religious sites , holding talks with social-interest groups , and visiting jewish monuments .
has that added to your understanding of light ?
yes .
there have been moments of contact with people who are engaged with what was the jewish past in germany .
we stopped in the town of bingen , at the study group for judaism there .
i asked the lady who leads it , ' why do you do this ? '
she was n't jewish , did n't have jewish ancestors .
none of them did .
she said she did it because her father had a close relationship to the jewish community and had been helped by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rabbi stopped at a thai buddhist center along the way have you found anything unexpected so far ?
well , walking in the lower rhineland up to cologne , i 've thought a lot about the shoah , obviously .
but i 've also been conscious that here was a thousand years of jewish creative history .
we were in a tiny village , st. goar .
and in that tiny rhineland village , the sefer ha-maharil , which is a key work in the progression of ashkenazy jewish law , was composed .
it still affects our practices today .
so , i had n't expected to feel such continuity with jewish culture as i have felt - this sense of jewish history , of learning , creativity , and study .
i expected to feel far more estranged .
your grandfather was german , and you speak excellent german although you yourself are english .
has this walk raised any thoughts about your own german ancestry ?
i 've been to germany many times before , but never for this long .
my grandfather loved the german jewish culture .
unlike many , he did n't teach us to hate germany .
he said we should differentiate between nazism and german culture .
i think there are a lot of questions to be asked about whether that differentiation could be made quite as neatly as that .
but that was certainly his attitude , so i have n't had to overcome an inner revulsion to being in germany - i never had it .
and i deeply do n't believe you can blame one generation for what another generation did .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the second fundraising walk wittenberg has taken with his dog , mitzpah but there is no doubt that there is a legacy .
and i think finding ways to face that legacy together as much as possible - you ca n't do it with major perpetrators - but with people who are struggling with what the past has meant to them , i think enabling that kind of conversation is very important .
was being on this trip during kristallnacht , the night of broken glass , part of your plan ?
on november 9 i 'll be in holland , since i 've been asked to speak there .
it would have made more sense to be in germany , but that 's where it worked out .
in any case i definitely wanted to be traveling the route on kristallnacht .
towards the end of the walk i pick up the route of the kindertransporte , -lsb- the name given to the movement to rescue some 10,000 jewish children from the nazis by sending them to live in the uk , just prior to the outbreak of world war ii ; eds . -rsb-
so that 's something i find deeply moving .
i 'm guessing you are something of a strange sight in the german countryside - a rabbi wearing a yarmulke and a backpack , with a dog in tow .
have you gotten some odd reactions ?
not at all - although people do keep stopping me to tell me that the flashlight in my backpack has been left on .
they do n't know i 've done it on purpose .

the downside is the impact this has on the environment .
but the country is taking meausres on climate protection - even more than some industrialized nations . in may 2009 , cyclone aila swept through the ganges delta .
tidal waves flooded a number of islands , devastating homes and farmland and claiming 300 lives .
200,000 people became climate refugees , and were forced to abandon their homes .
tropical cyclones are not uncommon in the world 's largest delta .
but to many , aila served a grim reminder of climate change , with greenpeace maintaining the destruction caused was in consonance with the predictions made by scientists , who had warned that storms would become more frequent and more damaging due to climate change .
aila also served as a reminder that the ganges delta is one of asia 's climate hotspots , vulnerable to some of the worst manifestations of climate change .
here , the effects of global warming are well underway – while in europe and north america , they are still only the subject of conferences and media debates . unique threat the challenges faced by people living on the ganges delta include the threat of rising sea levels caused mostly by subsidence in the region and partly by climate change .
if this continues , the result will be mass displacement .
higher temperatures related to climate change could also bring about more severe flooding of the delta , because of increased melting of snow and glaciers in the himalayas .
bildunterschrift : only a fraction of those displaced by aila had access to food and drinking water according to the experts , if climate change continues unchecked , the consequences for india will be devastating .
according to us economist william cline from the peterson institute for international economics in washington , india 's crop yield could drop by two thirds by 2080 as a result of global warming .
the institute 's statistics show that india is more at threat than any other region on the planet .
it 's not as though india is one of the planet 's biggest polluters .
the climate footprint of the seventh largest country in the world is commensurate with the size of its population - which is over 1 billion .
its carbon emissions are considerably lower than those of the us and china .
this is due largely to the country 's widespread poverty .
but as the indian economy gathers pace , the fear is that environmental issues will be sidelined .
demand for energy is rising as the middle-class buys more cars , tvs and better housing .
much of that energy comes from coal oil and gas , the main sources for planet-warming carbon dioxide .
but the country 's politicians are aware of the need for a low-carbon growth path .
learning from others ' mistakes " we need to put electricity into people 's homes and do it cleanly , " said india 's environment minister jairam ramesh last year - stressing that rich and poor nations inevitably have different approaches to tackling climate change . " you in the west need to live with only one car rather than three .
for you it 's about luxury .
for us it is about survival . "
india is especially active in the field of renewable energies , explains martin kaiser , director of international climate policy at greenpeace germany .
" india was quick to recognize that renewables could become a major growth market within its own economy , and got in on the act very early , " he says .
" it was a good move , because when an emerging economy invests in these technologies and contributes to their widespread use , they appear significantly more credible than the leading industrialized nations , who might just be keen to make money from them .
they become role models for other developing nations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy is popular in many developing nations today , india ranks 5th in the world with a total wind power capacity of 10,925 mw , or 3 percent of all electricity produced in the country .
experts predict that by 2030 , wind power will be supplying 15 percent of india 's energy needs . india is at pains to avoid the mistakes made by the industrialized nations .
large companies are now legally bound to hire energy managers , whose primary task is to ensure energy-efficient production , and are responsible for implement energy-saving measures .
they also report on the companies ' carbon footprint to india 's licensing authorities .
even the poverty-stricken population living on the ganges delta contributes to the fight against climate change by using solar energy .
mini solar units provide enough energy for a couple of energy-saving lamps and a radio or tv , and 50 percent of the 4.5 million people who live in the sundarbans in the lower part of the delta own one , according to geetanjali solar enterprise , an indian manufacturer of solar products and equipment .
that 's a much higher percentage of the population than in the major european cities and the us .

in krakow , a museum and memorial recently opened in schindler 's former factory . an industrial complex in krakow is hardly the usual place to find hordes of tourists .
however in this part of the city , tourist buses line the streets - and it 's all because this is the location of oskar schindler 's factory .
the american film director steven spielberg made the factory famous in 1993 when he filmed parts of his oscar-winning film " schindler 's list " at the factory .
the story follows schindler as he tries to save his jewish workforce from nazi persecution and the concentration camps .
until recently , people had to peer through the locked gates to get a look at the factory .
but as of this summer , the building is now open to all visitors .
the krakow authorities have converted the factory into a museum , which is currently housing an exhibition called " krakow : occupation 1939-1945 , " examining life during nazi rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the success of spielberg 's film drew visitors to schindler 's krakow factory the exhibition shows the history of oskar schindler himself , and his workers .
curator monika bednarek said while schindler is the " main protagonist " of the exhibition , " he 's not the only one . "
the exhibition also charts the nazi occupation as a whole , and puts the fate of the jewish workers in schindler 's factory into context .
schindler 's place in history oskar schindler lived from 1908 to 1974 , and was the son of an industrialist .
in 1939 , after the occupation of poland by nazi germany , schindler acquired an enamel factory which had previously been in jewish hands .
the factory produced tin ware and later shells and detonators for the war effort .
schindler directly benefitted from the so-called ' ayranization ' of jewish factories and businesses , and as the war progressed he made a fortune on the black market .
despite his nazi membership , schindler became increasingly concerned about the cruel fate of his jewish workforce .
he added 1,200 workers to his famous list , labeling them ' essential ' to the war effort .
by doing so , he saved them from certain death at a nazi concentration camp .
after the war , schindler 's enamel factory became state-owned and was converted for use by a telecommunications company .
in 2002 it was abandoned , only to be bought by the city council three years later .
" the council decided to turn it into a museum , " said bednarek .
with the help of eu funding , the building was renovated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial is filled with original tin ware from schindler 's factory modern exhibits entice young visitors the exhibition begins in the krakow of the 1930s with a range of photos - such as women walking in the city and jews on the way to the synagogue .
" first of all we see the history before the war , so we can understand what happened during the war , " explained bendarek .
then the exhibits chart the outbreak of war , as german soldiers marched through poland on september 6 , 1939 .
there 's even a reconstruction of the jewish ghetto .
with the help of touch-screen displays , life-size murals and multimedia exhibits , the history of the period is brought to life .
the curators hope these types of techniques will help appeal to younger visitors .
" with this technology we can reach young people , " said grzegorz jezowski , who helped put together the exhibition .
" it makes it more attractive for them . "
a memorial to oskar schindler schindler himself only features quite briefly in the exhibition .
his story is told through photos , original documents and furniture from the factory .
in the middle of one room is a giant transparent cube , filled with tin pots , bowls and plates that were produced in schindler 's factory .
the instillation is meant to represent the history of the entrepreneur and his workers .
in the center hang the names of around 1,200 jewish workers whose lives were saved by schindler .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 09.11.2010 oskar schindler 's krakow factory becomes a museum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photo exhibits show life during the nazi occupation steven spielberg made oskar schindler 's name immortal as the man who saved over a thousand jewish lives in world war ii .
in krakow , a museum and memorial recently opened in schindler 's former factory . an industrial complex in krakow is hardly the usual place to find hordes of tourists .
however in this part of the city , tourist buses line the streets - and it 's all because this is the location of oskar schindler 's factory .
the american film director steven spielberg made the factory famous in 1993 when he filmed parts of his oscar-winning film " schindler 's list " at the factory .
the story follows schindler as he tries to save his jewish workforce from nazi persecution and the concentration camps .
until recently , people had to peer through the locked gates to get a look at the factory .
but as of this summer , the building is now open to all visitors .
the krakow authorities have converted the factory into a museum , which is currently housing an exhibition called " krakow : occupation 1939-1945 , " examining life during nazi rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the success of spielberg 's film drew visitors to schindler 's krakow factory the exhibition shows the history of oskar schindler himself , and his workers .
curator monika bednarek said while schindler is the " main protagonist " of the exhibition , " he 's not the only one . "
the exhibition also charts the nazi occupation as a whole , and puts the fate of the jewish workers in schindler 's factory into context .
schindler 's place in history oskar schindler lived from 1908 to 1974 , and was the son of an industrialist .
in 1939 , after the occupation of poland by nazi germany , schindler acquired an enamel factory which had previously been in jewish hands .
the factory produced tin ware and later shells and detonators for the war effort .
schindler directly benefitted from the so-called ' ayranization ' of jewish factories and businesses , and as the war progressed he made a fortune on the black market .
despite his nazi membership , schindler became increasingly concerned about the cruel fate of his jewish workforce .
he added 1,200 workers to his famous list , labeling them ' essential ' to the war effort .
by doing so , he saved them from certain death at a nazi concentration camp .
after the war , schindler 's enamel factory became state-owned and was converted for use by a telecommunications company .
in 2002 it was abandoned , only to be bought by the city council three years later .
" the council decided to turn it into a museum , " said bednarek .
with the help of eu funding , the building was renovated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial is filled with original tin ware from schindler 's factory modern exhibits entice young visitors the exhibition begins in the krakow of the 1930s with a range of photos - such as women walking in the city and jews on the way to the synagogue .
" first of all we see the history before the war , so we can understand what happened during the war , " explained bendarek .
then the exhibits chart the outbreak of war , as german soldiers marched through poland on september 6 , 1939 .
there 's even a reconstruction of the jewish ghetto .
with the help of touch-screen displays , life-size murals and multimedia exhibits , the history of the period is brought to life .
the curators hope these types of techniques will help appeal to younger visitors .
" with this technology we can reach young people , " said grzegorz jezowski , who helped put together the exhibition .
" it makes it more attractive for them . "
a memorial to oskar schindler schindler himself only features quite briefly in the exhibition .
his story is told through photos , original documents and furniture from the factory .
in the middle of one room is a giant transparent cube , filled with tin pots , bowls and plates that were produced in schindler 's factory .
the instillation is meant to represent the history of the entrepreneur and his workers .
in the center hang the names of around 1,200 jewish workers whose lives were saved by schindler .

the delegates are meeting at the first global conference on cluster bombs since the pact became international law on august 1 , 2010 . the conference , which runs through november 12 , aims to give impetus to the convention 's target of ridding the world of cluster bombs .
the meeting is being described as a " defining moment " in the campaign to persuade governments the world over to stop producing and using the weapons which continue to kill and wound tens of thousands of people around the globe long after they have been dropped . the effect of cluster bombs can be seen and felt for decades after their use in an initial conflict .
the land or air deployed munitions , which split open before impact with the ground , scatter multiple bomblets over a wide area , many of which fail to explode . these unexploded cylindrical bomblets can be mistaken for batteries or balls and have caused horrific injuries and death to children who stumble across them .
over time , the bomblets can become buried , posing an equal risk to farmers and other civilians . vietnam war leaves laos crippled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bomblets have made areas of the world uninhabitable the convention on cluster munitions hopes to force nations into destroying their existing stockpiles of cluster bombs and prohibiting the creations of new ones .
it prohibits all use , stockpiling , production and transfer of cluster weapons and places the responsibility of financial support and other assistance to clean up the explosives on its signatories . a total of 108 nations have signed the convention and more than 40 have ratified it , making them full parties .
of those signatories , 74 still have stockpiles of cluster bombs .
but about 20 countries have already destroyed or are eliminating them , according to the landmine and cluster munition monitor , a non-governmental monitoring project . " cluster munitions can no longer be seen as legitimate weapons , " said steve goose , director of the arms division at human rights watch and co-chair of the cluster munition coalition -lrb- cmc -rrb- .
" no country , even one that has not yet joined the ban convention , should contemplate using these indiscriminate weapons , and certainly no country that has joined should contemplate helping someone else use them . " laos was chosen as the location for the conference due to its unwanted title of the most heavily cluster bombed nation on earth per capita .
the war in neighboring vietnam , which expanded to areas of laos , saw over two million tons of ordnance dropped on the south east asian nation by us forces between 1964 and 1973 . cluster bombs were used in the heavy bombing of both countries , with an estimated 270 million cluster bomblets spread across laos , according to the country 's national regulatory authority -lrb- nra -rrb- .
the nra estimates that 30 percent of those bomblets failed to explode , leaving around 25 percent of the entire country contaminated with unexploded ordnance .
it claims that one person per day is either killed or injured by vietnam war-era cluster bombs . according to data by the landmine and cluster munition monitor , confirmed deaths and injuries from cluster bombs have also been recorded in high numbers in iraq , afghanistan and lebanon - all countries which have in recent years experienced or continue to experience large-scale conflicts . major manufacturers refuse to sign " fifteen former producers of cluster munitions foreswore production when they joined the convention on cluster munitions , " cmc coordinator thomas nash told deutsche welle .
" seventeen countries continue production or reserve the right to produce the weapons in the future , including major producers like china , india , israel , pakistan , russia and the us , who are all non-signatories . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major nations continue to build and use cluster bombs since world war two , at least 18 government armed forces have used cluster bombs in 39 countries and disputed territories , nash said . " the united states , russia and israel have been the largest users of the weapons in the past decade , " he said . israel has used cluster bombs in its wars with militants in lebanon since 1978 , while russia used them in the second chechen war in 1999 and is accused of using them in its war with georgia in 2008 . in addition to the vietnam war , the us has used cluster bombs in afghanistan since 2001 , in air campaigns in iraq since the first gulf war in 1990 and - along with britain - in nato 's bombing campaign against yugoslavia in 1999 . the laos conference organizers do not expect any of the major non-signatory countries to send delegations as observers . " although a large number of european countries produced and stockpiled cluster bombs in the past , most have now given up the weapon , " nash added .
" a handful of former soviet bloc nations are the only european countries that continue to produce the weapon including poland , romania and slovakia . " us under pressure to sign despite not being a signatory , the us does support a number of non-governmental organizations in their efforts to clean up cluster bombs around the world .
human rights watch said that washington has pumped an estimated $ 2 million per year into clearing bomblets in laos , while still continuing to manufacture the weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us continues to use cluster bombs in its conflicts however , as a non-signatory country , the us finds itself in a quandary when it comes to dealing with allies who have signed up .
the convention forbids any signatory from helping a non-signatory nation transport cluster munitions .
this means those european nations who are both convention signatories and nato partners with the us are legally bound not to refuel trucks or planes carrying these weapons for the us . " countries committed to eradicating these brutal weapons need to make clear that no country should be allowed an exception to assist with the use of cluster munitions or other banned activities , " said bonnie docherty , senior arms division researcher at human rights watch , in a statement . " those that support the ban need to interpret it and carry it out in a comprehensive way to end the humanitarian harm caused by cluster munitions , " she said .
" this means explicitly prohibiting assistance to other countries with activities banned by the convention . " rapid implementation crucial to saving lives according to the cmc 's nash , the convention is rapidly having a positive effect .
seven signatories have already destroyed their stockpiles , with another 11 in the process of doing so .
clean up campaigns are gathering pace and donors are injecting increasingly large amounts of cash into countries struggling to rid themselves of the destructive legacy left behind from cluster bombing . " the convention is emerging as the clear global standard on cluster munitions and we are seeing that even countries that have n't joined the treaty can not simply carry on using the weapons in armed conflicts , given the weapons ' indiscriminate effect and grave humanitarian impact both at the time of use and for years after the armed conflict ends , " nash said .
" we believe that as more countries get on board the ban , this stigmatization will increase and the market for exporting cluster munitions will dry up . " campaigners hope that the laos conference will speed up the process of destroying munitions and cleaning up territories affected by them while also encouraging new nations to join . delegates are expected to hammer out a concrete plan of action to implement the treaty and save lives .
among the tangible outcomes expected from the conference will be a political avowal - the vientiane declaration - that reaffirms the global commitment to eradicate cluster bombs and end the harm they have caused . author : nick amies editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the delegates are meeting at the first global conference on cluster bombs since the pact became international law on august 1 , 2010 . the conference , which runs through november 12 , aims to give impetus to the convention 's target of ridding the world of cluster bombs .
the meeting is being described as a " defining moment " in the campaign to persuade governments the world over to stop producing and using the weapons which continue to kill and wound tens of thousands of people around the globe long after they have been dropped . the effect of cluster bombs can be seen and felt for decades after their use in an initial conflict .
the land or air deployed munitions , which split open before impact with the ground , scatter multiple bomblets over a wide area , many of which fail to explode . these unexploded cylindrical bomblets can be mistaken for batteries or balls and have caused horrific injuries and death to children who stumble across them .
over time , the bomblets can become buried , posing an equal risk to farmers and other civilians . vietnam war leaves laos crippled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bomblets have made areas of the world uninhabitable the convention on cluster munitions hopes to force nations into destroying their existing stockpiles of cluster bombs and prohibiting the creations of new ones .
it prohibits all use , stockpiling , production and transfer of cluster weapons and places the responsibility of financial support and other assistance to clean up the explosives on its signatories . a total of 108 nations have signed the convention and more than 40 have ratified it , making them full parties .
of those signatories , 74 still have stockpiles of cluster bombs .
but about 20 countries have already destroyed or are eliminating them , according to the landmine and cluster munition monitor , a non-governmental monitoring project . " cluster munitions can no longer be seen as legitimate weapons , " said steve goose , director of the arms division at human rights watch and co-chair of the cluster munition coalition -lrb- cmc -rrb- .
" no country , even one that has not yet joined the ban convention , should contemplate using these indiscriminate weapons , and certainly no country that has joined should contemplate helping someone else use them . " laos was chosen as the location for the conference due to its unwanted title of the most heavily cluster bombed nation on earth per capita .
the war in neighboring vietnam , which expanded to areas of laos , saw over two million tons of ordnance dropped on the south east asian nation by us forces between 1964 and 1973 . cluster bombs were used in the heavy bombing of both countries , with an estimated 270 million cluster bomblets spread across laos , according to the country 's national regulatory authority -lrb- nra -rrb- .
the nra estimates that 30 percent of those bomblets failed to explode , leaving around 25 percent of the entire country contaminated with unexploded ordnance .
it claims that one person per day is either killed or injured by vietnam war-era cluster bombs . according to data by the landmine and cluster munition monitor , confirmed deaths and injuries from cluster bombs have also been recorded in high numbers in iraq , afghanistan and lebanon - all countries which have in recent years experienced or continue to experience large-scale conflicts . major manufacturers refuse to sign " fifteen former producers of cluster munitions foreswore production when they joined the convention on cluster munitions , " cmc coordinator thomas nash told deutsche welle .
" seventeen countries continue production or reserve the right to produce the weapons in the future , including major producers like china , india , israel , pakistan , russia and the us , who are all non-signatories . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major nations continue to build and use cluster bombs since world war two , at least 18 government armed forces have used cluster bombs in 39 countries and disputed territories , nash said . " the united states , russia and israel have been the largest users of the weapons in the past decade , " he said . israel has used cluster bombs in its wars with militants in lebanon since 1978 , while russia used them in the second chechen war in 1999 and is accused of using them in its war with georgia in 2008 . in addition to the vietnam war , the us has used cluster bombs in afghanistan since 2001 , in air campaigns in iraq since the first gulf war in 1990 and - along with britain - in nato 's bombing campaign against yugoslavia in 1999 . the laos conference organizers do not expect any of the major non-signatory countries to send delegations as observers . " although a large number of european countries produced and stockpiled cluster bombs in the past , most have now given up the weapon , " nash added .
" a handful of former soviet bloc nations are the only european countries that continue to produce the weapon including poland , romania and slovakia . " us under pressure to sign despite not being a signatory , the us does support a number of non-governmental organizations in their efforts to clean up cluster bombs around the world .
human rights watch said that washington has pumped an estimated $ 2 million per year into clearing bomblets in laos , while still continuing to manufacture the weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us continues to use cluster bombs in its conflicts however , as a non-signatory country , the us finds itself in a quandary when it comes to dealing with allies who have signed up .
the convention forbids any signatory from helping a non-signatory nation transport cluster munitions .
this means those european nations who are both convention signatories and nato partners with the us are legally bound not to refuel trucks or planes carrying these weapons for the us . " countries committed to eradicating these brutal weapons need to make clear that no country should be allowed an exception to assist with the use of cluster munitions or other banned activities , " said bonnie docherty , senior arms division researcher at human rights watch , in a statement . " those that support the ban need to interpret it and carry it out in a comprehensive way to end the humanitarian harm caused by cluster munitions , " she said .
" this means explicitly prohibiting assistance to other countries with activities banned by the convention . " rapid implementation crucial to saving lives according to the cmc 's nash , the convention is rapidly having a positive effect .
seven signatories have already destroyed their stockpiles , with another 11 in the process of doing so .
clean up campaigns are gathering pace and donors are injecting increasingly large amounts of cash into countries struggling to rid themselves of the destructive legacy left behind from cluster bombing . " the convention is emerging as the clear global standard on cluster munitions and we are seeing that even countries that have n't joined the treaty can not simply carry on using the weapons in armed conflicts , given the weapons ' indiscriminate effect and grave humanitarian impact both at the time of use and for years after the armed conflict ends , " nash said .
" we believe that as more countries get on board the ban , this stigmatization will increase and the market for exporting cluster munitions will dry up . " campaigners hope that the laos conference will speed up the process of destroying munitions and cleaning up territories affected by them while also encouraging new nations to join . delegates are expected to hammer out a concrete plan of action to implement the treaty and save lives .
among the tangible outcomes expected from the conference will be a political avowal - the vientiane declaration - that reaffirms the global commitment to eradicate cluster bombs and end the harm they have caused . author : nick amies editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with this season already a likely write-off , even hardcore fans are calling for some major changes on the river weser . if there was any small consolation for bremen after their 6-0 thrashing by stuttgart on sunday , it was that the scoreline could have been worse .
after all , goalkeeper tim wiese had saved a penalty in the 60th minute .
but wiese remained disconsolate .
" the way we played here was embarrassing , " the keeper told reporters after the match .
" i 'm ashamed of us , and every one else should be ashamed as well . "
it was werder 's second straight league loss after an unexpected home to defeat to nuremberg in round 10 .
coach thomas schaaf took refuge in gallows humor .
" we were a good sparring partner , " schaaf told the press .
" that 's an opponent you invite to your training camp , when you want to stay fit .
it was like in practice , and that 's not enough for a competitive match . "
werder are currently eleventh in the table , 15 points behind leaders dortmund .
the team has been in similar positions before , but rarely have things looked so black for the men in green .
in 2008-9 , bremen stumbled to tenth place in the bundesliga but salvaged their season by reaching the final of the europa league and winning the german cup .
this year , they are already out of the cup and adrift at the bottom of their champions league group .
werder have qualified for international competition every year since 2004 and have missed the champions league only once , making them germany 's second most successful team .
nonetheless , the problems they are currently encountering have been in the making for some time .
achilles ' heel bildunterschrift : silvestre is one of the main problems in a terrible defense werder have always conceded more goals than the other top german teams but have thrived because they also scored more .
that 's down to the style favored by schaaf , which features the defenders pushed relatively far upfield .
but after 11 matches this season , bremen have already conceded 27 goals .
by way of comparison , werder 's season average for the past six campaigns is 41.5 .
schaaf and company have sorely missed central defender naldo , who 's out indefinitely while recovering from an operation to combat necrosis of the knee .
neither sebastian proedl nor mikael silvestre has been an adequate replacement , and germany international per mertesacker has been unable to compensate .
werder 's goal production – 19 – is also down , which has something to do with the hole left behind by mesut oezil , who left this summer for real madrid .
aaron hunt , a converted striker , has not been able to fill the playmaker role , and new acquisition wesley has been forced to play in the back four .
as a relatively low-budget club by top european standards , bremen are used to losing star players .
schaaf and commercial manager klaus allofs have always shown a remarkable knack for finding replacements .
not this season , though , and that 's causing some major friction in the werder family .
fussing and feuding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaaf and allofs are no longer beyond criticism schaaf and allofs have been running things at werder since 1999 , a unique record of longevity in the hire- ‘ em-fire- ‘ em bundesliga , and harmony has been the rule in their eleven-year tenure .
but questionable personnel decisions and curious management reactions have created an atmosphere of conflict .
disappointed with the team 's early form , allofs took the strange step of freezing players ' wages earlier this season .
that created a climate of tension that may have emerged when striker marko arnautovic reportedly hurled an obscenity in allofs ' direction after being substituted out in bremen 's most recent champions league loss .
the serbian-austrian is known for his mercurial temperament , and many fans questioned the decision to acquire him this summer .
but that 's nothing compared to the outrage directed at the 33-year-old silvestre .
the frenchman was brought in despite coming off a horrible year with arsenal and is , according to the grades handed out by kicker magazine , by far and away the worst defender in the bundesliga .
he was roundly booed after the nuremberg match , an understandable reaction from disappointed ticket-holders .
but schaaf subsequently went on local radio accusing supporters of not being “ real fans . ”
and that has the werder faithful up in arms .
" werder bremen is suffering from the arrogance and vanity of schaaf and allofs , " wrote one enraged user on the fanszene-bremen internet forum .
" these gentlemen have lost touch after having so much success and being treated with kid gloves by the media .
criticism , including boos , is interpreted as an insult to their royal highnesses . "
a fellow supporter , writing on a different platform , concurred .
" here everyone blames a team that is playing badly , " the user opined on forum.werder.de.
" that 's one issue .
another one is that klaus allofs is n't capable of buying reasonable players and thomas schaaf has been unable to form them into a reasonable team . "
a couple of wins would probably be enough to silence the voices of dissent , and bremen get a chance to make amends on saturday when they host frankfurt – a team they 'd expect to beat most seasons .
but this season is anything but typical .
frankfurt are riding high in fourth place , while werder bremen are facing a potential relegation fight – and an ill-tempered debate about the future of the club .

but with this season already a likely write-off , even hardcore fans are calling for some major changes on the river weser . if there was any small consolation for bremen after their 6-0 thrashing by stuttgart on sunday , it was that the scoreline could have been worse .
after all , goalkeeper tim wiese had saved a penalty in the 60th minute .
but wiese remained disconsolate .
" the way we played here was embarrassing , " the keeper told reporters after the match .
" i 'm ashamed of us , and every one else should be ashamed as well . "
it was werder 's second straight league loss after an unexpected home to defeat to nuremberg in round 10 .
coach thomas schaaf took refuge in gallows humor .
" we were a good sparring partner , " schaaf told the press .
" that 's an opponent you invite to your training camp , when you want to stay fit .
it was like in practice , and that 's not enough for a competitive match . "
werder are currently eleventh in the table , 15 points behind leaders dortmund .
the team has been in similar positions before , but rarely have things looked so black for the men in green .
in 2008-9 , bremen stumbled to tenth place in the bundesliga but salvaged their season by reaching the final of the europa league and winning the german cup .
this year , they are already out of the cup and adrift at the bottom of their champions league group .
werder have qualified for international competition every year since 2004 and have missed the champions league only once , making them germany 's second most successful team .
nonetheless , the problems they are currently encountering have been in the making for some time .
achilles ' heel bildunterschrift : silvestre is one of the main problems in a terrible defense werder have always conceded more goals than the other top german teams but have thrived because they also scored more .
that 's down to the style favored by schaaf , which features the defenders pushed relatively far upfield .
but after 11 matches this season , bremen have already conceded 27 goals .
by way of comparison , werder 's season average for the past six campaigns is 41.5 .
schaaf and company have sorely missed central defender naldo , who 's out indefinitely while recovering from an operation to combat necrosis of the knee .
neither sebastian proedl nor mikael silvestre has been an adequate replacement , and germany international per mertesacker has been unable to compensate .
werder 's goal production – 19 – is also down , which has something to do with the hole left behind by mesut oezil , who left this summer for real madrid .

after nearly two days of blocking a nuclear waste storage site , thousands of protestors have been cleared from the area by police and the transport of 11 containers of nuclear waste has arrived at its destination . police cleared thousands of anti-nuclear activists from roads leading to the nuclear storage facility in gorleben , northern germany on tuesday morning , allowing for the final arrival of 123 tons of nuclear waste .
about 3,000 demonstrators staged a 44-hour sit-in in front of the storage site , including high-level politicians such as green party co-chair claudia roth .
activists from the environmentalist organization greenpeace used a truck disguised as a vehicle carrying beer to block the freight train station in nearby dannenberg , where the waste containers were to be moved to trucks for the final 20 kilometers to the storage site .
two greenpeace activists delayed the transport by about 11 hours by encasing themselves in a cement block , making it so the police could not move them without injuring them .
authorities managed to free the activists early tuesday morning , and the first truck carrying the nuclear waste departed dannenberg at around 8:30 a.m.
the last of the trucks arrived at the storage facility at about 9:50 a.m.
bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists held up the trucks carrying the waste for 11 hours stop-and-go traffic large protests have taken place during past nuclear waste transport operations , but none have delayed the shipment of the waste as much as the most recent .
the waste originated from nuclear reactors in germany and was sent to a plant in northern france for reprocessing .
the waste containers , called " castors " -lrb- cask for storage and transport of radioactive material -rrb- , left france by train on friday afternoon , but were quickly stopped by the first blockade of activists on the train tracks .
the following days were a tedious stop-and-go game , as protestors blocked the train tracks and some of the 16,000 police officers mobilized to secure the transport removed them .
protests to continue leaders of the various " citizens ' initiatives " against nuclear power claimed victory on tuesday , despite the successful transport of the nuclear waste , and some vowed to continue protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors succeeded in delaying the transport on historic levels " we 've shown that we 're a force to be reckoned with , " said kerstin rudek , chairwoman of the citizens ' initiative for environmental protection luechow-dannenberg .
matthias miersch , environment spokesman for the opposition social democrats in parliament , said the movement against the nuclear waste transport was a " very impressive demonstration . "
" this was a very clear signal to the government that this atomic energy policy can not go on , " he told phoenix public television .
" politicians have to understand that decisions are being made now that the people are absolutely unable to relate to . "
transport to russia meanwhile munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that germany had negotiated a deal " ready to be signed " to ship nuclear waste originating from an old atomic research facility in former east germany to russia .
the report said a total of 951 nuclear fuel elements from the east german research center dresden-rossendorf , which have been in temporary storage since 2005 , would be shipped to the mayak atomic complex in the southern urals for reprocessing .
the waste would stay in russia for permanent storage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mayak facility in russia is to reprocess east germany 's radioactive waste the report said the basis for the transport deal was a previous agreement between the united states and russia , which regulates the transport of nuclear waste from reactors that were overseen by the soviet union .
germany 's goal was reportedly to " reduce the amount of highly-enriched uranium as much as possible . "
the deal received criticism from the green party , which has profited politically from a strong anti-nuclear sentiment in germany .
" cheap before safe , that 's what this is about , " green party spokeswoman sylvia kotting-uhl told the newspaper .

after nearly two days of blocking a nuclear waste storage site , thousands of protestors have been cleared from the area by police and the transport of 11 containers of nuclear waste has arrived at its destination . police cleared thousands of anti-nuclear activists from roads leading to the nuclear storage facility in gorleben , northern germany on tuesday morning , allowing for the final arrival of 123 tons of nuclear waste .
about 3,000 demonstrators staged a 44-hour sit-in in front of the storage site , including high-level politicians such as green party co-chair claudia roth .
activists from the environmentalist organization greenpeace used a truck disguised as a vehicle carrying beer to block the freight train station in nearby dannenberg , where the waste containers were to be moved to trucks for the final 20 kilometers to the storage site .
two greenpeace activists delayed the transport by about 11 hours by encasing themselves in a cement block , making it so the police could not move them without injuring them .
authorities managed to free the activists early tuesday morning , and the first truck carrying the nuclear waste departed dannenberg at around 8:30 a.m.
the last of the trucks arrived at the storage facility at about 9:50 a.m.
bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists held up the trucks carrying the waste for 11 hours stop-and-go traffic large protests have taken place during past nuclear waste transport operations , but none have delayed the shipment of the waste as much as the most recent .
the waste originated from nuclear reactors in germany and was sent to a plant in northern france for reprocessing .
the waste containers , called " castors " -lrb- cask for storage and transport of radioactive material -rrb- , left france by train on friday afternoon , but were quickly stopped by the first blockade of activists on the train tracks .
the following days were a tedious stop-and-go game , as protestors blocked the train tracks and some of the 16,000 police officers mobilized to secure the transport removed them .
protests to continue leaders of the various " citizens ' initiatives " against nuclear power claimed victory on tuesday , despite the successful transport of the nuclear waste , and some vowed to continue protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors succeeded in delaying the transport on historic levels " we 've shown that we 're a force to be reckoned with , " said kerstin rudek , chairwoman of the citizens ' initiative for environmental protection luechow-dannenberg .
matthias miersch , environment spokesman for the opposition social democrats in parliament , said the movement against the nuclear waste transport was a " very impressive demonstration . "
" this was a very clear signal to the government that this atomic energy policy can not go on , " he told phoenix public television .
" politicians have to understand that decisions are being made now that the people are absolutely unable to relate to . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 09.11.2010 black market is corrupting efforts to save tuna , report says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blue fin tuna are top predators and play a crucial role in balancing the oceans ' ecosystem a team of investigative reporters has revealed a flourishing illicit trade in bluefin tuna .
after months of digging , their probe suggests governments and regulators have willingly turned a blind eye to the problem . it is no secret that the past decade has seen sushi gain popularity in the western world , but the methods for feeding this appetite have been kept fairly well hidden .
until now .
in a report detailing the findings of its seven-month long probe into the business of bluefin tuna fishing , the international consortium of investigative journalists -lrb- icij -rrb- has unveiled a culture of over-exploitation , tacitly approved by government authorities .
the report details systematic over-fishing , falsely reported catch volumes , ignored bans of spotter planes to track down schools of tuna and illegal sales of national quotas from one vessel to another .
all told , the investigation paints a bleak picture in which thousands of tons of fish were illegally hauled between 1998 and 2007 - as many as one in every three bluefin tuna may have been caught illegally during this period .
the report also unveils a complex network of fishing fleets , farms , ministries and distributors from countries such as france , spain , italy , turkey and japan involved in the creation of a flourishing black market trade .
the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- said the inquiry had confirmed its repeated warnings of widespread illegalities .
" no consumer , no business , no government can be sure they are dealing with responsibly caught and traded bluefin tuna , " sergi tudela , head of fisheries at wwf mediterranean said in a statement .
" the whole chain is tarnished . "
parallels to the drug trade bildunterschrift : quotas for tuna are being flouted and authorities are looking away , investigators say .
eastern atlantic bluefin tuna are a catch in more than one sense of the word .
one large tuna , which can be three meters long and weigh more than 500 kilos , can fetch as much as 71,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- on the japanese market , the source of most of the world 's demand for tuna .
as marine biologist , daniel pauly told the icij , the promise of a slice of such wealth is too enticing for many to resist .
" fisheries are one of the most criminalized sectors in the world , " pauly said .
" this generates so much money that it 's like drugs . "
the report said the black market trade in tuna was worth at least $ 4 billion -lrb- 2.9 billion euros -rrb- between 1998 and 2007 .
while mostly taking aim at suppliers and the governments that turned a blind eye to their exporters ' behaviour , the report also reveals how japanese dealers evaded tuna quotas by importing tuna as another species of fish , only to re-label them as tuna at market . as the demand for the fish has grown , the industry has evolved in an increasingly detrimental way .
tuna farms have sprung up throughout the mediterranean , fishermen regularly plunder stocks in spawning areas and more boats – often subsidised at taxpayers ' expense – have been put to sea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the demand for tuna stems from japan , though fishing occurs internationally fish stocks dwindling the report singles out the burgeoning practice of purse-seining - in which entire schools of fish are encircled by vast nets and dragged to farms to be harvested .
as a consequence , numbers of bluefin tuna , which play a crucial role at the top of the marine food chain , have plummeted by almost three quarters over the past four decades , while the size of the average captured bluefin tuna has almost halved .

after months of digging , their probe suggests governments and regulators have willingly turned a blind eye to the problem . it is no secret that the past decade has seen sushi gain popularity in the western world , but the methods for feeding this appetite have been kept fairly well hidden .
until now .
in a report detailing the findings of its seven-month long probe into the business of bluefin tuna fishing , the international consortium of investigative journalists -lrb- icij -rrb- has unveiled a culture of over-exploitation , tacitly approved by government authorities .
the report details systematic over-fishing , falsely reported catch volumes , ignored bans of spotter planes to track down schools of tuna and illegal sales of national quotas from one vessel to another .
all told , the investigation paints a bleak picture in which thousands of tons of fish were illegally hauled between 1998 and 2007 - as many as one in every three bluefin tuna may have been caught illegally during this period .
the report also unveils a complex network of fishing fleets , farms , ministries and distributors from countries such as france , spain , italy , turkey and japan involved in the creation of a flourishing black market trade .
the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- said the inquiry had confirmed its repeated warnings of widespread illegalities .
" no consumer , no business , no government can be sure they are dealing with responsibly caught and traded bluefin tuna , " sergi tudela , head of fisheries at wwf mediterranean said in a statement .
" the whole chain is tarnished . "
parallels to the drug trade bildunterschrift : quotas for tuna are being flouted and authorities are looking away , investigators say .
eastern atlantic bluefin tuna are a catch in more than one sense of the word .
one large tuna , which can be three meters long and weigh more than 500 kilos , can fetch as much as 71,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- on the japanese market , the source of most of the world 's demand for tuna .
as marine biologist , daniel pauly told the icij , the promise of a slice of such wealth is too enticing for many to resist .
" fisheries are one of the most criminalized sectors in the world , " pauly said .
" this generates so much money that it 's like drugs . "
the report said the black market trade in tuna was worth at least $ 4 billion -lrb- 2.9 billion euros -rrb- between 1998 and 2007 .
while mostly taking aim at suppliers and the governments that turned a blind eye to their exporters ' behaviour , the report also reveals how japanese dealers evaded tuna quotas by importing tuna as another species of fish , only to re-label them as tuna at market . as the demand for the fish has grown , the industry has evolved in an increasingly detrimental way .
tuna farms have sprung up throughout the mediterranean , fishermen regularly plunder stocks in spawning areas and more boats – often subsidised at taxpayers ' expense – have been put to sea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the demand for tuna stems from japan , though fishing occurs internationally fish stocks dwindling the report singles out the burgeoning practice of purse-seining - in which entire schools of fish are encircled by vast nets and dragged to farms to be harvested .
as a consequence , numbers of bluefin tuna , which play a crucial role at the top of the marine food chain , have plummeted by almost three quarters over the past four decades , while the size of the average captured bluefin tuna has almost halved .
" if we want to continue being able to fish bluefin tuna at all , we need to backtrack 20 years , " gemma parkes , a spokeswoman for wwf mediterranean , told deutsche welle .
the extent of the problem first surfaced in 2007 when france was revealed to have caught almost twice the quota it is allowed under the international commission for the conservation of the atlantic tunas -lrb- iccat -rrb- – the tuna fishing industry 's watchdog .
the fishermen involved in the case were charged , and the regulatory body responded by introducing a new system , known as the bluefin tuna catch document -lrb- bcd -rrb- , to help monitor catch sizes .
but the team of investigative reporters at the icij says this system is full of so many holes that the data it gathers is practically useless .

the agency , the energy arm of the organization for economic cooperation and development , a grouping of the world 's richest nations , forecast that global oil demand will rise to 99 million barrels a day by 2035 , some 15 million barrels a day higher than last year .
" the message is clear , the price will go up , especially if consuming countries do not make changes in the way they consume oil , especially in the transport sector , " the iea 's chief economist and lead author of the report , fatih birol told reuters in an interview .
oil prices will exceed $ 200 -lrb- 144 euro -rrb- a barrel by 2035 , and will likely stay over $ 100 a barrel after 2015 , the report said .
on tuesday the price of oil stood at roughly $ 87 a barrel .
china drives demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace wants even more emphasis on renewables china and other emerging economies are driving demand for oil higher .
" all the net growth comes from non-oecd countries , almost half from china alone , mainly driven by rising use of transport fuels , " the iea said in the report .
oil subsidies were limiting the scope for higher prices to choke off demand and change consumer habits , the iea said , and called for oil subsidies to be reduced .
" if subsidy policy does not change , with increasing price assumptions , these $ 312 billion in subsidies for 2009 will reach $ 600 billion in 2015 .
that 's huge , " birol said .
the report estimated that renewable energy only receives $ 57 billion in subsidies , a fraction of the ongoing support for the fossil fuel sector .
eradicating fossil fuel subsidies would boost the global economy , environment and energy security , the iea said , referring to a pledge made by g20 countries .
g20 leaders committed in pittsburgh in 2009 to phase out , over the medium-term , inefficient fossil fuel subsidies which distort the energy market and encourage wasteful consumption .
a g20 meeting in seoul this week may update progress on fossil fuels . greenpeace welcomed the iea 's call to cut the $ 312 billion in global fossil fuel subsidies .
" the iea report clearly states that fossil fuels are heavily subsidized … leading to unfair competition with clean and climate friendly renewable energies .
we welcome that renewables are now in the focus of the 2010 edition , " said sven teske , renewable energy director at greenpeace international , in a press release .
gas glut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surplus of gas may hinder development in renewable energy the future of renewable energy depended on strong government support , said the iea report , especially given an expected " ten year glut in gas " which would suppress fossil fuel power prices and make renewables look even less competitive .
" the gas glut will be with us ten more years , " birol told reuters .
" cheaper gas prices will put additional pressure on renewable energies especially in the us and europe .
if natural gas is as plenty and cheap as we think , then life for renewables will be even more difficult , " he added although greenpeace praised the iea for making renewable energy more prominent in this year 's report , teske from greenpeace international criticized the iea 's emphasis on other energy sources such as nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- for coal power stations .
" the iea is failing to shift technology recommendations from unproven , dangerous and expensive technologies such as ccs and nuclear power plants , " teske said .
greenpeace would like to see more emphasis on renewable energy and greater efficiency to reduce co2 emissions .

" the iea report clearly states that fossil fuels are heavily subsidized … leading to unfair competition with clean and climate friendly renewable energies .
we welcome that renewables are now in the focus of the 2010 edition , " said sven teske , renewable energy director at greenpeace international , in a press release .
gas glut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surplus of gas may hinder development in renewable energy the future of renewable energy depended on strong government support , said the iea report , especially given an expected " ten year glut in gas " which would suppress fossil fuel power prices and make renewables look even less competitive .
" the gas glut will be with us ten more years , " birol told reuters .
" cheaper gas prices will put additional pressure on renewable energies especially in the us and europe .
if natural gas is as plenty and cheap as we think , then life for renewables will be even more difficult , " he added although greenpeace praised the iea for making renewable energy more prominent in this year 's report , teske from greenpeace international criticized the iea 's emphasis on other energy sources such as nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- for coal power stations .
" the iea is failing to shift technology recommendations from unproven , dangerous and expensive technologies such as ccs and nuclear power plants , " teske said .
greenpeace would like to see more emphasis on renewable energy and greater efficiency to reduce co2 emissions .

the agency , the energy arm of the organization for economic cooperation and development , a grouping of the world 's richest nations , forecast that global oil demand will rise to 99 million barrels a day by 2035 , some 15 million barrels a day higher than last year .
" the message is clear , the price will go up , especially if consuming countries do not make changes in the way they consume oil , especially in the transport sector , " the iea 's chief economist and lead author of the report , fatih birol told reuters in an interview .
oil prices will exceed $ 200 -lrb- 144 euro -rrb- a barrel by 2035 , and will likely stay over $ 100 a barrel after 2015 , the report said .
on tuesday the price of oil stood at roughly $ 87 a barrel .
china drives demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace wants even more emphasis on renewables china and other emerging economies are driving demand for oil higher .
" all the net growth comes from non-oecd countries , almost half from china alone , mainly driven by rising use of transport fuels , " the iea said in the report .
oil subsidies were limiting the scope for higher prices to choke off demand and change consumer habits , the iea said , and called for oil subsidies to be reduced .
" if subsidy policy does not change , with increasing price assumptions , these $ 312 billion in subsidies for 2009 will reach $ 600 billion in 2015 .
that 's huge , " birol said .
the report estimated that renewable energy only receives $ 57 billion in subsidies , a fraction of the ongoing support for the fossil fuel sector .
eradicating fossil fuel subsidies would boost the global economy , environment and energy security , the iea said , referring to a pledge made by g20 countries .

bush recalls in his book " decision points , " released tuesday in the us , that schroeder 's reversal on supporting the iraq war in a bid to win re-election in 2004 caused their relationship to sour .
bush says schroeder had privately assured him he backed his policy on iraq .
schroeder , along with the then french and russian presidents jacques chirac and vladimir putin , led international opposition to us diplomatic efforts to win support for invading iraq .
the war in iraq was and remains deeply unpopular in germany .
" as someone who valued personal diplomacy , i put a high premium on trust , " bush wrote .
" once that trust was violated , it was hard to have a constructive relationship again . "
schroeder rejects accusation schroeder disputed bush 's version , saying in a statement that he had only promised support if it was shown that saddam hussein 's regime played a role in the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , which was not the case .
" the bush administration 's reasons for the iraq war were based , as we know today , on lies , " schroeder said .
bush also seized upon comments made in 2002 by a german official who compared the us president to adolf hitler .
" i was shocked and furious , " bush writes of the alleged remarks by the then-german justice minister , herta daeubler-gmelin .
" it was hard to think of anything more insulting than being compared to hitler by a german official . "
the minister had to resign .

bush recalls in his book " decision points , " released tuesday in the us , that schroeder 's reversal on supporting the iraq war in a bid to win re-election in 2004 caused their relationship to sour .
bush says schroeder had privately assured him he backed his policy on iraq .
schroeder , along with the then french and russian presidents jacques chirac and vladimir putin , led international opposition to us diplomatic efforts to win support for invading iraq .
the war in iraq was and remains deeply unpopular in germany .
" as someone who valued personal diplomacy , i put a high premium on trust , " bush wrote .
" once that trust was violated , it was hard to have a constructive relationship again . "
schroeder rejects accusation schroeder disputed bush 's version , saying in a statement that he had only promised support if it was shown that saddam hussein 's regime played a role in the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , which was not the case .
" the bush administration 's reasons for the iraq war were based , as we know today , on lies , " schroeder said .
bush also seized upon comments made in 2002 by a german official who compared the us president to adolf hitler .
" i was shocked and furious , " bush writes of the alleged remarks by the then-german justice minister , herta daeubler-gmelin .
" it was hard to think of anything more insulting than being compared to hitler by a german official . "
the minister had to resign .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 09.11.2010 eu criticizes turkey in annual report on membership hopefuls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's accession talks with the eu are floundering the eu has called on turkey to open up trade with cyprus , to better promote gender equality and human rights , and to toe the line on foreign policy issues in a lukewarm appraisal of ankara 's path towards eu membership . the european union announced on tuesday that only one of seven candidates for membership in the bloc is close to achieving its goal .
" the negotiations with croatia are now in their final phase , " the european commission said in its annual report on the progress of would-be eu members .
the commission pointed to widespread corruption and organized crime problems in other western balkan applicant countries as the biggest hurdle to their joining the bloc in the short term , although it did announce that montenegro was ready for full candidate status , saying the country 's democracy " is largely in line with european principles and standards . "
montenegro 's application has already been recognized by the eu , and with the commission 's approval , member states will now debate whether to grant the country candidate status and begin the process of negotiating membership .
croatia , iceland , turkey and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia are the four candidates that have already reached this final phase of the accession process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks voted for constitutional changes meant to appease brussels in a september referendum turkey began its official negotiations five years ago , but the eu acknowledged in its report that the process has hit rather rocky ground .
" negotiations advanced , albeit rather slowly , " the commission said of accession talks with ankara .
several stumbling blocks despite praising constitutional reforms designed to fight corruption , wrest some political power away from the military , and improve the protection of human rights as " a step in the right direction , " the commission said that turkey was still lagging behind in areas like press freedom , freedom of expression and religion , the rights of women and trade unions , and the integration of the kurdish minority in the country .
" the pace of reform in turkey dictates the pace of the accession process , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle said in berlin , shortly after the report was released .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the division of cyprus has soured turkish relations with eu members greece and cyprus the european commission also called on turkey to open trade ties with cyprus and redouble diplomatic efforts with the country , describing the need for progress in this area as " urgent . "
eu member state cyprus and turkey are locked in a territorial dispute over the northern part of the island , which has been occupied by turkish forces since 1974 .
reunification talks have stalled , and turkey says it will not open trade ties with cyprus until the problem is resolved .
and while cyprus tries to slow turkey 's accession into the eu , turkey is using its membership of nato to hamper cyprus ' bid to join that alliance .
another problem facing turkey 's membership bid that did not get highlighted in the eu commission 's annual report is the sheer size of the country .
a 2009 census put turkey 's population at 72 million , which would make it the second most populous member of the bloc .
" that means turkey would be represented in the european parliament with a number of mps to reflect its size , and the size of its population would also mean a lot of weight in decisions in the council of ministers , " the head of the eu program at the german council on foreign relations , almut moeller , told deutsche welle .
moeller said that eu insiders often talk about the influence turkey would wield in the bloc , and the affect it would have on the larger countries and their power structure .
" this is a sensitively calibrated order that has been around for a while now , and in the past we have only seen smaller and medium-sized countries entering the bloc .
they have relatively little impact on the big players , but imagine what a country this size would mean for the old order , for the amount of power currently shared between france and germany in the eu , for instance . "
gul : ' strategic imperative ' to let turkey in five years ago , there was an outpouring of pro-european sentiment and euphoria in turkey when the country began the final phase of the eu accession process .
but the mood seems to be souring as other applicants make much smoother process towards membership in the bloc .
on monday , brussels announced plans to grant visa-free travel within the eu 's open-border schengen zone to people from albania and bosnia , and the turkish newspaper haber tuerk responded by proclaiming on tuesday 's front page : " everyone 's allowed into the eu , except us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president gul thinks the eu is short-sighted not to welcome turkey citizens from every balkan country except kosovo , which some eu members consider a part of serbia , are now free to travel within the eu 's open-border area , while turks have to seek special visas .
" the eu will not be weaker , but stronger both politically and economically with turkey 's membership , " turkish president abdullah gul said in a speech in london on monday .
" given the fact that the international balance of power tends to shift towards the east and asia , it is , indeed , a strategic imperative for the eu to have turkey as a member . "
gul , speaking to the chatham house think-tank after receiving the organization 's annual prize for statesmanship , said it was " sad to observe " that some european leaders did not recognize the role turkey could play within the eu .
" this short-sighted vision is the major impediment before the idea of the eu as a global actor , capable of assuming greater responsibilities on political and security issues , complementing its economic clout , " the turkish president said .
in his speech , gul also announced that neighboring iran had asked turkey to host another round of talks with un security council members and germany on tehran 's nuclear program , alluding to the diplomatic role his country might play for the eu .
however , turkey 's international activities were also singled out by the eu for veiled criticism on tuesday , after the country defied the us and eu to vote against tougher un sanctions for iran earlier this year .
" turkey 's foreign policy has become more active in its wider neighborhood , " the commission 's report said .
" this is an asset for the european union , provided it is developed as a complement to turkey 's accession process and in coordination with the eu . "

however , turkey 's international activities were also singled out by the eu for veiled criticism on tuesday , after the country defied the us and eu to vote against tougher un sanctions for iran earlier this year .
" turkey 's foreign policy has become more active in its wider neighborhood , " the commission 's report said .
" this is an asset for the european union , provided it is developed as a complement to turkey 's accession process and in coordination with the eu . "

" the negotiations with croatia are now in their final phase , " the european commission said in its annual report on the progress of would-be eu members .
the commission pointed to widespread corruption and organized crime problems in other western balkan applicant countries as the biggest hurdle to their joining the bloc in the short term , although it did announce that montenegro was ready for full candidate status , saying the country 's democracy " is largely in line with european principles and standards . "
montenegro 's application has already been recognized by the eu , and with the commission 's approval , member states will now debate whether to grant the country candidate status and begin the process of negotiating membership .
croatia , iceland , turkey and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia are the four candidates that have already reached this final phase of the accession process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks voted for constitutional changes meant to appease brussels in a september referendum turkey began its official negotiations five years ago , but the eu acknowledged in its report that the process has hit rather rocky ground .
" negotiations advanced , albeit rather slowly , " the commission said of accession talks with ankara .
several stumbling blocks despite praising constitutional reforms designed to fight corruption , wrest some political power away from the military , and improve the protection of human rights as " a step in the right direction , " the commission said that turkey was still lagging behind in areas like press freedom , freedom of expression and religion , the rights of women and trade unions , and the integration of the kurdish minority in the country .
" the pace of reform in turkey dictates the pace of the accession process , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle said in berlin , shortly after the report was released .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the division of cyprus has soured turkish relations with eu members greece and cyprus the european commission also called on turkey to open trade ties with cyprus and redouble diplomatic efforts with the country , describing the need for progress in this area as " urgent . "
eu member state cyprus and turkey are locked in a territorial dispute over the northern part of the island , which has been occupied by turkish forces since 1974 .
reunification talks have stalled , and turkey says it will not open trade ties with cyprus until the problem is resolved .
and while cyprus tries to slow turkey 's accession into the eu , turkey is using its membership of nato to hamper cyprus ' bid to join that alliance .
another problem facing turkey 's membership bid that did not get highlighted in the eu commission 's annual report is the sheer size of the country .
a 2009 census put turkey 's population at 72 million , which would make it the second most populous member of the bloc .
" that means turkey would be represented in the european parliament with a number of mps to reflect its size , and the size of its population would also mean a lot of weight in decisions in the council of ministers , " the head of the eu program at the german council on foreign relations , almut moeller , told deutsche welle .
moeller said that eu insiders often talk about the influence turkey would wield in the bloc , and the affect it would have on the larger countries and their power structure .
" this is a sensitively calibrated order that has been around for a while now , and in the past we have only seen smaller and medium-sized countries entering the bloc .
they have relatively little impact on the big players , but imagine what a country this size would mean for the old order , for the amount of power currently shared between france and germany in the eu , for instance . "
gul : ' strategic imperative ' to let turkey in five years ago , there was an outpouring of pro-european sentiment and euphoria in turkey when the country began the final phase of the eu accession process .
but the mood seems to be souring as other applicants make much smoother process towards membership in the bloc .
on monday , brussels announced plans to grant visa-free travel within the eu 's open-border schengen zone to people from albania and bosnia , and the turkish newspaper haber tuerk responded by proclaiming on tuesday 's front page : " everyone 's allowed into the eu , except us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president gul thinks the eu is short-sighted not to welcome turkey citizens from every balkan country except kosovo , which some eu members consider a part of serbia , are now free to travel within the eu 's open-border area , while turks have to seek special visas .
" the eu will not be weaker , but stronger both politically and economically with turkey 's membership , " turkish president abdullah gul said in a speech in london on monday .
" given the fact that the international balance of power tends to shift towards the east and asia , it is , indeed , a strategic imperative for the eu to have turkey as a member . "
gul , speaking to the chatham house think-tank after receiving the organization 's annual prize for statesmanship , said it was " sad to observe " that some european leaders did not recognize the role turkey could play within the eu .
" this short-sighted vision is the major impediment before the idea of the eu as a global actor , capable of assuming greater responsibilities on political and security issues , complementing its economic clout , " the turkish president said .
in his speech , gul also announced that neighboring iran had asked turkey to host another round of talks with un security council members and germany on tehran 's nuclear program , alluding to the diplomatic role his country might play for the eu .
however , turkey 's international activities were also singled out by the eu for veiled criticism on tuesday , after the country defied the us and eu to vote against tougher un sanctions for iran earlier this year .
" turkey 's foreign policy has become more active in its wider neighborhood , " the commission 's report said .
" this is an asset for the european union , provided it is developed as a complement to turkey 's accession process and in coordination with the eu . "

after nearly two days of blocking a nuclear waste storage site , thousands of protestors have been cleared from the area by police and the transport of 11 containers of nuclear waste has arrived at its destination . police cleared thousands of anti-nuclear activists from roads leading to the nuclear storage facility in gorleben , northern germany on tuesday morning , allowing for the final arrival of 123 tons of nuclear waste .
about 3,000 demonstrators staged a 44-hour sit-in in front of the storage site , including high-level politicians such as green party co-chair claudia roth .
activists from the environmentalist organization greenpeace used a truck disguised as a vehicle carrying beer to block the freight train station in nearby dannenberg , where the waste containers were to be moved to trucks for the final 20 kilometers to the storage site .
two greenpeace activists delayed the transport by about 11 hours by encasing themselves in a cement block , making it so the police could not move them without injuring them .
authorities managed to free the activists early tuesday morning , and the first truck carrying the nuclear waste departed dannenberg at around 8:30 a.m.
the last of the trucks arrived at the storage facility at about 9:50 a.m.
bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists held up the trucks carrying the waste for 11 hours stop-and-go traffic large protests have taken place during past nuclear waste transport operations , but none have delayed the shipment of the waste as much as the most recent .
the waste originated from nuclear reactors in germany and was sent to a plant in northern france for reprocessing .
the waste containers , called " castors " -lrb- cask for storage and transport of radioactive material -rrb- , left france by train on friday afternoon , but were quickly stopped by the first blockade of activists on the train tracks .
the following days were a tedious stop-and-go game , as protestors blocked the train tracks and some of the 16,000 police officers mobilized to secure the transport removed them .
protests to continue leaders of the various " citizens ' initiatives " against nuclear power claimed victory on tuesday , despite the successful transport of the nuclear waste , and some vowed to continue protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors succeeded in delaying the transport on historic levels " we 've shown that we 're a force to be reckoned with , " said kerstin rudek , chairwoman of the citizens ' initiative for environmental protection luechow-dannenberg .
matthias miersch , environment spokesman for the opposition social democrats in parliament , said the movement against the nuclear waste transport was a " very impressive demonstration . "
" this was a very clear signal to the government that this atomic energy policy can not go on , " he told phoenix public television .
" politicians have to understand that decisions are being made now that the people are absolutely unable to relate to . "
transport to russia meanwhile munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that germany had negotiated a deal " ready to be signed " to ship nuclear waste originating from an old atomic research facility in former east germany to russia .
the report said a total of 951 nuclear fuel elements from the east german research center dresden-rossendorf , which have been in temporary storage since 2005 , would be shipped to the mayak atomic complex in the southern urals for reprocessing .
the waste would stay in russia for permanent storage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mayak facility in russia is to reprocess east germany 's radioactive waste the report said the basis for the transport deal was a previous agreement between the united states and russia , which regulates the transport of nuclear waste from reactors that were overseen by the soviet union .
germany 's goal was reportedly to " reduce the amount of highly-enriched uranium as much as possible . "
the deal received criticism from the green party , which has profited politically from a strong anti-nuclear sentiment in germany .
" cheap before safe , that 's what this is about , " green party spokeswoman sylvia kotting-uhl told the newspaper .

these types of ultra-high-speed smash-ups at the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- are an attempt to re-create the explosion , known as the big bang , which is believed to have begun the universe .
as spokeswoman barbara warmbein told the associated press , the cern experiment over the weekend produced " a very , very , very small bang . "
lead ions are lead atoms whose electrons have been removed , and are much heavier than the protons that the researchers had been using .
that may be beneficial , as the energy required to smash them is higher , and thus may be closer to the conditions the scientists are trying to analyze .
as the research continues , scientists are trying to create " quark-gluon plasma , " an extremely hot and dense type of matter that may unlock some secrets in the early universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lead ion experiments will continue until cern shuts down for the winter on december 6 " the experiments are already providing an exciting glimpse of the new frontier , " sergio bertolucci , cern 's director for research and computing , told afp news agency .
major breakthroughs ' could take years ' the lhc is comprised of a circular , 27-kilometer -lrb- 17-mile -rrb- atom-smasher that cost four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- to build near geneva .
it began operations in september 2008 .
beyond pushing the limits of particle physics , the team is also exploring the frontier of data storage and transfer .
cern is currently using 140 computer centers spread across 34 countries to back up and analyze its data , which is being transferred at peak rates of 10 gigabytes per second , or the equivalent of approximately two dvds per second .
still , warmbein added that it will likely be months , if not years , before cern scientists make any major breakthroughs .

" the negotiations with croatia are now in their final phase , " the european commission said in its annual report on the progress of would-be eu members .
the commission pointed to widespread corruption and organized crime problems in other western balkan applicant countries as the biggest hurdle to their joining the bloc in the short term , although it did announce that montenegro was ready for full candidate status , saying the country 's democracy " is largely in line with european principles and standards . "
montenegro 's application has already been recognized by the eu , and with the commission 's approval , member states will now debate whether to grant the country candidate status and begin the process of negotiating membership .
croatia , iceland , turkey and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia are the four candidates that have already reached this final phase of the accession process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks voted for constitutional changes meant to appease brussels in a september referendum turkey began its official negotiations five years ago , but the eu acknowledged in its report that the process has hit rather rocky ground .
" negotiations advanced , albeit rather slowly , " the commission said of accession talks with ankara .
several stumbling blocks despite praising constitutional reforms designed to fight corruption , wrest some political power away from the military , and improve the protection of human rights as " a step in the right direction , " the commission said that turkey was still lagging behind in areas like press freedom , freedom of expression and religion , the rights of women and trade unions , and the integration of the kurdish minority in the country .
" the pace of reform in turkey dictates the pace of the accession process , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle said in berlin , shortly after the report was released .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the division of cyprus has soured turkish relations with eu members greece and cyprus the european commission also called on turkey to open trade ties with cyprus and redouble diplomatic efforts with the country , describing the need for progress in this area as " urgent . "
eu member state cyprus and turkey are locked in a territorial dispute over the northern part of the island , which has been occupied by turkish forces since 1974 .
reunification talks have stalled , and turkey says it will not open trade ties with cyprus until the problem is resolved .
and while cyprus tries to slow turkey 's accession into the eu , turkey is using its membership of nato to hamper cyprus ' bid to join that alliance .
another problem facing turkey 's membership bid that did not get highlighted in the eu commission 's annual report is the sheer size of the country .
a 2009 census put turkey 's population at 72 million , which would make it the second most populous member of the bloc .
" that means turkey would be represented in the european parliament with a number of mps to reflect its size , and the size of its population would also mean a lot of weight in decisions in the council of ministers , " the head of the eu program at the german council on foreign relations , almut moeller , told deutsche welle .
moeller said that eu insiders often talk about the influence turkey would wield in the bloc , and the affect it would have on the larger countries and their power structure .
" this is a sensitively calibrated order that has been around for a while now , and in the past we have only seen smaller and medium-sized countries entering the bloc .
they have relatively little impact on the big players , but imagine what a country this size would mean for the old order , for the amount of power currently shared between france and germany in the eu , for instance . "
gul : ' strategic imperative ' to let turkey in five years ago , there was an outpouring of pro-european sentiment and euphoria in turkey when the country began the final phase of the eu accession process .
but the mood seems to be souring as other applicants make much smoother process towards membership in the bloc .
on monday , brussels announced plans to grant visa-free travel within the eu 's open-border schengen zone to people from albania and bosnia , and the turkish newspaper haber tuerk responded by proclaiming on tuesday 's front page : " everyone 's allowed into the eu , except us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president gul thinks the eu is short-sighted not to welcome turkey citizens from every balkan country except kosovo , which some eu members consider a part of serbia , are now free to travel within the eu 's open-border area , while turks have to seek special visas .
" the eu will not be weaker , but stronger both politically and economically with turkey 's membership , " turkish president abdullah gul said in a speech in london on monday .
" given the fact that the international balance of power tends to shift towards the east and asia , it is , indeed , a strategic imperative for the eu to have turkey as a member . "
gul , speaking to the chatham house think-tank after receiving the organization 's annual prize for statesmanship , said it was " sad to observe " that some european leaders did not recognize the role turkey could play within the eu .
" this short-sighted vision is the major impediment before the idea of the eu as a global actor , capable of assuming greater responsibilities on political and security issues , complementing its economic clout , " the turkish president said .
in his speech , gul also announced that neighboring iran had asked turkey to host another round of talks with un security council members and germany on tehran 's nuclear program , alluding to the diplomatic role his country might play for the eu .
however , turkey 's international activities were also singled out by the eu for veiled criticism on tuesday , after the country defied the us and eu to vote against tougher un sanctions for iran earlier this year .
" turkey 's foreign policy has become more active in its wider neighborhood , " the commission 's report said .
" this is an asset for the european union , provided it is developed as a complement to turkey 's accession process and in coordination with the eu . "

the downside is the impact this has on the environment .
but the country is taking meausres on climate protection - even more than some industrialized nations . in may 2009 , cyclone aila swept through the ganges delta .
tidal waves flooded a number of islands , devastating homes and farmland and claiming 300 lives .
200,000 people became climate refugees , and were forced to abandon their homes .
tropical cyclones are not uncommon in the world 's largest delta .
but to many , aila served a grim reminder of climate change , with greenpeace maintaining the destruction caused was in consonance with the predictions made by scientists , who had warned that storms would become more frequent and more damaging due to climate change .
aila also served as a reminder that the ganges delta is one of asia 's climate hotspots , vulnerable to some of the worst manifestations of climate change .
here , the effects of global warming are well underway – while in europe and north america , they are still only the subject of conferences and media debates . unique threat the challenges faced by people living on the ganges delta include the threat of rising sea levels caused mostly by subsidence in the region and partly by climate change .
if this continues , the result will be mass displacement .
higher temperatures related to climate change could also bring about more severe flooding of the delta , because of increased melting of snow and glaciers in the himalayas .
bildunterschrift : only a fraction of those displaced by aila had access to food and drinking water according to the experts , if climate change continues unchecked , the consequences for india will be devastating .
according to us economist william cline from the peterson institute for international economics in washington , india 's crop yield could drop by two thirds by 2080 as a result of global warming .
the institute 's statistics show that india is more at threat than any other region on the planet .
it 's not as though india is one of the planet 's biggest polluters .
the climate footprint of the seventh largest country in the world is commensurate with the size of its population - which is over 1 billion .
its carbon emissions are considerably lower than those of the us and china .
this is due largely to the country 's widespread poverty .
but as the indian economy gathers pace , the fear is that environmental issues will be sidelined .
demand for energy is rising as the middle-class buys more cars , tvs and better housing .
much of that energy comes from coal oil and gas , the main sources for planet-warming carbon dioxide .
but the country 's politicians are aware of the need for a low-carbon growth path .
learning from others ' mistakes " we need to put electricity into people 's homes and do it cleanly , " said india 's environment minister jairam ramesh last year - stressing that rich and poor nations inevitably have different approaches to tackling climate change . " you in the west need to live with only one car rather than three .
for you it 's about luxury .
for us it is about survival . "
india is especially active in the field of renewable energies , explains martin kaiser , director of international climate policy at greenpeace germany .
" india was quick to recognize that renewables could become a major growth market within its own economy , and got in on the act very early , " he says .
" it was a good move , because when an emerging economy invests in these technologies and contributes to their widespread use , they appear significantly more credible than the leading industrialized nations , who might just be keen to make money from them .
they become role models for other developing nations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy is popular in many developing nations today , india ranks 5th in the world with a total wind power capacity of 10,925 mw , or 3 percent of all electricity produced in the country .
experts predict that by 2030 , wind power will be supplying 15 percent of india 's energy needs . india is at pains to avoid the mistakes made by the industrialized nations .
large companies are now legally bound to hire energy managers , whose primary task is to ensure energy-efficient production , and are responsible for implement energy-saving measures .
they also report on the companies ' carbon footprint to india 's licensing authorities .
even the poverty-stricken population living on the ganges delta contributes to the fight against climate change by using solar energy .
mini solar units provide enough energy for a couple of energy-saving lamps and a radio or tv , and 50 percent of the 4.5 million people who live in the sundarbans in the lower part of the delta own one , according to geetanjali solar enterprise , an indian manufacturer of solar products and equipment .
that 's a much higher percentage of the population than in the major european cities and the us .

nonnenmacher was recently implicated in a spying scandal at the bank . the axe appears to be about to fall on the head of one of germany 's powerful state banks , hsh nordbank , after the lender 's major shareholders asked its supervisory board to give scandal-plagued ceo dirk jens nonnenmacher the sack .
nonnenmacher 's tenure as hsh chief was thrown into doubt after he was implicated in allegations of spying at the state-controlled bank .
the 47-year-old has also been investigated by prosecutors over risky investments that led to the bank losing millions of euros .
hsh nordbank 's biggest investors , the states of schleswig-holstein and hamburg , have reportedly asked the bank 's supervisory board chairman hilmar kopper to begin proceedings to find a new ceo for the lender .
in a written statement , the state governments said nonnenmacher 's dismissal was necessary to " win back lost trust " in hsh , whose main commercial focus is on shipping , transportation , real estate and renewable energy .

he became chairman in november 2008 , succeeding hans berger .
hsh nordbank is currently emerging from a financially rocky period brought on by the global financial crisis .

after nearly two days of blocking a nuclear waste storage site , thousands of protestors have been cleared from the area by police and the transport of 11 containers of nuclear waste has arrived at its destination . police cleared thousands of anti-nuclear activists from roads leading to the nuclear storage facility in gorleben , northern germany on tuesday morning , allowing for the final arrival of 123 tons of nuclear waste .
about 3,000 demonstrators staged a 44-hour sit-in in front of the storage site , including high-level politicians such as green party co-chair claudia roth .
activists from the environmentalist organization greenpeace used a truck disguised as a vehicle carrying beer to block the freight train station in nearby dannenberg , where the waste containers were to be moved to trucks for the final 20 kilometers to the storage site .
two greenpeace activists delayed the transport by about 11 hours by encasing themselves in a cement block , making it so the police could not move them without injuring them .
authorities managed to free the activists early tuesday morning , and the first truck carrying the nuclear waste departed dannenberg at around 8:30 a.m.
the last of the trucks arrived at the storage facility at about 9:50 a.m.
bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists held up the trucks carrying the waste for 11 hours stop-and-go traffic large protests have taken place during past nuclear waste transport operations , but none have delayed the shipment of the waste as much as the most recent .
the waste originated from nuclear reactors in germany and was sent to a plant in northern france for reprocessing .
the waste containers , called " castors " -lrb- cask for storage and transport of radioactive material -rrb- , left france by train on friday afternoon , but were quickly stopped by the first blockade of activists on the train tracks .
the following days were a tedious stop-and-go game , as protestors blocked the train tracks and some of the 16,000 police officers mobilized to secure the transport removed them .
protests to continue leaders of the various " citizens ' initiatives " against nuclear power claimed victory on tuesday , despite the successful transport of the nuclear waste , and some vowed to continue protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors succeeded in delaying the transport on historic levels " we 've shown that we 're a force to be reckoned with , " said kerstin rudek , chairwoman of the citizens ' initiative for environmental protection luechow-dannenberg .
matthias miersch , environment spokesman for the opposition social democrats in parliament , said the movement against the nuclear waste transport was a " very impressive demonstration . "
" this was a very clear signal to the government that this atomic energy policy can not go on , " he told phoenix public television .
" politicians have to understand that decisions are being made now that the people are absolutely unable to relate to . "
transport to russia meanwhile munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that germany had negotiated a deal " ready to be signed " to ship nuclear waste originating from an old atomic research facility in former east germany to russia .
the report said a total of 951 nuclear fuel elements from the east german research center dresden-rossendorf , which have been in temporary storage since 2005 , would be shipped to the mayak atomic complex in the southern urals for reprocessing .
the waste would stay in russia for permanent storage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mayak facility in russia is to reprocess east germany 's radioactive waste the report said the basis for the transport deal was a previous agreement between the united states and russia , which regulates the transport of nuclear waste from reactors that were overseen by the soviet union .
germany 's goal was reportedly to " reduce the amount of highly-enriched uranium as much as possible . "
the deal received criticism from the green party , which has profited politically from a strong anti-nuclear sentiment in germany .
" cheap before safe , that 's what this is about , " green party spokeswoman sylvia kotting-uhl told the newspaper .

but not for long .
as researcher philipp gunz explained to deutsche welle , the similarities evolved into differences during the first year of their lives , a finding which proves a cognitive gulf between humans and the extinct species .
" what is being established during that period , both in humans and neanderthals , is synaptic connection among brain cells , " gunz said .
" we know from the example of modern man that even subtle differences can have significant consequences on development , and can contribute to social and communication skills . "
and although gunz says there is little doubt that the neanderthals , which have been extinct for almost 30,000 years , had language and did communicate with each other , they would have seen the world differently to the way we do .
same , same , but not for long bildunterschrift : how alike were we really ?
baby homo neanderthalensis ' elongated braincases – also found in new-born humans – had more to do with the physical make-up of the mothers than anything else .
" the baby has to fit through the birth canal and the shape of both was very similar so that would impose a constraint . "
but once unbridled and free to grow at will , human braincases gradually begin to change form to become more globular .
it is this shape which gunz believes proves early brain development in man which is absent in neanderthals .
human uniqueness in earlier research the scientists discovered that right after birth human brains are quite unlike those of chimpanzees , but that they become more similar at a later stage of development .
this shows that the " globularization phase " sets humans apart from both chimps and neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : chimps and man : not so similar " we think modern humans , chimpanzees and neanderthals share one ancestral growth pattern that that goes back millions of years , " gunz continued .
" but in the first year of life , modern humans depart from this ancestral pattern . "
and contrary to past opinion , it is this first year , and not brain size , which is crucial to cognitive development .
the leipzig anthropologists say it is the internal organization of the brain that matters .
deeper understanding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's in an ancient tooth ?
the scientists hope their research will help them understand a little more about the function of the genes , only a very small number of which separate modern humans from their extinct counterparts .
" we assume that some of these genes are related to brain development , " gunz said .
" in living people these mutations are linked to autism or schizophrenia or down-syndrome . "
and while he is not suggesting that an autistic child is a throwback to tens of thousands of years ago , the leipzig anthropologist does venture a link .
" we know from teeth that neanderthals grew faster , so maybe some of the genes are related to the regulation of brain growth . "

the key speaker at the event was a controversial choice , attacked by german jewish groups for his criticism of israel .
the 1938 kristallnacht is considered to be the first nazi-sanctioned nation-wide attack against jews .
mobs sought out and torched jewish-owned shops , homes and synagogues around the country .
many were murdered , while tens of thousands were deported to nazi concentration camps .
key speaker at the frankfurt st paul 's church ceremony was german-born french author alfred grosser .
as expected , grosser launched into a critique of israeli policies towards the palestinians , saying it could not be expected that those in gaza could " understand the horror of assassinations , if you do not show great sympathy in understanding the suffering in the gaza strip . "
the announcement that grosser would speak at the anniversary ceremony had led to fierce objections from germany 's central council of jews and others in the country 's jewish community .
many threatened to walk out of the proceedings if grosser entered into a diatribe against the jewish state .
grosser said he felt justified in criticizing israel as he considered the country to be part of europe , adding that everybody should be held accountable to western values .

" the negotiations with croatia are now in their final phase , " the european commission said in its annual report on the progress of would-be eu members .
the commission pointed to widespread corruption and organized crime problems in other western balkan applicant countries as the biggest hurdle to their joining the bloc in the short term , although it did announce that montenegro was ready for full candidate status , saying the country 's democracy " is largely in line with european principles and standards . "
montenegro 's application has already been recognized by the eu , and with the commission 's approval , member states will now debate whether to grant the country candidate status and begin the process of negotiating membership .
croatia , iceland , turkey and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia are the four candidates that have already reached this final phase of the accession process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks voted for constitutional changes meant to appease brussels in a september referendum turkey began its official negotiations five years ago , but the eu acknowledged in its report that the process has hit rather rocky ground .
" negotiations advanced , albeit rather slowly , " the commission said of accession talks with ankara .
several stumbling blocks despite praising constitutional reforms designed to fight corruption , wrest some political power away from the military , and improve the protection of human rights as " a step in the right direction , " the commission said that turkey was still lagging behind in areas like press freedom , freedom of expression and religion , the rights of women and trade unions , and the integration of the kurdish minority in the country .
" the pace of reform in turkey dictates the pace of the accession process , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle said in berlin , shortly after the report was released .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the division of cyprus has soured turkish relations with eu members greece and cyprus the european commission also called on turkey to open trade ties with cyprus and redouble diplomatic efforts with the country , describing the need for progress in this area as " urgent . "
eu member state cyprus and turkey are locked in a territorial dispute over the northern part of the island , which has been occupied by turkish forces since 1974 .
reunification talks have stalled , and turkey says it will not open trade ties with cyprus until the problem is resolved .
and while cyprus tries to slow turkey 's accession into the eu , turkey is using its membership of nato to hamper cyprus ' bid to join that alliance .
another problem facing turkey 's membership bid that did not get highlighted in the eu commission 's annual report is the sheer size of the country .
a 2009 census put turkey 's population at 72 million , which would make it the second most populous member of the bloc .
" that means turkey would be represented in the european parliament with a number of mps to reflect its size , and the size of its population would also mean a lot of weight in decisions in the council of ministers , " the head of the eu program at the german council on foreign relations , almut moeller , told deutsche welle .
moeller said that eu insiders often talk about the influence turkey would wield in the bloc , and the affect it would have on the larger countries and their power structure .
" this is a sensitively calibrated order that has been around for a while now , and in the past we have only seen smaller and medium-sized countries entering the bloc .
they have relatively little impact on the big players , but imagine what a country this size would mean for the old order , for the amount of power currently shared between france and germany in the eu , for instance . "
gul : ' strategic imperative ' to let turkey in five years ago , there was an outpouring of pro-european sentiment and euphoria in turkey when the country began the final phase of the eu accession process .
but the mood seems to be souring as other applicants make much smoother process towards membership in the bloc .
on monday , brussels announced plans to grant visa-free travel within the eu 's open-border schengen zone to people from albania and bosnia , and the turkish newspaper haber tuerk responded by proclaiming on tuesday 's front page : " everyone 's allowed into the eu , except us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president gul thinks the eu is short-sighted not to welcome turkey citizens from every balkan country except kosovo , which some eu members consider a part of serbia , are now free to travel within the eu 's open-border area , while turks have to seek special visas .
" the eu will not be weaker , but stronger both politically and economically with turkey 's membership , " turkish president abdullah gul said in a speech in london on monday .
" given the fact that the international balance of power tends to shift towards the east and asia , it is , indeed , a strategic imperative for the eu to have turkey as a member . "
gul , speaking to the chatham house think-tank after receiving the organization 's annual prize for statesmanship , said it was " sad to observe " that some european leaders did not recognize the role turkey could play within the eu .
" this short-sighted vision is the major impediment before the idea of the eu as a global actor , capable of assuming greater responsibilities on political and security issues , complementing its economic clout , " the turkish president said .
in his speech , gul also announced that neighboring iran had asked turkey to host another round of talks with un security council members and germany on tehran 's nuclear program , alluding to the diplomatic role his country might play for the eu .
however , turkey 's international activities were also singled out by the eu for veiled criticism on tuesday , after the country defied the us and eu to vote against tougher un sanctions for iran earlier this year .
" turkey 's foreign policy has become more active in its wider neighborhood , " the commission 's report said .
" this is an asset for the european union , provided it is developed as a complement to turkey 's accession process and in coordination with the eu . "

after months living undercover in picturesque chiemsee , he 's now trying to get political aslyum . tucked away on the border of germany and austria , lake chiemsee has long been popular with holiday-makers .
but now the idyllic alpine region has become the unlikely backdrop for the story of a man wandering into uncharted political territory . in 2007 , andre shepherd walked off the us army base where he was stationed in southern germany .
the apache helicopter mechanic said his experiences on duty in iraq convinced him he could no longer support the war .
" the iraqi people , when i met them , reacted towards us with anger , hostility and fear .
we did n't understand why , because in the us , you think ' oh , we 're the liberators , " ' shepherd told detusche welle .
" but what was going on with the kidnappings , the rapes , and abu ghraib - the population just wanted us out of there . "
unexpected turn shepherd had never planned to make a career of the military .
in his 20 's , his dream of studying computer science fell by the wayside after he could n't afford to keep paying tuition at kent state university in ohio .
for a while , he lived in his car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lake chiemsee is known for its sunsets and alpine beauty , not political drama " i ended up being homeless for about a year , and i joined the military because it was the only way to get a job out of cleveland , " said the ohio native .
after his first tour of duty in iraq , shepherd returned to the base in germany , where he started doing internet research on the iraq war .
gradually , he became convinced that the us-led invasion was a human rights violation .
that was the moment of truth , says shepherd . " i had to decide , ok , do i just go back to the war , knowing what i 'm doing is wrong , that it 's murder , or do i go against the world 's most powerful government and have a lot of problems , be ostracized from society ? "
it took him ten days to make up his mind .
in april 2007 , shepherd walked off the base .
a risky move germany is a main staging post for the us military , with around 60,000 us troops stationed there .
each year , some of those soldiers go awol -lrb- absent without official leave -rrb- .
many get picked up by the german police and sent back to their bases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shepherd refused to take part in a war he calls illegal shepherd avoided being caught .
he did n't contact his family , relying on local friends and the occasional odd job to survive .
after 19 months , he decided to turn himself in and apply for political asylum .
if his application is successful , shepherd will become the first us iraq war veteran to receive political asylum in germany , says rudi friedrich , head of the pacifist organization connection .
friedrich 's organization , which he runs out of his home in a suburb of frankfurt , offers support to conscientious objectors and war deserters and has been guiding shepherd through the asylum-seeking process .
" the recognition that one is not alone is an important experience for a deserter to regain his self-esteem , to be able to say , ' yes , i did make the right choice , i do n't want to shoot at my neighbor , " ' friedrich told deutsche welle .
shepherd 's asylum application cites a 2004 european union regulation that grants refugee status to any soldier who is in danger of being prosecuted if his or her military service " would include crimes or acts " which violate international law .
but some fear granting shepherd asylum could create an easy way out for americans stationed in germany who want to avoid combat duty in iraq .
that 's not likely , says friedrich , because asylum cases are considered individually .
friedrich explains , " if andre shepherd is granted asylum , than that decision will take the form of a letter , exactly one page , with a letterhead .
and it will say , ' in light of the document submitted , andre shepherd is granted asylum . '
that 's it - there is no explanation or rationalization .
so it 's not a political stance , unless you say , the recognition of the asylum application is in and of itself a political stance . "
the waiting game even if his application is granted , shepherd will likely face jail time if he ever attempts to return to the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a decision in shepherd 's case is expected by the end of the year fortunately , shepherd says he feels at home in the tiny town of prien-am-chiemsee . he 's married to a german woman , and works part-time installing solar paneling for her parent 's company .
he also attends daily language classes as part of an integration course .
in september , the berlin newspaper die tageszeitung awarded him its panther prize for his courage in deserting .
shepherd says he feels optimistic , and says he sees parallels between his own case and the lessons of the nuremburg trials .
says shepherd , " if your government is committing war crimes , and you 're taking part knowing that these are crimes , then there is no excuse .
even if you 're just a low ranking soldier , if you 're taking part , then you 're guilty too . "

but not for long .
as researcher philipp gunz explained to deutsche welle , the similarities evolved into differences during the first year of their lives , a finding which proves a cognitive gulf between humans and the extinct species .
" what is being established during that period , both in humans and neanderthals , is synaptic connection among brain cells , " gunz said .
" we know from the example of modern man that even subtle differences can have significant consequences on development , and can contribute to social and communication skills . "
and although gunz says there is little doubt that the neanderthals , which have been extinct for almost 30,000 years , had language and did communicate with each other , they would have seen the world differently to the way we do .
same , same , but not for long bildunterschrift : how alike were we really ?
baby homo neanderthalensis ' elongated braincases – also found in new-born humans – had more to do with the physical make-up of the mothers than anything else .
" the baby has to fit through the birth canal and the shape of both was very similar so that would impose a constraint . "
but once unbridled and free to grow at will , human braincases gradually begin to change form to become more globular .
it is this shape which gunz believes proves early brain development in man which is absent in neanderthals .
human uniqueness in earlier research the scientists discovered that right after birth human brains are quite unlike those of chimpanzees , but that they become more similar at a later stage of development .
this shows that the " globularization phase " sets humans apart from both chimps and neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : chimps and man : not so similar " we think modern humans , chimpanzees and neanderthals share one ancestral growth pattern that that goes back millions of years , " gunz continued .
" but in the first year of life , modern humans depart from this ancestral pattern . "
and contrary to past opinion , it is this first year , and not brain size , which is crucial to cognitive development .
the leipzig anthropologists say it is the internal organization of the brain that matters .
deeper understanding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's in an ancient tooth ?
the scientists hope their research will help them understand a little more about the function of the genes , only a very small number of which separate modern humans from their extinct counterparts .
" we assume that some of these genes are related to brain development , " gunz said .
" in living people these mutations are linked to autism or schizophrenia or down-syndrome . "
and while he is not suggesting that an autistic child is a throwback to tens of thousands of years ago , the leipzig anthropologist does venture a link .
" we know from teeth that neanderthals grew faster , so maybe some of the genes are related to the regulation of brain growth . "

" it was hard to think of anything more insulting than being compared to hitler by a german official . "

after months living undercover in picturesque chiemsee , he 's now trying to get political aslyum . tucked away on the border of germany and austria , lake chiemsee has long been popular with holiday-makers .
but now the idyllic alpine region has become the unlikely backdrop for the story of a man wandering into uncharted political territory . in 2007 , andre shepherd walked off the us army base where he was stationed in southern germany .
the apache helicopter mechanic said his experiences on duty in iraq convinced him he could no longer support the war .
" the iraqi people , when i met them , reacted towards us with anger , hostility and fear .
we did n't understand why , because in the us , you think ' oh , we 're the liberators , " ' shepherd told detusche welle .
" but what was going on with the kidnappings , the rapes , and abu ghraib - the population just wanted us out of there . "
unexpected turn shepherd had never planned to make a career of the military .
in his 20 's , his dream of studying computer science fell by the wayside after he could n't afford to keep paying tuition at kent state university in ohio .
for a while , he lived in his car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lake chiemsee is known for its sunsets and alpine beauty , not political drama " i ended up being homeless for about a year , and i joined the military because it was the only way to get a job out of cleveland , " said the ohio native .
after his first tour of duty in iraq , shepherd returned to the base in germany , where he started doing internet research on the iraq war .
gradually , he became convinced that the us-led invasion was a human rights violation .
that was the moment of truth , says shepherd . " i had to decide , ok , do i just go back to the war , knowing what i 'm doing is wrong , that it 's murder , or do i go against the world 's most powerful government and have a lot of problems , be ostracized from society ? "
it took him ten days to make up his mind .
in april 2007 , shepherd walked off the base .
a risky move germany is a main staging post for the us military , with around 60,000 us troops stationed there .
each year , some of those soldiers go awol -lrb- absent without official leave -rrb- .
many get picked up by the german police and sent back to their bases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shepherd refused to take part in a war he calls illegal shepherd avoided being caught .
he did n't contact his family , relying on local friends and the occasional odd job to survive .
after 19 months , he decided to turn himself in and apply for political asylum .
if his application is successful , shepherd will become the first us iraq war veteran to receive political asylum in germany , says rudi friedrich , head of the pacifist organization connection .
friedrich 's organization , which he runs out of his home in a suburb of frankfurt , offers support to conscientious objectors and war deserters and has been guiding shepherd through the asylum-seeking process .
" the recognition that one is not alone is an important experience for a deserter to regain his self-esteem , to be able to say , ' yes , i did make the right choice , i do n't want to shoot at my neighbor , " ' friedrich told deutsche welle .
shepherd 's asylum application cites a 2004 european union regulation that grants refugee status to any soldier who is in danger of being prosecuted if his or her military service " would include crimes or acts " which violate international law .
but some fear granting shepherd asylum could create an easy way out for americans stationed in germany who want to avoid combat duty in iraq .
that 's not likely , says friedrich , because asylum cases are considered individually .
friedrich explains , " if andre shepherd is granted asylum , than that decision will take the form of a letter , exactly one page , with a letterhead .
and it will say , ' in light of the document submitted , andre shepherd is granted asylum . '
that 's it - there is no explanation or rationalization .
so it 's not a political stance , unless you say , the recognition of the asylum application is in and of itself a political stance . "
the waiting game even if his application is granted , shepherd will likely face jail time if he ever attempts to return to the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a decision in shepherd 's case is expected by the end of the year fortunately , shepherd says he feels at home in the tiny town of prien-am-chiemsee . he 's married to a german woman , and works part-time installing solar paneling for her parent 's company .
he also attends daily language classes as part of an integration course .
in september , the berlin newspaper die tageszeitung awarded him its panther prize for his courage in deserting .
shepherd says he feels optimistic , and says he sees parallels between his own case and the lessons of the nuremburg trials .
says shepherd , " if your government is committing war crimes , and you 're taking part knowing that these are crimes , then there is no excuse .
even if you 're just a low ranking soldier , if you 're taking part , then you 're guilty too . "

" the negotiations with croatia are now in their final phase , " the european commission said in its annual report on the progress of would-be eu members .
the commission pointed to widespread corruption and organized crime problems in other western balkan applicant countries as the biggest hurdle to their joining the bloc in the short term , although it did announce that montenegro was ready for full candidate status , saying the country 's democracy " is largely in line with european principles and standards . "
montenegro 's application has already been recognized by the eu , and with the commission 's approval , member states will now debate whether to grant the country candidate status and begin the process of negotiating membership .
croatia , iceland , turkey and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia are the four candidates that have already reached this final phase of the accession process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks voted for constitutional changes meant to appease brussels in a september referendum turkey began its official negotiations five years ago , but the eu acknowledged in its report that the process has hit rather rocky ground .
" negotiations advanced , albeit rather slowly , " the commission said of accession talks with ankara .
several stumbling blocks despite praising constitutional reforms designed to fight corruption , wrest some political power away from the military , and improve the protection of human rights as " a step in the right direction , " the commission said that turkey was still lagging behind in areas like press freedom , freedom of expression and religion , the rights of women and trade unions , and the integration of the kurdish minority in the country .
" the pace of reform in turkey dictates the pace of the accession process , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle said in berlin , shortly after the report was released .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the division of cyprus has soured turkish relations with eu members greece and cyprus the european commission also called on turkey to open trade ties with cyprus and redouble diplomatic efforts with the country , describing the need for progress in this area as " urgent . "
eu member state cyprus and turkey are locked in a territorial dispute over the northern part of the island , which has been occupied by turkish forces since 1974 .
reunification talks have stalled , and turkey says it will not open trade ties with cyprus until the problem is resolved .
and while cyprus tries to slow turkey 's accession into the eu , turkey is using its membership of nato to hamper cyprus ' bid to join that alliance .
another problem facing turkey 's membership bid that did not get highlighted in the eu commission 's annual report is the sheer size of the country .
a 2009 census put turkey 's population at 72 million , which would make it the second most populous member of the bloc .
" that means turkey would be represented in the european parliament with a number of mps to reflect its size , and the size of its population would also mean a lot of weight in decisions in the council of ministers , " the head of the eu program at the german council on foreign relations , almut moeller , told deutsche welle .
moeller said that eu insiders often talk about the influence turkey would wield in the bloc , and the affect it would have on the larger countries and their power structure .
" this is a sensitively calibrated order that has been around for a while now , and in the past we have only seen smaller and medium-sized countries entering the bloc .
they have relatively little impact on the big players , but imagine what a country this size would mean for the old order , for the amount of power currently shared between france and germany in the eu , for instance . "
gul : ' strategic imperative ' to let turkey in five years ago , there was an outpouring of pro-european sentiment and euphoria in turkey when the country began the final phase of the eu accession process .
but the mood seems to be souring as other applicants make much smoother process towards membership in the bloc .
on monday , brussels announced plans to grant visa-free travel within the eu 's open-border schengen zone to people from albania and bosnia , and the turkish newspaper haber tuerk responded by proclaiming on tuesday 's front page : " everyone 's allowed into the eu , except us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president gul thinks the eu is short-sighted not to welcome turkey citizens from every balkan country except kosovo , which some eu members consider a part of serbia , are now free to travel within the eu 's open-border area , while turks have to seek special visas .
" the eu will not be weaker , but stronger both politically and economically with turkey 's membership , " turkish president abdullah gul said in a speech in london on monday .
" given the fact that the international balance of power tends to shift towards the east and asia , it is , indeed , a strategic imperative for the eu to have turkey as a member . "
gul , speaking to the chatham house think-tank after receiving the organization 's annual prize for statesmanship , said it was " sad to observe " that some european leaders did not recognize the role turkey could play within the eu .
" this short-sighted vision is the major impediment before the idea of the eu as a global actor , capable of assuming greater responsibilities on political and security issues , complementing its economic clout , " the turkish president said .
in his speech , gul also announced that neighboring iran had asked turkey to host another round of talks with un security council members and germany on tehran 's nuclear program , alluding to the diplomatic role his country might play for the eu .
however , turkey 's international activities were also singled out by the eu for veiled criticism on tuesday , after the country defied the us and eu to vote against tougher un sanctions for iran earlier this year .
" turkey 's foreign policy has become more active in its wider neighborhood , " the commission 's report said .
" this is an asset for the european union , provided it is developed as a complement to turkey 's accession process and in coordination with the eu . "

aila also served as a reminder that the ganges delta is one of asia 's climate hotspots , vulnerable to some of the worst manifestations of climate change .
here , the effects of global warming are well underway – while in europe and north america , they are still only the subject of conferences and media debates . unique threat the challenges faced by people living on the ganges delta include the threat of rising sea levels caused mostly by subsidence in the region and partly by climate change .
if this continues , the result will be mass displacement .
higher temperatures related to climate change could also bring about more severe flooding of the delta , because of increased melting of snow and glaciers in the himalayas .
bildunterschrift : only a fraction of those displaced by aila had access to food and drinking water according to the experts , if climate change continues unchecked , the consequences for india will be devastating .
according to us economist william cline from the peterson institute for international economics in washington , india 's crop yield could drop by two thirds by 2080 as a result of global warming .
the institute 's statistics show that india is more at threat than any other region on the planet .
it 's not as though india is one of the planet 's biggest polluters .
the climate footprint of the seventh largest country in the world is commensurate with the size of its population - which is over 1 billion .
its carbon emissions are considerably lower than those of the us and china .
this is due largely to the country 's widespread poverty .
but as the indian economy gathers pace , the fear is that environmental issues will be sidelined .
demand for energy is rising as the middle-class buys more cars , tvs and better housing .
much of that energy comes from coal oil and gas , the main sources for planet-warming carbon dioxide .
but the country 's politicians are aware of the need for a low-carbon growth path .
learning from others ' mistakes " we need to put electricity into people 's homes and do it cleanly , " said india 's environment minister jairam ramesh last year - stressing that rich and poor nations inevitably have different approaches to tackling climate change . " you in the west need to live with only one car rather than three .
for you it 's about luxury .
for us it is about survival . "
india is especially active in the field of renewable energies , explains martin kaiser , director of international climate policy at greenpeace germany .
" india was quick to recognize that renewables could become a major growth market within its own economy , and got in on the act very early , " he says .
" it was a good move , because when an emerging economy invests in these technologies and contributes to their widespread use , they appear significantly more credible than the leading industrialized nations , who might just be keen to make money from them .
they become role models for other developing nations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy is popular in many developing nations today , india ranks 5th in the world with a total wind power capacity of 10,925 mw , or 3 percent of all electricity produced in the country .
experts predict that by 2030 , wind power will be supplying 15 percent of india 's energy needs . india is at pains to avoid the mistakes made by the industrialized nations .
large companies are now legally bound to hire energy managers , whose primary task is to ensure energy-efficient production , and are responsible for implement energy-saving measures .
they also report on the companies ' carbon footprint to india 's licensing authorities .
even the poverty-stricken population living on the ganges delta contributes to the fight against climate change by using solar energy .
mini solar units provide enough energy for a couple of energy-saving lamps and a radio or tv , and 50 percent of the 4.5 million people who live in the sundarbans in the lower part of the delta own one , according to geetanjali solar enterprise , an indian manufacturer of solar products and equipment .
that 's a much higher percentage of the population than in the major european cities and the us .

according to us economist william cline from the peterson institute for international economics in washington , india 's crop yield could drop by two thirds by 2080 as a result of global warming .
the institute 's statistics show that india is more at threat than any other region on the planet .
it 's not as though india is one of the planet 's biggest polluters .
the climate footprint of the seventh largest country in the world is commensurate with the size of its population - which is over 1 billion .
its carbon emissions are considerably lower than those of the us and china .
this is due largely to the country 's widespread poverty .
but as the indian economy gathers pace , the fear is that environmental issues will be sidelined .
demand for energy is rising as the middle-class buys more cars , tvs and better housing .
much of that energy comes from coal oil and gas , the main sources for planet-warming carbon dioxide .
but the country 's politicians are aware of the need for a low-carbon growth path .
learning from others ' mistakes " we need to put electricity into people 's homes and do it cleanly , " said india 's environment minister jairam ramesh last year - stressing that rich and poor nations inevitably have different approaches to tackling climate change . " you in the west need to live with only one car rather than three .
for you it 's about luxury .
for us it is about survival . "
india is especially active in the field of renewable energies , explains martin kaiser , director of international climate policy at greenpeace germany .
" india was quick to recognize that renewables could become a major growth market within its own economy , and got in on the act very early , " he says .
" it was a good move , because when an emerging economy invests in these technologies and contributes to their widespread use , they appear significantly more credible than the leading industrialized nations , who might just be keen to make money from them .
they become role models for other developing nations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy is popular in many developing nations today , india ranks 5th in the world with a total wind power capacity of 10,925 mw , or 3 percent of all electricity produced in the country .
experts predict that by 2030 , wind power will be supplying 15 percent of india 's energy needs . india is at pains to avoid the mistakes made by the industrialized nations .
large companies are now legally bound to hire energy managers , whose primary task is to ensure energy-efficient production , and are responsible for implement energy-saving measures .
they also report on the companies ' carbon footprint to india 's licensing authorities .
even the poverty-stricken population living on the ganges delta contributes to the fight against climate change by using solar energy .
mini solar units provide enough energy for a couple of energy-saving lamps and a radio or tv , and 50 percent of the 4.5 million people who live in the sundarbans in the lower part of the delta own one , according to geetanjali solar enterprise , an indian manufacturer of solar products and equipment .
that 's a much higher percentage of the population than in the major european cities and the us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 09.11.2010 werder bremen have gone from heavyweights to sparring partners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conceding goals has been an all too regular occurence for werder this year for years , bremen have been a model of consistency , stability and harmony .
but with this season already a likely write-off , even hardcore fans are calling for some major changes on the river weser . if there was any small consolation for bremen after their 6-0 thrashing by stuttgart on sunday , it was that the scoreline could have been worse .
after all , goalkeeper tim wiese had saved a penalty in the 60th minute .
but wiese remained disconsolate .
" the way we played here was embarrassing , " the keeper told reporters after the match .
" i 'm ashamed of us , and every one else should be ashamed as well . "
it was werder 's second straight league loss after an unexpected home to defeat to nuremberg in round 10 .
coach thomas schaaf took refuge in gallows humor .
" we were a good sparring partner , " schaaf told the press .
" that 's an opponent you invite to your training camp , when you want to stay fit .
it was like in practice , and that 's not enough for a competitive match . "
werder are currently eleventh in the table , 15 points behind leaders dortmund .
the team has been in similar positions before , but rarely have things looked so black for the men in green .
in 2008-9 , bremen stumbled to tenth place in the bundesliga but salvaged their season by reaching the final of the europa league and winning the german cup .
this year , they are already out of the cup and adrift at the bottom of their champions league group .
werder have qualified for international competition every year since 2004 and have missed the champions league only once , making them germany 's second most successful team .
nonetheless , the problems they are currently encountering have been in the making for some time .
achilles ' heel bildunterschrift : silvestre is one of the main problems in a terrible defense werder have always conceded more goals than the other top german teams but have thrived because they also scored more .
that 's down to the style favored by schaaf , which features the defenders pushed relatively far upfield .
but after 11 matches this season , bremen have already conceded 27 goals .
by way of comparison , werder 's season average for the past six campaigns is 41.5 .
schaaf and company have sorely missed central defender naldo , who 's out indefinitely while recovering from an operation to combat necrosis of the knee .
neither sebastian proedl nor mikael silvestre has been an adequate replacement , and germany international per mertesacker has been unable to compensate .
werder 's goal production – 19 – is also down , which has something to do with the hole left behind by mesut oezil , who left this summer for real madrid .
aaron hunt , a converted striker , has not been able to fill the playmaker role , and new acquisition wesley has been forced to play in the back four .
as a relatively low-budget club by top european standards , bremen are used to losing star players .
schaaf and commercial manager klaus allofs have always shown a remarkable knack for finding replacements .
not this season , though , and that 's causing some major friction in the werder family .
fussing and feuding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaaf and allofs are no longer beyond criticism schaaf and allofs have been running things at werder since 1999 , a unique record of longevity in the hire- ‘ em-fire- ‘ em bundesliga , and harmony has been the rule in their eleven-year tenure .
but questionable personnel decisions and curious management reactions have created an atmosphere of conflict .
disappointed with the team 's early form , allofs took the strange step of freezing players ' wages earlier this season .
that created a climate of tension that may have emerged when striker marko arnautovic reportedly hurled an obscenity in allofs ' direction after being substituted out in bremen 's most recent champions league loss .
the serbian-austrian is known for his mercurial temperament , and many fans questioned the decision to acquire him this summer .
but that 's nothing compared to the outrage directed at the 33-year-old silvestre .
the frenchman was brought in despite coming off a horrible year with arsenal and is , according to the grades handed out by kicker magazine , by far and away the worst defender in the bundesliga .
he was roundly booed after the nuremberg match , an understandable reaction from disappointed ticket-holders .
but schaaf subsequently went on local radio accusing supporters of not being “ real fans . ”
and that has the werder faithful up in arms .
" werder bremen is suffering from the arrogance and vanity of schaaf and allofs , " wrote one enraged user on the fanszene-bremen internet forum .
" these gentlemen have lost touch after having so much success and being treated with kid gloves by the media .
criticism , including boos , is interpreted as an insult to their royal highnesses . "
a fellow supporter , writing on a different platform , concurred .
" here everyone blames a team that is playing badly , " the user opined on forum.werder.de.
" that 's one issue .
another one is that klaus allofs is n't capable of buying reasonable players and thomas schaaf has been unable to form them into a reasonable team . "
a couple of wins would probably be enough to silence the voices of dissent , and bremen get a chance to make amends on saturday when they host frankfurt – a team they 'd expect to beat most seasons .
but this season is anything but typical .
frankfurt are riding high in fourth place , while werder bremen are facing a potential relegation fight – and an ill-tempered debate about the future of the club .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 09.11.2010 on pogrom anniversary , rabbi carries torch from germany to england großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wittenberg is spending three weeks on the road - with a flashlight and his dog on the 72nd anniversary of a major nazi pogrom against the jews , a british rabbi is embarking on a symbolic journey , carrying a flame from his grandfather 's synagogue in frankfurt to his own in london . rabbi jonathan wittenberg has lit a symbolic torch from the " everlasting light " of the westend synagogue in frankfurt , which inexplicably survived the destruction of the nazis on november 9 , 1938 .
wittenberg 's grandfather was a rabbi there during the so-called kristallnacht , or night of broken glass .
all throughout germany and austria , jewish homes , business , and synagogues were ransacked and thousands of jews were deported to concentration camps .
now , accompanied by his dog mitzpah , he is carrying the torch by foot and by ferry .
in london , he will use it to symbolically light the eternal flame of a new synagogue for his own congregation .
the three-week project also serves as a fundraiser to support a variety of charities and interfaith projects .
deutsche welle spoke with the rabbi in cologne , at the midway point through his walk .
deutsche welle : rabbi wittenberg , can you tell me where the idea came from to take this walk , and what the journey is really all about ?
jonathan wittenberg : it was really when i was rereading my grandfather 's memoirs , at the 70th anniversary of kristallnacht .
i just wanted to remember what had happened to him .
and i read there how he was called by the gestapo on the 10th of november , on the allegation that he had the keys to the westend synagogue , which he did n't . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rabbi stopped at maria-laach abbey , in germany 's eifel region he wrote that he came to the main synagogue ; the fire brigade was there , and they were doing nothing .
he heard people in the crowd say -lsb- … -rsb- that the interior of the westend synagogue had been destroyed - wrecked and trashed - but that the eternal light -lsb- a constant flame that is lit in every synagogue ; eds . -rsb- was still burning .
and people took that for a miracle .
this spoke to me .
my own synagogue is building a new building .
we 've been working on it for 15 years and it 's nearing completion .
and i had the thought , because i am a lover of walking , of coming to frankfurt , of lighting a symbolic flame , and bringing it back to london to light our new eternal light . so you made ' light ' the subject of your walk ?
i was very struck by this idea , of light that burns despite darkness .
it 's an image that speaks to me in all kinds of ways as a rabbi .
i encounter a lot of darkness people struggle with .
i see the courage of people in facing illness , in facing death .
i also see the courage of people in a political context .
one of the organizations i am supporting on this walk is the parents ' circle , made up of parents who 've lost children on both sides of the israeli-palestinian conflict .
this group of parents , instead of blaming the others , instead of hating , they 're saying , ' well , this is a message that we need understanding . '
tell me about the ' eternal light ' that you are carrying .
how did you get it , and how are you transporting it ?
very simply , it 's an electric torch - a flashlight .
it 's symbolic .
i 'm not an olympic runner , and nobody 's going to let me into a cafe along the way with a great big torch on fire .
but what i did n't want to do was just to come by plane and take the torch and just fly back .
there 's no substance to something like that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the route traverses german wine country the trip began at the westend synagogue on october 24 .
i was there with a group of about 20 people from london who came to share the start of the journey .
the ceremony where i took the light was simple , just a couple of verses : " god is my light , and my salvation . "
one of the people with us was a hazzan -lsb- a singer trained to accompany jewish religious services ; eds . -rsb- who very beautifully sang those verses .
coincidentally , that day was the celebration of the 100-year anniversary of the westend synagogue .
i was invited to speak .
it was very , very moving .
my grandfather - my mother 's father - had been the main rabbi there for almost 30 years .
he died in 1975 .
what do you feel you 've learned about light along the way so far ?
my understanding of the meaning of light is constantly growing and constantly changing .
and just as light expands , so my understanding of it has expanded .
there is the beautiful natural light , while walking along the main and rhine rivers .
and then there is the tremendous amount of kindness i 've met in very ordinary circumstances .
on the second day , i was walking with a friend of mine who is a protestant minister .
i needed something to eat , and we went into a place - it turned out to be in a castle along the hiking trail , a very posh place .
i asked , ' can i have some bread please ? '
and the man came back with a basket of fruit and all kinds of bread .
i took out my purse to pay , and he said , ' no , please take it .
it 's a gift . '
i had n't told him what i was doing but it was obvious that i was somehow … en route .
i 've encountered that kind of kindness all along .
that is a kind of light .
you 're not just trekking on this trip - you 're visiting various religious sites , holding talks with social-interest groups , and visiting jewish monuments .
has that added to your understanding of light ?
yes .
there have been moments of contact with people who are engaged with what was the jewish past in germany .
we stopped in the town of bingen , at the study group for judaism there .
i asked the lady who leads it , ' why do you do this ? '
she was n't jewish , did n't have jewish ancestors .
none of them did .
she said she did it because her father had a close relationship to the jewish community and had been helped by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rabbi stopped at a thai buddhist center along the way have you found anything unexpected so far ?
well , walking in the lower rhineland up to cologne , i 've thought a lot about the shoah , obviously .
but i 've also been conscious that here was a thousand years of jewish creative history .
we were in a tiny village , st. goar .
and in that tiny rhineland village , the sefer ha-maharil , which is a key work in the progression of ashkenazy jewish law , was composed .
it still affects our practices today .
so , i had n't expected to feel such continuity with jewish culture as i have felt - this sense of jewish history , of learning , creativity , and study .
i expected to feel far more estranged .
your grandfather was german , and you speak excellent german although you yourself are english .
has this walk raised any thoughts about your own german ancestry ?
i 've been to germany many times before , but never for this long .
my grandfather loved the german jewish culture .
unlike many , he did n't teach us to hate germany .
he said we should differentiate between nazism and german culture .
i think there are a lot of questions to be asked about whether that differentiation could be made quite as neatly as that .
but that was certainly his attitude , so i have n't had to overcome an inner revulsion to being in germany - i never had it .
and i deeply do n't believe you can blame one generation for what another generation did .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the second fundraising walk wittenberg has taken with his dog , mitzpah but there is no doubt that there is a legacy .
and i think finding ways to face that legacy together as much as possible - you ca n't do it with major perpetrators - but with people who are struggling with what the past has meant to them , i think enabling that kind of conversation is very important .
was being on this trip during kristallnacht , the night of broken glass , part of your plan ?
on november 9 i 'll be in holland , since i 've been asked to speak there .
it would have made more sense to be in germany , but that 's where it worked out .
in any case i definitely wanted to be traveling the route on kristallnacht .
towards the end of the walk i pick up the route of the kindertransporte , -lsb- the name given to the movement to rescue some 10,000 jewish children from the nazis by sending them to live in the uk , just prior to the outbreak of world war ii ; eds . -rsb-
so that 's something i find deeply moving .
i 'm guessing you are something of a strange sight in the german countryside - a rabbi wearing a yarmulke and a backpack , with a dog in tow .
have you gotten some odd reactions ?
not at all - although people do keep stopping me to tell me that the flashlight in my backpack has been left on .
they do n't know i 've done it on purpose .

i 've encountered that kind of kindness all along .
that is a kind of light .
you 're not just trekking on this trip - you 're visiting various religious sites , holding talks with social-interest groups , and visiting jewish monuments .
has that added to your understanding of light ?
yes .
there have been moments of contact with people who are engaged with what was the jewish past in germany .
we stopped in the town of bingen , at the study group for judaism there .
i asked the lady who leads it , ' why do you do this ? '
she was n't jewish , did n't have jewish ancestors .
none of them did .
she said she did it because her father had a close relationship to the jewish community and had been helped by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rabbi stopped at a thai buddhist center along the way have you found anything unexpected so far ?
well , walking in the lower rhineland up to cologne , i 've thought a lot about the shoah , obviously .
but i 've also been conscious that here was a thousand years of jewish creative history .
we were in a tiny village , st. goar .
and in that tiny rhineland village , the sefer ha-maharil , which is a key work in the progression of ashkenazy jewish law , was composed .
it still affects our practices today .
so , i had n't expected to feel such continuity with jewish culture as i have felt - this sense of jewish history , of learning , creativity , and study .
i expected to feel far more estranged .
your grandfather was german , and you speak excellent german although you yourself are english .
has this walk raised any thoughts about your own german ancestry ?
i 've been to germany many times before , but never for this long .
my grandfather loved the german jewish culture .
unlike many , he did n't teach us to hate germany .
he said we should differentiate between nazism and german culture .
i think there are a lot of questions to be asked about whether that differentiation could be made quite as neatly as that .
but that was certainly his attitude , so i have n't had to overcome an inner revulsion to being in germany - i never had it .
and i deeply do n't believe you can blame one generation for what another generation did .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the second fundraising walk wittenberg has taken with his dog , mitzpah but there is no doubt that there is a legacy .
and i think finding ways to face that legacy together as much as possible - you ca n't do it with major perpetrators - but with people who are struggling with what the past has meant to them , i think enabling that kind of conversation is very important .
was being on this trip during kristallnacht , the night of broken glass , part of your plan ?
on november 9 i 'll be in holland , since i 've been asked to speak there .
it would have made more sense to be in germany , but that 's where it worked out .
in any case i definitely wanted to be traveling the route on kristallnacht .
towards the end of the walk i pick up the route of the kindertransporte , -lsb- the name given to the movement to rescue some 10,000 jewish children from the nazis by sending them to live in the uk , just prior to the outbreak of world war ii ; eds . -rsb-
so that 's something i find deeply moving .
i 'm guessing you are something of a strange sight in the german countryside - a rabbi wearing a yarmulke and a backpack , with a dog in tow .
have you gotten some odd reactions ?
not at all - although people do keep stopping me to tell me that the flashlight in my backpack has been left on .
they do n't know i 've done it on purpose .

in krakow , a museum and memorial recently opened in schindler 's former factory . an industrial complex in krakow is hardly the usual place to find hordes of tourists .
however in this part of the city , tourist buses line the streets - and it 's all because this is the location of oskar schindler 's factory .
the american film director steven spielberg made the factory famous in 1993 when he filmed parts of his oscar-winning film " schindler 's list " at the factory .
the story follows schindler as he tries to save his jewish workforce from nazi persecution and the concentration camps .
until recently , people had to peer through the locked gates to get a look at the factory .
but as of this summer , the building is now open to all visitors .
the krakow authorities have converted the factory into a museum , which is currently housing an exhibition called " krakow : occupation 1939-1945 , " examining life during nazi rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the success of spielberg 's film drew visitors to schindler 's krakow factory the exhibition shows the history of oskar schindler himself , and his workers .
curator monika bednarek said while schindler is the " main protagonist " of the exhibition , " he 's not the only one . "
the exhibition also charts the nazi occupation as a whole , and puts the fate of the jewish workers in schindler 's factory into context .
schindler 's place in history oskar schindler lived from 1908 to 1974 , and was the son of an industrialist .
in 1939 , after the occupation of poland by nazi germany , schindler acquired an enamel factory which had previously been in jewish hands .
the factory produced tin ware and later shells and detonators for the war effort .
schindler directly benefitted from the so-called ' ayranization ' of jewish factories and businesses , and as the war progressed he made a fortune on the black market .
despite his nazi membership , schindler became increasingly concerned about the cruel fate of his jewish workforce .
he added 1,200 workers to his famous list , labeling them ' essential ' to the war effort .
by doing so , he saved them from certain death at a nazi concentration camp .
after the war , schindler 's enamel factory became state-owned and was converted for use by a telecommunications company .
in 2002 it was abandoned , only to be bought by the city council three years later .
" the council decided to turn it into a museum , " said bednarek .
with the help of eu funding , the building was renovated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial is filled with original tin ware from schindler 's factory modern exhibits entice young visitors the exhibition begins in the krakow of the 1930s with a range of photos - such as women walking in the city and jews on the way to the synagogue .
" first of all we see the history before the war , so we can understand what happened during the war , " explained bendarek .
then the exhibits chart the outbreak of war , as german soldiers marched through poland on september 6 , 1939 .
there 's even a reconstruction of the jewish ghetto .
with the help of touch-screen displays , life-size murals and multimedia exhibits , the history of the period is brought to life .
the curators hope these types of techniques will help appeal to younger visitors .
" with this technology we can reach young people , " said grzegorz jezowski , who helped put together the exhibition .
" it makes it more attractive for them . "
a memorial to oskar schindler schindler himself only features quite briefly in the exhibition .
his story is told through photos , original documents and furniture from the factory .
in the middle of one room is a giant transparent cube , filled with tin pots , bowls and plates that were produced in schindler 's factory .
the instillation is meant to represent the history of the entrepreneur and his workers .
in the center hang the names of around 1,200 jewish workers whose lives were saved by schindler .

in krakow , a museum and memorial recently opened in schindler 's former factory . an industrial complex in krakow is hardly the usual place to find hordes of tourists .
however in this part of the city , tourist buses line the streets - and it 's all because this is the location of oskar schindler 's factory .
the american film director steven spielberg made the factory famous in 1993 when he filmed parts of his oscar-winning film " schindler 's list " at the factory .
the story follows schindler as he tries to save his jewish workforce from nazi persecution and the concentration camps .
until recently , people had to peer through the locked gates to get a look at the factory .
but as of this summer , the building is now open to all visitors .
the krakow authorities have converted the factory into a museum , which is currently housing an exhibition called " krakow : occupation 1939-1945 , " examining life during nazi rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the success of spielberg 's film drew visitors to schindler 's krakow factory the exhibition shows the history of oskar schindler himself , and his workers .
curator monika bednarek said while schindler is the " main protagonist " of the exhibition , " he 's not the only one . "
the exhibition also charts the nazi occupation as a whole , and puts the fate of the jewish workers in schindler 's factory into context .
schindler 's place in history oskar schindler lived from 1908 to 1974 , and was the son of an industrialist .
in 1939 , after the occupation of poland by nazi germany , schindler acquired an enamel factory which had previously been in jewish hands .
the factory produced tin ware and later shells and detonators for the war effort .
schindler directly benefitted from the so-called ' ayranization ' of jewish factories and businesses , and as the war progressed he made a fortune on the black market .
despite his nazi membership , schindler became increasingly concerned about the cruel fate of his jewish workforce .
he added 1,200 workers to his famous list , labeling them ' essential ' to the war effort .
by doing so , he saved them from certain death at a nazi concentration camp .
after the war , schindler 's enamel factory became state-owned and was converted for use by a telecommunications company .
in 2002 it was abandoned , only to be bought by the city council three years later .
" the council decided to turn it into a museum , " said bednarek .
with the help of eu funding , the building was renovated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial is filled with original tin ware from schindler 's factory modern exhibits entice young visitors the exhibition begins in the krakow of the 1930s with a range of photos - such as women walking in the city and jews on the way to the synagogue .
" first of all we see the history before the war , so we can understand what happened during the war , " explained bendarek .
then the exhibits chart the outbreak of war , as german soldiers marched through poland on september 6 , 1939 .
there 's even a reconstruction of the jewish ghetto .
with the help of touch-screen displays , life-size murals and multimedia exhibits , the history of the period is brought to life .
the curators hope these types of techniques will help appeal to younger visitors .
" with this technology we can reach young people , " said grzegorz jezowski , who helped put together the exhibition .
" it makes it more attractive for them . "
a memorial to oskar schindler schindler himself only features quite briefly in the exhibition .
his story is told through photos , original documents and furniture from the factory .
in the middle of one room is a giant transparent cube , filled with tin pots , bowls and plates that were produced in schindler 's factory .
the instillation is meant to represent the history of the entrepreneur and his workers .
in the center hang the names of around 1,200 jewish workers whose lives were saved by schindler .

but with this season already a likely write-off , even hardcore fans are calling for some major changes on the river weser . if there was any small consolation for bremen after their 6-0 thrashing by stuttgart on sunday , it was that the scoreline could have been worse .
after all , goalkeeper tim wiese had saved a penalty in the 60th minute .
but wiese remained disconsolate .
" the way we played here was embarrassing , " the keeper told reporters after the match .
" i 'm ashamed of us , and every one else should be ashamed as well . "
it was werder 's second straight league loss after an unexpected home to defeat to nuremberg in round 10 .
coach thomas schaaf took refuge in gallows humor .
" we were a good sparring partner , " schaaf told the press .
" that 's an opponent you invite to your training camp , when you want to stay fit .
it was like in practice , and that 's not enough for a competitive match . "
werder are currently eleventh in the table , 15 points behind leaders dortmund .
the team has been in similar positions before , but rarely have things looked so black for the men in green .
in 2008-9 , bremen stumbled to tenth place in the bundesliga but salvaged their season by reaching the final of the europa league and winning the german cup .
this year , they are already out of the cup and adrift at the bottom of their champions league group .
werder have qualified for international competition every year since 2004 and have missed the champions league only once , making them germany 's second most successful team .
nonetheless , the problems they are currently encountering have been in the making for some time .
achilles ' heel bildunterschrift : silvestre is one of the main problems in a terrible defense werder have always conceded more goals than the other top german teams but have thrived because they also scored more .
that 's down to the style favored by schaaf , which features the defenders pushed relatively far upfield .
but after 11 matches this season , bremen have already conceded 27 goals .
by way of comparison , werder 's season average for the past six campaigns is 41.5 .
schaaf and company have sorely missed central defender naldo , who 's out indefinitely while recovering from an operation to combat necrosis of the knee .
neither sebastian proedl nor mikael silvestre has been an adequate replacement , and germany international per mertesacker has been unable to compensate .
werder 's goal production – 19 – is also down , which has something to do with the hole left behind by mesut oezil , who left this summer for real madrid .
aaron hunt , a converted striker , has not been able to fill the playmaker role , and new acquisition wesley has been forced to play in the back four .
as a relatively low-budget club by top european standards , bremen are used to losing star players .
schaaf and commercial manager klaus allofs have always shown a remarkable knack for finding replacements .
not this season , though , and that 's causing some major friction in the werder family .
fussing and feuding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaaf and allofs are no longer beyond criticism schaaf and allofs have been running things at werder since 1999 , a unique record of longevity in the hire- ‘ em-fire- ‘ em bundesliga , and harmony has been the rule in their eleven-year tenure .
but questionable personnel decisions and curious management reactions have created an atmosphere of conflict .
disappointed with the team 's early form , allofs took the strange step of freezing players ' wages earlier this season .
that created a climate of tension that may have emerged when striker marko arnautovic reportedly hurled an obscenity in allofs ' direction after being substituted out in bremen 's most recent champions league loss .
the serbian-austrian is known for his mercurial temperament , and many fans questioned the decision to acquire him this summer .
but that 's nothing compared to the outrage directed at the 33-year-old silvestre .
the frenchman was brought in despite coming off a horrible year with arsenal and is , according to the grades handed out by kicker magazine , by far and away the worst defender in the bundesliga .
he was roundly booed after the nuremberg match , an understandable reaction from disappointed ticket-holders .
but schaaf subsequently went on local radio accusing supporters of not being “ real fans . ”
and that has the werder faithful up in arms .
" werder bremen is suffering from the arrogance and vanity of schaaf and allofs , " wrote one enraged user on the fanszene-bremen internet forum .
" these gentlemen have lost touch after having so much success and being treated with kid gloves by the media .
criticism , including boos , is interpreted as an insult to their royal highnesses . "
a fellow supporter , writing on a different platform , concurred .
" here everyone blames a team that is playing badly , " the user opined on forum.werder.de.
" that 's one issue .
another one is that klaus allofs is n't capable of buying reasonable players and thomas schaaf has been unable to form them into a reasonable team . "
a couple of wins would probably be enough to silence the voices of dissent , and bremen get a chance to make amends on saturday when they host frankfurt – a team they 'd expect to beat most seasons .
but this season is anything but typical .
frankfurt are riding high in fourth place , while werder bremen are facing a potential relegation fight – and an ill-tempered debate about the future of the club .

the downside is the impact this has on the environment .
but the country is taking meausres on climate protection - even more than some industrialized nations . in may 2009 , cyclone aila swept through the ganges delta .
tidal waves flooded a number of islands , devastating homes and farmland and claiming 300 lives .
200,000 people became climate refugees , and were forced to abandon their homes .
tropical cyclones are not uncommon in the world 's largest delta .
but to many , aila served a grim reminder of climate change , with greenpeace maintaining the destruction caused was in consonance with the predictions made by scientists , who had warned that storms would become more frequent and more damaging due to climate change .
aila also served as a reminder that the ganges delta is one of asia 's climate hotspots , vulnerable to some of the worst manifestations of climate change .
here , the effects of global warming are well underway – while in europe and north america , they are still only the subject of conferences and media debates . unique threat the challenges faced by people living on the ganges delta include the threat of rising sea levels caused mostly by subsidence in the region and partly by climate change .
if this continues , the result will be mass displacement .
higher temperatures related to climate change could also bring about more severe flooding of the delta , because of increased melting of snow and glaciers in the himalayas .
bildunterschrift : only a fraction of those displaced by aila had access to food and drinking water according to the experts , if climate change continues unchecked , the consequences for india will be devastating .
according to us economist william cline from the peterson institute for international economics in washington , india 's crop yield could drop by two thirds by 2080 as a result of global warming .
the institute 's statistics show that india is more at threat than any other region on the planet .
it 's not as though india is one of the planet 's biggest polluters .
the climate footprint of the seventh largest country in the world is commensurate with the size of its population - which is over 1 billion .
its carbon emissions are considerably lower than those of the us and china .
this is due largely to the country 's widespread poverty .
but as the indian economy gathers pace , the fear is that environmental issues will be sidelined .
demand for energy is rising as the middle-class buys more cars , tvs and better housing .
much of that energy comes from coal oil and gas , the main sources for planet-warming carbon dioxide .
but the country 's politicians are aware of the need for a low-carbon growth path .
learning from others ' mistakes " we need to put electricity into people 's homes and do it cleanly , " said india 's environment minister jairam ramesh last year - stressing that rich and poor nations inevitably have different approaches to tackling climate change . " you in the west need to live with only one car rather than three .
for you it 's about luxury .
for us it is about survival . "
india is especially active in the field of renewable energies , explains martin kaiser , director of international climate policy at greenpeace germany .
" india was quick to recognize that renewables could become a major growth market within its own economy , and got in on the act very early , " he says .
" it was a good move , because when an emerging economy invests in these technologies and contributes to their widespread use , they appear significantly more credible than the leading industrialized nations , who might just be keen to make money from them .
they become role models for other developing nations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy is popular in many developing nations today , india ranks 5th in the world with a total wind power capacity of 10,925 mw , or 3 percent of all electricity produced in the country .
experts predict that by 2030 , wind power will be supplying 15 percent of india 's energy needs . india is at pains to avoid the mistakes made by the industrialized nations .
large companies are now legally bound to hire energy managers , whose primary task is to ensure energy-efficient production , and are responsible for implement energy-saving measures .
they also report on the companies ' carbon footprint to india 's licensing authorities .
even the poverty-stricken population living on the ganges delta contributes to the fight against climate change by using solar energy .
mini solar units provide enough energy for a couple of energy-saving lamps and a radio or tv , and 50 percent of the 4.5 million people who live in the sundarbans in the lower part of the delta own one , according to geetanjali solar enterprise , an indian manufacturer of solar products and equipment .
that 's a much higher percentage of the population than in the major european cities and the us .

in krakow , a museum and memorial recently opened in schindler 's former factory . an industrial complex in krakow is hardly the usual place to find hordes of tourists .
however in this part of the city , tourist buses line the streets - and it 's all because this is the location of oskar schindler 's factory .
the american film director steven spielberg made the factory famous in 1993 when he filmed parts of his oscar-winning film " schindler 's list " at the factory .
the story follows schindler as he tries to save his jewish workforce from nazi persecution and the concentration camps .
until recently , people had to peer through the locked gates to get a look at the factory .
but as of this summer , the building is now open to all visitors .
the krakow authorities have converted the factory into a museum , which is currently housing an exhibition called " krakow : occupation 1939-1945 , " examining life during nazi rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the success of spielberg 's film drew visitors to schindler 's krakow factory the exhibition shows the history of oskar schindler himself , and his workers .
curator monika bednarek said while schindler is the " main protagonist " of the exhibition , " he 's not the only one . "
the exhibition also charts the nazi occupation as a whole , and puts the fate of the jewish workers in schindler 's factory into context .
schindler 's place in history oskar schindler lived from 1908 to 1974 , and was the son of an industrialist .
in 1939 , after the occupation of poland by nazi germany , schindler acquired an enamel factory which had previously been in jewish hands .
the factory produced tin ware and later shells and detonators for the war effort .
schindler directly benefitted from the so-called ' ayranization ' of jewish factories and businesses , and as the war progressed he made a fortune on the black market .
despite his nazi membership , schindler became increasingly concerned about the cruel fate of his jewish workforce .
he added 1,200 workers to his famous list , labeling them ' essential ' to the war effort .
by doing so , he saved them from certain death at a nazi concentration camp .
after the war , schindler 's enamel factory became state-owned and was converted for use by a telecommunications company .
in 2002 it was abandoned , only to be bought by the city council three years later .
" the council decided to turn it into a museum , " said bednarek .
with the help of eu funding , the building was renovated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial is filled with original tin ware from schindler 's factory modern exhibits entice young visitors the exhibition begins in the krakow of the 1930s with a range of photos - such as women walking in the city and jews on the way to the synagogue .
" first of all we see the history before the war , so we can understand what happened during the war , " explained bendarek .
then the exhibits chart the outbreak of war , as german soldiers marched through poland on september 6 , 1939 .
there 's even a reconstruction of the jewish ghetto .
with the help of touch-screen displays , life-size murals and multimedia exhibits , the history of the period is brought to life .
the curators hope these types of techniques will help appeal to younger visitors .
" with this technology we can reach young people , " said grzegorz jezowski , who helped put together the exhibition .
" it makes it more attractive for them . "
a memorial to oskar schindler schindler himself only features quite briefly in the exhibition .
his story is told through photos , original documents and furniture from the factory .
in the middle of one room is a giant transparent cube , filled with tin pots , bowls and plates that were produced in schindler 's factory .
the instillation is meant to represent the history of the entrepreneur and his workers .
in the center hang the names of around 1,200 jewish workers whose lives were saved by schindler .

wittenberg 's grandfather was a rabbi there during the so-called kristallnacht , or night of broken glass .
all throughout germany and austria , jewish homes , business , and synagogues were ransacked and thousands of jews were deported to concentration camps .
now , accompanied by his dog mitzpah , he is carrying the torch by foot and by ferry .
in london , he will use it to symbolically light the eternal flame of a new synagogue for his own congregation .
the three-week project also serves as a fundraiser to support a variety of charities and interfaith projects .
deutsche welle spoke with the rabbi in cologne , at the midway point through his walk .
deutsche welle : rabbi wittenberg , can you tell me where the idea came from to take this walk , and what the journey is really all about ?
jonathan wittenberg : it was really when i was rereading my grandfather 's memoirs , at the 70th anniversary of kristallnacht .
i just wanted to remember what had happened to him .
and i read there how he was called by the gestapo on the 10th of november , on the allegation that he had the keys to the westend synagogue , which he did n't . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rabbi stopped at maria-laach abbey , in germany 's eifel region he wrote that he came to the main synagogue ; the fire brigade was there , and they were doing nothing .
he heard people in the crowd say -lsb- … -rsb- that the interior of the westend synagogue had been destroyed - wrecked and trashed - but that the eternal light -lsb- a constant flame that is lit in every synagogue ; eds . -rsb- was still burning .
and people took that for a miracle .
this spoke to me .
my own synagogue is building a new building .
we 've been working on it for 15 years and it 's nearing completion .
and i had the thought , because i am a lover of walking , of coming to frankfurt , of lighting a symbolic flame , and bringing it back to london to light our new eternal light . so you made ' light ' the subject of your walk ?
i was very struck by this idea , of light that burns despite darkness .
it 's an image that speaks to me in all kinds of ways as a rabbi .
i encounter a lot of darkness people struggle with .
i see the courage of people in facing illness , in facing death .
i also see the courage of people in a political context .
one of the organizations i am supporting on this walk is the parents ' circle , made up of parents who 've lost children on both sides of the israeli-palestinian conflict .
this group of parents , instead of blaming the others , instead of hating , they 're saying , ' well , this is a message that we need understanding . '
tell me about the ' eternal light ' that you are carrying .
how did you get it , and how are you transporting it ?
very simply , it 's an electric torch - a flashlight .
it 's symbolic .
i 'm not an olympic runner , and nobody 's going to let me into a cafe along the way with a great big torch on fire .
but what i did n't want to do was just to come by plane and take the torch and just fly back .
there 's no substance to something like that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the route traverses german wine country the trip began at the westend synagogue on october 24 .
i was there with a group of about 20 people from london who came to share the start of the journey .
the ceremony where i took the light was simple , just a couple of verses : " god is my light , and my salvation . "
one of the people with us was a hazzan -lsb- a singer trained to accompany jewish religious services ; eds . -rsb- who very beautifully sang those verses .
coincidentally , that day was the celebration of the 100-year anniversary of the westend synagogue .
i was invited to speak .
it was very , very moving .
my grandfather - my mother 's father - had been the main rabbi there for almost 30 years .
he died in 1975 .
what do you feel you 've learned about light along the way so far ?
my understanding of the meaning of light is constantly growing and constantly changing .
and just as light expands , so my understanding of it has expanded .
there is the beautiful natural light , while walking along the main and rhine rivers .
and then there is the tremendous amount of kindness i 've met in very ordinary circumstances .
on the second day , i was walking with a friend of mine who is a protestant minister .
i needed something to eat , and we went into a place - it turned out to be in a castle along the hiking trail , a very posh place .
i asked , ' can i have some bread please ? '
and the man came back with a basket of fruit and all kinds of bread .
i took out my purse to pay , and he said , ' no , please take it .
it 's a gift . '
i had n't told him what i was doing but it was obvious that i was somehow … en route .
i 've encountered that kind of kindness all along .
that is a kind of light .
you 're not just trekking on this trip - you 're visiting various religious sites , holding talks with social-interest groups , and visiting jewish monuments .
has that added to your understanding of light ?
yes .
there have been moments of contact with people who are engaged with what was the jewish past in germany .
we stopped in the town of bingen , at the study group for judaism there .
i asked the lady who leads it , ' why do you do this ? '
she was n't jewish , did n't have jewish ancestors .
none of them did .
she said she did it because her father had a close relationship to the jewish community and had been helped by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rabbi stopped at a thai buddhist center along the way have you found anything unexpected so far ?
well , walking in the lower rhineland up to cologne , i 've thought a lot about the shoah , obviously .
but i 've also been conscious that here was a thousand years of jewish creative history .
we were in a tiny village , st. goar .
and in that tiny rhineland village , the sefer ha-maharil , which is a key work in the progression of ashkenazy jewish law , was composed .
it still affects our practices today .
so , i had n't expected to feel such continuity with jewish culture as i have felt - this sense of jewish history , of learning , creativity , and study .
i expected to feel far more estranged .
your grandfather was german , and you speak excellent german although you yourself are english .
has this walk raised any thoughts about your own german ancestry ?
i 've been to germany many times before , but never for this long .
my grandfather loved the german jewish culture .
unlike many , he did n't teach us to hate germany .
he said we should differentiate between nazism and german culture .
i think there are a lot of questions to be asked about whether that differentiation could be made quite as neatly as that .
but that was certainly his attitude , so i have n't had to overcome an inner revulsion to being in germany - i never had it .
and i deeply do n't believe you can blame one generation for what another generation did .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the second fundraising walk wittenberg has taken with his dog , mitzpah but there is no doubt that there is a legacy .
and i think finding ways to face that legacy together as much as possible - you ca n't do it with major perpetrators - but with people who are struggling with what the past has meant to them , i think enabling that kind of conversation is very important .
was being on this trip during kristallnacht , the night of broken glass , part of your plan ?
on november 9 i 'll be in holland , since i 've been asked to speak there .
it would have made more sense to be in germany , but that 's where it worked out .
in any case i definitely wanted to be traveling the route on kristallnacht .
towards the end of the walk i pick up the route of the kindertransporte , -lsb- the name given to the movement to rescue some 10,000 jewish children from the nazis by sending them to live in the uk , just prior to the outbreak of world war ii ; eds . -rsb-
so that 's something i find deeply moving .
i 'm guessing you are something of a strange sight in the german countryside - a rabbi wearing a yarmulke and a backpack , with a dog in tow .
have you gotten some odd reactions ?
not at all - although people do keep stopping me to tell me that the flashlight in my backpack has been left on .
they do n't know i 've done it on purpose .

wittenberg 's grandfather was a rabbi there during the so-called kristallnacht , or night of broken glass .
all throughout germany and austria , jewish homes , business , and synagogues were ransacked and thousands of jews were deported to concentration camps .
now , accompanied by his dog mitzpah , he is carrying the torch by foot and by ferry .
in london , he will use it to symbolically light the eternal flame of a new synagogue for his own congregation .
the three-week project also serves as a fundraiser to support a variety of charities and interfaith projects .
deutsche welle spoke with the rabbi in cologne , at the midway point through his walk .
deutsche welle : rabbi wittenberg , can you tell me where the idea came from to take this walk , and what the journey is really all about ?
jonathan wittenberg : it was really when i was rereading my grandfather 's memoirs , at the 70th anniversary of kristallnacht .
i just wanted to remember what had happened to him .
and i read there how he was called by the gestapo on the 10th of november , on the allegation that he had the keys to the westend synagogue , which he did n't . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rabbi stopped at maria-laach abbey , in germany 's eifel region he wrote that he came to the main synagogue ; the fire brigade was there , and they were doing nothing .
he heard people in the crowd say -lsb- … -rsb- that the interior of the westend synagogue had been destroyed - wrecked and trashed - but that the eternal light -lsb- a constant flame that is lit in every synagogue ; eds . -rsb- was still burning .
and people took that for a miracle .
this spoke to me .
my own synagogue is building a new building .
we 've been working on it for 15 years and it 's nearing completion .
and i had the thought , because i am a lover of walking , of coming to frankfurt , of lighting a symbolic flame , and bringing it back to london to light our new eternal light . so you made ' light ' the subject of your walk ?
i was very struck by this idea , of light that burns despite darkness .
it 's an image that speaks to me in all kinds of ways as a rabbi .
i encounter a lot of darkness people struggle with .
i see the courage of people in facing illness , in facing death .
i also see the courage of people in a political context .
one of the organizations i am supporting on this walk is the parents ' circle , made up of parents who 've lost children on both sides of the israeli-palestinian conflict .
this group of parents , instead of blaming the others , instead of hating , they 're saying , ' well , this is a message that we need understanding . '
tell me about the ' eternal light ' that you are carrying .
how did you get it , and how are you transporting it ?
very simply , it 's an electric torch - a flashlight .
it 's symbolic .
i 'm not an olympic runner , and nobody 's going to let me into a cafe along the way with a great big torch on fire .
but what i did n't want to do was just to come by plane and take the torch and just fly back .
there 's no substance to something like that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the route traverses german wine country the trip began at the westend synagogue on october 24 .
i was there with a group of about 20 people from london who came to share the start of the journey .
the ceremony where i took the light was simple , just a couple of verses : " god is my light , and my salvation . "
one of the people with us was a hazzan -lsb- a singer trained to accompany jewish religious services ; eds . -rsb- who very beautifully sang those verses .
coincidentally , that day was the celebration of the 100-year anniversary of the westend synagogue .
i was invited to speak .
it was very , very moving .
my grandfather - my mother 's father - had been the main rabbi there for almost 30 years .
he died in 1975 .
what do you feel you 've learned about light along the way so far ?
my understanding of the meaning of light is constantly growing and constantly changing .
and just as light expands , so my understanding of it has expanded .
there is the beautiful natural light , while walking along the main and rhine rivers .
and then there is the tremendous amount of kindness i 've met in very ordinary circumstances .
on the second day , i was walking with a friend of mine who is a protestant minister .
i needed something to eat , and we went into a place - it turned out to be in a castle along the hiking trail , a very posh place .
i asked , ' can i have some bread please ? '
and the man came back with a basket of fruit and all kinds of bread .
i took out my purse to pay , and he said , ' no , please take it .
it 's a gift . '
i had n't told him what i was doing but it was obvious that i was somehow … en route .

yet despite booming export rates , the country 's economic growth appears to be headed for a setback . german exports have reached their highest level in more than two years .
according to figures released by the federal statistics office on monday , sales abroad rose by three percent to 84.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 117.4 billion -rrb- .
" the exports sector remains the driving force behind the country 's economic recovery , " said anton boerner , president of the federation of german wholesale , foreign trade and services .
powered by demand from emerging economies like china , the increase in exports was twice the expected 1.5 percent rise predicted by analysts .
industrial output drops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boerner says exports remain the driving force behind germany 's economic recovery but the new data came as industrial output slumped , with both industrial production and factory orders falling short of expectations .
instead of a predicted 0.5 percent increase , industrial output in october dropped by 0.8 percent compared to the previous month .
despite releasing disappointing figures , the economics ministry in berlin insisted that germany 's economic recovery was not in danger .
berlin insists overall trend is positive " industrial production is still trending upwards .
in the third quarter , output could again rise above the level of the second quarter , when we saw strong growth , " the ministry said in a statement . in september , berlin had raised its 2010 growth forecast to 3.4 percent , following a crippling contraction of 4.7 percent in 2009 .
at the same time , unemployment dropped to 7.5 percent in the seasonally adjusted term .
the number of total unemployed dropped to below 3 million for the first time in two decades .

after nearly two days of blocking a nuclear waste storage site , thousands of protestors have been cleared from the area by police and the transport of 11 containers of nuclear waste has arrived at its destination . police cleared thousands of anti-nuclear activists from roads leading to the nuclear storage facility in gorleben , northern germany on tuesday morning , allowing for the final arrival of 123 tons of nuclear waste .
about 3,000 demonstrators staged a 44-hour sit-in in front of the storage site , including high-level politicians such as green party co-chair claudia roth .
activists from the environmentalist organization greenpeace used a truck disguised as a vehicle carrying beer to block the freight train station in nearby dannenberg , where the waste containers were to be moved to trucks for the final 20 kilometers to the storage site .
two greenpeace activists delayed the transport by about 11 hours by encasing themselves in a cement block , making it so the police could not move them without injuring them .
authorities managed to free the activists early tuesday morning , and the first truck carrying the nuclear waste departed dannenberg at around 8:30 a.m.
the last of the trucks arrived at the storage facility at about 9:50 a.m.
bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists held up the trucks carrying the waste for 11 hours stop-and-go traffic large protests have taken place during past nuclear waste transport operations , but none have delayed the shipment of the waste as much as the most recent .
the waste originated from nuclear reactors in germany and was sent to a plant in northern france for reprocessing .
the waste containers , called " castors " -lrb- cask for storage and transport of radioactive material -rrb- , left france by train on friday afternoon , but were quickly stopped by the first blockade of activists on the train tracks .
the following days were a tedious stop-and-go game , as protestors blocked the train tracks and some of the 16,000 police officers mobilized to secure the transport removed them .
protests to continue leaders of the various " citizens ' initiatives " against nuclear power claimed victory on tuesday , despite the successful transport of the nuclear waste , and some vowed to continue protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors succeeded in delaying the transport on historic levels " we 've shown that we 're a force to be reckoned with , " said kerstin rudek , chairwoman of the citizens ' initiative for environmental protection luechow-dannenberg .
matthias miersch , environment spokesman for the opposition social democrats in parliament , said the movement against the nuclear waste transport was a " very impressive demonstration . "
" this was a very clear signal to the government that this atomic energy policy can not go on , " he told phoenix public television .
" politicians have to understand that decisions are being made now that the people are absolutely unable to relate to . "
transport to russia meanwhile munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that germany had negotiated a deal " ready to be signed " to ship nuclear waste originating from an old atomic research facility in former east germany to russia .
the report said a total of 951 nuclear fuel elements from the east german research center dresden-rossendorf , which have been in temporary storage since 2005 , would be shipped to the mayak atomic complex in the southern urals for reprocessing .
the waste would stay in russia for permanent storage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mayak facility in russia is to reprocess east germany 's radioactive waste the report said the basis for the transport deal was a previous agreement between the united states and russia , which regulates the transport of nuclear waste from reactors that were overseen by the soviet union .
germany 's goal was reportedly to " reduce the amount of highly-enriched uranium as much as possible . "
the deal received criticism from the green party , which has profited politically from a strong anti-nuclear sentiment in germany .
" cheap before safe , that 's what this is about , " green party spokeswoman sylvia kotting-uhl told the newspaper .

after months of digging , their probe suggests governments and regulators have willingly turned a blind eye to the problem . it is no secret that the past decade has seen sushi gain popularity in the western world , but the methods for feeding this appetite have been kept fairly well hidden .

in a report detailing the findings of its seven-month long probe into the business of bluefin tuna fishing , the international consortium of investigative journalists -lrb- icij -rrb- has unveiled a culture of over-exploitation , tacitly approved by government authorities .
the report details systematic over-fishing , falsely reported catch volumes , ignored bans of spotter planes to track down schools of tuna and illegal sales of national quotas from one vessel to another .
all told , the investigation paints a bleak picture in which thousands of tons of fish were illegally hauled between 1998 and 2007 - as many as one in every three bluefin tuna may have been caught illegally during this period .
the report also unveils a complex network of fishing fleets , farms , ministries and distributors from countries such as france , spain , italy , turkey and japan involved in the creation of a flourishing black market trade .
the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- said the inquiry had confirmed its repeated warnings of widespread illegalities .
" no consumer , no business , no government can be sure they are dealing with responsibly caught and traded bluefin tuna , " sergi tudela , head of fisheries at wwf mediterranean said in a statement .
" the whole chain is tarnished . "

as marine biologist , daniel pauly told the icij , the promise of a slice of such wealth is too enticing for many to resist .
" fisheries are one of the most criminalized sectors in the world , " pauly said .
" this generates so much money that it 's like drugs . "
the report said the black market trade in tuna was worth at least $ 4 billion -lrb- 2.9 billion euros -rrb- between 1998 and 2007 .
while mostly taking aim at suppliers and the governments that turned a blind eye to their exporters ' behaviour , the report also reveals how japanese dealers evaded tuna quotas by importing tuna as another species of fish , only to re-label them as tuna at market . as the demand for the fish has grown , the industry has evolved in an increasingly detrimental way .

" if we want to continue being able to fish bluefin tuna at all , we need to backtrack 20 years , " gemma parkes , a spokeswoman for wwf mediterranean , told deutsche welle .

the fishermen involved in the case were charged , and the regulatory body responded by introducing a new system , known as the bluefin tuna catch document -lrb- bcd -rrb- , to help monitor catch sizes .

after nearly two days of blocking a nuclear waste storage site , thousands of protestors have been cleared from the area by police and the transport of 11 containers of nuclear waste has arrived at its destination . police cleared thousands of anti-nuclear activists from roads leading to the nuclear storage facility in gorleben , northern germany on tuesday morning , allowing for the final arrival of 123 tons of nuclear waste .
about 3,000 demonstrators staged a 44-hour sit-in in front of the storage site , including high-level politicians such as green party co-chair claudia roth .
activists from the environmentalist organization greenpeace used a truck disguised as a vehicle carrying beer to block the freight train station in nearby dannenberg , where the waste containers were to be moved to trucks for the final 20 kilometers to the storage site .
two greenpeace activists delayed the transport by about 11 hours by encasing themselves in a cement block , making it so the police could not move them without injuring them .
authorities managed to free the activists early tuesday morning , and the first truck carrying the nuclear waste departed dannenberg at around 8:30 a.m.
the last of the trucks arrived at the storage facility at about 9:50 a.m.
bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists held up the trucks carrying the waste for 11 hours stop-and-go traffic large protests have taken place during past nuclear waste transport operations , but none have delayed the shipment of the waste as much as the most recent .
the waste originated from nuclear reactors in germany and was sent to a plant in northern france for reprocessing .
the waste containers , called " castors " -lrb- cask for storage and transport of radioactive material -rrb- , left france by train on friday afternoon , but were quickly stopped by the first blockade of activists on the train tracks .
the following days were a tedious stop-and-go game , as protestors blocked the train tracks and some of the 16,000 police officers mobilized to secure the transport removed them .
protests to continue leaders of the various " citizens ' initiatives " against nuclear power claimed victory on tuesday , despite the successful transport of the nuclear waste , and some vowed to continue protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors succeeded in delaying the transport on historic levels " we 've shown that we 're a force to be reckoned with , " said kerstin rudek , chairwoman of the citizens ' initiative for environmental protection luechow-dannenberg .
matthias miersch , environment spokesman for the opposition social democrats in parliament , said the movement against the nuclear waste transport was a " very impressive demonstration . "
" this was a very clear signal to the government that this atomic energy policy can not go on , " he told phoenix public television .
" politicians have to understand that decisions are being made now that the people are absolutely unable to relate to . "
transport to russia meanwhile munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that germany had negotiated a deal " ready to be signed " to ship nuclear waste originating from an old atomic research facility in former east germany to russia .
the report said a total of 951 nuclear fuel elements from the east german research center dresden-rossendorf , which have been in temporary storage since 2005 , would be shipped to the mayak atomic complex in the southern urals for reprocessing .
the waste would stay in russia for permanent storage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mayak facility in russia is to reprocess east germany 's radioactive waste the report said the basis for the transport deal was a previous agreement between the united states and russia , which regulates the transport of nuclear waste from reactors that were overseen by the soviet union .
germany 's goal was reportedly to " reduce the amount of highly-enriched uranium as much as possible . "
the deal received criticism from the green party , which has profited politically from a strong anti-nuclear sentiment in germany .
" cheap before safe , that 's what this is about , " green party spokeswoman sylvia kotting-uhl told the newspaper .

the downside is the impact this has on the environment .
but the country is taking meausres on climate protection - even more than some industrialized nations . in may 2009 , cyclone aila swept through the ganges delta .
tidal waves flooded a number of islands , devastating homes and farmland and claiming 300 lives .
200,000 people became climate refugees , and were forced to abandon their homes .
tropical cyclones are not uncommon in the world 's largest delta .
but to many , aila served a grim reminder of climate change , with greenpeace maintaining the destruction caused was in consonance with the predictions made by scientists , who had warned that storms would become more frequent and more damaging due to climate change .
aila also served as a reminder that the ganges delta is one of asia 's climate hotspots , vulnerable to some of the worst manifestations of climate change .
here , the effects of global warming are well underway – while in europe and north america , they are still only the subject of conferences and media debates . unique threat the challenges faced by people living on the ganges delta include the threat of rising sea levels caused mostly by subsidence in the region and partly by climate change .
if this continues , the result will be mass displacement .
higher temperatures related to climate change could also bring about more severe flooding of the delta , because of increased melting of snow and glaciers in the himalayas .
bildunterschrift : only a fraction of those displaced by aila had access to food and drinking water according to the experts , if climate change continues unchecked , the consequences for india will be devastating .
according to us economist william cline from the peterson institute for international economics in washington , india 's crop yield could drop by two thirds by 2080 as a result of global warming .
the institute 's statistics show that india is more at threat than any other region on the planet .
it 's not as though india is one of the planet 's biggest polluters .
the climate footprint of the seventh largest country in the world is commensurate with the size of its population - which is over 1 billion .
its carbon emissions are considerably lower than those of the us and china .
this is due largely to the country 's widespread poverty .
but as the indian economy gathers pace , the fear is that environmental issues will be sidelined .
demand for energy is rising as the middle-class buys more cars , tvs and better housing .
much of that energy comes from coal oil and gas , the main sources for planet-warming carbon dioxide .
but the country 's politicians are aware of the need for a low-carbon growth path .
learning from others ' mistakes " we need to put electricity into people 's homes and do it cleanly , " said india 's environment minister jairam ramesh last year - stressing that rich and poor nations inevitably have different approaches to tackling climate change . " you in the west need to live with only one car rather than three .
for you it 's about luxury .
for us it is about survival . "
india is especially active in the field of renewable energies , explains martin kaiser , director of international climate policy at greenpeace germany .
" india was quick to recognize that renewables could become a major growth market within its own economy , and got in on the act very early , " he says .
" it was a good move , because when an emerging economy invests in these technologies and contributes to their widespread use , they appear significantly more credible than the leading industrialized nations , who might just be keen to make money from them .
they become role models for other developing nations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy is popular in many developing nations today , india ranks 5th in the world with a total wind power capacity of 10,925 mw , or 3 percent of all electricity produced in the country .
experts predict that by 2030 , wind power will be supplying 15 percent of india 's energy needs . india is at pains to avoid the mistakes made by the industrialized nations .
large companies are now legally bound to hire energy managers , whose primary task is to ensure energy-efficient production , and are responsible for implement energy-saving measures .
they also report on the companies ' carbon footprint to india 's licensing authorities .
even the poverty-stricken population living on the ganges delta contributes to the fight against climate change by using solar energy .
mini solar units provide enough energy for a couple of energy-saving lamps and a radio or tv , and 50 percent of the 4.5 million people who live in the sundarbans in the lower part of the delta own one , according to geetanjali solar enterprise , an indian manufacturer of solar products and equipment .
that 's a much higher percentage of the population than in the major european cities and the us .

the downside is the impact this has on the environment .
but the country is taking meausres on climate protection - even more than some industrialized nations . in may 2009 , cyclone aila swept through the ganges delta .
tidal waves flooded a number of islands , devastating homes and farmland and claiming 300 lives .
200,000 people became climate refugees , and were forced to abandon their homes .
tropical cyclones are not uncommon in the world 's largest delta .
but to many , aila served a grim reminder of climate change , with greenpeace maintaining the destruction caused was in consonance with the predictions made by scientists , who had warned that storms would become more frequent and more damaging due to climate change .
aila also served as a reminder that the ganges delta is one of asia 's climate hotspots , vulnerable to some of the worst manifestations of climate change .
here , the effects of global warming are well underway – while in europe and north america , they are still only the subject of conferences and media debates . unique threat the challenges faced by people living on the ganges delta include the threat of rising sea levels caused mostly by subsidence in the region and partly by climate change .
if this continues , the result will be mass displacement .
higher temperatures related to climate change could also bring about more severe flooding of the delta , because of increased melting of snow and glaciers in the himalayas .
bildunterschrift : only a fraction of those displaced by aila had access to food and drinking water according to the experts , if climate change continues unchecked , the consequences for india will be devastating .
according to us economist william cline from the peterson institute for international economics in washington , india 's crop yield could drop by two thirds by 2080 as a result of global warming .
the institute 's statistics show that india is more at threat than any other region on the planet .
it 's not as though india is one of the planet 's biggest polluters .
the climate footprint of the seventh largest country in the world is commensurate with the size of its population - which is over 1 billion .
its carbon emissions are considerably lower than those of the us and china .
this is due largely to the country 's widespread poverty .
but as the indian economy gathers pace , the fear is that environmental issues will be sidelined .
demand for energy is rising as the middle-class buys more cars , tvs and better housing .
much of that energy comes from coal oil and gas , the main sources for planet-warming carbon dioxide .
but the country 's politicians are aware of the need for a low-carbon growth path .
learning from others ' mistakes " we need to put electricity into people 's homes and do it cleanly , " said india 's environment minister jairam ramesh last year - stressing that rich and poor nations inevitably have different approaches to tackling climate change . " you in the west need to live with only one car rather than three .
for you it 's about luxury .
for us it is about survival . "
india is especially active in the field of renewable energies , explains martin kaiser , director of international climate policy at greenpeace germany .
" india was quick to recognize that renewables could become a major growth market within its own economy , and got in on the act very early , " he says .
" it was a good move , because when an emerging economy invests in these technologies and contributes to their widespread use , they appear significantly more credible than the leading industrialized nations , who might just be keen to make money from them .
they become role models for other developing nations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy is popular in many developing nations today , india ranks 5th in the world with a total wind power capacity of 10,925 mw , or 3 percent of all electricity produced in the country .
experts predict that by 2030 , wind power will be supplying 15 percent of india 's energy needs . india is at pains to avoid the mistakes made by the industrialized nations .
large companies are now legally bound to hire energy managers , whose primary task is to ensure energy-efficient production , and are responsible for implement energy-saving measures .
they also report on the companies ' carbon footprint to india 's licensing authorities .
even the poverty-stricken population living on the ganges delta contributes to the fight against climate change by using solar energy .
mini solar units provide enough energy for a couple of energy-saving lamps and a radio or tv , and 50 percent of the 4.5 million people who live in the sundarbans in the lower part of the delta own one , according to geetanjali solar enterprise , an indian manufacturer of solar products and equipment .
that 's a much higher percentage of the population than in the major european cities and the us .

after nearly two days of blocking a nuclear waste storage site , thousands of protestors have been cleared from the area by police and the transport of 11 containers of nuclear waste has arrived at its destination . police cleared thousands of anti-nuclear activists from roads leading to the nuclear storage facility in gorleben , northern germany on tuesday morning , allowing for the final arrival of 123 tons of nuclear waste .
about 3,000 demonstrators staged a 44-hour sit-in in front of the storage site , including high-level politicians such as green party co-chair claudia roth .
activists from the environmentalist organization greenpeace used a truck disguised as a vehicle carrying beer to block the freight train station in nearby dannenberg , where the waste containers were to be moved to trucks for the final 20 kilometers to the storage site .
two greenpeace activists delayed the transport by about 11 hours by encasing themselves in a cement block , making it so the police could not move them without injuring them .
authorities managed to free the activists early tuesday morning , and the first truck carrying the nuclear waste departed dannenberg at around 8:30 a.m.
the last of the trucks arrived at the storage facility at about 9:50 a.m.
bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists held up the trucks carrying the waste for 11 hours stop-and-go traffic large protests have taken place during past nuclear waste transport operations , but none have delayed the shipment of the waste as much as the most recent .
the waste originated from nuclear reactors in germany and was sent to a plant in northern france for reprocessing .
the waste containers , called " castors " -lrb- cask for storage and transport of radioactive material -rrb- , left france by train on friday afternoon , but were quickly stopped by the first blockade of activists on the train tracks .
the following days were a tedious stop-and-go game , as protestors blocked the train tracks and some of the 16,000 police officers mobilized to secure the transport removed them .
protests to continue leaders of the various " citizens ' initiatives " against nuclear power claimed victory on tuesday , despite the successful transport of the nuclear waste , and some vowed to continue protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors succeeded in delaying the transport on historic levels " we 've shown that we 're a force to be reckoned with , " said kerstin rudek , chairwoman of the citizens ' initiative for environmental protection luechow-dannenberg .
matthias miersch , environment spokesman for the opposition social democrats in parliament , said the movement against the nuclear waste transport was a " very impressive demonstration . "
" this was a very clear signal to the government that this atomic energy policy can not go on , " he told phoenix public television .
" politicians have to understand that decisions are being made now that the people are absolutely unable to relate to . "
transport to russia meanwhile munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that germany had negotiated a deal " ready to be signed " to ship nuclear waste originating from an old atomic research facility in former east germany to russia .
the report said a total of 951 nuclear fuel elements from the east german research center dresden-rossendorf , which have been in temporary storage since 2005 , would be shipped to the mayak atomic complex in the southern urals for reprocessing .
the waste would stay in russia for permanent storage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mayak facility in russia is to reprocess east germany 's radioactive waste the report said the basis for the transport deal was a previous agreement between the united states and russia , which regulates the transport of nuclear waste from reactors that were overseen by the soviet union .
germany 's goal was reportedly to " reduce the amount of highly-enriched uranium as much as possible . "
the deal received criticism from the green party , which has profited politically from a strong anti-nuclear sentiment in germany .
" cheap before safe , that 's what this is about , " green party spokeswoman sylvia kotting-uhl told the newspaper .

these types of ultra-high-speed smash-ups at the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- are an attempt to re-create the explosion , known as the big bang , which is believed to have begun the universe .
as spokeswoman barbara warmbein told the associated press , the cern experiment over the weekend produced " a very , very , very small bang . "
lead ions are lead atoms whose electrons have been removed , and are much heavier than the protons that the researchers had been using .
that may be beneficial , as the energy required to smash them is higher , and thus may be closer to the conditions the scientists are trying to analyze .
as the research continues , scientists are trying to create " quark-gluon plasma , " an extremely hot and dense type of matter that may unlock some secrets in the early universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lead ion experiments will continue until cern shuts down for the winter on december 6 " the experiments are already providing an exciting glimpse of the new frontier , " sergio bertolucci , cern 's director for research and computing , told afp news agency .
major breakthroughs ' could take years ' the lhc is comprised of a circular , 27-kilometer -lrb- 17-mile -rrb- atom-smasher that cost four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- to build near geneva .
it began operations in september 2008 .
beyond pushing the limits of particle physics , the team is also exploring the frontier of data storage and transfer .
cern is currently using 140 computer centers spread across 34 countries to back up and analyze its data , which is being transferred at peak rates of 10 gigabytes per second , or the equivalent of approximately two dvds per second .
still , warmbein added that it will likely be months , if not years , before cern scientists make any major breakthroughs .

nonnenmacher was recently implicated in a spying scandal at the bank . the axe appears to be about to fall on the head of one of germany 's powerful state banks , hsh nordbank , after the lender 's major shareholders asked its supervisory board to give scandal-plagued ceo dirk jens nonnenmacher the sack .
nonnenmacher 's tenure as hsh chief was thrown into doubt after he was implicated in allegations of spying at the state-controlled bank .
the 47-year-old has also been investigated by prosecutors over risky investments that led to the bank losing millions of euros .
hsh nordbank 's biggest investors , the states of schleswig-holstein and hamburg , have reportedly asked the bank 's supervisory board chairman hilmar kopper to begin proceedings to find a new ceo for the lender .
in a written statement , the state governments said nonnenmacher 's dismissal was necessary to " win back lost trust " in hsh , whose main commercial focus is on shipping , transportation , real estate and renewable energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nonnenmacher has been in the post for around two years kopper said the supervisory board " took note " of the request by the state governments .
however , a decision will likely have to wait until at least the next board meeting on december 2 .
" -lsb- nonnenmacher -rsb- will continue with his duties for the time being with the necessary energy and reliability , " kopper said tuesday .
nonnenmacher 's contract at the bank runs until october 2012 .
a trained mathematician , he worked for several private banks before joining hsh nordbank in 2007 .
he became chairman in november 2008 , succeeding hans berger .
hsh nordbank is currently emerging from a financially rocky period brought on by the global financial crisis .
hamburg and schleswig-holstein were forced to provide the bank with 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.18 billion -rrb- in capital and 10 billion euros in guarantees .
the bank also received around 17 billion euros in guarantees from the federal government 's soffin bank rescue fund .

nonnenmacher was recently implicated in a spying scandal at the bank . the axe appears to be about to fall on the head of one of germany 's powerful state banks , hsh nordbank , after the lender 's major shareholders asked its supervisory board to give scandal-plagued ceo dirk jens nonnenmacher the sack .
nonnenmacher 's tenure as hsh chief was thrown into doubt after he was implicated in allegations of spying at the state-controlled bank .
the 47-year-old has also been investigated by prosecutors over risky investments that led to the bank losing millions of euros .
hsh nordbank 's biggest investors , the states of schleswig-holstein and hamburg , have reportedly asked the bank 's supervisory board chairman hilmar kopper to begin proceedings to find a new ceo for the lender .
in a written statement , the state governments said nonnenmacher 's dismissal was necessary to " win back lost trust " in hsh , whose main commercial focus is on shipping , transportation , real estate and renewable energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nonnenmacher has been in the post for around two years kopper said the supervisory board " took note " of the request by the state governments .
however , a decision will likely have to wait until at least the next board meeting on december 2 .
" -lsb- nonnenmacher -rsb- will continue with his duties for the time being with the necessary energy and reliability , " kopper said tuesday .
nonnenmacher 's contract at the bank runs until october 2012 .
a trained mathematician , he worked for several private banks before joining hsh nordbank in 2007 .
he became chairman in november 2008 , succeeding hans berger .
hsh nordbank is currently emerging from a financially rocky period brought on by the global financial crisis .
hamburg and schleswig-holstein were forced to provide the bank with 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.18 billion -rrb- in capital and 10 billion euros in guarantees .
the bank also received around 17 billion euros in guarantees from the federal government 's soffin bank rescue fund .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 09.11.2010 iraq war deserter seeks asylum in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to us law , desertion can carry the death penalty in 2007 , andre shepherd abandoned the us army base where he was stationed in germany to protest the iraq war .
after months living undercover in picturesque chiemsee , he 's now trying to get political aslyum . tucked away on the border of germany and austria , lake chiemsee has long been popular with holiday-makers .
but now the idyllic alpine region has become the unlikely backdrop for the story of a man wandering into uncharted political territory . in 2007 , andre shepherd walked off the us army base where he was stationed in southern germany .
the apache helicopter mechanic said his experiences on duty in iraq convinced him he could no longer support the war .
" the iraqi people , when i met them , reacted towards us with anger , hostility and fear .
we did n't understand why , because in the us , you think ' oh , we 're the liberators , " ' shepherd told detusche welle .
" but what was going on with the kidnappings , the rapes , and abu ghraib - the population just wanted us out of there . "
unexpected turn shepherd had never planned to make a career of the military .
in his 20 's , his dream of studying computer science fell by the wayside after he could n't afford to keep paying tuition at kent state university in ohio .
for a while , he lived in his car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lake chiemsee is known for its sunsets and alpine beauty , not political drama " i ended up being homeless for about a year , and i joined the military because it was the only way to get a job out of cleveland , " said the ohio native .
after his first tour of duty in iraq , shepherd returned to the base in germany , where he started doing internet research on the iraq war .
gradually , he became convinced that the us-led invasion was a human rights violation .
that was the moment of truth , says shepherd . " i had to decide , ok , do i just go back to the war , knowing what i 'm doing is wrong , that it 's murder , or do i go against the world 's most powerful government and have a lot of problems , be ostracized from society ? "
it took him ten days to make up his mind .
in april 2007 , shepherd walked off the base .
a risky move germany is a main staging post for the us military , with around 60,000 us troops stationed there .
each year , some of those soldiers go awol -lrb- absent without official leave -rrb- .
many get picked up by the german police and sent back to their bases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shepherd refused to take part in a war he calls illegal shepherd avoided being caught .
he did n't contact his family , relying on local friends and the occasional odd job to survive .
after 19 months , he decided to turn himself in and apply for political asylum .
if his application is successful , shepherd will become the first us iraq war veteran to receive political asylum in germany , says rudi friedrich , head of the pacifist organization connection .
friedrich 's organization , which he runs out of his home in a suburb of frankfurt , offers support to conscientious objectors and war deserters and has been guiding shepherd through the asylum-seeking process .
" the recognition that one is not alone is an important experience for a deserter to regain his self-esteem , to be able to say , ' yes , i did make the right choice , i do n't want to shoot at my neighbor , " ' friedrich told deutsche welle .
shepherd 's asylum application cites a 2004 european union regulation that grants refugee status to any soldier who is in danger of being prosecuted if his or her military service " would include crimes or acts " which violate international law .
but some fear granting shepherd asylum could create an easy way out for americans stationed in germany who want to avoid combat duty in iraq .
that 's not likely , says friedrich , because asylum cases are considered individually .

yet despite booming export rates , the country 's economic growth appears to be headed for a setback . german exports have reached their highest level in more than two years .
according to figures released by the federal statistics office on monday , sales abroad rose by three percent to 84.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 117.4 billion -rrb- .
" the exports sector remains the driving force behind the country 's economic recovery , " said anton boerner , president of the federation of german wholesale , foreign trade and services .
powered by demand from emerging economies like china , the increase in exports was twice the expected 1.5 percent rise predicted by analysts .
industrial output drops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boerner says exports remain the driving force behind germany 's economic recovery but the new data came as industrial output slumped , with both industrial production and factory orders falling short of expectations .
instead of a predicted 0.5 percent increase , industrial output in october dropped by 0.8 percent compared to the previous month .
despite releasing disappointing figures , the economics ministry in berlin insisted that germany 's economic recovery was not in danger .
berlin insists overall trend is positive " industrial production is still trending upwards .
in the third quarter , output could again rise above the level of the second quarter , when we saw strong growth , " the ministry said in a statement . in september , berlin had raised its 2010 growth forecast to 3.4 percent , following a crippling contraction of 4.7 percent in 2009 .
at the same time , unemployment dropped to 7.5 percent in the seasonally adjusted term .
the number of total unemployed dropped to below 3 million for the first time in two decades .

" the negotiations with croatia are now in their final phase , " the european commission said in its annual report on the progress of would-be eu members .
the commission pointed to widespread corruption and organized crime problems in other western balkan applicant countries as the biggest hurdle to their joining the bloc in the short term , although it did announce that montenegro was ready for full candidate status , saying the country 's democracy " is largely in line with european principles and standards . "
montenegro 's application has already been recognized by the eu , and with the commission 's approval , member states will now debate whether to grant the country candidate status and begin the process of negotiating membership .
croatia , iceland , turkey and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia are the four candidates that have already reached this final phase of the accession process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks voted for constitutional changes meant to appease brussels in a september referendum turkey began its official negotiations five years ago , but the eu acknowledged in its report that the process has hit rather rocky ground .
" negotiations advanced , albeit rather slowly , " the commission said of accession talks with ankara .
several stumbling blocks despite praising constitutional reforms designed to fight corruption , wrest some political power away from the military , and improve the protection of human rights as " a step in the right direction , " the commission said that turkey was still lagging behind in areas like press freedom , freedom of expression and religion , the rights of women and trade unions , and the integration of the kurdish minority in the country .
" the pace of reform in turkey dictates the pace of the accession process , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle said in berlin , shortly after the report was released .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the division of cyprus has soured turkish relations with eu members greece and cyprus the european commission also called on turkey to open trade ties with cyprus and redouble diplomatic efforts with the country , describing the need for progress in this area as " urgent . "
eu member state cyprus and turkey are locked in a territorial dispute over the northern part of the island , which has been occupied by turkish forces since 1974 .
reunification talks have stalled , and turkey says it will not open trade ties with cyprus until the problem is resolved .
and while cyprus tries to slow turkey 's accession into the eu , turkey is using its membership of nato to hamper cyprus ' bid to join that alliance .
another problem facing turkey 's membership bid that did not get highlighted in the eu commission 's annual report is the sheer size of the country .
a 2009 census put turkey 's population at 72 million , which would make it the second most populous member of the bloc .
" that means turkey would be represented in the european parliament with a number of mps to reflect its size , and the size of its population would also mean a lot of weight in decisions in the council of ministers , " the head of the eu program at the german council on foreign relations , almut moeller , told deutsche welle .
moeller said that eu insiders often talk about the influence turkey would wield in the bloc , and the affect it would have on the larger countries and their power structure .
" this is a sensitively calibrated order that has been around for a while now , and in the past we have only seen smaller and medium-sized countries entering the bloc .
they have relatively little impact on the big players , but imagine what a country this size would mean for the old order , for the amount of power currently shared between france and germany in the eu , for instance . "
gul : ' strategic imperative ' to let turkey in five years ago , there was an outpouring of pro-european sentiment and euphoria in turkey when the country began the final phase of the eu accession process .
but the mood seems to be souring as other applicants make much smoother process towards membership in the bloc .
on monday , brussels announced plans to grant visa-free travel within the eu 's open-border schengen zone to people from albania and bosnia , and the turkish newspaper haber tuerk responded by proclaiming on tuesday 's front page : " everyone 's allowed into the eu , except us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president gul thinks the eu is short-sighted not to welcome turkey citizens from every balkan country except kosovo , which some eu members consider a part of serbia , are now free to travel within the eu 's open-border area , while turks have to seek special visas .
" the eu will not be weaker , but stronger both politically and economically with turkey 's membership , " turkish president abdullah gul said in a speech in london on monday .
" given the fact that the international balance of power tends to shift towards the east and asia , it is , indeed , a strategic imperative for the eu to have turkey as a member . "
gul , speaking to the chatham house think-tank after receiving the organization 's annual prize for statesmanship , said it was " sad to observe " that some european leaders did not recognize the role turkey could play within the eu .
" this short-sighted vision is the major impediment before the idea of the eu as a global actor , capable of assuming greater responsibilities on political and security issues , complementing its economic clout , " the turkish president said .
in his speech , gul also announced that neighboring iran had asked turkey to host another round of talks with un security council members and germany on tehran 's nuclear program , alluding to the diplomatic role his country might play for the eu .
however , turkey 's international activities were also singled out by the eu for veiled criticism on tuesday , after the country defied the us and eu to vote against tougher un sanctions for iran earlier this year .
" turkey 's foreign policy has become more active in its wider neighborhood , " the commission 's report said .
" this is an asset for the european union , provided it is developed as a complement to turkey 's accession process and in coordination with the eu . "

these types of ultra-high-speed smash-ups at the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- are an attempt to re-create the explosion , known as the big bang , which is believed to have begun the universe .
as spokeswoman barbara warmbein told the associated press , the cern experiment over the weekend produced " a very , very , very small bang . "
lead ions are lead atoms whose electrons have been removed , and are much heavier than the protons that the researchers had been using .
that may be beneficial , as the energy required to smash them is higher , and thus may be closer to the conditions the scientists are trying to analyze .
as the research continues , scientists are trying to create " quark-gluon plasma , " an extremely hot and dense type of matter that may unlock some secrets in the early universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lead ion experiments will continue until cern shuts down for the winter on december 6 " the experiments are already providing an exciting glimpse of the new frontier , " sergio bertolucci , cern 's director for research and computing , told afp news agency .
major breakthroughs ' could take years ' the lhc is comprised of a circular , 27-kilometer -lrb- 17-mile -rrb- atom-smasher that cost four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- to build near geneva .
it began operations in september 2008 .
beyond pushing the limits of particle physics , the team is also exploring the frontier of data storage and transfer .
cern is currently using 140 computer centers spread across 34 countries to back up and analyze its data , which is being transferred at peak rates of 10 gigabytes per second , or the equivalent of approximately two dvds per second .
still , warmbein added that it will likely be months , if not years , before cern scientists make any major breakthroughs .

wittenberg 's grandfather was a rabbi there during the so-called kristallnacht , or night of broken glass .
all throughout germany and austria , jewish homes , business , and synagogues were ransacked and thousands of jews were deported to concentration camps .
now , accompanied by his dog mitzpah , he is carrying the torch by foot and by ferry .
in london , he will use it to symbolically light the eternal flame of a new synagogue for his own congregation .
the three-week project also serves as a fundraiser to support a variety of charities and interfaith projects .
deutsche welle spoke with the rabbi in cologne , at the midway point through his walk .
deutsche welle : rabbi wittenberg , can you tell me where the idea came from to take this walk , and what the journey is really all about ?
jonathan wittenberg : it was really when i was rereading my grandfather 's memoirs , at the 70th anniversary of kristallnacht .
i just wanted to remember what had happened to him .
and i read there how he was called by the gestapo on the 10th of november , on the allegation that he had the keys to the westend synagogue , which he did n't . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rabbi stopped at maria-laach abbey , in germany 's eifel region he wrote that he came to the main synagogue ; the fire brigade was there , and they were doing nothing .
he heard people in the crowd say -lsb- … -rsb- that the interior of the westend synagogue had been destroyed - wrecked and trashed - but that the eternal light -lsb- a constant flame that is lit in every synagogue ; eds . -rsb- was still burning .
and people took that for a miracle .
this spoke to me .
my own synagogue is building a new building .
we 've been working on it for 15 years and it 's nearing completion .
and i had the thought , because i am a lover of walking , of coming to frankfurt , of lighting a symbolic flame , and bringing it back to london to light our new eternal light . so you made ' light ' the subject of your walk ?
i was very struck by this idea , of light that burns despite darkness .
it 's an image that speaks to me in all kinds of ways as a rabbi .
i encounter a lot of darkness people struggle with .
i see the courage of people in facing illness , in facing death .
i also see the courage of people in a political context .
one of the organizations i am supporting on this walk is the parents ' circle , made up of parents who 've lost children on both sides of the israeli-palestinian conflict .
this group of parents , instead of blaming the others , instead of hating , they 're saying , ' well , this is a message that we need understanding . '
tell me about the ' eternal light ' that you are carrying .
how did you get it , and how are you transporting it ?
very simply , it 's an electric torch - a flashlight .
it 's symbolic .
i 'm not an olympic runner , and nobody 's going to let me into a cafe along the way with a great big torch on fire .
but what i did n't want to do was just to come by plane and take the torch and just fly back .
there 's no substance to something like that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the route traverses german wine country the trip began at the westend synagogue on october 24 .
i was there with a group of about 20 people from london who came to share the start of the journey .
the ceremony where i took the light was simple , just a couple of verses : " god is my light , and my salvation . "
one of the people with us was a hazzan -lsb- a singer trained to accompany jewish religious services ; eds . -rsb- who very beautifully sang those verses .
coincidentally , that day was the celebration of the 100-year anniversary of the westend synagogue .
i was invited to speak .
it was very , very moving .
my grandfather - my mother 's father - had been the main rabbi there for almost 30 years .
he died in 1975 .
what do you feel you 've learned about light along the way so far ?
my understanding of the meaning of light is constantly growing and constantly changing .
and just as light expands , so my understanding of it has expanded .
there is the beautiful natural light , while walking along the main and rhine rivers .
and then there is the tremendous amount of kindness i 've met in very ordinary circumstances .
on the second day , i was walking with a friend of mine who is a protestant minister .
i needed something to eat , and we went into a place - it turned out to be in a castle along the hiking trail , a very posh place .
i asked , ' can i have some bread please ? '
and the man came back with a basket of fruit and all kinds of bread .
i took out my purse to pay , and he said , ' no , please take it .
it 's a gift . '
i had n't told him what i was doing but it was obvious that i was somehow … en route .
i 've encountered that kind of kindness all along .
that is a kind of light .
you 're not just trekking on this trip - you 're visiting various religious sites , holding talks with social-interest groups , and visiting jewish monuments .
has that added to your understanding of light ?
yes .
there have been moments of contact with people who are engaged with what was the jewish past in germany .
we stopped in the town of bingen , at the study group for judaism there .
i asked the lady who leads it , ' why do you do this ? '
she was n't jewish , did n't have jewish ancestors .
none of them did .
she said she did it because her father had a close relationship to the jewish community and had been helped by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rabbi stopped at a thai buddhist center along the way have you found anything unexpected so far ?
well , walking in the lower rhineland up to cologne , i 've thought a lot about the shoah , obviously .
but i 've also been conscious that here was a thousand years of jewish creative history .
we were in a tiny village , st. goar .
and in that tiny rhineland village , the sefer ha-maharil , which is a key work in the progression of ashkenazy jewish law , was composed .
it still affects our practices today .
so , i had n't expected to feel such continuity with jewish culture as i have felt - this sense of jewish history , of learning , creativity , and study .
i expected to feel far more estranged .
your grandfather was german , and you speak excellent german although you yourself are english .
has this walk raised any thoughts about your own german ancestry ?
i 've been to germany many times before , but never for this long .
my grandfather loved the german jewish culture .
unlike many , he did n't teach us to hate germany .
he said we should differentiate between nazism and german culture .
i think there are a lot of questions to be asked about whether that differentiation could be made quite as neatly as that .
but that was certainly his attitude , so i have n't had to overcome an inner revulsion to being in germany - i never had it .
and i deeply do n't believe you can blame one generation for what another generation did .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the second fundraising walk wittenberg has taken with his dog , mitzpah but there is no doubt that there is a legacy .
and i think finding ways to face that legacy together as much as possible - you ca n't do it with major perpetrators - but with people who are struggling with what the past has meant to them , i think enabling that kind of conversation is very important .
was being on this trip during kristallnacht , the night of broken glass , part of your plan ?
on november 9 i 'll be in holland , since i 've been asked to speak there .
it would have made more sense to be in germany , but that 's where it worked out .
in any case i definitely wanted to be traveling the route on kristallnacht .
towards the end of the walk i pick up the route of the kindertransporte , -lsb- the name given to the movement to rescue some 10,000 jewish children from the nazis by sending them to live in the uk , just prior to the outbreak of world war ii ; eds . -rsb-
so that 's something i find deeply moving .
i 'm guessing you are something of a strange sight in the german countryside - a rabbi wearing a yarmulke and a backpack , with a dog in tow .
have you gotten some odd reactions ?
not at all - although people do keep stopping me to tell me that the flashlight in my backpack has been left on .
they do n't know i 've done it on purpose .

wittenberg 's grandfather was a rabbi there during the so-called kristallnacht , or night of broken glass .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 09.11.2010 oskar schindler 's krakow factory becomes a museum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photo exhibits show life during the nazi occupation steven spielberg made oskar schindler 's name immortal as the man who saved over a thousand jewish lives in world war ii .
in krakow , a museum and memorial recently opened in schindler 's former factory . an industrial complex in krakow is hardly the usual place to find hordes of tourists .
however in this part of the city , tourist buses line the streets - and it 's all because this is the location of oskar schindler 's factory .
the american film director steven spielberg made the factory famous in 1993 when he filmed parts of his oscar-winning film " schindler 's list " at the factory .
the story follows schindler as he tries to save his jewish workforce from nazi persecution and the concentration camps .
until recently , people had to peer through the locked gates to get a look at the factory .
but as of this summer , the building is now open to all visitors .
the krakow authorities have converted the factory into a museum , which is currently housing an exhibition called " krakow : occupation 1939-1945 , " examining life during nazi rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the success of spielberg 's film drew visitors to schindler 's krakow factory the exhibition shows the history of oskar schindler himself , and his workers .
curator monika bednarek said while schindler is the " main protagonist " of the exhibition , " he 's not the only one . "
the exhibition also charts the nazi occupation as a whole , and puts the fate of the jewish workers in schindler 's factory into context .
schindler 's place in history oskar schindler lived from 1908 to 1974 , and was the son of an industrialist .
in 1939 , after the occupation of poland by nazi germany , schindler acquired an enamel factory which had previously been in jewish hands .
the factory produced tin ware and later shells and detonators for the war effort .
schindler directly benefitted from the so-called ' ayranization ' of jewish factories and businesses , and as the war progressed he made a fortune on the black market .
despite his nazi membership , schindler became increasingly concerned about the cruel fate of his jewish workforce .
he added 1,200 workers to his famous list , labeling them ' essential ' to the war effort .
by doing so , he saved them from certain death at a nazi concentration camp .
after the war , schindler 's enamel factory became state-owned and was converted for use by a telecommunications company .
in 2002 it was abandoned , only to be bought by the city council three years later .
" the council decided to turn it into a museum , " said bednarek .
with the help of eu funding , the building was renovated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial is filled with original tin ware from schindler 's factory modern exhibits entice young visitors the exhibition begins in the krakow of the 1930s with a range of photos - such as women walking in the city and jews on the way to the synagogue .
" first of all we see the history before the war , so we can understand what happened during the war , " explained bendarek .
then the exhibits chart the outbreak of war , as german soldiers marched through poland on september 6 , 1939 .
there 's even a reconstruction of the jewish ghetto .
with the help of touch-screen displays , life-size murals and multimedia exhibits , the history of the period is brought to life .
the curators hope these types of techniques will help appeal to younger visitors .
" with this technology we can reach young people , " said grzegorz jezowski , who helped put together the exhibition .
" it makes it more attractive for them . "
a memorial to oskar schindler schindler himself only features quite briefly in the exhibition .
his story is told through photos , original documents and furniture from the factory .
in the middle of one room is a giant transparent cube , filled with tin pots , bowls and plates that were produced in schindler 's factory .
the instillation is meant to represent the history of the entrepreneur and his workers .
in the center hang the names of around 1,200 jewish workers whose lives were saved by schindler .

wittenberg 's grandfather was a rabbi there during the so-called kristallnacht , or night of broken glass .
all throughout germany and austria , jewish homes , business , and synagogues were ransacked and thousands of jews were deported to concentration camps .
now , accompanied by his dog mitzpah , he is carrying the torch by foot and by ferry .
in london , he will use it to symbolically light the eternal flame of a new synagogue for his own congregation .
the three-week project also serves as a fundraiser to support a variety of charities and interfaith projects .
deutsche welle spoke with the rabbi in cologne , at the midway point through his walk .
deutsche welle : rabbi wittenberg , can you tell me where the idea came from to take this walk , and what the journey is really all about ?
jonathan wittenberg : it was really when i was rereading my grandfather 's memoirs , at the 70th anniversary of kristallnacht .
i just wanted to remember what had happened to him .
and i read there how he was called by the gestapo on the 10th of november , on the allegation that he had the keys to the westend synagogue , which he did n't . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rabbi stopped at maria-laach abbey , in germany 's eifel region he wrote that he came to the main synagogue ; the fire brigade was there , and they were doing nothing .
he heard people in the crowd say -lsb- … -rsb- that the interior of the westend synagogue had been destroyed - wrecked and trashed - but that the eternal light -lsb- a constant flame that is lit in every synagogue ; eds . -rsb- was still burning .
and people took that for a miracle .
this spoke to me .
my own synagogue is building a new building .
we 've been working on it for 15 years and it 's nearing completion .
and i had the thought , because i am a lover of walking , of coming to frankfurt , of lighting a symbolic flame , and bringing it back to london to light our new eternal light . so you made ' light ' the subject of your walk ?
i was very struck by this idea , of light that burns despite darkness .
it 's an image that speaks to me in all kinds of ways as a rabbi .
i encounter a lot of darkness people struggle with .
i see the courage of people in facing illness , in facing death .
i also see the courage of people in a political context .
one of the organizations i am supporting on this walk is the parents ' circle , made up of parents who 've lost children on both sides of the israeli-palestinian conflict .
this group of parents , instead of blaming the others , instead of hating , they 're saying , ' well , this is a message that we need understanding . '
tell me about the ' eternal light ' that you are carrying .
how did you get it , and how are you transporting it ?
very simply , it 's an electric torch - a flashlight .
it 's symbolic .
i 'm not an olympic runner , and nobody 's going to let me into a cafe along the way with a great big torch on fire .
but what i did n't want to do was just to come by plane and take the torch and just fly back .
there 's no substance to something like that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the route traverses german wine country the trip began at the westend synagogue on october 24 .
i was there with a group of about 20 people from london who came to share the start of the journey .
the ceremony where i took the light was simple , just a couple of verses : " god is my light , and my salvation . "
one of the people with us was a hazzan -lsb- a singer trained to accompany jewish religious services ; eds . -rsb- who very beautifully sang those verses .
coincidentally , that day was the celebration of the 100-year anniversary of the westend synagogue .
i was invited to speak .
it was very , very moving .
my grandfather - my mother 's father - had been the main rabbi there for almost 30 years .
he died in 1975 .
what do you feel you 've learned about light along the way so far ?
my understanding of the meaning of light is constantly growing and constantly changing .
and just as light expands , so my understanding of it has expanded .
there is the beautiful natural light , while walking along the main and rhine rivers .
and then there is the tremendous amount of kindness i 've met in very ordinary circumstances .
on the second day , i was walking with a friend of mine who is a protestant minister .
i needed something to eat , and we went into a place - it turned out to be in a castle along the hiking trail , a very posh place .
i asked , ' can i have some bread please ? '
and the man came back with a basket of fruit and all kinds of bread .
i took out my purse to pay , and he said , ' no , please take it .
it 's a gift . '
i had n't told him what i was doing but it was obvious that i was somehow … en route .
i 've encountered that kind of kindness all along .
that is a kind of light .
you 're not just trekking on this trip - you 're visiting various religious sites , holding talks with social-interest groups , and visiting jewish monuments .
has that added to your understanding of light ?
yes .
there have been moments of contact with people who are engaged with what was the jewish past in germany .
we stopped in the town of bingen , at the study group for judaism there .
i asked the lady who leads it , ' why do you do this ? '
she was n't jewish , did n't have jewish ancestors .
none of them did .
she said she did it because her father had a close relationship to the jewish community and had been helped by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rabbi stopped at a thai buddhist center along the way have you found anything unexpected so far ?
well , walking in the lower rhineland up to cologne , i 've thought a lot about the shoah , obviously .
but i 've also been conscious that here was a thousand years of jewish creative history .
we were in a tiny village , st. goar .
and in that tiny rhineland village , the sefer ha-maharil , which is a key work in the progression of ashkenazy jewish law , was composed .
it still affects our practices today .
so , i had n't expected to feel such continuity with jewish culture as i have felt - this sense of jewish history , of learning , creativity , and study .
i expected to feel far more estranged .
your grandfather was german , and you speak excellent german although you yourself are english .
has this walk raised any thoughts about your own german ancestry ?
i 've been to germany many times before , but never for this long .
my grandfather loved the german jewish culture .
unlike many , he did n't teach us to hate germany .
he said we should differentiate between nazism and german culture .
i think there are a lot of questions to be asked about whether that differentiation could be made quite as neatly as that .
but that was certainly his attitude , so i have n't had to overcome an inner revulsion to being in germany - i never had it .
and i deeply do n't believe you can blame one generation for what another generation did .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the second fundraising walk wittenberg has taken with his dog , mitzpah but there is no doubt that there is a legacy .
and i think finding ways to face that legacy together as much as possible - you ca n't do it with major perpetrators - but with people who are struggling with what the past has meant to them , i think enabling that kind of conversation is very important .
was being on this trip during kristallnacht , the night of broken glass , part of your plan ?
on november 9 i 'll be in holland , since i 've been asked to speak there .
it would have made more sense to be in germany , but that 's where it worked out .
in any case i definitely wanted to be traveling the route on kristallnacht .
towards the end of the walk i pick up the route of the kindertransporte , -lsb- the name given to the movement to rescue some 10,000 jewish children from the nazis by sending them to live in the uk , just prior to the outbreak of world war ii ; eds . -rsb-
so that 's something i find deeply moving .
i 'm guessing you are something of a strange sight in the german countryside - a rabbi wearing a yarmulke and a backpack , with a dog in tow .
have you gotten some odd reactions ?
not at all - although people do keep stopping me to tell me that the flashlight in my backpack has been left on .
they do n't know i 've done it on purpose .

yet despite booming export rates , the country 's economic growth appears to be headed for a setback . german exports have reached their highest level in more than two years .
according to figures released by the federal statistics office on monday , sales abroad rose by three percent to 84.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 117.4 billion -rrb- .
" the exports sector remains the driving force behind the country 's economic recovery , " said anton boerner , president of the federation of german wholesale , foreign trade and services .
powered by demand from emerging economies like china , the increase in exports was twice the expected 1.5 percent rise predicted by analysts .
industrial output drops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boerner says exports remain the driving force behind germany 's economic recovery but the new data came as industrial output slumped , with both industrial production and factory orders falling short of expectations .
instead of a predicted 0.5 percent increase , industrial output in october dropped by 0.8 percent compared to the previous month .
despite releasing disappointing figures , the economics ministry in berlin insisted that germany 's economic recovery was not in danger .
berlin insists overall trend is positive " industrial production is still trending upwards .
in the third quarter , output could again rise above the level of the second quarter , when we saw strong growth , " the ministry said in a statement . in september , berlin had raised its 2010 growth forecast to 3.4 percent , following a crippling contraction of 4.7 percent in 2009 .
at the same time , unemployment dropped to 7.5 percent in the seasonally adjusted term .
the number of total unemployed dropped to below 3 million for the first time in two decades .

yet despite booming export rates , the country 's economic growth appears to be headed for a setback . german exports have reached their highest level in more than two years .
according to figures released by the federal statistics office on monday , sales abroad rose by three percent to 84.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 117.4 billion -rrb- .
" the exports sector remains the driving force behind the country 's economic recovery , " said anton boerner , president of the federation of german wholesale , foreign trade and services .
powered by demand from emerging economies like china , the increase in exports was twice the expected 1.5 percent rise predicted by analysts .
industrial output drops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boerner says exports remain the driving force behind germany 's economic recovery but the new data came as industrial output slumped , with both industrial production and factory orders falling short of expectations .
instead of a predicted 0.5 percent increase , industrial output in october dropped by 0.8 percent compared to the previous month .
despite releasing disappointing figures , the economics ministry in berlin insisted that germany 's economic recovery was not in danger .
berlin insists overall trend is positive " industrial production is still trending upwards .
in the third quarter , output could again rise above the level of the second quarter , when we saw strong growth , " the ministry said in a statement . in september , berlin had raised its 2010 growth forecast to 3.4 percent , following a crippling contraction of 4.7 percent in 2009 .
at the same time , unemployment dropped to 7.5 percent in the seasonally adjusted term .
the number of total unemployed dropped to below 3 million for the first time in two decades .

the agency , the energy arm of the organization for economic cooperation and development , a grouping of the world 's richest nations , forecast that global oil demand will rise to 99 million barrels a day by 2035 , some 15 million barrels a day higher than last year .
" the message is clear , the price will go up , especially if consuming countries do not make changes in the way they consume oil , especially in the transport sector , " the iea 's chief economist and lead author of the report , fatih birol told reuters in an interview .
oil prices will exceed $ 200 -lrb- 144 euro -rrb- a barrel by 2035 , and will likely stay over $ 100 a barrel after 2015 , the report said .
on tuesday the price of oil stood at roughly $ 87 a barrel .
china drives demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace wants even more emphasis on renewables china and other emerging economies are driving demand for oil higher .
" all the net growth comes from non-oecd countries , almost half from china alone , mainly driven by rising use of transport fuels , " the iea said in the report .
oil subsidies were limiting the scope for higher prices to choke off demand and change consumer habits , the iea said , and called for oil subsidies to be reduced .
" if subsidy policy does not change , with increasing price assumptions , these $ 312 billion in subsidies for 2009 will reach $ 600 billion in 2015 .
that 's huge , " birol said .
the report estimated that renewable energy only receives $ 57 billion in subsidies , a fraction of the ongoing support for the fossil fuel sector .
eradicating fossil fuel subsidies would boost the global economy , environment and energy security , the iea said , referring to a pledge made by g20 countries .
g20 leaders committed in pittsburgh in 2009 to phase out , over the medium-term , inefficient fossil fuel subsidies which distort the energy market and encourage wasteful consumption .
a g20 meeting in seoul this week may update progress on fossil fuels . greenpeace welcomed the iea 's call to cut the $ 312 billion in global fossil fuel subsidies .
" the iea report clearly states that fossil fuels are heavily subsidized … leading to unfair competition with clean and climate friendly renewable energies .
we welcome that renewables are now in the focus of the 2010 edition , " said sven teske , renewable energy director at greenpeace international , in a press release .
gas glut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surplus of gas may hinder development in renewable energy the future of renewable energy depended on strong government support , said the iea report , especially given an expected " ten year glut in gas " which would suppress fossil fuel power prices and make renewables look even less competitive .
" the gas glut will be with us ten more years , " birol told reuters .
" cheaper gas prices will put additional pressure on renewable energies especially in the us and europe .
if natural gas is as plenty and cheap as we think , then life for renewables will be even more difficult , " he added although greenpeace praised the iea for making renewable energy more prominent in this year 's report , teske from greenpeace international criticized the iea 's emphasis on other energy sources such as nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- for coal power stations .
" the iea is failing to shift technology recommendations from unproven , dangerous and expensive technologies such as ccs and nuclear power plants , " teske said .
greenpeace would like to see more emphasis on renewable energy and greater efficiency to reduce co2 emissions .

the commission pointed to widespread corruption and organized crime problems in other western balkan applicant countries as the biggest hurdle to their joining the bloc in the short term , although it did announce that montenegro was ready for full candidate status , saying the country 's democracy " is largely in line with european principles and standards . "
montenegro 's application has already been recognized by the eu , and with the commission 's approval , member states will now debate whether to grant the country candidate status and begin the process of negotiating membership .
croatia , iceland , turkey and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia are the four candidates that have already reached this final phase of the accession process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks voted for constitutional changes meant to appease brussels in a september referendum turkey began its official negotiations five years ago , but the eu acknowledged in its report that the process has hit rather rocky ground .
" negotiations advanced , albeit rather slowly , " the commission said of accession talks with ankara .
several stumbling blocks despite praising constitutional reforms designed to fight corruption , wrest some political power away from the military , and improve the protection of human rights as " a step in the right direction , " the commission said that turkey was still lagging behind in areas like press freedom , freedom of expression and religion , the rights of women and trade unions , and the integration of the kurdish minority in the country .
" the pace of reform in turkey dictates the pace of the accession process , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle said in berlin , shortly after the report was released .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the division of cyprus has soured turkish relations with eu members greece and cyprus the european commission also called on turkey to open trade ties with cyprus and redouble diplomatic efforts with the country , describing the need for progress in this area as " urgent . "
eu member state cyprus and turkey are locked in a territorial dispute over the northern part of the island , which has been occupied by turkish forces since 1974 .
reunification talks have stalled , and turkey says it will not open trade ties with cyprus until the problem is resolved .
and while cyprus tries to slow turkey 's accession into the eu , turkey is using its membership of nato to hamper cyprus ' bid to join that alliance .
another problem facing turkey 's membership bid that did not get highlighted in the eu commission 's annual report is the sheer size of the country .
a 2009 census put turkey 's population at 72 million , which would make it the second most populous member of the bloc .
" that means turkey would be represented in the european parliament with a number of mps to reflect its size , and the size of its population would also mean a lot of weight in decisions in the council of ministers , " the head of the eu program at the german council on foreign relations , almut moeller , told deutsche welle .
moeller said that eu insiders often talk about the influence turkey would wield in the bloc , and the affect it would have on the larger countries and their power structure .
" this is a sensitively calibrated order that has been around for a while now , and in the past we have only seen smaller and medium-sized countries entering the bloc .
they have relatively little impact on the big players , but imagine what a country this size would mean for the old order , for the amount of power currently shared between france and germany in the eu , for instance . "
gul : ' strategic imperative ' to let turkey in five years ago , there was an outpouring of pro-european sentiment and euphoria in turkey when the country began the final phase of the eu accession process .
but the mood seems to be souring as other applicants make much smoother process towards membership in the bloc .
on monday , brussels announced plans to grant visa-free travel within the eu 's open-border schengen zone to people from albania and bosnia , and the turkish newspaper haber tuerk responded by proclaiming on tuesday 's front page : " everyone 's allowed into the eu , except us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president gul thinks the eu is short-sighted not to welcome turkey citizens from every balkan country except kosovo , which some eu members consider a part of serbia , are now free to travel within the eu 's open-border area , while turks have to seek special visas .
" the eu will not be weaker , but stronger both politically and economically with turkey 's membership , " turkish president abdullah gul said in a speech in london on monday .
" given the fact that the international balance of power tends to shift towards the east and asia , it is , indeed , a strategic imperative for the eu to have turkey as a member . "
gul , speaking to the chatham house think-tank after receiving the organization 's annual prize for statesmanship , said it was " sad to observe " that some european leaders did not recognize the role turkey could play within the eu .
" this short-sighted vision is the major impediment before the idea of the eu as a global actor , capable of assuming greater responsibilities on political and security issues , complementing its economic clout , " the turkish president said .
in his speech , gul also announced that neighboring iran had asked turkey to host another round of talks with un security council members and germany on tehran 's nuclear program , alluding to the diplomatic role his country might play for the eu .
however , turkey 's international activities were also singled out by the eu for veiled criticism on tuesday , after the country defied the us and eu to vote against tougher un sanctions for iran earlier this year .
" turkey 's foreign policy has become more active in its wider neighborhood , " the commission 's report said .
" this is an asset for the european union , provided it is developed as a complement to turkey 's accession process and in coordination with the eu . "

after nearly two days of blocking a nuclear waste storage site , thousands of protestors have been cleared from the area by police and the transport of 11 containers of nuclear waste has arrived at its destination . police cleared thousands of anti-nuclear activists from roads leading to the nuclear storage facility in gorleben , northern germany on tuesday morning , allowing for the final arrival of 123 tons of nuclear waste .
about 3,000 demonstrators staged a 44-hour sit-in in front of the storage site , including high-level politicians such as green party co-chair claudia roth .
activists from the environmentalist organization greenpeace used a truck disguised as a vehicle carrying beer to block the freight train station in nearby dannenberg , where the waste containers were to be moved to trucks for the final 20 kilometers to the storage site .
two greenpeace activists delayed the transport by about 11 hours by encasing themselves in a cement block , making it so the police could not move them without injuring them .
authorities managed to free the activists early tuesday morning , and the first truck carrying the nuclear waste departed dannenberg at around 8:30 a.m.
the last of the trucks arrived at the storage facility at about 9:50 a.m.
bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists held up the trucks carrying the waste for 11 hours stop-and-go traffic large protests have taken place during past nuclear waste transport operations , but none have delayed the shipment of the waste as much as the most recent .
the waste originated from nuclear reactors in germany and was sent to a plant in northern france for reprocessing .
the waste containers , called " castors " -lrb- cask for storage and transport of radioactive material -rrb- , left france by train on friday afternoon , but were quickly stopped by the first blockade of activists on the train tracks .
the following days were a tedious stop-and-go game , as protestors blocked the train tracks and some of the 16,000 police officers mobilized to secure the transport removed them .
protests to continue leaders of the various " citizens ' initiatives " against nuclear power claimed victory on tuesday , despite the successful transport of the nuclear waste , and some vowed to continue protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors succeeded in delaying the transport on historic levels " we 've shown that we 're a force to be reckoned with , " said kerstin rudek , chairwoman of the citizens ' initiative for environmental protection luechow-dannenberg .
matthias miersch , environment spokesman for the opposition social democrats in parliament , said the movement against the nuclear waste transport was a " very impressive demonstration . "
" this was a very clear signal to the government that this atomic energy policy can not go on , " he told phoenix public television .
" politicians have to understand that decisions are being made now that the people are absolutely unable to relate to . "
transport to russia meanwhile munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that germany had negotiated a deal " ready to be signed " to ship nuclear waste originating from an old atomic research facility in former east germany to russia .
the report said a total of 951 nuclear fuel elements from the east german research center dresden-rossendorf , which have been in temporary storage since 2005 , would be shipped to the mayak atomic complex in the southern urals for reprocessing .
the waste would stay in russia for permanent storage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mayak facility in russia is to reprocess east germany 's radioactive waste the report said the basis for the transport deal was a previous agreement between the united states and russia , which regulates the transport of nuclear waste from reactors that were overseen by the soviet union .
germany 's goal was reportedly to " reduce the amount of highly-enriched uranium as much as possible . "
the deal received criticism from the green party , which has profited politically from a strong anti-nuclear sentiment in germany .
" cheap before safe , that 's what this is about , " green party spokeswoman sylvia kotting-uhl told the newspaper .

wittenberg 's grandfather was a rabbi there during the so-called kristallnacht , or night of broken glass .
all throughout germany and austria , jewish homes , business , and synagogues were ransacked and thousands of jews were deported to concentration camps .
now , accompanied by his dog mitzpah , he is carrying the torch by foot and by ferry .
in london , he will use it to symbolically light the eternal flame of a new synagogue for his own congregation .
the three-week project also serves as a fundraiser to support a variety of charities and interfaith projects .
deutsche welle spoke with the rabbi in cologne , at the midway point through his walk .
deutsche welle : rabbi wittenberg , can you tell me where the idea came from to take this walk , and what the journey is really all about ?
jonathan wittenberg : it was really when i was rereading my grandfather 's memoirs , at the 70th anniversary of kristallnacht .
i just wanted to remember what had happened to him .
and i read there how he was called by the gestapo on the 10th of november , on the allegation that he had the keys to the westend synagogue , which he did n't . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rabbi stopped at maria-laach abbey , in germany 's eifel region he wrote that he came to the main synagogue ; the fire brigade was there , and they were doing nothing .
he heard people in the crowd say -lsb- … -rsb- that the interior of the westend synagogue had been destroyed - wrecked and trashed - but that the eternal light -lsb- a constant flame that is lit in every synagogue ; eds . -rsb- was still burning .
and people took that for a miracle .
this spoke to me .
my own synagogue is building a new building .
we 've been working on it for 15 years and it 's nearing completion .
and i had the thought , because i am a lover of walking , of coming to frankfurt , of lighting a symbolic flame , and bringing it back to london to light our new eternal light . so you made ' light ' the subject of your walk ?
i was very struck by this idea , of light that burns despite darkness .
it 's an image that speaks to me in all kinds of ways as a rabbi .
i encounter a lot of darkness people struggle with .
i see the courage of people in facing illness , in facing death .
i also see the courage of people in a political context .
one of the organizations i am supporting on this walk is the parents ' circle , made up of parents who 've lost children on both sides of the israeli-palestinian conflict .
this group of parents , instead of blaming the others , instead of hating , they 're saying , ' well , this is a message that we need understanding . '
tell me about the ' eternal light ' that you are carrying .
how did you get it , and how are you transporting it ?
very simply , it 's an electric torch - a flashlight .
it 's symbolic .
i 'm not an olympic runner , and nobody 's going to let me into a cafe along the way with a great big torch on fire .
but what i did n't want to do was just to come by plane and take the torch and just fly back .
there 's no substance to something like that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the route traverses german wine country the trip began at the westend synagogue on october 24 .
i was there with a group of about 20 people from london who came to share the start of the journey .
the ceremony where i took the light was simple , just a couple of verses : " god is my light , and my salvation . "
one of the people with us was a hazzan -lsb- a singer trained to accompany jewish religious services ; eds . -rsb- who very beautifully sang those verses .
coincidentally , that day was the celebration of the 100-year anniversary of the westend synagogue .
i was invited to speak .
it was very , very moving .
my grandfather - my mother 's father - had been the main rabbi there for almost 30 years .
he died in 1975 .
what do you feel you 've learned about light along the way so far ?
my understanding of the meaning of light is constantly growing and constantly changing .
and just as light expands , so my understanding of it has expanded .
there is the beautiful natural light , while walking along the main and rhine rivers .
and then there is the tremendous amount of kindness i 've met in very ordinary circumstances .
on the second day , i was walking with a friend of mine who is a protestant minister .
i needed something to eat , and we went into a place - it turned out to be in a castle along the hiking trail , a very posh place .
i asked , ' can i have some bread please ? '
and the man came back with a basket of fruit and all kinds of bread .
i took out my purse to pay , and he said , ' no , please take it .
it 's a gift . '
i had n't told him what i was doing but it was obvious that i was somehow … en route .
i 've encountered that kind of kindness all along .
that is a kind of light .
you 're not just trekking on this trip - you 're visiting various religious sites , holding talks with social-interest groups , and visiting jewish monuments .
has that added to your understanding of light ?
yes .
there have been moments of contact with people who are engaged with what was the jewish past in germany .
we stopped in the town of bingen , at the study group for judaism there .
i asked the lady who leads it , ' why do you do this ? '
she was n't jewish , did n't have jewish ancestors .
none of them did .
she said she did it because her father had a close relationship to the jewish community and had been helped by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rabbi stopped at a thai buddhist center along the way have you found anything unexpected so far ?
well , walking in the lower rhineland up to cologne , i 've thought a lot about the shoah , obviously .
but i 've also been conscious that here was a thousand years of jewish creative history .
we were in a tiny village , st. goar .
and in that tiny rhineland village , the sefer ha-maharil , which is a key work in the progression of ashkenazy jewish law , was composed .
it still affects our practices today .
so , i had n't expected to feel such continuity with jewish culture as i have felt - this sense of jewish history , of learning , creativity , and study .
i expected to feel far more estranged .
your grandfather was german , and you speak excellent german although you yourself are english .
has this walk raised any thoughts about your own german ancestry ?
i 've been to germany many times before , but never for this long .
my grandfather loved the german jewish culture .
unlike many , he did n't teach us to hate germany .
he said we should differentiate between nazism and german culture .
i think there are a lot of questions to be asked about whether that differentiation could be made quite as neatly as that .
but that was certainly his attitude , so i have n't had to overcome an inner revulsion to being in germany - i never had it .
and i deeply do n't believe you can blame one generation for what another generation did .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the second fundraising walk wittenberg has taken with his dog , mitzpah but there is no doubt that there is a legacy .
and i think finding ways to face that legacy together as much as possible - you ca n't do it with major perpetrators - but with people who are struggling with what the past has meant to them , i think enabling that kind of conversation is very important .
was being on this trip during kristallnacht , the night of broken glass , part of your plan ?
on november 9 i 'll be in holland , since i 've been asked to speak there .
it would have made more sense to be in germany , but that 's where it worked out .
in any case i definitely wanted to be traveling the route on kristallnacht .
towards the end of the walk i pick up the route of the kindertransporte , -lsb- the name given to the movement to rescue some 10,000 jewish children from the nazis by sending them to live in the uk , just prior to the outbreak of world war ii ; eds . -rsb-
so that 's something i find deeply moving .
i 'm guessing you are something of a strange sight in the german countryside - a rabbi wearing a yarmulke and a backpack , with a dog in tow .
have you gotten some odd reactions ?
not at all - although people do keep stopping me to tell me that the flashlight in my backpack has been left on .
they do n't know i 've done it on purpose .

but fighting was still reported in some areas tuesday leading to fresh uncertainties over the outlook after the fighting in the border town of myawaddy had left several dead and injured . the ethnic karen militia fighters had been told to join a border patrol force .
while some have agreed , a faction of the democratic karen buddhist army or dkba is resisting .
late tuesday mywaddy town was reported back under control of the army .
aid group says situation at the border remains unstable several ethnic armies have ceasefire pacts with myanmar ’ s military .
but several others , such as the karen , wa , and shan among others have refused to lay down their weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar refugees are on their way to a pier in thailand to go home leonard buckles , a spokesman with the refugee aid group thailand burma border consortium , says while people have returned over the border the outlook remained uncertain : " people that came in last night in three pagodas pass went back to burma today .
but now they are coming back out so it ’ s a very flux situation in terms of people not staying permanently inside thailand .
so it ’ s hard to say really when it might resolve itself .
i think it ’ s going to be people coming and going for the next couple of weeks . "
army-backed party claims victory the return of the refugees came as myanmar ’ s main pro-military party , the union solidarity and development party , said tuesday it had won up to 80 percent of the parliamentary seats in the weekend elections .
sunai pasuk , a spokesman for the new york-based human rights watch , says the fighting between militias and myanmar ’ s armed forces reflects growing pressures on border ceasefire groups to lay down weapons and join the border guards under the army ’ s control : " this alliance is breaking down , falling apart .
on the other hand we have groups who will continue to fight so again this reaffirms the current speculation that this situation pre- and post election are pretty much the same .
the election will not be able to bring any stability to the country because there is no sincerity to give power back to the people including the ethnic population . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the karen minority in myanmar sunai says an absence of real reconciliation and participation for myanmar ’ s ethnic populations in the political process is set to leave the border regions unstable .
experts say more violence is yet to come political scientist at chulalongkorn university , thitinan pongsudhirak , agrees the outlook for myanmar ’ s border regions is one of violence and conflict : " it is highly likely we will see prolonged conflict now – renewed civil war between ethnic armies along the minority groups and the burmese military .
the military will also feel emboldened by having this election but at the same time paranoid and vulnerable because they ’ ve had elections and they will have to transfer power – so they ’ re likely to clamp down on the ethnic armies . "
thitinan says increased conflict has wide ranging regional implications with a humanitarian crisis set to lead to increased illegal drug trafficking and more refugees fleeing into thailand for safety .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 09.11.2010 iea predicts oil prices will more than double by 2035 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iea wants countries to change the way they consume oil the international energy agency has called for oil subsidies to be eradicated as it predicts that oil demand and prices will rise in the next 25 years , despite a push towards green energy . the international energy agency has warned that governments need to do more to increase efficiency and boost green technologies to meet a forecasted 36 percent jump in energy demand between 2008 and 2035 .
the agency , the energy arm of the organization for economic cooperation and development , a grouping of the world 's richest nations , forecast that global oil demand will rise to 99 million barrels a day by 2035 , some 15 million barrels a day higher than last year .
" the message is clear , the price will go up , especially if consuming countries do not make changes in the way they consume oil , especially in the transport sector , " the iea 's chief economist and lead author of the report , fatih birol told reuters in an interview .
oil prices will exceed $ 200 -lrb- 144 euro -rrb- a barrel by 2035 , and will likely stay over $ 100 a barrel after 2015 , the report said .
on tuesday the price of oil stood at roughly $ 87 a barrel .
china drives demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace wants even more emphasis on renewables china and other emerging economies are driving demand for oil higher .
" all the net growth comes from non-oecd countries , almost half from china alone , mainly driven by rising use of transport fuels , " the iea said in the report .
oil subsidies were limiting the scope for higher prices to choke off demand and change consumer habits , the iea said , and called for oil subsidies to be reduced .
" if subsidy policy does not change , with increasing price assumptions , these $ 312 billion in subsidies for 2009 will reach $ 600 billion in 2015 .
that 's huge , " birol said .
the report estimated that renewable energy only receives $ 57 billion in subsidies , a fraction of the ongoing support for the fossil fuel sector .
eradicating fossil fuel subsidies would boost the global economy , environment and energy security , the iea said , referring to a pledge made by g20 countries .
g20 leaders committed in pittsburgh in 2009 to phase out , over the medium-term , inefficient fossil fuel subsidies which distort the energy market and encourage wasteful consumption .
a g20 meeting in seoul this week may update progress on fossil fuels . greenpeace welcomed the iea 's call to cut the $ 312 billion in global fossil fuel subsidies .
" the iea report clearly states that fossil fuels are heavily subsidized … leading to unfair competition with clean and climate friendly renewable energies .
we welcome that renewables are now in the focus of the 2010 edition , " said sven teske , renewable energy director at greenpeace international , in a press release .
gas glut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surplus of gas may hinder development in renewable energy the future of renewable energy depended on strong government support , said the iea report , especially given an expected " ten year glut in gas " which would suppress fossil fuel power prices and make renewables look even less competitive .
" the gas glut will be with us ten more years , " birol told reuters .
" cheaper gas prices will put additional pressure on renewable energies especially in the us and europe .
if natural gas is as plenty and cheap as we think , then life for renewables will be even more difficult , " he added although greenpeace praised the iea for making renewable energy more prominent in this year 's report , teske from greenpeace international criticized the iea 's emphasis on other energy sources such as nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- for coal power stations .
" the iea is failing to shift technology recommendations from unproven , dangerous and expensive technologies such as ccs and nuclear power plants , " teske said .
greenpeace would like to see more emphasis on renewable energy and greater efficiency to reduce co2 emissions .

but fighting was still reported in some areas tuesday leading to fresh uncertainties over the outlook after the fighting in the border town of myawaddy had left several dead and injured . the ethnic karen militia fighters had been told to join a border patrol force .
while some have agreed , a faction of the democratic karen buddhist army or dkba is resisting .
late tuesday mywaddy town was reported back under control of the army .
aid group says situation at the border remains unstable several ethnic armies have ceasefire pacts with myanmar ’ s military .
but several others , such as the karen , wa , and shan among others have refused to lay down their weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar refugees are on their way to a pier in thailand to go home leonard buckles , a spokesman with the refugee aid group thailand burma border consortium , says while people have returned over the border the outlook remained uncertain : " people that came in last night in three pagodas pass went back to burma today .
but now they are coming back out so it ’ s a very flux situation in terms of people not staying permanently inside thailand .
so it ’ s hard to say really when it might resolve itself .
i think it ’ s going to be people coming and going for the next couple of weeks . "
army-backed party claims victory the return of the refugees came as myanmar ’ s main pro-military party , the union solidarity and development party , said tuesday it had won up to 80 percent of the parliamentary seats in the weekend elections .
sunai pasuk , a spokesman for the new york-based human rights watch , says the fighting between militias and myanmar ’ s armed forces reflects growing pressures on border ceasefire groups to lay down weapons and join the border guards under the army ’ s control : " this alliance is breaking down , falling apart .
on the other hand we have groups who will continue to fight so again this reaffirms the current speculation that this situation pre- and post election are pretty much the same .
the election will not be able to bring any stability to the country because there is no sincerity to give power back to the people including the ethnic population . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the karen minority in myanmar sunai says an absence of real reconciliation and participation for myanmar ’ s ethnic populations in the political process is set to leave the border regions unstable .
experts say more violence is yet to come political scientist at chulalongkorn university , thitinan pongsudhirak , agrees the outlook for myanmar ’ s border regions is one of violence and conflict : " it is highly likely we will see prolonged conflict now – renewed civil war between ethnic armies along the minority groups and the burmese military .
the military will also feel emboldened by having this election but at the same time paranoid and vulnerable because they ’ ve had elections and they will have to transfer power – so they ’ re likely to clamp down on the ethnic armies . "
thitinan says increased conflict has wide ranging regional implications with a humanitarian crisis set to lead to increased illegal drug trafficking and more refugees fleeing into thailand for safety .

the agency , the energy arm of the organization for economic cooperation and development , a grouping of the world 's richest nations , forecast that global oil demand will rise to 99 million barrels a day by 2035 , some 15 million barrels a day higher than last year .
" the message is clear , the price will go up , especially if consuming countries do not make changes in the way they consume oil , especially in the transport sector , " the iea 's chief economist and lead author of the report , fatih birol told reuters in an interview .
oil prices will exceed $ 200 -lrb- 144 euro -rrb- a barrel by 2035 , and will likely stay over $ 100 a barrel after 2015 , the report said .
on tuesday the price of oil stood at roughly $ 87 a barrel .
china drives demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace wants even more emphasis on renewables china and other emerging economies are driving demand for oil higher .
" all the net growth comes from non-oecd countries , almost half from china alone , mainly driven by rising use of transport fuels , " the iea said in the report .
oil subsidies were limiting the scope for higher prices to choke off demand and change consumer habits , the iea said , and called for oil subsidies to be reduced .
" if subsidy policy does not change , with increasing price assumptions , these $ 312 billion in subsidies for 2009 will reach $ 600 billion in 2015 .
that 's huge , " birol said .
the report estimated that renewable energy only receives $ 57 billion in subsidies , a fraction of the ongoing support for the fossil fuel sector .
eradicating fossil fuel subsidies would boost the global economy , environment and energy security , the iea said , referring to a pledge made by g20 countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 09.11.2010 international conference highlights continuing scourge of cluster bombs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unexploded cluster bomblets can remain hidden for years three months after the landmark convention on cluster munitions came into force , government officials and campaigners are meeting in laos for talks aimed to add impetus to the global campaign for a ban on cluster bombs . more than 1,000 politicians from over 100 states , which have signed up to the convention , join charity workers and survivors in the laotian capital of vientiane beginning on tuesday .
the delegates are meeting at the first global conference on cluster bombs since the pact became international law on august 1 , 2010 . the conference , which runs through november 12 , aims to give impetus to the convention 's target of ridding the world of cluster bombs .
the meeting is being described as a " defining moment " in the campaign to persuade governments the world over to stop producing and using the weapons which continue to kill and wound tens of thousands of people around the globe long after they have been dropped . the effect of cluster bombs can be seen and felt for decades after their use in an initial conflict .
the land or air deployed munitions , which split open before impact with the ground , scatter multiple bomblets over a wide area , many of which fail to explode . these unexploded cylindrical bomblets can be mistaken for batteries or balls and have caused horrific injuries and death to children who stumble across them .
over time , the bomblets can become buried , posing an equal risk to farmers and other civilians . vietnam war leaves laos crippled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bomblets have made areas of the world uninhabitable the convention on cluster munitions hopes to force nations into destroying their existing stockpiles of cluster bombs and prohibiting the creations of new ones .
it prohibits all use , stockpiling , production and transfer of cluster weapons and places the responsibility of financial support and other assistance to clean up the explosives on its signatories . a total of 108 nations have signed the convention and more than 40 have ratified it , making them full parties .
of those signatories , 74 still have stockpiles of cluster bombs .
but about 20 countries have already destroyed or are eliminating them , according to the landmine and cluster munition monitor , a non-governmental monitoring project . " cluster munitions can no longer be seen as legitimate weapons , " said steve goose , director of the arms division at human rights watch and co-chair of the cluster munition coalition -lrb- cmc -rrb- .
" no country , even one that has not yet joined the ban convention , should contemplate using these indiscriminate weapons , and certainly no country that has joined should contemplate helping someone else use them . " laos was chosen as the location for the conference due to its unwanted title of the most heavily cluster bombed nation on earth per capita .
the war in neighboring vietnam , which expanded to areas of laos , saw over two million tons of ordnance dropped on the south east asian nation by us forces between 1964 and 1973 . cluster bombs were used in the heavy bombing of both countries , with an estimated 270 million cluster bomblets spread across laos , according to the country 's national regulatory authority -lrb- nra -rrb- .
the nra estimates that 30 percent of those bomblets failed to explode , leaving around 25 percent of the entire country contaminated with unexploded ordnance .
it claims that one person per day is either killed or injured by vietnam war-era cluster bombs . according to data by the landmine and cluster munition monitor , confirmed deaths and injuries from cluster bombs have also been recorded in high numbers in iraq , afghanistan and lebanon - all countries which have in recent years experienced or continue to experience large-scale conflicts . major manufacturers refuse to sign " fifteen former producers of cluster munitions foreswore production when they joined the convention on cluster munitions , " cmc coordinator thomas nash told deutsche welle .
" seventeen countries continue production or reserve the right to produce the weapons in the future , including major producers like china , india , israel , pakistan , russia and the us , who are all non-signatories . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major nations continue to build and use cluster bombs since world war two , at least 18 government armed forces have used cluster bombs in 39 countries and disputed territories , nash said . " the united states , russia and israel have been the largest users of the weapons in the past decade , " he said . israel has used cluster bombs in its wars with militants in lebanon since 1978 , while russia used them in the second chechen war in 1999 and is accused of using them in its war with georgia in 2008 . in addition to the vietnam war , the us has used cluster bombs in afghanistan since 2001 , in air campaigns in iraq since the first gulf war in 1990 and - along with britain - in nato 's bombing campaign against yugoslavia in 1999 . the laos conference organizers do not expect any of the major non-signatory countries to send delegations as observers . " although a large number of european countries produced and stockpiled cluster bombs in the past , most have now given up the weapon , " nash added .
" a handful of former soviet bloc nations are the only european countries that continue to produce the weapon including poland , romania and slovakia . " us under pressure to sign despite not being a signatory , the us does support a number of non-governmental organizations in their efforts to clean up cluster bombs around the world .
human rights watch said that washington has pumped an estimated $ 2 million per year into clearing bomblets in laos , while still continuing to manufacture the weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us continues to use cluster bombs in its conflicts however , as a non-signatory country , the us finds itself in a quandary when it comes to dealing with allies who have signed up .
the convention forbids any signatory from helping a non-signatory nation transport cluster munitions .
this means those european nations who are both convention signatories and nato partners with the us are legally bound not to refuel trucks or planes carrying these weapons for the us . " countries committed to eradicating these brutal weapons need to make clear that no country should be allowed an exception to assist with the use of cluster munitions or other banned activities , " said bonnie docherty , senior arms division researcher at human rights watch , in a statement . " those that support the ban need to interpret it and carry it out in a comprehensive way to end the humanitarian harm caused by cluster munitions , " she said .
" this means explicitly prohibiting assistance to other countries with activities banned by the convention . " rapid implementation crucial to saving lives according to the cmc 's nash , the convention is rapidly having a positive effect .
seven signatories have already destroyed their stockpiles , with another 11 in the process of doing so .
clean up campaigns are gathering pace and donors are injecting increasingly large amounts of cash into countries struggling to rid themselves of the destructive legacy left behind from cluster bombing . " the convention is emerging as the clear global standard on cluster munitions and we are seeing that even countries that have n't joined the treaty can not simply carry on using the weapons in armed conflicts , given the weapons ' indiscriminate effect and grave humanitarian impact both at the time of use and for years after the armed conflict ends , " nash said .
" we believe that as more countries get on board the ban , this stigmatization will increase and the market for exporting cluster munitions will dry up . " campaigners hope that the laos conference will speed up the process of destroying munitions and cleaning up territories affected by them while also encouraging new nations to join . delegates are expected to hammer out a concrete plan of action to implement the treaty and save lives .
among the tangible outcomes expected from the conference will be a political avowal - the vientiane declaration - that reaffirms the global commitment to eradicate cluster bombs and end the harm they have caused . author : nick amies editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in krakow , a museum and memorial recently opened in schindler 's former factory . an industrial complex in krakow is hardly the usual place to find hordes of tourists .
however in this part of the city , tourist buses line the streets - and it 's all because this is the location of oskar schindler 's factory .
the american film director steven spielberg made the factory famous in 1993 when he filmed parts of his oscar-winning film " schindler 's list " at the factory .
the story follows schindler as he tries to save his jewish workforce from nazi persecution and the concentration camps .
until recently , people had to peer through the locked gates to get a look at the factory .
but as of this summer , the building is now open to all visitors .
the krakow authorities have converted the factory into a museum , which is currently housing an exhibition called " krakow : occupation 1939-1945 , " examining life during nazi rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the success of spielberg 's film drew visitors to schindler 's krakow factory the exhibition shows the history of oskar schindler himself , and his workers .
curator monika bednarek said while schindler is the " main protagonist " of the exhibition , " he 's not the only one . "
the exhibition also charts the nazi occupation as a whole , and puts the fate of the jewish workers in schindler 's factory into context .
schindler 's place in history oskar schindler lived from 1908 to 1974 , and was the son of an industrialist .
in 1939 , after the occupation of poland by nazi germany , schindler acquired an enamel factory which had previously been in jewish hands .
the factory produced tin ware and later shells and detonators for the war effort .
schindler directly benefitted from the so-called ' ayranization ' of jewish factories and businesses , and as the war progressed he made a fortune on the black market .
despite his nazi membership , schindler became increasingly concerned about the cruel fate of his jewish workforce .
he added 1,200 workers to his famous list , labeling them ' essential ' to the war effort .
by doing so , he saved them from certain death at a nazi concentration camp .
after the war , schindler 's enamel factory became state-owned and was converted for use by a telecommunications company .
in 2002 it was abandoned , only to be bought by the city council three years later .
" the council decided to turn it into a museum , " said bednarek .
with the help of eu funding , the building was renovated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial is filled with original tin ware from schindler 's factory modern exhibits entice young visitors the exhibition begins in the krakow of the 1930s with a range of photos - such as women walking in the city and jews on the way to the synagogue .
" first of all we see the history before the war , so we can understand what happened during the war , " explained bendarek .
then the exhibits chart the outbreak of war , as german soldiers marched through poland on september 6 , 1939 .
there 's even a reconstruction of the jewish ghetto .
with the help of touch-screen displays , life-size murals and multimedia exhibits , the history of the period is brought to life .
the curators hope these types of techniques will help appeal to younger visitors .
" with this technology we can reach young people , " said grzegorz jezowski , who helped put together the exhibition .
" it makes it more attractive for them . "
a memorial to oskar schindler schindler himself only features quite briefly in the exhibition .
his story is told through photos , original documents and furniture from the factory .
in the middle of one room is a giant transparent cube , filled with tin pots , bowls and plates that were produced in schindler 's factory .
the instillation is meant to represent the history of the entrepreneur and his workers .
in the center hang the names of around 1,200 jewish workers whose lives were saved by schindler .

these types of ultra-high-speed smash-ups at the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- are an attempt to re-create the explosion , known as the big bang , which is believed to have begun the universe .
as spokeswoman barbara warmbein told the associated press , the cern experiment over the weekend produced " a very , very , very small bang . "
lead ions are lead atoms whose electrons have been removed , and are much heavier than the protons that the researchers had been using .
that may be beneficial , as the energy required to smash them is higher , and thus may be closer to the conditions the scientists are trying to analyze .
as the research continues , scientists are trying to create " quark-gluon plasma , " an extremely hot and dense type of matter that may unlock some secrets in the early universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lead ion experiments will continue until cern shuts down for the winter on december 6 " the experiments are already providing an exciting glimpse of the new frontier , " sergio bertolucci , cern 's director for research and computing , told afp news agency .
major breakthroughs ' could take years ' the lhc is comprised of a circular , 27-kilometer -lrb- 17-mile -rrb- atom-smasher that cost four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- to build near geneva .
it began operations in september 2008 .
beyond pushing the limits of particle physics , the team is also exploring the frontier of data storage and transfer .
cern is currently using 140 computer centers spread across 34 countries to back up and analyze its data , which is being transferred at peak rates of 10 gigabytes per second , or the equivalent of approximately two dvds per second .
still , warmbein added that it will likely be months , if not years , before cern scientists make any major breakthroughs .

in a report detailing the findings of its seven-month long probe into the business of bluefin tuna fishing , the international consortium of investigative journalists -lrb- icij -rrb- has unveiled a culture of over-exploitation , tacitly approved by government authorities .
the report details systematic over-fishing , falsely reported catch volumes , ignored bans of spotter planes to track down schools of tuna and illegal sales of national quotas from one vessel to another .
all told , the investigation paints a bleak picture in which thousands of tons of fish were illegally hauled between 1998 and 2007 - as many as one in every three bluefin tuna may have been caught illegally during this period .
the report also unveils a complex network of fishing fleets , farms , ministries and distributors from countries such as france , spain , italy , turkey and japan involved in the creation of a flourishing black market trade .
the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- said the inquiry had confirmed its repeated warnings of widespread illegalities .
" no consumer , no business , no government can be sure they are dealing with responsibly caught and traded bluefin tuna , " sergi tudela , head of fisheries at wwf mediterranean said in a statement .
" the whole chain is tarnished . "
parallels to the drug trade bildunterschrift : quotas for tuna are being flouted and authorities are looking away , investigators say .
eastern atlantic bluefin tuna are a catch in more than one sense of the word .
one large tuna , which can be three meters long and weigh more than 500 kilos , can fetch as much as 71,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- on the japanese market , the source of most of the world 's demand for tuna .
as marine biologist , daniel pauly told the icij , the promise of a slice of such wealth is too enticing for many to resist .
" fisheries are one of the most criminalized sectors in the world , " pauly said .
" this generates so much money that it 's like drugs . "
the report said the black market trade in tuna was worth at least $ 4 billion -lrb- 2.9 billion euros -rrb- between 1998 and 2007 .
while mostly taking aim at suppliers and the governments that turned a blind eye to their exporters ' behaviour , the report also reveals how japanese dealers evaded tuna quotas by importing tuna as another species of fish , only to re-label them as tuna at market . as the demand for the fish has grown , the industry has evolved in an increasingly detrimental way .
tuna farms have sprung up throughout the mediterranean , fishermen regularly plunder stocks in spawning areas and more boats – often subsidised at taxpayers ' expense – have been put to sea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the demand for tuna stems from japan , though fishing occurs internationally fish stocks dwindling the report singles out the burgeoning practice of purse-seining - in which entire schools of fish are encircled by vast nets and dragged to farms to be harvested .
as a consequence , numbers of bluefin tuna , which play a crucial role at the top of the marine food chain , have plummeted by almost three quarters over the past four decades , while the size of the average captured bluefin tuna has almost halved .
" if we want to continue being able to fish bluefin tuna at all , we need to backtrack 20 years , " gemma parkes , a spokeswoman for wwf mediterranean , told deutsche welle .
the extent of the problem first surfaced in 2007 when france was revealed to have caught almost twice the quota it is allowed under the international commission for the conservation of the atlantic tunas -lrb- iccat -rrb- – the tuna fishing industry 's watchdog .
the fishermen involved in the case were charged , and the regulatory body responded by introducing a new system , known as the bluefin tuna catch document -lrb- bcd -rrb- , to help monitor catch sizes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 09.11.2010 werder bremen have gone from heavyweights to sparring partners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conceding goals has been an all too regular occurence for werder this year for years , bremen have been a model of consistency , stability and harmony .
but with this season already a likely write-off , even hardcore fans are calling for some major changes on the river weser . if there was any small consolation for bremen after their 6-0 thrashing by stuttgart on sunday , it was that the scoreline could have been worse .
after all , goalkeeper tim wiese had saved a penalty in the 60th minute .
but wiese remained disconsolate .
" the way we played here was embarrassing , " the keeper told reporters after the match .
" i 'm ashamed of us , and every one else should be ashamed as well . "
it was werder 's second straight league loss after an unexpected home to defeat to nuremberg in round 10 .
coach thomas schaaf took refuge in gallows humor .
" we were a good sparring partner , " schaaf told the press .
" that 's an opponent you invite to your training camp , when you want to stay fit .
it was like in practice , and that 's not enough for a competitive match . "
werder are currently eleventh in the table , 15 points behind leaders dortmund .
the team has been in similar positions before , but rarely have things looked so black for the men in green .
in 2008-9 , bremen stumbled to tenth place in the bundesliga but salvaged their season by reaching the final of the europa league and winning the german cup .
this year , they are already out of the cup and adrift at the bottom of their champions league group .
werder have qualified for international competition every year since 2004 and have missed the champions league only once , making them germany 's second most successful team .
nonetheless , the problems they are currently encountering have been in the making for some time .
achilles ' heel bildunterschrift : silvestre is one of the main problems in a terrible defense werder have always conceded more goals than the other top german teams but have thrived because they also scored more .
that 's down to the style favored by schaaf , which features the defenders pushed relatively far upfield .
but after 11 matches this season , bremen have already conceded 27 goals .
by way of comparison , werder 's season average for the past six campaigns is 41.5 .
schaaf and company have sorely missed central defender naldo , who 's out indefinitely while recovering from an operation to combat necrosis of the knee .
neither sebastian proedl nor mikael silvestre has been an adequate replacement , and germany international per mertesacker has been unable to compensate .
werder 's goal production – 19 – is also down , which has something to do with the hole left behind by mesut oezil , who left this summer for real madrid .
aaron hunt , a converted striker , has not been able to fill the playmaker role , and new acquisition wesley has been forced to play in the back four .
as a relatively low-budget club by top european standards , bremen are used to losing star players .
schaaf and commercial manager klaus allofs have always shown a remarkable knack for finding replacements .
not this season , though , and that 's causing some major friction in the werder family .
fussing and feuding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaaf and allofs are no longer beyond criticism schaaf and allofs have been running things at werder since 1999 , a unique record of longevity in the hire- ‘ em-fire- ‘ em bundesliga , and harmony has been the rule in their eleven-year tenure .
but questionable personnel decisions and curious management reactions have created an atmosphere of conflict .
disappointed with the team 's early form , allofs took the strange step of freezing players ' wages earlier this season .
that created a climate of tension that may have emerged when striker marko arnautovic reportedly hurled an obscenity in allofs ' direction after being substituted out in bremen 's most recent champions league loss .
the serbian-austrian is known for his mercurial temperament , and many fans questioned the decision to acquire him this summer .
but that 's nothing compared to the outrage directed at the 33-year-old silvestre .
the frenchman was brought in despite coming off a horrible year with arsenal and is , according to the grades handed out by kicker magazine , by far and away the worst defender in the bundesliga .
he was roundly booed after the nuremberg match , an understandable reaction from disappointed ticket-holders .
but schaaf subsequently went on local radio accusing supporters of not being “ real fans . ”
and that has the werder faithful up in arms .
" werder bremen is suffering from the arrogance and vanity of schaaf and allofs , " wrote one enraged user on the fanszene-bremen internet forum .
" these gentlemen have lost touch after having so much success and being treated with kid gloves by the media .
criticism , including boos , is interpreted as an insult to their royal highnesses . "
a fellow supporter , writing on a different platform , concurred .
" here everyone blames a team that is playing badly , " the user opined on forum.werder.de.
" that 's one issue .
another one is that klaus allofs is n't capable of buying reasonable players and thomas schaaf has been unable to form them into a reasonable team . "
a couple of wins would probably be enough to silence the voices of dissent , and bremen get a chance to make amends on saturday when they host frankfurt – a team they 'd expect to beat most seasons .
but this season is anything but typical .
frankfurt are riding high in fourth place , while werder bremen are facing a potential relegation fight – and an ill-tempered debate about the future of the club .

after nearly two days of blocking a nuclear waste storage site , thousands of protestors have been cleared from the area by police and the transport of 11 containers of nuclear waste has arrived at its destination . police cleared thousands of anti-nuclear activists from roads leading to the nuclear storage facility in gorleben , northern germany on tuesday morning , allowing for the final arrival of 123 tons of nuclear waste .
about 3,000 demonstrators staged a 44-hour sit-in in front of the storage site , including high-level politicians such as green party co-chair claudia roth .
activists from the environmentalist organization greenpeace used a truck disguised as a vehicle carrying beer to block the freight train station in nearby dannenberg , where the waste containers were to be moved to trucks for the final 20 kilometers to the storage site .
two greenpeace activists delayed the transport by about 11 hours by encasing themselves in a cement block , making it so the police could not move them without injuring them .
authorities managed to free the activists early tuesday morning , and the first truck carrying the nuclear waste departed dannenberg at around 8:30 a.m.
the last of the trucks arrived at the storage facility at about 9:50 a.m.
bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists held up the trucks carrying the waste for 11 hours stop-and-go traffic large protests have taken place during past nuclear waste transport operations , but none have delayed the shipment of the waste as much as the most recent .
the waste originated from nuclear reactors in germany and was sent to a plant in northern france for reprocessing .
the waste containers , called " castors " -lrb- cask for storage and transport of radioactive material -rrb- , left france by train on friday afternoon , but were quickly stopped by the first blockade of activists on the train tracks .
the following days were a tedious stop-and-go game , as protestors blocked the train tracks and some of the 16,000 police officers mobilized to secure the transport removed them .
protests to continue leaders of the various " citizens ' initiatives " against nuclear power claimed victory on tuesday , despite the successful transport of the nuclear waste , and some vowed to continue protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors succeeded in delaying the transport on historic levels " we 've shown that we 're a force to be reckoned with , " said kerstin rudek , chairwoman of the citizens ' initiative for environmental protection luechow-dannenberg .
matthias miersch , environment spokesman for the opposition social democrats in parliament , said the movement against the nuclear waste transport was a " very impressive demonstration . "
" this was a very clear signal to the government that this atomic energy policy can not go on , " he told phoenix public television .
" politicians have to understand that decisions are being made now that the people are absolutely unable to relate to . "
transport to russia meanwhile munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that germany had negotiated a deal " ready to be signed " to ship nuclear waste originating from an old atomic research facility in former east germany to russia .
the report said a total of 951 nuclear fuel elements from the east german research center dresden-rossendorf , which have been in temporary storage since 2005 , would be shipped to the mayak atomic complex in the southern urals for reprocessing .
the waste would stay in russia for permanent storage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mayak facility in russia is to reprocess east germany 's radioactive waste the report said the basis for the transport deal was a previous agreement between the united states and russia , which regulates the transport of nuclear waste from reactors that were overseen by the soviet union .
germany 's goal was reportedly to " reduce the amount of highly-enriched uranium as much as possible . "
the deal received criticism from the green party , which has profited politically from a strong anti-nuclear sentiment in germany .
" cheap before safe , that 's what this is about , " green party spokeswoman sylvia kotting-uhl told the newspaper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 09.11.2010 on pogrom anniversary , rabbi carries torch from germany to england großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wittenberg is spending three weeks on the road - with a flashlight and his dog on the 72nd anniversary of a major nazi pogrom against the jews , a british rabbi is embarking on a symbolic journey , carrying a flame from his grandfather 's synagogue in frankfurt to his own in london . rabbi jonathan wittenberg has lit a symbolic torch from the " everlasting light " of the westend synagogue in frankfurt , which inexplicably survived the destruction of the nazis on november 9 , 1938 .
wittenberg 's grandfather was a rabbi there during the so-called kristallnacht , or night of broken glass .
all throughout germany and austria , jewish homes , business , and synagogues were ransacked and thousands of jews were deported to concentration camps .
now , accompanied by his dog mitzpah , he is carrying the torch by foot and by ferry .
in london , he will use it to symbolically light the eternal flame of a new synagogue for his own congregation .
the three-week project also serves as a fundraiser to support a variety of charities and interfaith projects .
deutsche welle spoke with the rabbi in cologne , at the midway point through his walk .
deutsche welle : rabbi wittenberg , can you tell me where the idea came from to take this walk , and what the journey is really all about ?
jonathan wittenberg : it was really when i was rereading my grandfather 's memoirs , at the 70th anniversary of kristallnacht .
i just wanted to remember what had happened to him .
and i read there how he was called by the gestapo on the 10th of november , on the allegation that he had the keys to the westend synagogue , which he did n't . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rabbi stopped at maria-laach abbey , in germany 's eifel region he wrote that he came to the main synagogue ; the fire brigade was there , and they were doing nothing .
he heard people in the crowd say -lsb- … -rsb- that the interior of the westend synagogue had been destroyed - wrecked and trashed - but that the eternal light -lsb- a constant flame that is lit in every synagogue ; eds . -rsb- was still burning .
and people took that for a miracle .
this spoke to me .
my own synagogue is building a new building .
we 've been working on it for 15 years and it 's nearing completion .
and i had the thought , because i am a lover of walking , of coming to frankfurt , of lighting a symbolic flame , and bringing it back to london to light our new eternal light . so you made ' light ' the subject of your walk ?
i was very struck by this idea , of light that burns despite darkness .
it 's an image that speaks to me in all kinds of ways as a rabbi .
i encounter a lot of darkness people struggle with .
i see the courage of people in facing illness , in facing death .
i also see the courage of people in a political context .
one of the organizations i am supporting on this walk is the parents ' circle , made up of parents who 've lost children on both sides of the israeli-palestinian conflict .
this group of parents , instead of blaming the others , instead of hating , they 're saying , ' well , this is a message that we need understanding . '
tell me about the ' eternal light ' that you are carrying .
how did you get it , and how are you transporting it ?
very simply , it 's an electric torch - a flashlight .
it 's symbolic .
i 'm not an olympic runner , and nobody 's going to let me into a cafe along the way with a great big torch on fire .
but what i did n't want to do was just to come by plane and take the torch and just fly back .
there 's no substance to something like that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the route traverses german wine country the trip began at the westend synagogue on october 24 .
i was there with a group of about 20 people from london who came to share the start of the journey .
the ceremony where i took the light was simple , just a couple of verses : " god is my light , and my salvation . "
one of the people with us was a hazzan -lsb- a singer trained to accompany jewish religious services ; eds . -rsb- who very beautifully sang those verses .
coincidentally , that day was the celebration of the 100-year anniversary of the westend synagogue .
i was invited to speak .
it was very , very moving .
my grandfather - my mother 's father - had been the main rabbi there for almost 30 years .
he died in 1975 .
what do you feel you 've learned about light along the way so far ?
my understanding of the meaning of light is constantly growing and constantly changing .
and just as light expands , so my understanding of it has expanded .
there is the beautiful natural light , while walking along the main and rhine rivers .
and then there is the tremendous amount of kindness i 've met in very ordinary circumstances .
on the second day , i was walking with a friend of mine who is a protestant minister .
i needed something to eat , and we went into a place - it turned out to be in a castle along the hiking trail , a very posh place .
i asked , ' can i have some bread please ? '
and the man came back with a basket of fruit and all kinds of bread .
i took out my purse to pay , and he said , ' no , please take it .
it 's a gift . '
i had n't told him what i was doing but it was obvious that i was somehow … en route .
i 've encountered that kind of kindness all along .
that is a kind of light .
you 're not just trekking on this trip - you 're visiting various religious sites , holding talks with social-interest groups , and visiting jewish monuments .
has that added to your understanding of light ?
yes .
there have been moments of contact with people who are engaged with what was the jewish past in germany .
we stopped in the town of bingen , at the study group for judaism there .
i asked the lady who leads it , ' why do you do this ? '
she was n't jewish , did n't have jewish ancestors .
none of them did .
she said she did it because her father had a close relationship to the jewish community and had been helped by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rabbi stopped at a thai buddhist center along the way have you found anything unexpected so far ?
well , walking in the lower rhineland up to cologne , i 've thought a lot about the shoah , obviously .
but i 've also been conscious that here was a thousand years of jewish creative history .
we were in a tiny village , st. goar .
and in that tiny rhineland village , the sefer ha-maharil , which is a key work in the progression of ashkenazy jewish law , was composed .
it still affects our practices today .
so , i had n't expected to feel such continuity with jewish culture as i have felt - this sense of jewish history , of learning , creativity , and study .
i expected to feel far more estranged .
your grandfather was german , and you speak excellent german although you yourself are english .
has this walk raised any thoughts about your own german ancestry ?
i 've been to germany many times before , but never for this long .
my grandfather loved the german jewish culture .
unlike many , he did n't teach us to hate germany .
he said we should differentiate between nazism and german culture .
i think there are a lot of questions to be asked about whether that differentiation could be made quite as neatly as that .
but that was certainly his attitude , so i have n't had to overcome an inner revulsion to being in germany - i never had it .
and i deeply do n't believe you can blame one generation for what another generation did .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the second fundraising walk wittenberg has taken with his dog , mitzpah but there is no doubt that there is a legacy .
and i think finding ways to face that legacy together as much as possible - you ca n't do it with major perpetrators - but with people who are struggling with what the past has meant to them , i think enabling that kind of conversation is very important .
was being on this trip during kristallnacht , the night of broken glass , part of your plan ?
on november 9 i 'll be in holland , since i 've been asked to speak there .
it would have made more sense to be in germany , but that 's where it worked out .
in any case i definitely wanted to be traveling the route on kristallnacht .
towards the end of the walk i pick up the route of the kindertransporte , -lsb- the name given to the movement to rescue some 10,000 jewish children from the nazis by sending them to live in the uk , just prior to the outbreak of world war ii ; eds . -rsb-
so that 's something i find deeply moving .
i 'm guessing you are something of a strange sight in the german countryside - a rabbi wearing a yarmulke and a backpack , with a dog in tow .
have you gotten some odd reactions ?
not at all - although people do keep stopping me to tell me that the flashlight in my backpack has been left on .
they do n't know i 've done it on purpose .

wittenberg 's grandfather was a rabbi there during the so-called kristallnacht , or night of broken glass .
all throughout germany and austria , jewish homes , business , and synagogues were ransacked and thousands of jews were deported to concentration camps .
now , accompanied by his dog mitzpah , he is carrying the torch by foot and by ferry .
in london , he will use it to symbolically light the eternal flame of a new synagogue for his own congregation .
the three-week project also serves as a fundraiser to support a variety of charities and interfaith projects .
deutsche welle spoke with the rabbi in cologne , at the midway point through his walk .
deutsche welle : rabbi wittenberg , can you tell me where the idea came from to take this walk , and what the journey is really all about ?
jonathan wittenberg : it was really when i was rereading my grandfather 's memoirs , at the 70th anniversary of kristallnacht .
i just wanted to remember what had happened to him .
and i read there how he was called by the gestapo on the 10th of november , on the allegation that he had the keys to the westend synagogue , which he did n't . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rabbi stopped at maria-laach abbey , in germany 's eifel region he wrote that he came to the main synagogue ; the fire brigade was there , and they were doing nothing .
he heard people in the crowd say -lsb- … -rsb- that the interior of the westend synagogue had been destroyed - wrecked and trashed - but that the eternal light -lsb- a constant flame that is lit in every synagogue ; eds . -rsb- was still burning .
and people took that for a miracle .
this spoke to me .
my own synagogue is building a new building .
we 've been working on it for 15 years and it 's nearing completion .
and i had the thought , because i am a lover of walking , of coming to frankfurt , of lighting a symbolic flame , and bringing it back to london to light our new eternal light . so you made ' light ' the subject of your walk ?
i was very struck by this idea , of light that burns despite darkness .
it 's an image that speaks to me in all kinds of ways as a rabbi .
i encounter a lot of darkness people struggle with .
i see the courage of people in facing illness , in facing death .
i also see the courage of people in a political context .
one of the organizations i am supporting on this walk is the parents ' circle , made up of parents who 've lost children on both sides of the israeli-palestinian conflict .
this group of parents , instead of blaming the others , instead of hating , they 're saying , ' well , this is a message that we need understanding . '
tell me about the ' eternal light ' that you are carrying .
how did you get it , and how are you transporting it ?
very simply , it 's an electric torch - a flashlight .
it 's symbolic .
i 'm not an olympic runner , and nobody 's going to let me into a cafe along the way with a great big torch on fire .
but what i did n't want to do was just to come by plane and take the torch and just fly back .
there 's no substance to something like that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the route traverses german wine country the trip began at the westend synagogue on october 24 .
i was there with a group of about 20 people from london who came to share the start of the journey .
the ceremony where i took the light was simple , just a couple of verses : " god is my light , and my salvation . "
one of the people with us was a hazzan -lsb- a singer trained to accompany jewish religious services ; eds . -rsb- who very beautifully sang those verses .
coincidentally , that day was the celebration of the 100-year anniversary of the westend synagogue .
i was invited to speak .
it was very , very moving .
my grandfather - my mother 's father - had been the main rabbi there for almost 30 years .
he died in 1975 .
what do you feel you 've learned about light along the way so far ?
my understanding of the meaning of light is constantly growing and constantly changing .
and just as light expands , so my understanding of it has expanded .
there is the beautiful natural light , while walking along the main and rhine rivers .
and then there is the tremendous amount of kindness i 've met in very ordinary circumstances .
on the second day , i was walking with a friend of mine who is a protestant minister .
i needed something to eat , and we went into a place - it turned out to be in a castle along the hiking trail , a very posh place .
i asked , ' can i have some bread please ? '
and the man came back with a basket of fruit and all kinds of bread .
i took out my purse to pay , and he said , ' no , please take it .
it 's a gift . '
i had n't told him what i was doing but it was obvious that i was somehow … en route .

we were in a tiny village , st. goar .
and in that tiny rhineland village , the sefer ha-maharil , which is a key work in the progression of ashkenazy jewish law , was composed .

the key speaker at the event was a controversial choice , attacked by german jewish groups for his criticism of israel .
the 1938 kristallnacht is considered to be the first nazi-sanctioned nation-wide attack against jews .
mobs sought out and torched jewish-owned shops , homes and synagogues around the country .
many were murdered , while tens of thousands were deported to nazi concentration camps .
key speaker at the frankfurt st paul 's church ceremony was german-born french author alfred grosser .
as expected , grosser launched into a critique of israeli policies towards the palestinians , saying it could not be expected that those in gaza could " understand the horror of assassinations , if you do not show great sympathy in understanding the suffering in the gaza strip . "
the announcement that grosser would speak at the anniversary ceremony had led to fierce objections from germany 's central council of jews and others in the country 's jewish community .
many threatened to walk out of the proceedings if grosser entered into a diatribe against the jewish state .
grosser said he felt justified in criticizing israel as he considered the country to be part of europe , adding that everybody should be held accountable to western values .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grosser has taken an interest in the israel-palestine conflict despite the 85-year-old 's comments , none of the attendees at the service walked out .

the political scientist and author of numerous books and essays is seen as an important pioneer in post-war franco-german understanding .
in recent years he has become increasingly interested in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
his 2009 book " von auschwitz nach jerusalem " -lrb- from auschwitz to jerusalem -rrb- caused controversy as he dealt with the permissibility of questioning the policies of israel .
meanwhile , the president of the central council of jews in germany has used the kristallnacht anniversary to warn of rising anti-semitism in the country .

she stressed that young germans should take a more active roll in remembering the crimes of the nazi era .

" the negotiations with croatia are now in their final phase , " the european commission said in its annual report on the progress of would-be eu members .
the commission pointed to widespread corruption and organized crime problems in other western balkan applicant countries as the biggest hurdle to their joining the bloc in the short term , although it did announce that montenegro was ready for full candidate status , saying the country 's democracy " is largely in line with european principles and standards . "
montenegro 's application has already been recognized by the eu , and with the commission 's approval , member states will now debate whether to grant the country candidate status and begin the process of negotiating membership .
croatia , iceland , turkey and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia are the four candidates that have already reached this final phase of the accession process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks voted for constitutional changes meant to appease brussels in a september referendum turkey began its official negotiations five years ago , but the eu acknowledged in its report that the process has hit rather rocky ground .
" negotiations advanced , albeit rather slowly , " the commission said of accession talks with ankara .
several stumbling blocks despite praising constitutional reforms designed to fight corruption , wrest some political power away from the military , and improve the protection of human rights as " a step in the right direction , " the commission said that turkey was still lagging behind in areas like press freedom , freedom of expression and religion , the rights of women and trade unions , and the integration of the kurdish minority in the country .
" the pace of reform in turkey dictates the pace of the accession process , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle said in berlin , shortly after the report was released .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the division of cyprus has soured turkish relations with eu members greece and cyprus the european commission also called on turkey to open trade ties with cyprus and redouble diplomatic efforts with the country , describing the need for progress in this area as " urgent . "
eu member state cyprus and turkey are locked in a territorial dispute over the northern part of the island , which has been occupied by turkish forces since 1974 .
reunification talks have stalled , and turkey says it will not open trade ties with cyprus until the problem is resolved .
and while cyprus tries to slow turkey 's accession into the eu , turkey is using its membership of nato to hamper cyprus ' bid to join that alliance .
another problem facing turkey 's membership bid that did not get highlighted in the eu commission 's annual report is the sheer size of the country .
a 2009 census put turkey 's population at 72 million , which would make it the second most populous member of the bloc .
" that means turkey would be represented in the european parliament with a number of mps to reflect its size , and the size of its population would also mean a lot of weight in decisions in the council of ministers , " the head of the eu program at the german council on foreign relations , almut moeller , told deutsche welle .
moeller said that eu insiders often talk about the influence turkey would wield in the bloc , and the affect it would have on the larger countries and their power structure .
" this is a sensitively calibrated order that has been around for a while now , and in the past we have only seen smaller and medium-sized countries entering the bloc .
they have relatively little impact on the big players , but imagine what a country this size would mean for the old order , for the amount of power currently shared between france and germany in the eu , for instance . "
gul : ' strategic imperative ' to let turkey in five years ago , there was an outpouring of pro-european sentiment and euphoria in turkey when the country began the final phase of the eu accession process .
but the mood seems to be souring as other applicants make much smoother process towards membership in the bloc .
on monday , brussels announced plans to grant visa-free travel within the eu 's open-border schengen zone to people from albania and bosnia , and the turkish newspaper haber tuerk responded by proclaiming on tuesday 's front page : " everyone 's allowed into the eu , except us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president gul thinks the eu is short-sighted not to welcome turkey citizens from every balkan country except kosovo , which some eu members consider a part of serbia , are now free to travel within the eu 's open-border area , while turks have to seek special visas .
" the eu will not be weaker , but stronger both politically and economically with turkey 's membership , " turkish president abdullah gul said in a speech in london on monday .
" given the fact that the international balance of power tends to shift towards the east and asia , it is , indeed , a strategic imperative for the eu to have turkey as a member . "
gul , speaking to the chatham house think-tank after receiving the organization 's annual prize for statesmanship , said it was " sad to observe " that some european leaders did not recognize the role turkey could play within the eu .
" this short-sighted vision is the major impediment before the idea of the eu as a global actor , capable of assuming greater responsibilities on political and security issues , complementing its economic clout , " the turkish president said .
in his speech , gul also announced that neighboring iran had asked turkey to host another round of talks with un security council members and germany on tehran 's nuclear program , alluding to the diplomatic role his country might play for the eu .
however , turkey 's international activities were also singled out by the eu for veiled criticism on tuesday , after the country defied the us and eu to vote against tougher un sanctions for iran earlier this year .
" turkey 's foreign policy has become more active in its wider neighborhood , " the commission 's report said .
" this is an asset for the european union , provided it is developed as a complement to turkey 's accession process and in coordination with the eu . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign relations -pipe- 09.11.2010 bush laments soured relationship with germany 's ex-chancellor schroeder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush says schroeder , right , reneged on his support for iraq former us president george w. bush says in his new memoirs that he lost trust in his then-german counterpart gerhard schroeder following what he said was the chancellor 's reversal on the war in iraq . in his new memoirs , former us president george w. bush says he lost trust in his german counterpart at the time , gerhard schroeder , when the chancellor turned against him over the war in iraq .
bush recalls in his book " decision points , " released tuesday in the us , that schroeder 's reversal on supporting the iraq war in a bid to win re-election in 2004 caused their relationship to sour .
bush says schroeder had privately assured him he backed his policy on iraq .
schroeder , along with the then french and russian presidents jacques chirac and vladimir putin , led international opposition to us diplomatic efforts to win support for invading iraq .
the war in iraq was and remains deeply unpopular in germany .
" as someone who valued personal diplomacy , i put a high premium on trust , " bush wrote .
" once that trust was violated , it was hard to have a constructive relationship again . "
schroeder rejects accusation schroeder disputed bush 's version , saying in a statement that he had only promised support if it was shown that saddam hussein 's regime played a role in the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , which was not the case .
" the bush administration 's reasons for the iraq war were based , as we know today , on lies , " schroeder said .
bush also seized upon comments made in 2002 by a german official who compared the us president to adolf hitler .
" i was shocked and furious , " bush writes of the alleged remarks by the then-german justice minister , herta daeubler-gmelin .

bush recalls in his book " decision points , " released tuesday in the us , that schroeder 's reversal on supporting the iraq war in a bid to win re-election in 2004 caused their relationship to sour .
bush says schroeder had privately assured him he backed his policy on iraq .
schroeder , along with the then french and russian presidents jacques chirac and vladimir putin , led international opposition to us diplomatic efforts to win support for invading iraq .
the war in iraq was and remains deeply unpopular in germany .
" as someone who valued personal diplomacy , i put a high premium on trust , " bush wrote .
" once that trust was violated , it was hard to have a constructive relationship again . "
schroeder rejects accusation schroeder disputed bush 's version , saying in a statement that he had only promised support if it was shown that saddam hussein 's regime played a role in the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , which was not the case .
" the bush administration 's reasons for the iraq war were based , as we know today , on lies , " schroeder said .
bush also seized upon comments made in 2002 by a german official who compared the us president to adolf hitler .
" i was shocked and furious , " bush writes of the alleged remarks by the then-german justice minister , herta daeubler-gmelin .
" it was hard to think of anything more insulting than being compared to hitler by a german official . "

after months living undercover in picturesque chiemsee , he 's now trying to get political aslyum . tucked away on the border of germany and austria , lake chiemsee has long been popular with holiday-makers .
but now the idyllic alpine region has become the unlikely backdrop for the story of a man wandering into uncharted political territory . in 2007 , andre shepherd walked off the us army base where he was stationed in southern germany .
the apache helicopter mechanic said his experiences on duty in iraq convinced him he could no longer support the war .
" the iraqi people , when i met them , reacted towards us with anger , hostility and fear .
we did n't understand why , because in the us , you think ' oh , we 're the liberators , " ' shepherd told detusche welle .
" but what was going on with the kidnappings , the rapes , and abu ghraib - the population just wanted us out of there . "
unexpected turn shepherd had never planned to make a career of the military .
in his 20 's , his dream of studying computer science fell by the wayside after he could n't afford to keep paying tuition at kent state university in ohio .
for a while , he lived in his car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lake chiemsee is known for its sunsets and alpine beauty , not political drama " i ended up being homeless for about a year , and i joined the military because it was the only way to get a job out of cleveland , " said the ohio native .
after his first tour of duty in iraq , shepherd returned to the base in germany , where he started doing internet research on the iraq war .
gradually , he became convinced that the us-led invasion was a human rights violation .
that was the moment of truth , says shepherd . " i had to decide , ok , do i just go back to the war , knowing what i 'm doing is wrong , that it 's murder , or do i go against the world 's most powerful government and have a lot of problems , be ostracized from society ? "
it took him ten days to make up his mind .
in april 2007 , shepherd walked off the base .
a risky move germany is a main staging post for the us military , with around 60,000 us troops stationed there .
each year , some of those soldiers go awol -lrb- absent without official leave -rrb- .
many get picked up by the german police and sent back to their bases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shepherd refused to take part in a war he calls illegal shepherd avoided being caught .
he did n't contact his family , relying on local friends and the occasional odd job to survive .
after 19 months , he decided to turn himself in and apply for political asylum .
if his application is successful , shepherd will become the first us iraq war veteran to receive political asylum in germany , says rudi friedrich , head of the pacifist organization connection .
friedrich 's organization , which he runs out of his home in a suburb of frankfurt , offers support to conscientious objectors and war deserters and has been guiding shepherd through the asylum-seeking process .
" the recognition that one is not alone is an important experience for a deserter to regain his self-esteem , to be able to say , ' yes , i did make the right choice , i do n't want to shoot at my neighbor , " ' friedrich told deutsche welle .
shepherd 's asylum application cites a 2004 european union regulation that grants refugee status to any soldier who is in danger of being prosecuted if his or her military service " would include crimes or acts " which violate international law .
but some fear granting shepherd asylum could create an easy way out for americans stationed in germany who want to avoid combat duty in iraq .
that 's not likely , says friedrich , because asylum cases are considered individually .
friedrich explains , " if andre shepherd is granted asylum , than that decision will take the form of a letter , exactly one page , with a letterhead .
and it will say , ' in light of the document submitted , andre shepherd is granted asylum . '
that 's it - there is no explanation or rationalization .
so it 's not a political stance , unless you say , the recognition of the asylum application is in and of itself a political stance . "
the waiting game even if his application is granted , shepherd will likely face jail time if he ever attempts to return to the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a decision in shepherd 's case is expected by the end of the year fortunately , shepherd says he feels at home in the tiny town of prien-am-chiemsee . he 's married to a german woman , and works part-time installing solar paneling for her parent 's company .
he also attends daily language classes as part of an integration course .
in september , the berlin newspaper die tageszeitung awarded him its panther prize for his courage in deserting .
shepherd says he feels optimistic , and says he sees parallels between his own case and the lessons of the nuremburg trials .
says shepherd , " if your government is committing war crimes , and you 're taking part knowing that these are crimes , then there is no excuse .
even if you 're just a low ranking soldier , if you 're taking part , then you 're guilty too . "

" but what was going on with the kidnappings , the rapes , and abu ghraib - the population just wanted us out of there . "
unexpected turn shepherd had never planned to make a career of the military .
in his 20 's , his dream of studying computer science fell by the wayside after he could n't afford to keep paying tuition at kent state university in ohio .
for a while , he lived in his car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lake chiemsee is known for its sunsets and alpine beauty , not political drama " i ended up being homeless for about a year , and i joined the military because it was the only way to get a job out of cleveland , " said the ohio native .
after his first tour of duty in iraq , shepherd returned to the base in germany , where he started doing internet research on the iraq war .
gradually , he became convinced that the us-led invasion was a human rights violation .
that was the moment of truth , says shepherd . " i had to decide , ok , do i just go back to the war , knowing what i 'm doing is wrong , that it 's murder , or do i go against the world 's most powerful government and have a lot of problems , be ostracized from society ? "
it took him ten days to make up his mind .
in april 2007 , shepherd walked off the base .
a risky move germany is a main staging post for the us military , with around 60,000 us troops stationed there .
each year , some of those soldiers go awol -lrb- absent without official leave -rrb- .
many get picked up by the german police and sent back to their bases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shepherd refused to take part in a war he calls illegal shepherd avoided being caught .
he did n't contact his family , relying on local friends and the occasional odd job to survive .
after 19 months , he decided to turn himself in and apply for political asylum .
if his application is successful , shepherd will become the first us iraq war veteran to receive political asylum in germany , says rudi friedrich , head of the pacifist organization connection .
friedrich 's organization , which he runs out of his home in a suburb of frankfurt , offers support to conscientious objectors and war deserters and has been guiding shepherd through the asylum-seeking process .
" the recognition that one is not alone is an important experience for a deserter to regain his self-esteem , to be able to say , ' yes , i did make the right choice , i do n't want to shoot at my neighbor , " ' friedrich told deutsche welle .
shepherd 's asylum application cites a 2004 european union regulation that grants refugee status to any soldier who is in danger of being prosecuted if his or her military service " would include crimes or acts " which violate international law .
but some fear granting shepherd asylum could create an easy way out for americans stationed in germany who want to avoid combat duty in iraq .
that 's not likely , says friedrich , because asylum cases are considered individually .
friedrich explains , " if andre shepherd is granted asylum , than that decision will take the form of a letter , exactly one page , with a letterhead .
and it will say , ' in light of the document submitted , andre shepherd is granted asylum . '
that 's it - there is no explanation or rationalization .
so it 's not a political stance , unless you say , the recognition of the asylum application is in and of itself a political stance . "
the waiting game even if his application is granted , shepherd will likely face jail time if he ever attempts to return to the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a decision in shepherd 's case is expected by the end of the year fortunately , shepherd says he feels at home in the tiny town of prien-am-chiemsee . he 's married to a german woman , and works part-time installing solar paneling for her parent 's company .
he also attends daily language classes as part of an integration course .
in september , the berlin newspaper die tageszeitung awarded him its panther prize for his courage in deserting .
shepherd says he feels optimistic , and says he sees parallels between his own case and the lessons of the nuremburg trials .
says shepherd , " if your government is committing war crimes , and you 're taking part knowing that these are crimes , then there is no excuse .
even if you 're just a low ranking soldier , if you 're taking part , then you 're guilty too . "

but not for long .
as researcher philipp gunz explained to deutsche welle , the similarities evolved into differences during the first year of their lives , a finding which proves a cognitive gulf between humans and the extinct species .
" what is being established during that period , both in humans and neanderthals , is synaptic connection among brain cells , " gunz said .
" we know from the example of modern man that even subtle differences can have significant consequences on development , and can contribute to social and communication skills . "
and although gunz says there is little doubt that the neanderthals , which have been extinct for almost 30,000 years , had language and did communicate with each other , they would have seen the world differently to the way we do .
same , same , but not for long bildunterschrift : how alike were we really ?
baby homo neanderthalensis ' elongated braincases – also found in new-born humans – had more to do with the physical make-up of the mothers than anything else .
" the baby has to fit through the birth canal and the shape of both was very similar so that would impose a constraint . "
but once unbridled and free to grow at will , human braincases gradually begin to change form to become more globular .
it is this shape which gunz believes proves early brain development in man which is absent in neanderthals .
human uniqueness in earlier research the scientists discovered that right after birth human brains are quite unlike those of chimpanzees , but that they become more similar at a later stage of development .
this shows that the " globularization phase " sets humans apart from both chimps and neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : chimps and man : not so similar " we think modern humans , chimpanzees and neanderthals share one ancestral growth pattern that that goes back millions of years , " gunz continued .
" but in the first year of life , modern humans depart from this ancestral pattern . "
and contrary to past opinion , it is this first year , and not brain size , which is crucial to cognitive development .
the leipzig anthropologists say it is the internal organization of the brain that matters .
deeper understanding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's in an ancient tooth ?
the scientists hope their research will help them understand a little more about the function of the genes , only a very small number of which separate modern humans from their extinct counterparts .
" we assume that some of these genes are related to brain development , " gunz said .
" in living people these mutations are linked to autism or schizophrenia or down-syndrome . "
and while he is not suggesting that an autistic child is a throwback to tens of thousands of years ago , the leipzig anthropologist does venture a link .
" we know from teeth that neanderthals grew faster , so maybe some of the genes are related to the regulation of brain growth . "

the downside is the impact this has on the environment .
but the country is taking meausres on climate protection - even more than some industrialized nations . in may 2009 , cyclone aila swept through the ganges delta .
tidal waves flooded a number of islands , devastating homes and farmland and claiming 300 lives .
200,000 people became climate refugees , and were forced to abandon their homes .
tropical cyclones are not uncommon in the world 's largest delta .
but to many , aila served a grim reminder of climate change , with greenpeace maintaining the destruction caused was in consonance with the predictions made by scientists , who had warned that storms would become more frequent and more damaging due to climate change .
aila also served as a reminder that the ganges delta is one of asia 's climate hotspots , vulnerable to some of the worst manifestations of climate change .
here , the effects of global warming are well underway – while in europe and north america , they are still only the subject of conferences and media debates . unique threat the challenges faced by people living on the ganges delta include the threat of rising sea levels caused mostly by subsidence in the region and partly by climate change .
if this continues , the result will be mass displacement .
higher temperatures related to climate change could also bring about more severe flooding of the delta , because of increased melting of snow and glaciers in the himalayas .
bildunterschrift : only a fraction of those displaced by aila had access to food and drinking water according to the experts , if climate change continues unchecked , the consequences for india will be devastating .
according to us economist william cline from the peterson institute for international economics in washington , india 's crop yield could drop by two thirds by 2080 as a result of global warming .
the institute 's statistics show that india is more at threat than any other region on the planet .
it 's not as though india is one of the planet 's biggest polluters .
the climate footprint of the seventh largest country in the world is commensurate with the size of its population - which is over 1 billion .
its carbon emissions are considerably lower than those of the us and china .
this is due largely to the country 's widespread poverty .
but as the indian economy gathers pace , the fear is that environmental issues will be sidelined .
demand for energy is rising as the middle-class buys more cars , tvs and better housing .
much of that energy comes from coal oil and gas , the main sources for planet-warming carbon dioxide .
but the country 's politicians are aware of the need for a low-carbon growth path .
learning from others ' mistakes " we need to put electricity into people 's homes and do it cleanly , " said india 's environment minister jairam ramesh last year - stressing that rich and poor nations inevitably have different approaches to tackling climate change . " you in the west need to live with only one car rather than three .
for you it 's about luxury .
for us it is about survival . "
india is especially active in the field of renewable energies , explains martin kaiser , director of international climate policy at greenpeace germany .
" india was quick to recognize that renewables could become a major growth market within its own economy , and got in on the act very early , " he says .
" it was a good move , because when an emerging economy invests in these technologies and contributes to their widespread use , they appear significantly more credible than the leading industrialized nations , who might just be keen to make money from them .
they become role models for other developing nations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind energy is popular in many developing nations today , india ranks 5th in the world with a total wind power capacity of 10,925 mw , or 3 percent of all electricity produced in the country .
experts predict that by 2030 , wind power will be supplying 15 percent of india 's energy needs . india is at pains to avoid the mistakes made by the industrialized nations .
large companies are now legally bound to hire energy managers , whose primary task is to ensure energy-efficient production , and are responsible for implement energy-saving measures .
they also report on the companies ' carbon footprint to india 's licensing authorities .
even the poverty-stricken population living on the ganges delta contributes to the fight against climate change by using solar energy .
mini solar units provide enough energy for a couple of energy-saving lamps and a radio or tv , and 50 percent of the 4.5 million people who live in the sundarbans in the lower part of the delta own one , according to geetanjali solar enterprise , an indian manufacturer of solar products and equipment .
that 's a much higher percentage of the population than in the major european cities and the us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 09.11.2010 oskar schindler 's krakow factory becomes a museum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photo exhibits show life during the nazi occupation steven spielberg made oskar schindler 's name immortal as the man who saved over a thousand jewish lives in world war ii .
in krakow , a museum and memorial recently opened in schindler 's former factory . an industrial complex in krakow is hardly the usual place to find hordes of tourists .
however in this part of the city , tourist buses line the streets - and it 's all because this is the location of oskar schindler 's factory .
the american film director steven spielberg made the factory famous in 1993 when he filmed parts of his oscar-winning film " schindler 's list " at the factory .
the story follows schindler as he tries to save his jewish workforce from nazi persecution and the concentration camps .
until recently , people had to peer through the locked gates to get a look at the factory .
but as of this summer , the building is now open to all visitors .
the krakow authorities have converted the factory into a museum , which is currently housing an exhibition called " krakow : occupation 1939-1945 , " examining life during nazi rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the success of spielberg 's film drew visitors to schindler 's krakow factory the exhibition shows the history of oskar schindler himself , and his workers .
curator monika bednarek said while schindler is the " main protagonist " of the exhibition , " he 's not the only one . "
the exhibition also charts the nazi occupation as a whole , and puts the fate of the jewish workers in schindler 's factory into context .
schindler 's place in history oskar schindler lived from 1908 to 1974 , and was the son of an industrialist .
in 1939 , after the occupation of poland by nazi germany , schindler acquired an enamel factory which had previously been in jewish hands .
the factory produced tin ware and later shells and detonators for the war effort .
schindler directly benefitted from the so-called ' ayranization ' of jewish factories and businesses , and as the war progressed he made a fortune on the black market .
despite his nazi membership , schindler became increasingly concerned about the cruel fate of his jewish workforce .
he added 1,200 workers to his famous list , labeling them ' essential ' to the war effort .
by doing so , he saved them from certain death at a nazi concentration camp .
after the war , schindler 's enamel factory became state-owned and was converted for use by a telecommunications company .
in 2002 it was abandoned , only to be bought by the city council three years later .

in krakow , a museum and memorial recently opened in schindler 's former factory . an industrial complex in krakow is hardly the usual place to find hordes of tourists .
however in this part of the city , tourist buses line the streets - and it 's all because this is the location of oskar schindler 's factory .
the american film director steven spielberg made the factory famous in 1993 when he filmed parts of his oscar-winning film " schindler 's list " at the factory .
the story follows schindler as he tries to save his jewish workforce from nazi persecution and the concentration camps .
until recently , people had to peer through the locked gates to get a look at the factory .
but as of this summer , the building is now open to all visitors .
the krakow authorities have converted the factory into a museum , which is currently housing an exhibition called " krakow : occupation 1939-1945 , " examining life during nazi rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the success of spielberg 's film drew visitors to schindler 's krakow factory the exhibition shows the history of oskar schindler himself , and his workers .
curator monika bednarek said while schindler is the " main protagonist " of the exhibition , " he 's not the only one . "
the exhibition also charts the nazi occupation as a whole , and puts the fate of the jewish workers in schindler 's factory into context .
schindler 's place in history oskar schindler lived from 1908 to 1974 , and was the son of an industrialist .
in 1939 , after the occupation of poland by nazi germany , schindler acquired an enamel factory which had previously been in jewish hands .
the factory produced tin ware and later shells and detonators for the war effort .
schindler directly benefitted from the so-called ' ayranization ' of jewish factories and businesses , and as the war progressed he made a fortune on the black market .
despite his nazi membership , schindler became increasingly concerned about the cruel fate of his jewish workforce .
he added 1,200 workers to his famous list , labeling them ' essential ' to the war effort .
by doing so , he saved them from certain death at a nazi concentration camp .
after the war , schindler 's enamel factory became state-owned and was converted for use by a telecommunications company .
in 2002 it was abandoned , only to be bought by the city council three years later .
" the council decided to turn it into a museum , " said bednarek .
with the help of eu funding , the building was renovated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial is filled with original tin ware from schindler 's factory modern exhibits entice young visitors the exhibition begins in the krakow of the 1930s with a range of photos - such as women walking in the city and jews on the way to the synagogue .

nonnenmacher was recently implicated in a spying scandal at the bank . the axe appears to be about to fall on the head of one of germany 's powerful state banks , hsh nordbank , after the lender 's major shareholders asked its supervisory board to give scandal-plagued ceo dirk jens nonnenmacher the sack .
nonnenmacher 's tenure as hsh chief was thrown into doubt after he was implicated in allegations of spying at the state-controlled bank .
the 47-year-old has also been investigated by prosecutors over risky investments that led to the bank losing millions of euros .
hsh nordbank 's biggest investors , the states of schleswig-holstein and hamburg , have reportedly asked the bank 's supervisory board chairman hilmar kopper to begin proceedings to find a new ceo for the lender .
in a written statement , the state governments said nonnenmacher 's dismissal was necessary to " win back lost trust " in hsh , whose main commercial focus is on shipping , transportation , real estate and renewable energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nonnenmacher has been in the post for around two years kopper said the supervisory board " took note " of the request by the state governments .
however , a decision will likely have to wait until at least the next board meeting on december 2 .
" -lsb- nonnenmacher -rsb- will continue with his duties for the time being with the necessary energy and reliability , " kopper said tuesday .
nonnenmacher 's contract at the bank runs until october 2012 .
a trained mathematician , he worked for several private banks before joining hsh nordbank in 2007 .
he became chairman in november 2008 , succeeding hans berger .
hsh nordbank is currently emerging from a financially rocky period brought on by the global financial crisis .
hamburg and schleswig-holstein were forced to provide the bank with 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.18 billion -rrb- in capital and 10 billion euros in guarantees .
the bank also received around 17 billion euros in guarantees from the federal government 's soffin bank rescue fund .

the agency , the energy arm of the organization for economic cooperation and development , a grouping of the world 's richest nations , forecast that global oil demand will rise to 99 million barrels a day by 2035 , some 15 million barrels a day higher than last year .
" the message is clear , the price will go up , especially if consuming countries do not make changes in the way they consume oil , especially in the transport sector , " the iea 's chief economist and lead author of the report , fatih birol told reuters in an interview .
oil prices will exceed $ 200 -lrb- 144 euro -rrb- a barrel by 2035 , and will likely stay over $ 100 a barrel after 2015 , the report said .
on tuesday the price of oil stood at roughly $ 87 a barrel .
china drives demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace wants even more emphasis on renewables china and other emerging economies are driving demand for oil higher .
" all the net growth comes from non-oecd countries , almost half from china alone , mainly driven by rising use of transport fuels , " the iea said in the report .
oil subsidies were limiting the scope for higher prices to choke off demand and change consumer habits , the iea said , and called for oil subsidies to be reduced .
" if subsidy policy does not change , with increasing price assumptions , these $ 312 billion in subsidies for 2009 will reach $ 600 billion in 2015 .
that 's huge , " birol said .
the report estimated that renewable energy only receives $ 57 billion in subsidies , a fraction of the ongoing support for the fossil fuel sector .
eradicating fossil fuel subsidies would boost the global economy , environment and energy security , the iea said , referring to a pledge made by g20 countries .
g20 leaders committed in pittsburgh in 2009 to phase out , over the medium-term , inefficient fossil fuel subsidies which distort the energy market and encourage wasteful consumption .
a g20 meeting in seoul this week may update progress on fossil fuels . greenpeace welcomed the iea 's call to cut the $ 312 billion in global fossil fuel subsidies .
" the iea report clearly states that fossil fuels are heavily subsidized … leading to unfair competition with clean and climate friendly renewable energies .
we welcome that renewables are now in the focus of the 2010 edition , " said sven teske , renewable energy director at greenpeace international , in a press release .
gas glut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surplus of gas may hinder development in renewable energy the future of renewable energy depended on strong government support , said the iea report , especially given an expected " ten year glut in gas " which would suppress fossil fuel power prices and make renewables look even less competitive .
" the gas glut will be with us ten more years , " birol told reuters .
" cheaper gas prices will put additional pressure on renewable energies especially in the us and europe .
if natural gas is as plenty and cheap as we think , then life for renewables will be even more difficult , " he added although greenpeace praised the iea for making renewable energy more prominent in this year 's report , teske from greenpeace international criticized the iea 's emphasis on other energy sources such as nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- for coal power stations .
" the iea is failing to shift technology recommendations from unproven , dangerous and expensive technologies such as ccs and nuclear power plants , " teske said .
greenpeace would like to see more emphasis on renewable energy and greater efficiency to reduce co2 emissions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 09.11.2010 iea predicts oil prices will more than double by 2035 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iea wants countries to change the way they consume oil the international energy agency has called for oil subsidies to be eradicated as it predicts that oil demand and prices will rise in the next 25 years , despite a push towards green energy . the international energy agency has warned that governments need to do more to increase efficiency and boost green technologies to meet a forecasted 36 percent jump in energy demand between 2008 and 2035 .
the agency , the energy arm of the organization for economic cooperation and development , a grouping of the world 's richest nations , forecast that global oil demand will rise to 99 million barrels a day by 2035 , some 15 million barrels a day higher than last year .
" the message is clear , the price will go up , especially if consuming countries do not make changes in the way they consume oil , especially in the transport sector , " the iea 's chief economist and lead author of the report , fatih birol told reuters in an interview .
oil prices will exceed $ 200 -lrb- 144 euro -rrb- a barrel by 2035 , and will likely stay over $ 100 a barrel after 2015 , the report said .
on tuesday the price of oil stood at roughly $ 87 a barrel .
china drives demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace wants even more emphasis on renewables china and other emerging economies are driving demand for oil higher .
" all the net growth comes from non-oecd countries , almost half from china alone , mainly driven by rising use of transport fuels , " the iea said in the report .
oil subsidies were limiting the scope for higher prices to choke off demand and change consumer habits , the iea said , and called for oil subsidies to be reduced .
" if subsidy policy does not change , with increasing price assumptions , these $ 312 billion in subsidies for 2009 will reach $ 600 billion in 2015 .
that 's huge , " birol said .
the report estimated that renewable energy only receives $ 57 billion in subsidies , a fraction of the ongoing support for the fossil fuel sector .
eradicating fossil fuel subsidies would boost the global economy , environment and energy security , the iea said , referring to a pledge made by g20 countries .
g20 leaders committed in pittsburgh in 2009 to phase out , over the medium-term , inefficient fossil fuel subsidies which distort the energy market and encourage wasteful consumption .
a g20 meeting in seoul this week may update progress on fossil fuels . greenpeace welcomed the iea 's call to cut the $ 312 billion in global fossil fuel subsidies .
" the iea report clearly states that fossil fuels are heavily subsidized … leading to unfair competition with clean and climate friendly renewable energies .
we welcome that renewables are now in the focus of the 2010 edition , " said sven teske , renewable energy director at greenpeace international , in a press release .
gas glut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surplus of gas may hinder development in renewable energy the future of renewable energy depended on strong government support , said the iea report , especially given an expected " ten year glut in gas " which would suppress fossil fuel power prices and make renewables look even less competitive .
" the gas glut will be with us ten more years , " birol told reuters .
" cheaper gas prices will put additional pressure on renewable energies especially in the us and europe .
if natural gas is as plenty and cheap as we think , then life for renewables will be even more difficult , " he added although greenpeace praised the iea for making renewable energy more prominent in this year 's report , teske from greenpeace international criticized the iea 's emphasis on other energy sources such as nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- for coal power stations .
" the iea is failing to shift technology recommendations from unproven , dangerous and expensive technologies such as ccs and nuclear power plants , " teske said .
greenpeace would like to see more emphasis on renewable energy and greater efficiency to reduce co2 emissions .

but with this season already a likely write-off , even hardcore fans are calling for some major changes on the river weser . if there was any small consolation for bremen after their 6-0 thrashing by stuttgart on sunday , it was that the scoreline could have been worse .
after all , goalkeeper tim wiese had saved a penalty in the 60th minute .
but wiese remained disconsolate .
" the way we played here was embarrassing , " the keeper told reporters after the match .
" i 'm ashamed of us , and every one else should be ashamed as well . "
it was werder 's second straight league loss after an unexpected home to defeat to nuremberg in round 10 .
coach thomas schaaf took refuge in gallows humor .
" we were a good sparring partner , " schaaf told the press .
" that 's an opponent you invite to your training camp , when you want to stay fit .
it was like in practice , and that 's not enough for a competitive match . "
werder are currently eleventh in the table , 15 points behind leaders dortmund .
the team has been in similar positions before , but rarely have things looked so black for the men in green .
in 2008-9 , bremen stumbled to tenth place in the bundesliga but salvaged their season by reaching the final of the europa league and winning the german cup .
this year , they are already out of the cup and adrift at the bottom of their champions league group .
werder have qualified for international competition every year since 2004 and have missed the champions league only once , making them germany 's second most successful team .
nonetheless , the problems they are currently encountering have been in the making for some time .
achilles ' heel bildunterschrift : silvestre is one of the main problems in a terrible defense werder have always conceded more goals than the other top german teams but have thrived because they also scored more .
that 's down to the style favored by schaaf , which features the defenders pushed relatively far upfield .
but after 11 matches this season , bremen have already conceded 27 goals .
by way of comparison , werder 's season average for the past six campaigns is 41.5 .
schaaf and company have sorely missed central defender naldo , who 's out indefinitely while recovering from an operation to combat necrosis of the knee .
neither sebastian proedl nor mikael silvestre has been an adequate replacement , and germany international per mertesacker has been unable to compensate .
werder 's goal production – 19 – is also down , which has something to do with the hole left behind by mesut oezil , who left this summer for real madrid .
aaron hunt , a converted striker , has not been able to fill the playmaker role , and new acquisition wesley has been forced to play in the back four .
as a relatively low-budget club by top european standards , bremen are used to losing star players .
schaaf and commercial manager klaus allofs have always shown a remarkable knack for finding replacements .
not this season , though , and that 's causing some major friction in the werder family .
fussing and feuding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaaf and allofs are no longer beyond criticism schaaf and allofs have been running things at werder since 1999 , a unique record of longevity in the hire- ‘ em-fire- ‘ em bundesliga , and harmony has been the rule in their eleven-year tenure .
but questionable personnel decisions and curious management reactions have created an atmosphere of conflict .
disappointed with the team 's early form , allofs took the strange step of freezing players ' wages earlier this season .
that created a climate of tension that may have emerged when striker marko arnautovic reportedly hurled an obscenity in allofs ' direction after being substituted out in bremen 's most recent champions league loss .
the serbian-austrian is known for his mercurial temperament , and many fans questioned the decision to acquire him this summer .
but that 's nothing compared to the outrage directed at the 33-year-old silvestre .
the frenchman was brought in despite coming off a horrible year with arsenal and is , according to the grades handed out by kicker magazine , by far and away the worst defender in the bundesliga .
he was roundly booed after the nuremberg match , an understandable reaction from disappointed ticket-holders .
but schaaf subsequently went on local radio accusing supporters of not being “ real fans . ”
and that has the werder faithful up in arms .
" werder bremen is suffering from the arrogance and vanity of schaaf and allofs , " wrote one enraged user on the fanszene-bremen internet forum .
" these gentlemen have lost touch after having so much success and being treated with kid gloves by the media .
criticism , including boos , is interpreted as an insult to their royal highnesses . "
a fellow supporter , writing on a different platform , concurred .
" here everyone blames a team that is playing badly , " the user opined on forum.werder.de.
" that 's one issue .
another one is that klaus allofs is n't capable of buying reasonable players and thomas schaaf has been unable to form them into a reasonable team . "
a couple of wins would probably be enough to silence the voices of dissent , and bremen get a chance to make amends on saturday when they host frankfurt – a team they 'd expect to beat most seasons .
but this season is anything but typical .
frankfurt are riding high in fourth place , while werder bremen are facing a potential relegation fight – and an ill-tempered debate about the future of the club .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 09.11.2010 black market is corrupting efforts to save tuna , report says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blue fin tuna are top predators and play a crucial role in balancing the oceans ' ecosystem a team of investigative reporters has revealed a flourishing illicit trade in bluefin tuna .
after months of digging , their probe suggests governments and regulators have willingly turned a blind eye to the problem . it is no secret that the past decade has seen sushi gain popularity in the western world , but the methods for feeding this appetite have been kept fairly well hidden .
until now .
in a report detailing the findings of its seven-month long probe into the business of bluefin tuna fishing , the international consortium of investigative journalists -lrb- icij -rrb- has unveiled a culture of over-exploitation , tacitly approved by government authorities .
the report details systematic over-fishing , falsely reported catch volumes , ignored bans of spotter planes to track down schools of tuna and illegal sales of national quotas from one vessel to another .
all told , the investigation paints a bleak picture in which thousands of tons of fish were illegally hauled between 1998 and 2007 - as many as one in every three bluefin tuna may have been caught illegally during this period .
the report also unveils a complex network of fishing fleets , farms , ministries and distributors from countries such as france , spain , italy , turkey and japan involved in the creation of a flourishing black market trade .
the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- said the inquiry had confirmed its repeated warnings of widespread illegalities .
" no consumer , no business , no government can be sure they are dealing with responsibly caught and traded bluefin tuna , " sergi tudela , head of fisheries at wwf mediterranean said in a statement .
" the whole chain is tarnished . "
parallels to the drug trade bildunterschrift : quotas for tuna are being flouted and authorities are looking away , investigators say .
eastern atlantic bluefin tuna are a catch in more than one sense of the word .
one large tuna , which can be three meters long and weigh more than 500 kilos , can fetch as much as 71,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- on the japanese market , the source of most of the world 's demand for tuna .
as marine biologist , daniel pauly told the icij , the promise of a slice of such wealth is too enticing for many to resist .
" fisheries are one of the most criminalized sectors in the world , " pauly said .
" this generates so much money that it 's like drugs . "
the report said the black market trade in tuna was worth at least $ 4 billion -lrb- 2.9 billion euros -rrb- between 1998 and 2007 .
while mostly taking aim at suppliers and the governments that turned a blind eye to their exporters ' behaviour , the report also reveals how japanese dealers evaded tuna quotas by importing tuna as another species of fish , only to re-label them as tuna at market . as the demand for the fish has grown , the industry has evolved in an increasingly detrimental way .
tuna farms have sprung up throughout the mediterranean , fishermen regularly plunder stocks in spawning areas and more boats – often subsidised at taxpayers ' expense – have been put to sea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the demand for tuna stems from japan , though fishing occurs internationally fish stocks dwindling the report singles out the burgeoning practice of purse-seining - in which entire schools of fish are encircled by vast nets and dragged to farms to be harvested .
as a consequence , numbers of bluefin tuna , which play a crucial role at the top of the marine food chain , have plummeted by almost three quarters over the past four decades , while the size of the average captured bluefin tuna has almost halved .
" if we want to continue being able to fish bluefin tuna at all , we need to backtrack 20 years , " gemma parkes , a spokeswoman for wwf mediterranean , told deutsche welle .
the extent of the problem first surfaced in 2007 when france was revealed to have caught almost twice the quota it is allowed under the international commission for the conservation of the atlantic tunas -lrb- iccat -rrb- – the tuna fishing industry 's watchdog .
the fishermen involved in the case were charged , and the regulatory body responded by introducing a new system , known as the bluefin tuna catch document -lrb- bcd -rrb- , to help monitor catch sizes .
but the team of investigative reporters at the icij says this system is full of so many holes that the data it gathers is practically useless .
moreover the wwf says it has seen evidence to prove that the bluefin industry still suffers from plenty of illegal activity bildunterschrift : a smaller specimen just minutes away from becoming sushi tougher measures this week , the iccat commission is meeting in paris to consider the current situation and find solutions .
exactly what shape these could take is far from clear , but parkes says the answers are simple .
" we are pushing for quotas to be cut from 13,500 to between zero and 6,000 tons , for a phasing out of purse-seining and the establishment of ' no fishing zones ' in spawning areas . "
to lend weight to its demands , the wwf has gathered the support of businesses and restaurants that have agreed to remove bluefin tuna from their shelves and menus until the stocks have had a chance to replenish .
exactly when that might be , nobody can tell , but parkes insists that the wwf 's suggestions would at the very least give the coveted species a much-needed break .
" there has been a depressingly widespread lack of control and respect for rules , " parkes said .
" but these rules would be so clear cut that they would be easy to police . "

after months of digging , their probe suggests governments and regulators have willingly turned a blind eye to the problem . it is no secret that the past decade has seen sushi gain popularity in the western world , but the methods for feeding this appetite have been kept fairly well hidden .
until now .
in a report detailing the findings of its seven-month long probe into the business of bluefin tuna fishing , the international consortium of investigative journalists -lrb- icij -rrb- has unveiled a culture of over-exploitation , tacitly approved by government authorities .
the report details systematic over-fishing , falsely reported catch volumes , ignored bans of spotter planes to track down schools of tuna and illegal sales of national quotas from one vessel to another .
all told , the investigation paints a bleak picture in which thousands of tons of fish were illegally hauled between 1998 and 2007 - as many as one in every three bluefin tuna may have been caught illegally during this period .
the report also unveils a complex network of fishing fleets , farms , ministries and distributors from countries such as france , spain , italy , turkey and japan involved in the creation of a flourishing black market trade .
the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- said the inquiry had confirmed its repeated warnings of widespread illegalities .
" no consumer , no business , no government can be sure they are dealing with responsibly caught and traded bluefin tuna , " sergi tudela , head of fisheries at wwf mediterranean said in a statement .
" the whole chain is tarnished . "
parallels to the drug trade bildunterschrift : quotas for tuna are being flouted and authorities are looking away , investigators say .
eastern atlantic bluefin tuna are a catch in more than one sense of the word .
one large tuna , which can be three meters long and weigh more than 500 kilos , can fetch as much as 71,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- on the japanese market , the source of most of the world 's demand for tuna .
as marine biologist , daniel pauly told the icij , the promise of a slice of such wealth is too enticing for many to resist .
" fisheries are one of the most criminalized sectors in the world , " pauly said .
" this generates so much money that it 's like drugs . "
the report said the black market trade in tuna was worth at least $ 4 billion -lrb- 2.9 billion euros -rrb- between 1998 and 2007 .
while mostly taking aim at suppliers and the governments that turned a blind eye to their exporters ' behaviour , the report also reveals how japanese dealers evaded tuna quotas by importing tuna as another species of fish , only to re-label them as tuna at market . as the demand for the fish has grown , the industry has evolved in an increasingly detrimental way .
tuna farms have sprung up throughout the mediterranean , fishermen regularly plunder stocks in spawning areas and more boats – often subsidised at taxpayers ' expense – have been put to sea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the demand for tuna stems from japan , though fishing occurs internationally fish stocks dwindling the report singles out the burgeoning practice of purse-seining - in which entire schools of fish are encircled by vast nets and dragged to farms to be harvested .
as a consequence , numbers of bluefin tuna , which play a crucial role at the top of the marine food chain , have plummeted by almost three quarters over the past four decades , while the size of the average captured bluefin tuna has almost halved .
" if we want to continue being able to fish bluefin tuna at all , we need to backtrack 20 years , " gemma parkes , a spokeswoman for wwf mediterranean , told deutsche welle .
the extent of the problem first surfaced in 2007 when france was revealed to have caught almost twice the quota it is allowed under the international commission for the conservation of the atlantic tunas -lrb- iccat -rrb- – the tuna fishing industry 's watchdog .
the fishermen involved in the case were charged , and the regulatory body responded by introducing a new system , known as the bluefin tuna catch document -lrb- bcd -rrb- , to help monitor catch sizes .
but the team of investigative reporters at the icij says this system is full of so many holes that the data it gathers is practically useless .
moreover the wwf says it has seen evidence to prove that the bluefin industry still suffers from plenty of illegal activity bildunterschrift : a smaller specimen just minutes away from becoming sushi tougher measures this week , the iccat commission is meeting in paris to consider the current situation and find solutions .
exactly what shape these could take is far from clear , but parkes says the answers are simple .
" we are pushing for quotas to be cut from 13,500 to between zero and 6,000 tons , for a phasing out of purse-seining and the establishment of ' no fishing zones ' in spawning areas . "
to lend weight to its demands , the wwf has gathered the support of businesses and restaurants that have agreed to remove bluefin tuna from their shelves and menus until the stocks have had a chance to replenish .
exactly when that might be , nobody can tell , but parkes insists that the wwf 's suggestions would at the very least give the coveted species a much-needed break .
" there has been a depressingly widespread lack of control and respect for rules , " parkes said .
" but these rules would be so clear cut that they would be easy to police . "

but fighting was still reported in some areas tuesday leading to fresh uncertainties over the outlook after the fighting in the border town of myawaddy had left several dead and injured . the ethnic karen militia fighters had been told to join a border patrol force .
while some have agreed , a faction of the democratic karen buddhist army or dkba is resisting .
late tuesday mywaddy town was reported back under control of the army .
aid group says situation at the border remains unstable several ethnic armies have ceasefire pacts with myanmar ’ s military .
but several others , such as the karen , wa , and shan among others have refused to lay down their weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar refugees are on their way to a pier in thailand to go home leonard buckles , a spokesman with the refugee aid group thailand burma border consortium , says while people have returned over the border the outlook remained uncertain : " people that came in last night in three pagodas pass went back to burma today .
but now they are coming back out so it ’ s a very flux situation in terms of people not staying permanently inside thailand .
so it ’ s hard to say really when it might resolve itself .
i think it ’ s going to be people coming and going for the next couple of weeks . "
army-backed party claims victory the return of the refugees came as myanmar ’ s main pro-military party , the union solidarity and development party , said tuesday it had won up to 80 percent of the parliamentary seats in the weekend elections .
sunai pasuk , a spokesman for the new york-based human rights watch , says the fighting between militias and myanmar ’ s armed forces reflects growing pressures on border ceasefire groups to lay down weapons and join the border guards under the army ’ s control : " this alliance is breaking down , falling apart .
on the other hand we have groups who will continue to fight so again this reaffirms the current speculation that this situation pre- and post election are pretty much the same .
the election will not be able to bring any stability to the country because there is no sincerity to give power back to the people including the ethnic population . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the karen minority in myanmar sunai says an absence of real reconciliation and participation for myanmar ’ s ethnic populations in the political process is set to leave the border regions unstable .
experts say more violence is yet to come political scientist at chulalongkorn university , thitinan pongsudhirak , agrees the outlook for myanmar ’ s border regions is one of violence and conflict : " it is highly likely we will see prolonged conflict now – renewed civil war between ethnic armies along the minority groups and the burmese military .
the military will also feel emboldened by having this election but at the same time paranoid and vulnerable because they ’ ve had elections and they will have to transfer power – so they ’ re likely to clamp down on the ethnic armies . "
thitinan says increased conflict has wide ranging regional implications with a humanitarian crisis set to lead to increased illegal drug trafficking and more refugees fleeing into thailand for safety .

these types of ultra-high-speed smash-ups at the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- are an attempt to re-create the explosion , known as the big bang , which is believed to have begun the universe .
as spokeswoman barbara warmbein told the associated press , the cern experiment over the weekend produced " a very , very , very small bang . "
lead ions are lead atoms whose electrons have been removed , and are much heavier than the protons that the researchers had been using .
that may be beneficial , as the energy required to smash them is higher , and thus may be closer to the conditions the scientists are trying to analyze .
as the research continues , scientists are trying to create " quark-gluon plasma , " an extremely hot and dense type of matter that may unlock some secrets in the early universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lead ion experiments will continue until cern shuts down for the winter on december 6 " the experiments are already providing an exciting glimpse of the new frontier , " sergio bertolucci , cern 's director for research and computing , told afp news agency .

it began operations in september 2008 .
beyond pushing the limits of particle physics , the team is also exploring the frontier of data storage and transfer .
cern is currently using 140 computer centers spread across 34 countries to back up and analyze its data , which is being transferred at peak rates of 10 gigabytes per second , or the equivalent of approximately two dvds per second .
still , warmbein added that it will likely be months , if not years , before cern scientists make any major breakthroughs .

this time round , he has finally made it , but indonesians on the street are not so excited any more .
" i hope that more investors will come to indonesia from the us if obama encourages this .

the japanese are investing more here than the americans .
we 're not expecting that much from his trip this time , " said one man .

this time , only a short visit is planned .
people here think that he is less interested in indonesia now . "
indonesians disappointed by obama 's foreign policy moreover , experts say obama 's foreign policy does not differ much from that of his predecessor and that a lot of people are disenchanted with the us president .
as hariadi wirawan puts it : " in the middle east , the us has the same policies as before .
not much has changed .
in terms of economics , the americans do n't seem to have shown much interest in the needs of the developing countries .
that 's how people see it here .
this trip is not very important if it is all talk and there are no concrete results . "

after nearly two days of blocking a nuclear waste storage site , thousands of protestors have been cleared from the area by police and the transport of 11 containers of nuclear waste has arrived at its destination . police cleared thousands of anti-nuclear activists from roads leading to the nuclear storage facility in gorleben , northern germany on tuesday morning , allowing for the final arrival of 123 tons of nuclear waste .
about 3,000 demonstrators staged a 44-hour sit-in in front of the storage site , including high-level politicians such as green party co-chair claudia roth .
activists from the environmentalist organization greenpeace used a truck disguised as a vehicle carrying beer to block the freight train station in nearby dannenberg , where the waste containers were to be moved to trucks for the final 20 kilometers to the storage site .
two greenpeace activists delayed the transport by about 11 hours by encasing themselves in a cement block , making it so the police could not move them without injuring them .
authorities managed to free the activists early tuesday morning , and the first truck carrying the nuclear waste departed dannenberg at around 8:30 a.m.
the last of the trucks arrived at the storage facility at about 9:50 a.m.
bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists held up the trucks carrying the waste for 11 hours stop-and-go traffic large protests have taken place during past nuclear waste transport operations , but none have delayed the shipment of the waste as much as the most recent .
the waste originated from nuclear reactors in germany and was sent to a plant in northern france for reprocessing .
the waste containers , called " castors " -lrb- cask for storage and transport of radioactive material -rrb- , left france by train on friday afternoon , but were quickly stopped by the first blockade of activists on the train tracks .
the following days were a tedious stop-and-go game , as protestors blocked the train tracks and some of the 16,000 police officers mobilized to secure the transport removed them .
protests to continue leaders of the various " citizens ' initiatives " against nuclear power claimed victory on tuesday , despite the successful transport of the nuclear waste , and some vowed to continue protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors succeeded in delaying the transport on historic levels " we 've shown that we 're a force to be reckoned with , " said kerstin rudek , chairwoman of the citizens ' initiative for environmental protection luechow-dannenberg .
matthias miersch , environment spokesman for the opposition social democrats in parliament , said the movement against the nuclear waste transport was a " very impressive demonstration . "
" this was a very clear signal to the government that this atomic energy policy can not go on , " he told phoenix public television .
" politicians have to understand that decisions are being made now that the people are absolutely unable to relate to . "
transport to russia meanwhile munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that germany had negotiated a deal " ready to be signed " to ship nuclear waste originating from an old atomic research facility in former east germany to russia .
the report said a total of 951 nuclear fuel elements from the east german research center dresden-rossendorf , which have been in temporary storage since 2005 , would be shipped to the mayak atomic complex in the southern urals for reprocessing .
the waste would stay in russia for permanent storage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mayak facility in russia is to reprocess east germany 's radioactive waste the report said the basis for the transport deal was a previous agreement between the united states and russia , which regulates the transport of nuclear waste from reactors that were overseen by the soviet union .
germany 's goal was reportedly to " reduce the amount of highly-enriched uranium as much as possible . "
the deal received criticism from the green party , which has profited politically from a strong anti-nuclear sentiment in germany .

bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists held up the trucks carrying the waste for 11 hours stop-and-go traffic large protests have taken place during past nuclear waste transport operations , but none have delayed the shipment of the waste as much as the most recent .
the waste originated from nuclear reactors in germany and was sent to a plant in northern france for reprocessing .
the waste containers , called " castors " -lrb- cask for storage and transport of radioactive material -rrb- , left france by train on friday afternoon , but were quickly stopped by the first blockade of activists on the train tracks .
the following days were a tedious stop-and-go game , as protestors blocked the train tracks and some of the 16,000 police officers mobilized to secure the transport removed them .
protests to continue leaders of the various " citizens ' initiatives " against nuclear power claimed victory on tuesday , despite the successful transport of the nuclear waste , and some vowed to continue protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors succeeded in delaying the transport on historic levels " we 've shown that we 're a force to be reckoned with , " said kerstin rudek , chairwoman of the citizens ' initiative for environmental protection luechow-dannenberg .
matthias miersch , environment spokesman for the opposition social democrats in parliament , said the movement against the nuclear waste transport was a " very impressive demonstration . "
" this was a very clear signal to the government that this atomic energy policy can not go on , " he told phoenix public television .
" politicians have to understand that decisions are being made now that the people are absolutely unable to relate to . "
transport to russia meanwhile munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that germany had negotiated a deal " ready to be signed " to ship nuclear waste originating from an old atomic research facility in former east germany to russia .
the report said a total of 951 nuclear fuel elements from the east german research center dresden-rossendorf , which have been in temporary storage since 2005 , would be shipped to the mayak atomic complex in the southern urals for reprocessing .
the waste would stay in russia for permanent storage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mayak facility in russia is to reprocess east germany 's radioactive waste the report said the basis for the transport deal was a previous agreement between the united states and russia , which regulates the transport of nuclear waste from reactors that were overseen by the soviet union .
germany 's goal was reportedly to " reduce the amount of highly-enriched uranium as much as possible . "
the deal received criticism from the green party , which has profited politically from a strong anti-nuclear sentiment in germany .
" cheap before safe , that 's what this is about , " green party spokeswoman sylvia kotting-uhl told the newspaper .

these types of ultra-high-speed smash-ups at the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- are an attempt to re-create the explosion , known as the big bang , which is believed to have begun the universe .
as spokeswoman barbara warmbein told the associated press , the cern experiment over the weekend produced " a very , very , very small bang . "
lead ions are lead atoms whose electrons have been removed , and are much heavier than the protons that the researchers had been using .
that may be beneficial , as the energy required to smash them is higher , and thus may be closer to the conditions the scientists are trying to analyze .
as the research continues , scientists are trying to create " quark-gluon plasma , " an extremely hot and dense type of matter that may unlock some secrets in the early universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lead ion experiments will continue until cern shuts down for the winter on december 6 " the experiments are already providing an exciting glimpse of the new frontier , " sergio bertolucci , cern 's director for research and computing , told afp news agency .
major breakthroughs ' could take years ' the lhc is comprised of a circular , 27-kilometer -lrb- 17-mile -rrb- atom-smasher that cost four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- to build near geneva .
it began operations in september 2008 .
beyond pushing the limits of particle physics , the team is also exploring the frontier of data storage and transfer .
cern is currently using 140 computer centers spread across 34 countries to back up and analyze its data , which is being transferred at peak rates of 10 gigabytes per second , or the equivalent of approximately two dvds per second .
still , warmbein added that it will likely be months , if not years , before cern scientists make any major breakthroughs .

these types of ultra-high-speed smash-ups at the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- are an attempt to re-create the explosion , known as the big bang , which is believed to have begun the universe .
as spokeswoman barbara warmbein told the associated press , the cern experiment over the weekend produced " a very , very , very small bang . "
lead ions are lead atoms whose electrons have been removed , and are much heavier than the protons that the researchers had been using .
that may be beneficial , as the energy required to smash them is higher , and thus may be closer to the conditions the scientists are trying to analyze .
as the research continues , scientists are trying to create " quark-gluon plasma , " an extremely hot and dense type of matter that may unlock some secrets in the early universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lead ion experiments will continue until cern shuts down for the winter on december 6 " the experiments are already providing an exciting glimpse of the new frontier , " sergio bertolucci , cern 's director for research and computing , told afp news agency .
major breakthroughs ' could take years ' the lhc is comprised of a circular , 27-kilometer -lrb- 17-mile -rrb- atom-smasher that cost four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- to build near geneva .
it began operations in september 2008 .
beyond pushing the limits of particle physics , the team is also exploring the frontier of data storage and transfer .
cern is currently using 140 computer centers spread across 34 countries to back up and analyze its data , which is being transferred at peak rates of 10 gigabytes per second , or the equivalent of approximately two dvds per second .
still , warmbein added that it will likely be months , if not years , before cern scientists make any major breakthroughs .

dw-world.de race for knowledge spurs physics research at cern the large hadron collider is coming late to the party and has a lot to prove in the particle physics community .
it 's no surprise then that a little competitive jockeying plays a role in cern 's research strategy .
-lrb- 28.06.2010 -rrb- large hadron collider in switzerland smashes records physicists at the european centre for nuclear research -lrb- cern -rrb- in geneva , switzerland , slam together sub-atomic particles with a level of energy never before achieved .
-lrb- 30.03.2010 -rrb- cern researchers celebrating as the large hadron collider is restarted scientists working on the world 's largest atom smasher say they are now circulating beams of protons in opposite directions at the same time after more than a year of repairs .

" there are indications that the artworks had been stored in what used to be house number 50 on koenigstrasse , now known as rathausstrasse .

but fighting was still reported in some areas tuesday leading to fresh uncertainties over the outlook after the fighting in the border town of myawaddy had left several dead and injured . the ethnic karen militia fighters had been told to join a border patrol force .
while some have agreed , a faction of the democratic karen buddhist army or dkba is resisting .
late tuesday mywaddy town was reported back under control of the army .
aid group says situation at the border remains unstable several ethnic armies have ceasefire pacts with myanmar ’ s military .
but several others , such as the karen , wa , and shan among others have refused to lay down their weapons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar refugees are on their way to a pier in thailand to go home leonard buckles , a spokesman with the refugee aid group thailand burma border consortium , says while people have returned over the border the outlook remained uncertain : " people that came in last night in three pagodas pass went back to burma today .
but now they are coming back out so it ’ s a very flux situation in terms of people not staying permanently inside thailand .
so it ’ s hard to say really when it might resolve itself .

but fighting was still reported in some areas tuesday leading to fresh uncertainties over the outlook after the fighting in the border town of myawaddy had left several dead and injured . the ethnic karen militia fighters had been told to join a border patrol force .
while some have agreed , a faction of the democratic karen buddhist army or dkba is resisting .
late tuesday mywaddy town was reported back under control of the army .

after months of digging , their probe suggests governments and regulators have willingly turned a blind eye to the problem . it is no secret that the past decade has seen sushi gain popularity in the western world , but the methods for feeding this appetite have been kept fairly well hidden .
until now .
in a report detailing the findings of its seven-month long probe into the business of bluefin tuna fishing , the international consortium of investigative journalists -lrb- icij -rrb- has unveiled a culture of over-exploitation , tacitly approved by government authorities .
the report details systematic over-fishing , falsely reported catch volumes , ignored bans of spotter planes to track down schools of tuna and illegal sales of national quotas from one vessel to another .
all told , the investigation paints a bleak picture in which thousands of tons of fish were illegally hauled between 1998 and 2007 - as many as one in every three bluefin tuna may have been caught illegally during this period .
the report also unveils a complex network of fishing fleets , farms , ministries and distributors from countries such as france , spain , italy , turkey and japan involved in the creation of a flourishing black market trade .
the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- said the inquiry had confirmed its repeated warnings of widespread illegalities .
" no consumer , no business , no government can be sure they are dealing with responsibly caught and traded bluefin tuna , " sergi tudela , head of fisheries at wwf mediterranean said in a statement .
" the whole chain is tarnished . "
parallels to the drug trade bildunterschrift : quotas for tuna are being flouted and authorities are looking away , investigators say .
eastern atlantic bluefin tuna are a catch in more than one sense of the word .
one large tuna , which can be three meters long and weigh more than 500 kilos , can fetch as much as 71,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- on the japanese market , the source of most of the world 's demand for tuna .
as marine biologist , daniel pauly told the icij , the promise of a slice of such wealth is too enticing for many to resist .
" fisheries are one of the most criminalized sectors in the world , " pauly said .
" this generates so much money that it 's like drugs . "
the report said the black market trade in tuna was worth at least $ 4 billion -lrb- 2.9 billion euros -rrb- between 1998 and 2007 .
while mostly taking aim at suppliers and the governments that turned a blind eye to their exporters ' behaviour , the report also reveals how japanese dealers evaded tuna quotas by importing tuna as another species of fish , only to re-label them as tuna at market . as the demand for the fish has grown , the industry has evolved in an increasingly detrimental way .
tuna farms have sprung up throughout the mediterranean , fishermen regularly plunder stocks in spawning areas and more boats – often subsidised at taxpayers ' expense – have been put to sea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the demand for tuna stems from japan , though fishing occurs internationally fish stocks dwindling the report singles out the burgeoning practice of purse-seining - in which entire schools of fish are encircled by vast nets and dragged to farms to be harvested .
as a consequence , numbers of bluefin tuna , which play a crucial role at the top of the marine food chain , have plummeted by almost three quarters over the past four decades , while the size of the average captured bluefin tuna has almost halved .
" if we want to continue being able to fish bluefin tuna at all , we need to backtrack 20 years , " gemma parkes , a spokeswoman for wwf mediterranean , told deutsche welle .
the extent of the problem first surfaced in 2007 when france was revealed to have caught almost twice the quota it is allowed under the international commission for the conservation of the atlantic tunas -lrb- iccat -rrb- – the tuna fishing industry 's watchdog .
the fishermen involved in the case were charged , and the regulatory body responded by introducing a new system , known as the bluefin tuna catch document -lrb- bcd -rrb- , to help monitor catch sizes .
but the team of investigative reporters at the icij says this system is full of so many holes that the data it gathers is practically useless .
moreover the wwf says it has seen evidence to prove that the bluefin industry still suffers from plenty of illegal activity bildunterschrift : a smaller specimen just minutes away from becoming sushi tougher measures this week , the iccat commission is meeting in paris to consider the current situation and find solutions .
exactly what shape these could take is far from clear , but parkes says the answers are simple .
" we are pushing for quotas to be cut from 13,500 to between zero and 6,000 tons , for a phasing out of purse-seining and the establishment of ' no fishing zones ' in spawning areas . "
to lend weight to its demands , the wwf has gathered the support of businesses and restaurants that have agreed to remove bluefin tuna from their shelves and menus until the stocks have had a chance to replenish .
exactly when that might be , nobody can tell , but parkes insists that the wwf 's suggestions would at the very least give the coveted species a much-needed break .
" there has been a depressingly widespread lack of control and respect for rules , " parkes said .
" but these rules would be so clear cut that they would be easy to police . "

while mostly taking aim at suppliers and the governments that turned a blind eye to their exporters ' behaviour , the report also reveals how japanese dealers evaded tuna quotas by importing tuna as another species of fish , only to re-label them as tuna at market . as the demand for the fish has grown , the industry has evolved in an increasingly detrimental way .
tuna farms have sprung up throughout the mediterranean , fishermen regularly plunder stocks in spawning areas and more boats – often subsidised at taxpayers ' expense – have been put to sea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the demand for tuna stems from japan , though fishing occurs internationally fish stocks dwindling the report singles out the burgeoning practice of purse-seining - in which entire schools of fish are encircled by vast nets and dragged to farms to be harvested .
as a consequence , numbers of bluefin tuna , which play a crucial role at the top of the marine food chain , have plummeted by almost three quarters over the past four decades , while the size of the average captured bluefin tuna has almost halved .
" if we want to continue being able to fish bluefin tuna at all , we need to backtrack 20 years , " gemma parkes , a spokeswoman for wwf mediterranean , told deutsche welle .
the extent of the problem first surfaced in 2007 when france was revealed to have caught almost twice the quota it is allowed under the international commission for the conservation of the atlantic tunas -lrb- iccat -rrb- – the tuna fishing industry 's watchdog .
the fishermen involved in the case were charged , and the regulatory body responded by introducing a new system , known as the bluefin tuna catch document -lrb- bcd -rrb- , to help monitor catch sizes .
but the team of investigative reporters at the icij says this system is full of so many holes that the data it gathers is practically useless .
moreover the wwf says it has seen evidence to prove that the bluefin industry still suffers from plenty of illegal activity bildunterschrift : a smaller specimen just minutes away from becoming sushi tougher measures this week , the iccat commission is meeting in paris to consider the current situation and find solutions .
exactly what shape these could take is far from clear , but parkes says the answers are simple .
" we are pushing for quotas to be cut from 13,500 to between zero and 6,000 tons , for a phasing out of purse-seining and the establishment of ' no fishing zones ' in spawning areas . "
to lend weight to its demands , the wwf has gathered the support of businesses and restaurants that have agreed to remove bluefin tuna from their shelves and menus until the stocks have had a chance to replenish .
exactly when that might be , nobody can tell , but parkes insists that the wwf 's suggestions would at the very least give the coveted species a much-needed break .
" there has been a depressingly widespread lack of control and respect for rules , " parkes said .
" but these rules would be so clear cut that they would be easy to police . "

the agency , the energy arm of the organization for economic cooperation and development , a grouping of the world 's richest nations , forecast that global oil demand will rise to 99 million barrels a day by 2035 , some 15 million barrels a day higher than last year .
" the message is clear , the price will go up , especially if consuming countries do not make changes in the way they consume oil , especially in the transport sector , " the iea 's chief economist and lead author of the report , fatih birol told reuters in an interview .
oil prices will exceed $ 200 -lrb- 144 euro -rrb- a barrel by 2035 , and will likely stay over $ 100 a barrel after 2015 , the report said .
on tuesday the price of oil stood at roughly $ 87 a barrel .
china drives demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace wants even more emphasis on renewables china and other emerging economies are driving demand for oil higher .
" all the net growth comes from non-oecd countries , almost half from china alone , mainly driven by rising use of transport fuels , " the iea said in the report .
oil subsidies were limiting the scope for higher prices to choke off demand and change consumer habits , the iea said , and called for oil subsidies to be reduced .
" if subsidy policy does not change , with increasing price assumptions , these $ 312 billion in subsidies for 2009 will reach $ 600 billion in 2015 .
that 's huge , " birol said .
the report estimated that renewable energy only receives $ 57 billion in subsidies , a fraction of the ongoing support for the fossil fuel sector .
eradicating fossil fuel subsidies would boost the global economy , environment and energy security , the iea said , referring to a pledge made by g20 countries .
g20 leaders committed in pittsburgh in 2009 to phase out , over the medium-term , inefficient fossil fuel subsidies which distort the energy market and encourage wasteful consumption .
a g20 meeting in seoul this week may update progress on fossil fuels . greenpeace welcomed the iea 's call to cut the $ 312 billion in global fossil fuel subsidies .
" the iea report clearly states that fossil fuels are heavily subsidized … leading to unfair competition with clean and climate friendly renewable energies .
we welcome that renewables are now in the focus of the 2010 edition , " said sven teske , renewable energy director at greenpeace international , in a press release .
gas glut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surplus of gas may hinder development in renewable energy the future of renewable energy depended on strong government support , said the iea report , especially given an expected " ten year glut in gas " which would suppress fossil fuel power prices and make renewables look even less competitive .
" the gas glut will be with us ten more years , " birol told reuters .
" cheaper gas prices will put additional pressure on renewable energies especially in the us and europe .
if natural gas is as plenty and cheap as we think , then life for renewables will be even more difficult , " he added although greenpeace praised the iea for making renewable energy more prominent in this year 's report , teske from greenpeace international criticized the iea 's emphasis on other energy sources such as nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- for coal power stations .
" the iea is failing to shift technology recommendations from unproven , dangerous and expensive technologies such as ccs and nuclear power plants , " teske said .

but with this season already a likely write-off , even hardcore fans are calling for some major changes on the river weser . if there was any small consolation for bremen after their 6-0 thrashing by stuttgart on sunday , it was that the scoreline could have been worse .
after all , goalkeeper tim wiese had saved a penalty in the 60th minute .
but wiese remained disconsolate .
" the way we played here was embarrassing , " the keeper told reporters after the match .
" i 'm ashamed of us , and every one else should be ashamed as well . "
it was werder 's second straight league loss after an unexpected home to defeat to nuremberg in round 10 .
coach thomas schaaf took refuge in gallows humor .
" we were a good sparring partner , " schaaf told the press .
" that 's an opponent you invite to your training camp , when you want to stay fit .
it was like in practice , and that 's not enough for a competitive match . "
werder are currently eleventh in the table , 15 points behind leaders dortmund .
the team has been in similar positions before , but rarely have things looked so black for the men in green .
in 2008-9 , bremen stumbled to tenth place in the bundesliga but salvaged their season by reaching the final of the europa league and winning the german cup .
this year , they are already out of the cup and adrift at the bottom of their champions league group .
werder have qualified for international competition every year since 2004 and have missed the champions league only once , making them germany 's second most successful team .
nonetheless , the problems they are currently encountering have been in the making for some time .
achilles ' heel bildunterschrift : silvestre is one of the main problems in a terrible defense werder have always conceded more goals than the other top german teams but have thrived because they also scored more .
that 's down to the style favored by schaaf , which features the defenders pushed relatively far upfield .
but after 11 matches this season , bremen have already conceded 27 goals .
by way of comparison , werder 's season average for the past six campaigns is 41.5 .
schaaf and company have sorely missed central defender naldo , who 's out indefinitely while recovering from an operation to combat necrosis of the knee .
neither sebastian proedl nor mikael silvestre has been an adequate replacement , and germany international per mertesacker has been unable to compensate .
werder 's goal production – 19 – is also down , which has something to do with the hole left behind by mesut oezil , who left this summer for real madrid .
aaron hunt , a converted striker , has not been able to fill the playmaker role , and new acquisition wesley has been forced to play in the back four .
as a relatively low-budget club by top european standards , bremen are used to losing star players .
schaaf and commercial manager klaus allofs have always shown a remarkable knack for finding replacements .
not this season , though , and that 's causing some major friction in the werder family .
fussing and feuding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaaf and allofs are no longer beyond criticism schaaf and allofs have been running things at werder since 1999 , a unique record of longevity in the hire- ‘ em-fire- ‘ em bundesliga , and harmony has been the rule in their eleven-year tenure .
but questionable personnel decisions and curious management reactions have created an atmosphere of conflict .
disappointed with the team 's early form , allofs took the strange step of freezing players ' wages earlier this season .
that created a climate of tension that may have emerged when striker marko arnautovic reportedly hurled an obscenity in allofs ' direction after being substituted out in bremen 's most recent champions league loss .
the serbian-austrian is known for his mercurial temperament , and many fans questioned the decision to acquire him this summer .
but that 's nothing compared to the outrage directed at the 33-year-old silvestre .
the frenchman was brought in despite coming off a horrible year with arsenal and is , according to the grades handed out by kicker magazine , by far and away the worst defender in the bundesliga .
he was roundly booed after the nuremberg match , an understandable reaction from disappointed ticket-holders .
but schaaf subsequently went on local radio accusing supporters of not being “ real fans . ”
and that has the werder faithful up in arms .
" werder bremen is suffering from the arrogance and vanity of schaaf and allofs , " wrote one enraged user on the fanszene-bremen internet forum .
" these gentlemen have lost touch after having so much success and being treated with kid gloves by the media .
criticism , including boos , is interpreted as an insult to their royal highnesses . "
a fellow supporter , writing on a different platform , concurred .
" here everyone blames a team that is playing badly , " the user opined on forum.werder.de.
" that 's one issue .
another one is that klaus allofs is n't capable of buying reasonable players and thomas schaaf has been unable to form them into a reasonable team . "
a couple of wins would probably be enough to silence the voices of dissent , and bremen get a chance to make amends on saturday when they host frankfurt – a team they 'd expect to beat most seasons .
but this season is anything but typical .
frankfurt are riding high in fourth place , while werder bremen are facing a potential relegation fight – and an ill-tempered debate about the future of the club .

nonnenmacher was recently implicated in a spying scandal at the bank . the axe appears to be about to fall on the head of one of germany 's powerful state banks , hsh nordbank , after the lender 's major shareholders asked its supervisory board to give scandal-plagued ceo dirk jens nonnenmacher the sack .
nonnenmacher 's tenure as hsh chief was thrown into doubt after he was implicated in allegations of spying at the state-controlled bank .
the 47-year-old has also been investigated by prosecutors over risky investments that led to the bank losing millions of euros .
hsh nordbank 's biggest investors , the states of schleswig-holstein and hamburg , have reportedly asked the bank 's supervisory board chairman hilmar kopper to begin proceedings to find a new ceo for the lender .
in a written statement , the state governments said nonnenmacher 's dismissal was necessary to " win back lost trust " in hsh , whose main commercial focus is on shipping , transportation , real estate and renewable energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nonnenmacher has been in the post for around two years kopper said the supervisory board " took note " of the request by the state governments .
however , a decision will likely have to wait until at least the next board meeting on december 2 .
" -lsb- nonnenmacher -rsb- will continue with his duties for the time being with the necessary energy and reliability , " kopper said tuesday .
nonnenmacher 's contract at the bank runs until october 2012 .
a trained mathematician , he worked for several private banks before joining hsh nordbank in 2007 .
he became chairman in november 2008 , succeeding hans berger .
hsh nordbank is currently emerging from a financially rocky period brought on by the global financial crisis .
hamburg and schleswig-holstein were forced to provide the bank with 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.18 billion -rrb- in capital and 10 billion euros in guarantees .
the bank also received around 17 billion euros in guarantees from the federal government 's soffin bank rescue fund .

nonnenmacher was recently implicated in a spying scandal at the bank . the axe appears to be about to fall on the head of one of germany 's powerful state banks , hsh nordbank , after the lender 's major shareholders asked its supervisory board to give scandal-plagued ceo dirk jens nonnenmacher the sack .
nonnenmacher 's tenure as hsh chief was thrown into doubt after he was implicated in allegations of spying at the state-controlled bank .
the 47-year-old has also been investigated by prosecutors over risky investments that led to the bank losing millions of euros .
hsh nordbank 's biggest investors , the states of schleswig-holstein and hamburg , have reportedly asked the bank 's supervisory board chairman hilmar kopper to begin proceedings to find a new ceo for the lender .
in a written statement , the state governments said nonnenmacher 's dismissal was necessary to " win back lost trust " in hsh , whose main commercial focus is on shipping , transportation , real estate and renewable energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nonnenmacher has been in the post for around two years kopper said the supervisory board " took note " of the request by the state governments .
however , a decision will likely have to wait until at least the next board meeting on december 2 .
" -lsb- nonnenmacher -rsb- will continue with his duties for the time being with the necessary energy and reliability , " kopper said tuesday .
nonnenmacher 's contract at the bank runs until october 2012 .
a trained mathematician , he worked for several private banks before joining hsh nordbank in 2007 .
he became chairman in november 2008 , succeeding hans berger .
hsh nordbank is currently emerging from a financially rocky period brought on by the global financial crisis .
hamburg and schleswig-holstein were forced to provide the bank with 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.18 billion -rrb- in capital and 10 billion euros in guarantees .
the bank also received around 17 billion euros in guarantees from the federal government 's soffin bank rescue fund .

after months living undercover in picturesque chiemsee , he 's now trying to get political aslyum . tucked away on the border of germany and austria , lake chiemsee has long been popular with holiday-makers .
but now the idyllic alpine region has become the unlikely backdrop for the story of a man wandering into uncharted political territory . in 2007 , andre shepherd walked off the us army base where he was stationed in southern germany .
the apache helicopter mechanic said his experiences on duty in iraq convinced him he could no longer support the war .
" the iraqi people , when i met them , reacted towards us with anger , hostility and fear .
we did n't understand why , because in the us , you think ' oh , we 're the liberators , " ' shepherd told detusche welle .
" but what was going on with the kidnappings , the rapes , and abu ghraib - the population just wanted us out of there . "
unexpected turn shepherd had never planned to make a career of the military .
in his 20 's , his dream of studying computer science fell by the wayside after he could n't afford to keep paying tuition at kent state university in ohio .
for a while , he lived in his car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lake chiemsee is known for its sunsets and alpine beauty , not political drama " i ended up being homeless for about a year , and i joined the military because it was the only way to get a job out of cleveland , " said the ohio native .
after his first tour of duty in iraq , shepherd returned to the base in germany , where he started doing internet research on the iraq war .
gradually , he became convinced that the us-led invasion was a human rights violation .
that was the moment of truth , says shepherd . " i had to decide , ok , do i just go back to the war , knowing what i 'm doing is wrong , that it 's murder , or do i go against the world 's most powerful government and have a lot of problems , be ostracized from society ? "
it took him ten days to make up his mind .
in april 2007 , shepherd walked off the base .
a risky move germany is a main staging post for the us military , with around 60,000 us troops stationed there .
each year , some of those soldiers go awol -lrb- absent without official leave -rrb- .
many get picked up by the german police and sent back to their bases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shepherd refused to take part in a war he calls illegal shepherd avoided being caught .
he did n't contact his family , relying on local friends and the occasional odd job to survive .
after 19 months , he decided to turn himself in and apply for political asylum .
if his application is successful , shepherd will become the first us iraq war veteran to receive political asylum in germany , says rudi friedrich , head of the pacifist organization connection .
friedrich 's organization , which he runs out of his home in a suburb of frankfurt , offers support to conscientious objectors and war deserters and has been guiding shepherd through the asylum-seeking process .
" the recognition that one is not alone is an important experience for a deserter to regain his self-esteem , to be able to say , ' yes , i did make the right choice , i do n't want to shoot at my neighbor , " ' friedrich told deutsche welle .
shepherd 's asylum application cites a 2004 european union regulation that grants refugee status to any soldier who is in danger of being prosecuted if his or her military service " would include crimes or acts " which violate international law .
but some fear granting shepherd asylum could create an easy way out for americans stationed in germany who want to avoid combat duty in iraq .
that 's not likely , says friedrich , because asylum cases are considered individually .
friedrich explains , " if andre shepherd is granted asylum , than that decision will take the form of a letter , exactly one page , with a letterhead .
and it will say , ' in light of the document submitted , andre shepherd is granted asylum . '
that 's it - there is no explanation or rationalization .
so it 's not a political stance , unless you say , the recognition of the asylum application is in and of itself a political stance . "
the waiting game even if his application is granted , shepherd will likely face jail time if he ever attempts to return to the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a decision in shepherd 's case is expected by the end of the year fortunately , shepherd says he feels at home in the tiny town of prien-am-chiemsee . he 's married to a german woman , and works part-time installing solar paneling for her parent 's company .
he also attends daily language classes as part of an integration course .
in september , the berlin newspaper die tageszeitung awarded him its panther prize for his courage in deserting .
shepherd says he feels optimistic , and says he sees parallels between his own case and the lessons of the nuremburg trials .
says shepherd , " if your government is committing war crimes , and you 're taking part knowing that these are crimes , then there is no excuse .
even if you 're just a low ranking soldier , if you 're taking part , then you 're guilty too . "

if his application is successful , shepherd will become the first us iraq war veteran to receive political asylum in germany , says rudi friedrich , head of the pacifist organization connection .
friedrich 's organization , which he runs out of his home in a suburb of frankfurt , offers support to conscientious objectors and war deserters and has been guiding shepherd through the asylum-seeking process .
" the recognition that one is not alone is an important experience for a deserter to regain his self-esteem , to be able to say , ' yes , i did make the right choice , i do n't want to shoot at my neighbor , " ' friedrich told deutsche welle .
shepherd 's asylum application cites a 2004 european union regulation that grants refugee status to any soldier who is in danger of being prosecuted if his or her military service " would include crimes or acts " which violate international law .
but some fear granting shepherd asylum could create an easy way out for americans stationed in germany who want to avoid combat duty in iraq .
that 's not likely , says friedrich , because asylum cases are considered individually .
friedrich explains , " if andre shepherd is granted asylum , than that decision will take the form of a letter , exactly one page , with a letterhead .
and it will say , ' in light of the document submitted , andre shepherd is granted asylum . '
that 's it - there is no explanation or rationalization .
so it 's not a political stance , unless you say , the recognition of the asylum application is in and of itself a political stance . "
the waiting game even if his application is granted , shepherd will likely face jail time if he ever attempts to return to the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a decision in shepherd 's case is expected by the end of the year fortunately , shepherd says he feels at home in the tiny town of prien-am-chiemsee . he 's married to a german woman , and works part-time installing solar paneling for her parent 's company .
he also attends daily language classes as part of an integration course .
in september , the berlin newspaper die tageszeitung awarded him its panther prize for his courage in deserting .
shepherd says he feels optimistic , and says he sees parallels between his own case and the lessons of the nuremburg trials .
says shepherd , " if your government is committing war crimes , and you 're taking part knowing that these are crimes , then there is no excuse .
even if you 're just a low ranking soldier , if you 're taking part , then you 're guilty too . "

after months living undercover in picturesque chiemsee , he 's now trying to get political aslyum . tucked away on the border of germany and austria , lake chiemsee has long been popular with holiday-makers .
but now the idyllic alpine region has become the unlikely backdrop for the story of a man wandering into uncharted political territory . in 2007 , andre shepherd walked off the us army base where he was stationed in southern germany .
the apache helicopter mechanic said his experiences on duty in iraq convinced him he could no longer support the war .
" the iraqi people , when i met them , reacted towards us with anger , hostility and fear .
we did n't understand why , because in the us , you think ' oh , we 're the liberators , " ' shepherd told detusche welle .
" but what was going on with the kidnappings , the rapes , and abu ghraib - the population just wanted us out of there . "
unexpected turn shepherd had never planned to make a career of the military .
in his 20 's , his dream of studying computer science fell by the wayside after he could n't afford to keep paying tuition at kent state university in ohio .
for a while , he lived in his car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lake chiemsee is known for its sunsets and alpine beauty , not political drama " i ended up being homeless for about a year , and i joined the military because it was the only way to get a job out of cleveland , " said the ohio native .
after his first tour of duty in iraq , shepherd returned to the base in germany , where he started doing internet research on the iraq war .
gradually , he became convinced that the us-led invasion was a human rights violation .
that was the moment of truth , says shepherd . " i had to decide , ok , do i just go back to the war , knowing what i 'm doing is wrong , that it 's murder , or do i go against the world 's most powerful government and have a lot of problems , be ostracized from society ? "
it took him ten days to make up his mind .
in april 2007 , shepherd walked off the base .
a risky move germany is a main staging post for the us military , with around 60,000 us troops stationed there .
each year , some of those soldiers go awol -lrb- absent without official leave -rrb- .
many get picked up by the german police and sent back to their bases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shepherd refused to take part in a war he calls illegal shepherd avoided being caught .
he did n't contact his family , relying on local friends and the occasional odd job to survive .
after 19 months , he decided to turn himself in and apply for political asylum .
if his application is successful , shepherd will become the first us iraq war veteran to receive political asylum in germany , says rudi friedrich , head of the pacifist organization connection .

bush recalls in his book " decision points , " released tuesday in the us , that schroeder 's reversal on supporting the iraq war in a bid to win re-election in 2004 caused their relationship to sour .
bush says schroeder had privately assured him he backed his policy on iraq .
schroeder , along with the then french and russian presidents jacques chirac and vladimir putin , led international opposition to us diplomatic efforts to win support for invading iraq .
the war in iraq was and remains deeply unpopular in germany .
" as someone who valued personal diplomacy , i put a high premium on trust , " bush wrote .
" once that trust was violated , it was hard to have a constructive relationship again . "
schroeder rejects accusation schroeder disputed bush 's version , saying in a statement that he had only promised support if it was shown that saddam hussein 's regime played a role in the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , which was not the case .
" the bush administration 's reasons for the iraq war were based , as we know today , on lies , " schroeder said .
bush also seized upon comments made in 2002 by a german official who compared the us president to adolf hitler .
" i was shocked and furious , " bush writes of the alleged remarks by the then-german justice minister , herta daeubler-gmelin .
" it was hard to think of anything more insulting than being compared to hitler by a german official . "
the minister had to resign .

" the negotiations with croatia are now in their final phase , " the european commission said in its annual report on the progress of would-be eu members .
the commission pointed to widespread corruption and organized crime problems in other western balkan applicant countries as the biggest hurdle to their joining the bloc in the short term , although it did announce that montenegro was ready for full candidate status , saying the country 's democracy " is largely in line with european principles and standards . "
montenegro 's application has already been recognized by the eu , and with the commission 's approval , member states will now debate whether to grant the country candidate status and begin the process of negotiating membership .
croatia , iceland , turkey and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia are the four candidates that have already reached this final phase of the accession process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks voted for constitutional changes meant to appease brussels in a september referendum turkey began its official negotiations five years ago , but the eu acknowledged in its report that the process has hit rather rocky ground .
" negotiations advanced , albeit rather slowly , " the commission said of accession talks with ankara .
several stumbling blocks despite praising constitutional reforms designed to fight corruption , wrest some political power away from the military , and improve the protection of human rights as " a step in the right direction , " the commission said that turkey was still lagging behind in areas like press freedom , freedom of expression and religion , the rights of women and trade unions , and the integration of the kurdish minority in the country .
" the pace of reform in turkey dictates the pace of the accession process , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle said in berlin , shortly after the report was released .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the division of cyprus has soured turkish relations with eu members greece and cyprus the european commission also called on turkey to open trade ties with cyprus and redouble diplomatic efforts with the country , describing the need for progress in this area as " urgent . "
eu member state cyprus and turkey are locked in a territorial dispute over the northern part of the island , which has been occupied by turkish forces since 1974 .
reunification talks have stalled , and turkey says it will not open trade ties with cyprus until the problem is resolved .
and while cyprus tries to slow turkey 's accession into the eu , turkey is using its membership of nato to hamper cyprus ' bid to join that alliance .
another problem facing turkey 's membership bid that did not get highlighted in the eu commission 's annual report is the sheer size of the country .
a 2009 census put turkey 's population at 72 million , which would make it the second most populous member of the bloc .
" that means turkey would be represented in the european parliament with a number of mps to reflect its size , and the size of its population would also mean a lot of weight in decisions in the council of ministers , " the head of the eu program at the german council on foreign relations , almut moeller , told deutsche welle .
moeller said that eu insiders often talk about the influence turkey would wield in the bloc , and the affect it would have on the larger countries and their power structure .
" this is a sensitively calibrated order that has been around for a while now , and in the past we have only seen smaller and medium-sized countries entering the bloc .
they have relatively little impact on the big players , but imagine what a country this size would mean for the old order , for the amount of power currently shared between france and germany in the eu , for instance . "
gul : ' strategic imperative ' to let turkey in five years ago , there was an outpouring of pro-european sentiment and euphoria in turkey when the country began the final phase of the eu accession process .
but the mood seems to be souring as other applicants make much smoother process towards membership in the bloc .
on monday , brussels announced plans to grant visa-free travel within the eu 's open-border schengen zone to people from albania and bosnia , and the turkish newspaper haber tuerk responded by proclaiming on tuesday 's front page : " everyone 's allowed into the eu , except us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president gul thinks the eu is short-sighted not to welcome turkey citizens from every balkan country except kosovo , which some eu members consider a part of serbia , are now free to travel within the eu 's open-border area , while turks have to seek special visas .
" the eu will not be weaker , but stronger both politically and economically with turkey 's membership , " turkish president abdullah gul said in a speech in london on monday .
" given the fact that the international balance of power tends to shift towards the east and asia , it is , indeed , a strategic imperative for the eu to have turkey as a member . "
gul , speaking to the chatham house think-tank after receiving the organization 's annual prize for statesmanship , said it was " sad to observe " that some european leaders did not recognize the role turkey could play within the eu .
" this short-sighted vision is the major impediment before the idea of the eu as a global actor , capable of assuming greater responsibilities on political and security issues , complementing its economic clout , " the turkish president said .
in his speech , gul also announced that neighboring iran had asked turkey to host another round of talks with un security council members and germany on tehran 's nuclear program , alluding to the diplomatic role his country might play for the eu .
however , turkey 's international activities were also singled out by the eu for veiled criticism on tuesday , after the country defied the us and eu to vote against tougher un sanctions for iran earlier this year .
" turkey 's foreign policy has become more active in its wider neighborhood , " the commission 's report said .
" this is an asset for the european union , provided it is developed as a complement to turkey 's accession process and in coordination with the eu . "

" the negotiations with croatia are now in their final phase , " the european commission said in its annual report on the progress of would-be eu members .
the commission pointed to widespread corruption and organized crime problems in other western balkan applicant countries as the biggest hurdle to their joining the bloc in the short term , although it did announce that montenegro was ready for full candidate status , saying the country 's democracy " is largely in line with european principles and standards . "
montenegro 's application has already been recognized by the eu , and with the commission 's approval , member states will now debate whether to grant the country candidate status and begin the process of negotiating membership .
croatia , iceland , turkey and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia are the four candidates that have already reached this final phase of the accession process .

in krakow , a museum and memorial recently opened in schindler 's former factory . an industrial complex in krakow is hardly the usual place to find hordes of tourists .
however in this part of the city , tourist buses line the streets - and it 's all because this is the location of oskar schindler 's factory .
the american film director steven spielberg made the factory famous in 1993 when he filmed parts of his oscar-winning film " schindler 's list " at the factory .
the story follows schindler as he tries to save his jewish workforce from nazi persecution and the concentration camps .
until recently , people had to peer through the locked gates to get a look at the factory .
but as of this summer , the building is now open to all visitors .
the krakow authorities have converted the factory into a museum , which is currently housing an exhibition called " krakow : occupation 1939-1945 , " examining life during nazi rule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the success of spielberg 's film drew visitors to schindler 's krakow factory the exhibition shows the history of oskar schindler himself , and his workers .
curator monika bednarek said while schindler is the " main protagonist " of the exhibition , " he 's not the only one . "
the exhibition also charts the nazi occupation as a whole , and puts the fate of the jewish workers in schindler 's factory into context .
schindler 's place in history oskar schindler lived from 1908 to 1974 , and was the son of an industrialist .
in 1939 , after the occupation of poland by nazi germany , schindler acquired an enamel factory which had previously been in jewish hands .
the factory produced tin ware and later shells and detonators for the war effort .
schindler directly benefitted from the so-called ' ayranization ' of jewish factories and businesses , and as the war progressed he made a fortune on the black market .
despite his nazi membership , schindler became increasingly concerned about the cruel fate of his jewish workforce .
he added 1,200 workers to his famous list , labeling them ' essential ' to the war effort .
by doing so , he saved them from certain death at a nazi concentration camp .
after the war , schindler 's enamel factory became state-owned and was converted for use by a telecommunications company .
in 2002 it was abandoned , only to be bought by the city council three years later .
" the council decided to turn it into a museum , " said bednarek .
with the help of eu funding , the building was renovated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial is filled with original tin ware from schindler 's factory modern exhibits entice young visitors the exhibition begins in the krakow of the 1930s with a range of photos - such as women walking in the city and jews on the way to the synagogue .
" first of all we see the history before the war , so we can understand what happened during the war , " explained bendarek .
then the exhibits chart the outbreak of war , as german soldiers marched through poland on september 6 , 1939 .
there 's even a reconstruction of the jewish ghetto .
with the help of touch-screen displays , life-size murals and multimedia exhibits , the history of the period is brought to life .
the curators hope these types of techniques will help appeal to younger visitors .
" with this technology we can reach young people , " said grzegorz jezowski , who helped put together the exhibition .
" it makes it more attractive for them . "
a memorial to oskar schindler schindler himself only features quite briefly in the exhibition .
his story is told through photos , original documents and furniture from the factory .
in the middle of one room is a giant transparent cube , filled with tin pots , bowls and plates that were produced in schindler 's factory .
the instillation is meant to represent the history of the entrepreneur and his workers .
in the center hang the names of around 1,200 jewish workers whose lives were saved by schindler .

the key speaker at the event was a controversial choice , attacked by german jewish groups for his criticism of israel .
the 1938 kristallnacht is considered to be the first nazi-sanctioned nation-wide attack against jews .
mobs sought out and torched jewish-owned shops , homes and synagogues around the country .
many were murdered , while tens of thousands were deported to nazi concentration camps .
key speaker at the frankfurt st paul 's church ceremony was german-born french author alfred grosser .
as expected , grosser launched into a critique of israeli policies towards the palestinians , saying it could not be expected that those in gaza could " understand the horror of assassinations , if you do not show great sympathy in understanding the suffering in the gaza strip . "
the announcement that grosser would speak at the anniversary ceremony had led to fierce objections from germany 's central council of jews and others in the country 's jewish community .
many threatened to walk out of the proceedings if grosser entered into a diatribe against the jewish state .
grosser said he felt justified in criticizing israel as he considered the country to be part of europe , adding that everybody should be held accountable to western values .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grosser has taken an interest in the israel-palestine conflict despite the 85-year-old 's comments , none of the attendees at the service walked out .
members of the central council of jews attending the ceremony said grosser had not crossed the line in his speech .
focus on israel grosser comes from a jewish family which immigrated to france in 1933 .
the political scientist and author of numerous books and essays is seen as an important pioneer in post-war franco-german understanding .
in recent years he has become increasingly interested in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
his 2009 book " von auschwitz nach jerusalem " -lrb- from auschwitz to jerusalem -rrb- caused controversy as he dealt with the permissibility of questioning the policies of israel .
meanwhile , the president of the central council of jews in germany has used the kristallnacht anniversary to warn of rising anti-semitism in the country .
president charlotte knobloch called for more civil courage from germans to fight xenophobia and anti-semitism .
she stressed that young germans should take a more active roll in remembering the crimes of the nazi era .

the key speaker at the event was a controversial choice , attacked by german jewish groups for his criticism of israel .
the 1938 kristallnacht is considered to be the first nazi-sanctioned nation-wide attack against jews .
mobs sought out and torched jewish-owned shops , homes and synagogues around the country .
many were murdered , while tens of thousands were deported to nazi concentration camps .
key speaker at the frankfurt st paul 's church ceremony was german-born french author alfred grosser .
as expected , grosser launched into a critique of israeli policies towards the palestinians , saying it could not be expected that those in gaza could " understand the horror of assassinations , if you do not show great sympathy in understanding the suffering in the gaza strip . "
the announcement that grosser would speak at the anniversary ceremony had led to fierce objections from germany 's central council of jews and others in the country 's jewish community .
many threatened to walk out of the proceedings if grosser entered into a diatribe against the jewish state .
grosser said he felt justified in criticizing israel as he considered the country to be part of europe , adding that everybody should be held accountable to western values .

after nearly two days of blocking a nuclear waste storage site , thousands of protestors have been cleared from the area by police and the transport of 11 containers of nuclear waste has arrived at its destination . police cleared thousands of anti-nuclear activists from roads leading to the nuclear storage facility in gorleben , northern germany on tuesday morning , allowing for the final arrival of 123 tons of nuclear waste .
about 3,000 demonstrators staged a 44-hour sit-in in front of the storage site , including high-level politicians such as green party co-chair claudia roth .
activists from the environmentalist organization greenpeace used a truck disguised as a vehicle carrying beer to block the freight train station in nearby dannenberg , where the waste containers were to be moved to trucks for the final 20 kilometers to the storage site .
two greenpeace activists delayed the transport by about 11 hours by encasing themselves in a cement block , making it so the police could not move them without injuring them .
authorities managed to free the activists early tuesday morning , and the first truck carrying the nuclear waste departed dannenberg at around 8:30 a.m.
the last of the trucks arrived at the storage facility at about 9:50 a.m.
bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists held up the trucks carrying the waste for 11 hours stop-and-go traffic large protests have taken place during past nuclear waste transport operations , but none have delayed the shipment of the waste as much as the most recent .
the waste originated from nuclear reactors in germany and was sent to a plant in northern france for reprocessing .
the waste containers , called " castors " -lrb- cask for storage and transport of radioactive material -rrb- , left france by train on friday afternoon , but were quickly stopped by the first blockade of activists on the train tracks .
the following days were a tedious stop-and-go game , as protestors blocked the train tracks and some of the 16,000 police officers mobilized to secure the transport removed them .
protests to continue leaders of the various " citizens ' initiatives " against nuclear power claimed victory on tuesday , despite the successful transport of the nuclear waste , and some vowed to continue protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors succeeded in delaying the transport on historic levels " we 've shown that we 're a force to be reckoned with , " said kerstin rudek , chairwoman of the citizens ' initiative for environmental protection luechow-dannenberg .
matthias miersch , environment spokesman for the opposition social democrats in parliament , said the movement against the nuclear waste transport was a " very impressive demonstration . "
" this was a very clear signal to the government that this atomic energy policy can not go on , " he told phoenix public television .
" politicians have to understand that decisions are being made now that the people are absolutely unable to relate to . "
transport to russia meanwhile munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that germany had negotiated a deal " ready to be signed " to ship nuclear waste originating from an old atomic research facility in former east germany to russia .
the report said a total of 951 nuclear fuel elements from the east german research center dresden-rossendorf , which have been in temporary storage since 2005 , would be shipped to the mayak atomic complex in the southern urals for reprocessing .
the waste would stay in russia for permanent storage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mayak facility in russia is to reprocess east germany 's radioactive waste the report said the basis for the transport deal was a previous agreement between the united states and russia , which regulates the transport of nuclear waste from reactors that were overseen by the soviet union .
germany 's goal was reportedly to " reduce the amount of highly-enriched uranium as much as possible . "
the deal received criticism from the green party , which has profited politically from a strong anti-nuclear sentiment in germany .
" cheap before safe , that 's what this is about , " green party spokeswoman sylvia kotting-uhl told the newspaper .

wittenberg 's grandfather was a rabbi there during the so-called kristallnacht , or night of broken glass .
all throughout germany and austria , jewish homes , business , and synagogues were ransacked and thousands of jews were deported to concentration camps .
now , accompanied by his dog mitzpah , he is carrying the torch by foot and by ferry .
in london , he will use it to symbolically light the eternal flame of a new synagogue for his own congregation .
the three-week project also serves as a fundraiser to support a variety of charities and interfaith projects .
deutsche welle spoke with the rabbi in cologne , at the midway point through his walk .
deutsche welle : rabbi wittenberg , can you tell me where the idea came from to take this walk , and what the journey is really all about ?
jonathan wittenberg : it was really when i was rereading my grandfather 's memoirs , at the 70th anniversary of kristallnacht .
i just wanted to remember what had happened to him .
and i read there how he was called by the gestapo on the 10th of november , on the allegation that he had the keys to the westend synagogue , which he did n't . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rabbi stopped at maria-laach abbey , in germany 's eifel region he wrote that he came to the main synagogue ; the fire brigade was there , and they were doing nothing .
he heard people in the crowd say -lsb- … -rsb- that the interior of the westend synagogue had been destroyed - wrecked and trashed - but that the eternal light -lsb- a constant flame that is lit in every synagogue ; eds . -rsb- was still burning .
and people took that for a miracle .
this spoke to me .
my own synagogue is building a new building .
we 've been working on it for 15 years and it 's nearing completion .
and i had the thought , because i am a lover of walking , of coming to frankfurt , of lighting a symbolic flame , and bringing it back to london to light our new eternal light . so you made ' light ' the subject of your walk ?
i was very struck by this idea , of light that burns despite darkness .
it 's an image that speaks to me in all kinds of ways as a rabbi .
i encounter a lot of darkness people struggle with .
i see the courage of people in facing illness , in facing death .
i also see the courage of people in a political context .
one of the organizations i am supporting on this walk is the parents ' circle , made up of parents who 've lost children on both sides of the israeli-palestinian conflict .
this group of parents , instead of blaming the others , instead of hating , they 're saying , ' well , this is a message that we need understanding . '
tell me about the ' eternal light ' that you are carrying .
how did you get it , and how are you transporting it ?
very simply , it 's an electric torch - a flashlight .
it 's symbolic .
i 'm not an olympic runner , and nobody 's going to let me into a cafe along the way with a great big torch on fire .
but what i did n't want to do was just to come by plane and take the torch and just fly back .
there 's no substance to something like that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the route traverses german wine country the trip began at the westend synagogue on october 24 .
i was there with a group of about 20 people from london who came to share the start of the journey .
the ceremony where i took the light was simple , just a couple of verses : " god is my light , and my salvation . "
one of the people with us was a hazzan -lsb- a singer trained to accompany jewish religious services ; eds . -rsb- who very beautifully sang those verses .
coincidentally , that day was the celebration of the 100-year anniversary of the westend synagogue .
i was invited to speak .
it was very , very moving .
my grandfather - my mother 's father - had been the main rabbi there for almost 30 years .
he died in 1975 .
what do you feel you 've learned about light along the way so far ?
my understanding of the meaning of light is constantly growing and constantly changing .
and just as light expands , so my understanding of it has expanded .
there is the beautiful natural light , while walking along the main and rhine rivers .
and then there is the tremendous amount of kindness i 've met in very ordinary circumstances .
on the second day , i was walking with a friend of mine who is a protestant minister .
i needed something to eat , and we went into a place - it turned out to be in a castle along the hiking trail , a very posh place .
i asked , ' can i have some bread please ? '
and the man came back with a basket of fruit and all kinds of bread .
i took out my purse to pay , and he said , ' no , please take it .
it 's a gift . '
i had n't told him what i was doing but it was obvious that i was somehow … en route .
i 've encountered that kind of kindness all along .
that is a kind of light .
you 're not just trekking on this trip - you 're visiting various religious sites , holding talks with social-interest groups , and visiting jewish monuments .
has that added to your understanding of light ?
yes .
there have been moments of contact with people who are engaged with what was the jewish past in germany .
we stopped in the town of bingen , at the study group for judaism there .
i asked the lady who leads it , ' why do you do this ? '
she was n't jewish , did n't have jewish ancestors .
none of them did .
she said she did it because her father had a close relationship to the jewish community and had been helped by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rabbi stopped at a thai buddhist center along the way have you found anything unexpected so far ?
well , walking in the lower rhineland up to cologne , i 've thought a lot about the shoah , obviously .
but i 've also been conscious that here was a thousand years of jewish creative history .
we were in a tiny village , st. goar .
and in that tiny rhineland village , the sefer ha-maharil , which is a key work in the progression of ashkenazy jewish law , was composed .
it still affects our practices today .
so , i had n't expected to feel such continuity with jewish culture as i have felt - this sense of jewish history , of learning , creativity , and study .
i expected to feel far more estranged .
your grandfather was german , and you speak excellent german although you yourself are english .
has this walk raised any thoughts about your own german ancestry ?
i 've been to germany many times before , but never for this long .
my grandfather loved the german jewish culture .
unlike many , he did n't teach us to hate germany .
he said we should differentiate between nazism and german culture .
i think there are a lot of questions to be asked about whether that differentiation could be made quite as neatly as that .
but that was certainly his attitude , so i have n't had to overcome an inner revulsion to being in germany - i never had it .
and i deeply do n't believe you can blame one generation for what another generation did .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the second fundraising walk wittenberg has taken with his dog , mitzpah but there is no doubt that there is a legacy .
and i think finding ways to face that legacy together as much as possible - you ca n't do it with major perpetrators - but with people who are struggling with what the past has meant to them , i think enabling that kind of conversation is very important .
was being on this trip during kristallnacht , the night of broken glass , part of your plan ?
on november 9 i 'll be in holland , since i 've been asked to speak there .
it would have made more sense to be in germany , but that 's where it worked out .
in any case i definitely wanted to be traveling the route on kristallnacht .
towards the end of the walk i pick up the route of the kindertransporte , -lsb- the name given to the movement to rescue some 10,000 jewish children from the nazis by sending them to live in the uk , just prior to the outbreak of world war ii ; eds . -rsb-
so that 's something i find deeply moving .
i 'm guessing you are something of a strange sight in the german countryside - a rabbi wearing a yarmulke and a backpack , with a dog in tow .
have you gotten some odd reactions ?
not at all - although people do keep stopping me to tell me that the flashlight in my backpack has been left on .
they do n't know i 've done it on purpose .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 09.11.2010 on pogrom anniversary , rabbi carries torch from germany to england großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wittenberg is spending three weeks on the road - with a flashlight and his dog on the 72nd anniversary of a major nazi pogrom against the jews , a british rabbi is embarking on a symbolic journey , carrying a flame from his grandfather 's synagogue in frankfurt to his own in london . rabbi jonathan wittenberg has lit a symbolic torch from the " everlasting light " of the westend synagogue in frankfurt , which inexplicably survived the destruction of the nazis on november 9 , 1938 .
wittenberg 's grandfather was a rabbi there during the so-called kristallnacht , or night of broken glass .
all throughout germany and austria , jewish homes , business , and synagogues were ransacked and thousands of jews were deported to concentration camps .
now , accompanied by his dog mitzpah , he is carrying the torch by foot and by ferry .
in london , he will use it to symbolically light the eternal flame of a new synagogue for his own congregation .
the three-week project also serves as a fundraiser to support a variety of charities and interfaith projects .
deutsche welle spoke with the rabbi in cologne , at the midway point through his walk .
deutsche welle : rabbi wittenberg , can you tell me where the idea came from to take this walk , and what the journey is really all about ?
jonathan wittenberg : it was really when i was rereading my grandfather 's memoirs , at the 70th anniversary of kristallnacht .
i just wanted to remember what had happened to him .
and i read there how he was called by the gestapo on the 10th of november , on the allegation that he had the keys to the westend synagogue , which he did n't . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rabbi stopped at maria-laach abbey , in germany 's eifel region he wrote that he came to the main synagogue ; the fire brigade was there , and they were doing nothing .
he heard people in the crowd say -lsb- … -rsb- that the interior of the westend synagogue had been destroyed - wrecked and trashed - but that the eternal light -lsb- a constant flame that is lit in every synagogue ; eds . -rsb- was still burning .
and people took that for a miracle .
this spoke to me .
my own synagogue is building a new building .
we 've been working on it for 15 years and it 's nearing completion .
and i had the thought , because i am a lover of walking , of coming to frankfurt , of lighting a symbolic flame , and bringing it back to london to light our new eternal light . so you made ' light ' the subject of your walk ?
i was very struck by this idea , of light that burns despite darkness .
it 's an image that speaks to me in all kinds of ways as a rabbi .
i encounter a lot of darkness people struggle with .
i see the courage of people in facing illness , in facing death .
i also see the courage of people in a political context .
one of the organizations i am supporting on this walk is the parents ' circle , made up of parents who 've lost children on both sides of the israeli-palestinian conflict .
this group of parents , instead of blaming the others , instead of hating , they 're saying , ' well , this is a message that we need understanding . '
tell me about the ' eternal light ' that you are carrying .
how did you get it , and how are you transporting it ?
very simply , it 's an electric torch - a flashlight .
it 's symbolic .
i 'm not an olympic runner , and nobody 's going to let me into a cafe along the way with a great big torch on fire .
but what i did n't want to do was just to come by plane and take the torch and just fly back .
there 's no substance to something like that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the route traverses german wine country the trip began at the westend synagogue on october 24 .
i was there with a group of about 20 people from london who came to share the start of the journey .
the ceremony where i took the light was simple , just a couple of verses : " god is my light , and my salvation . "
one of the people with us was a hazzan -lsb- a singer trained to accompany jewish religious services ; eds . -rsb- who very beautifully sang those verses .
coincidentally , that day was the celebration of the 100-year anniversary of the westend synagogue .
i was invited to speak .
it was very , very moving .
my grandfather - my mother 's father - had been the main rabbi there for almost 30 years .
he died in 1975 .
what do you feel you 've learned about light along the way so far ?
my understanding of the meaning of light is constantly growing and constantly changing .
and just as light expands , so my understanding of it has expanded .
there is the beautiful natural light , while walking along the main and rhine rivers .
and then there is the tremendous amount of kindness i 've met in very ordinary circumstances .
on the second day , i was walking with a friend of mine who is a protestant minister .
i needed something to eat , and we went into a place - it turned out to be in a castle along the hiking trail , a very posh place .
i asked , ' can i have some bread please ? '
and the man came back with a basket of fruit and all kinds of bread .
i took out my purse to pay , and he said , ' no , please take it .
it 's a gift . '
i had n't told him what i was doing but it was obvious that i was somehow … en route .
i 've encountered that kind of kindness all along .
that is a kind of light .
you 're not just trekking on this trip - you 're visiting various religious sites , holding talks with social-interest groups , and visiting jewish monuments .
has that added to your understanding of light ?
yes .
there have been moments of contact with people who are engaged with what was the jewish past in germany .
we stopped in the town of bingen , at the study group for judaism there .
i asked the lady who leads it , ' why do you do this ? '
she was n't jewish , did n't have jewish ancestors .
none of them did .
she said she did it because her father had a close relationship to the jewish community and had been helped by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rabbi stopped at a thai buddhist center along the way have you found anything unexpected so far ?
well , walking in the lower rhineland up to cologne , i 've thought a lot about the shoah , obviously .
but i 've also been conscious that here was a thousand years of jewish creative history .
we were in a tiny village , st. goar .
and in that tiny rhineland village , the sefer ha-maharil , which is a key work in the progression of ashkenazy jewish law , was composed .
it still affects our practices today .
so , i had n't expected to feel such continuity with jewish culture as i have felt - this sense of jewish history , of learning , creativity , and study .
i expected to feel far more estranged .
your grandfather was german , and you speak excellent german although you yourself are english .
has this walk raised any thoughts about your own german ancestry ?
i 've been to germany many times before , but never for this long .
my grandfather loved the german jewish culture .
unlike many , he did n't teach us to hate germany .
he said we should differentiate between nazism and german culture .
i think there are a lot of questions to be asked about whether that differentiation could be made quite as neatly as that .
but that was certainly his attitude , so i have n't had to overcome an inner revulsion to being in germany - i never had it .
and i deeply do n't believe you can blame one generation for what another generation did .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the second fundraising walk wittenberg has taken with his dog , mitzpah but there is no doubt that there is a legacy .
and i think finding ways to face that legacy together as much as possible - you ca n't do it with major perpetrators - but with people who are struggling with what the past has meant to them , i think enabling that kind of conversation is very important .
was being on this trip during kristallnacht , the night of broken glass , part of your plan ?
on november 9 i 'll be in holland , since i 've been asked to speak there .
it would have made more sense to be in germany , but that 's where it worked out .
in any case i definitely wanted to be traveling the route on kristallnacht .
towards the end of the walk i pick up the route of the kindertransporte , -lsb- the name given to the movement to rescue some 10,000 jewish children from the nazis by sending them to live in the uk , just prior to the outbreak of world war ii ; eds . -rsb-
so that 's something i find deeply moving .
i 'm guessing you are something of a strange sight in the german countryside - a rabbi wearing a yarmulke and a backpack , with a dog in tow .
have you gotten some odd reactions ?
not at all - although people do keep stopping me to tell me that the flashlight in my backpack has been left on .
they do n't know i 've done it on purpose .

after nearly two days of blocking a nuclear waste storage site , thousands of protestors have been cleared from the area by police and the transport of 11 containers of nuclear waste has arrived at its destination . police cleared thousands of anti-nuclear activists from roads leading to the nuclear storage facility in gorleben , northern germany on tuesday morning , allowing for the final arrival of 123 tons of nuclear waste .
about 3,000 demonstrators staged a 44-hour sit-in in front of the storage site , including high-level politicians such as green party co-chair claudia roth .
activists from the environmentalist organization greenpeace used a truck disguised as a vehicle carrying beer to block the freight train station in nearby dannenberg , where the waste containers were to be moved to trucks for the final 20 kilometers to the storage site .
two greenpeace activists delayed the transport by about 11 hours by encasing themselves in a cement block , making it so the police could not move them without injuring them .
authorities managed to free the activists early tuesday morning , and the first truck carrying the nuclear waste departed dannenberg at around 8:30 a.m.
the last of the trucks arrived at the storage facility at about 9:50 a.m.
bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists held up the trucks carrying the waste for 11 hours stop-and-go traffic large protests have taken place during past nuclear waste transport operations , but none have delayed the shipment of the waste as much as the most recent .
the waste originated from nuclear reactors in germany and was sent to a plant in northern france for reprocessing .
the waste containers , called " castors " -lrb- cask for storage and transport of radioactive material -rrb- , left france by train on friday afternoon , but were quickly stopped by the first blockade of activists on the train tracks .
the following days were a tedious stop-and-go game , as protestors blocked the train tracks and some of the 16,000 police officers mobilized to secure the transport removed them .
protests to continue leaders of the various " citizens ' initiatives " against nuclear power claimed victory on tuesday , despite the successful transport of the nuclear waste , and some vowed to continue protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors succeeded in delaying the transport on historic levels " we 've shown that we 're a force to be reckoned with , " said kerstin rudek , chairwoman of the citizens ' initiative for environmental protection luechow-dannenberg .
matthias miersch , environment spokesman for the opposition social democrats in parliament , said the movement against the nuclear waste transport was a " very impressive demonstration . "
" this was a very clear signal to the government that this atomic energy policy can not go on , " he told phoenix public television .
" politicians have to understand that decisions are being made now that the people are absolutely unable to relate to . "
transport to russia meanwhile munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that germany had negotiated a deal " ready to be signed " to ship nuclear waste originating from an old atomic research facility in former east germany to russia .
the report said a total of 951 nuclear fuel elements from the east german research center dresden-rossendorf , which have been in temporary storage since 2005 , would be shipped to the mayak atomic complex in the southern urals for reprocessing .
the waste would stay in russia for permanent storage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mayak facility in russia is to reprocess east germany 's radioactive waste the report said the basis for the transport deal was a previous agreement between the united states and russia , which regulates the transport of nuclear waste from reactors that were overseen by the soviet union .
germany 's goal was reportedly to " reduce the amount of highly-enriched uranium as much as possible . "
the deal received criticism from the green party , which has profited politically from a strong anti-nuclear sentiment in germany .
" cheap before safe , that 's what this is about , " green party spokeswoman sylvia kotting-uhl told the newspaper .

we did n't understand why , because in the us , you think ' oh , we 're the liberators , " ' shepherd told detusche welle .
" but what was going on with the kidnappings , the rapes , and abu ghraib - the population just wanted us out of there . "
unexpected turn shepherd had never planned to make a career of the military .
in his 20 's , his dream of studying computer science fell by the wayside after he could n't afford to keep paying tuition at kent state university in ohio .
for a while , he lived in his car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lake chiemsee is known for its sunsets and alpine beauty , not political drama " i ended up being homeless for about a year , and i joined the military because it was the only way to get a job out of cleveland , " said the ohio native .
after his first tour of duty in iraq , shepherd returned to the base in germany , where he started doing internet research on the iraq war .
gradually , he became convinced that the us-led invasion was a human rights violation .
that was the moment of truth , says shepherd . " i had to decide , ok , do i just go back to the war , knowing what i 'm doing is wrong , that it 's murder , or do i go against the world 's most powerful government and have a lot of problems , be ostracized from society ? "
it took him ten days to make up his mind .
in april 2007 , shepherd walked off the base .
a risky move germany is a main staging post for the us military , with around 60,000 us troops stationed there .
each year , some of those soldiers go awol -lrb- absent without official leave -rrb- .
many get picked up by the german police and sent back to their bases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shepherd refused to take part in a war he calls illegal shepherd avoided being caught .
he did n't contact his family , relying on local friends and the occasional odd job to survive .
after 19 months , he decided to turn himself in and apply for political asylum .
if his application is successful , shepherd will become the first us iraq war veteran to receive political asylum in germany , says rudi friedrich , head of the pacifist organization connection .
friedrich 's organization , which he runs out of his home in a suburb of frankfurt , offers support to conscientious objectors and war deserters and has been guiding shepherd through the asylum-seeking process .
" the recognition that one is not alone is an important experience for a deserter to regain his self-esteem , to be able to say , ' yes , i did make the right choice , i do n't want to shoot at my neighbor , " ' friedrich told deutsche welle .
shepherd 's asylum application cites a 2004 european union regulation that grants refugee status to any soldier who is in danger of being prosecuted if his or her military service " would include crimes or acts " which violate international law .
but some fear granting shepherd asylum could create an easy way out for americans stationed in germany who want to avoid combat duty in iraq .
that 's not likely , says friedrich , because asylum cases are considered individually .
friedrich explains , " if andre shepherd is granted asylum , than that decision will take the form of a letter , exactly one page , with a letterhead .
and it will say , ' in light of the document submitted , andre shepherd is granted asylum . '
that 's it - there is no explanation or rationalization .
so it 's not a political stance , unless you say , the recognition of the asylum application is in and of itself a political stance . "
the waiting game even if his application is granted , shepherd will likely face jail time if he ever attempts to return to the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a decision in shepherd 's case is expected by the end of the year fortunately , shepherd says he feels at home in the tiny town of prien-am-chiemsee . he 's married to a german woman , and works part-time installing solar paneling for her parent 's company .
he also attends daily language classes as part of an integration course .
in september , the berlin newspaper die tageszeitung awarded him its panther prize for his courage in deserting .
shepherd says he feels optimistic , and says he sees parallels between his own case and the lessons of the nuremburg trials .
says shepherd , " if your government is committing war crimes , and you 're taking part knowing that these are crimes , then there is no excuse .
even if you 're just a low ranking soldier , if you 're taking part , then you 're guilty too . "

after months living undercover in picturesque chiemsee , he 's now trying to get political aslyum . tucked away on the border of germany and austria , lake chiemsee has long been popular with holiday-makers .
but now the idyllic alpine region has become the unlikely backdrop for the story of a man wandering into uncharted political territory . in 2007 , andre shepherd walked off the us army base where he was stationed in southern germany .
the apache helicopter mechanic said his experiences on duty in iraq convinced him he could no longer support the war .

" the exports sector remains the driving force behind the country 's economic recovery , " said anton boerner , president of the federation of german wholesale , foreign trade and services .

despite releasing disappointing figures , the economics ministry in berlin insisted that germany 's economic recovery was not in danger .

at the same time , unemployment dropped to 7.5 percent in the seasonally adjusted term .

yet despite booming export rates , the country 's economic growth appears to be headed for a setback . german exports have reached their highest level in more than two years .
according to figures released by the federal statistics office on monday , sales abroad rose by three percent to 84.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 117.4 billion -rrb- .
" the exports sector remains the driving force behind the country 's economic recovery , " said anton boerner , president of the federation of german wholesale , foreign trade and services .

instead of a predicted 0.5 percent increase , industrial output in october dropped by 0.8 percent compared to the previous month .
despite releasing disappointing figures , the economics ministry in berlin insisted that germany 's economic recovery was not in danger .
berlin insists overall trend is positive " industrial production is still trending upwards .
in the third quarter , output could again rise above the level of the second quarter , when we saw strong growth , " the ministry said in a statement . in september , berlin had raised its 2010 growth forecast to 3.4 percent , following a crippling contraction of 4.7 percent in 2009 .
at the same time , unemployment dropped to 7.5 percent in the seasonally adjusted term .

after nearly two days of blocking a nuclear waste storage site , thousands of protestors have been cleared from the area by police and the transport of 11 containers of nuclear waste has arrived at its destination . police cleared thousands of anti-nuclear activists from roads leading to the nuclear storage facility in gorleben , northern germany on tuesday morning , allowing for the final arrival of 123 tons of nuclear waste .
about 3,000 demonstrators staged a 44-hour sit-in in front of the storage site , including high-level politicians such as green party co-chair claudia roth .
activists from the environmentalist organization greenpeace used a truck disguised as a vehicle carrying beer to block the freight train station in nearby dannenberg , where the waste containers were to be moved to trucks for the final 20 kilometers to the storage site .
two greenpeace activists delayed the transport by about 11 hours by encasing themselves in a cement block , making it so the police could not move them without injuring them .
authorities managed to free the activists early tuesday morning , and the first truck carrying the nuclear waste departed dannenberg at around 8:30 a.m.
the last of the trucks arrived at the storage facility at about 9:50 a.m.
bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists held up the trucks carrying the waste for 11 hours stop-and-go traffic large protests have taken place during past nuclear waste transport operations , but none have delayed the shipment of the waste as much as the most recent .
the waste originated from nuclear reactors in germany and was sent to a plant in northern france for reprocessing .
the waste containers , called " castors " -lrb- cask for storage and transport of radioactive material -rrb- , left france by train on friday afternoon , but were quickly stopped by the first blockade of activists on the train tracks .
the following days were a tedious stop-and-go game , as protestors blocked the train tracks and some of the 16,000 police officers mobilized to secure the transport removed them .
protests to continue leaders of the various " citizens ' initiatives " against nuclear power claimed victory on tuesday , despite the successful transport of the nuclear waste , and some vowed to continue protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors succeeded in delaying the transport on historic levels " we 've shown that we 're a force to be reckoned with , " said kerstin rudek , chairwoman of the citizens ' initiative for environmental protection luechow-dannenberg .
matthias miersch , environment spokesman for the opposition social democrats in parliament , said the movement against the nuclear waste transport was a " very impressive demonstration . "
" this was a very clear signal to the government that this atomic energy policy can not go on , " he told phoenix public television .
" politicians have to understand that decisions are being made now that the people are absolutely unable to relate to . "
transport to russia meanwhile munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that germany had negotiated a deal " ready to be signed " to ship nuclear waste originating from an old atomic research facility in former east germany to russia .
the report said a total of 951 nuclear fuel elements from the east german research center dresden-rossendorf , which have been in temporary storage since 2005 , would be shipped to the mayak atomic complex in the southern urals for reprocessing .
the waste would stay in russia for permanent storage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mayak facility in russia is to reprocess east germany 's radioactive waste the report said the basis for the transport deal was a previous agreement between the united states and russia , which regulates the transport of nuclear waste from reactors that were overseen by the soviet union .
germany 's goal was reportedly to " reduce the amount of highly-enriched uranium as much as possible . "
the deal received criticism from the green party , which has profited politically from a strong anti-nuclear sentiment in germany .
" cheap before safe , that 's what this is about , " green party spokeswoman sylvia kotting-uhl told the newspaper .

after nearly two days of blocking a nuclear waste storage site , thousands of protestors have been cleared from the area by police and the transport of 11 containers of nuclear waste has arrived at its destination . police cleared thousands of anti-nuclear activists from roads leading to the nuclear storage facility in gorleben , northern germany on tuesday morning , allowing for the final arrival of 123 tons of nuclear waste .
about 3,000 demonstrators staged a 44-hour sit-in in front of the storage site , including high-level politicians such as green party co-chair claudia roth .
activists from the environmentalist organization greenpeace used a truck disguised as a vehicle carrying beer to block the freight train station in nearby dannenberg , where the waste containers were to be moved to trucks for the final 20 kilometers to the storage site .
two greenpeace activists delayed the transport by about 11 hours by encasing themselves in a cement block , making it so the police could not move them without injuring them .
authorities managed to free the activists early tuesday morning , and the first truck carrying the nuclear waste departed dannenberg at around 8:30 a.m.
the last of the trucks arrived at the storage facility at about 9:50 a.m.
bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists held up the trucks carrying the waste for 11 hours stop-and-go traffic large protests have taken place during past nuclear waste transport operations , but none have delayed the shipment of the waste as much as the most recent .
the waste originated from nuclear reactors in germany and was sent to a plant in northern france for reprocessing .
the waste containers , called " castors " -lrb- cask for storage and transport of radioactive material -rrb- , left france by train on friday afternoon , but were quickly stopped by the first blockade of activists on the train tracks .
the following days were a tedious stop-and-go game , as protestors blocked the train tracks and some of the 16,000 police officers mobilized to secure the transport removed them .
protests to continue leaders of the various " citizens ' initiatives " against nuclear power claimed victory on tuesday , despite the successful transport of the nuclear waste , and some vowed to continue protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors succeeded in delaying the transport on historic levels " we 've shown that we 're a force to be reckoned with , " said kerstin rudek , chairwoman of the citizens ' initiative for environmental protection luechow-dannenberg .
matthias miersch , environment spokesman for the opposition social democrats in parliament , said the movement against the nuclear waste transport was a " very impressive demonstration . "
" this was a very clear signal to the government that this atomic energy policy can not go on , " he told phoenix public television .
" politicians have to understand that decisions are being made now that the people are absolutely unable to relate to . "
transport to russia meanwhile munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that germany had negotiated a deal " ready to be signed " to ship nuclear waste originating from an old atomic research facility in former east germany to russia .
the report said a total of 951 nuclear fuel elements from the east german research center dresden-rossendorf , which have been in temporary storage since 2005 , would be shipped to the mayak atomic complex in the southern urals for reprocessing .
the waste would stay in russia for permanent storage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mayak facility in russia is to reprocess east germany 's radioactive waste the report said the basis for the transport deal was a previous agreement between the united states and russia , which regulates the transport of nuclear waste from reactors that were overseen by the soviet union .
germany 's goal was reportedly to " reduce the amount of highly-enriched uranium as much as possible . "
the deal received criticism from the green party , which has profited politically from a strong anti-nuclear sentiment in germany .
" cheap before safe , that 's what this is about , " green party spokeswoman sylvia kotting-uhl told the newspaper .

but the atmosphere in the country where he spent four years of his childhood is subdued . indonesians were ecstatic when barack obama won the us presidential elections and looked forward to his visit enthusiastically .
however , he cancelled twice – last march because of his difficulties getting through his health reform bill and again in june because of the oil spill in the gulf of mexico .
this time round , he has finally made it , but indonesians on the street are not so excited any more .
" i hope that more investors will come to indonesia from the us if obama encourages this .
but i am not that optimistic any more .
the japanese are investing more here than the americans .
we 're not expecting that much from his trip this time , " said one man .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the official welcome " let 's see .
we celebrated him before and that did n't bring us much .
the atmosphere is more pessimistic now .
lots of people still like him but he has fewer fans than before , " another man explained .
from nostalgic trip to business as usual obama 's trip was supposed to be an emotional trip into the past .
he planned to bring his children with him and visit his old school in jakarta but the focus of his visit has changed , becoming business as usual .
" obama has said that indonesia could play an important role as a bridge between the west and the muslim world , " political scientist hariadi wirawan pointed out .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama meets with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono " if he really wanted that he should have taken more time to speak to our religious leaders .
he should also speak in more detail about the ties between our two countries .
this time , only a short visit is planned .
people here think that he is less interested in indonesia now . "
indonesians disappointed by obama 's foreign policy moreover , experts say obama 's foreign policy does not differ much from that of his predecessor and that a lot of people are disenchanted with the us president .
as hariadi wirawan puts it : " in the middle east , the us has the same policies as before .
not much has changed .
in terms of economics , the americans do n't seem to have shown much interest in the needs of the developing countries .
that 's how people see it here .
this trip is not very important if it is all talk and there are no concrete results . "

he will also visit the national soldiers ' cemetery and lay down a wreath to mark indonesia 's heroes ' day .
his trip will end with a public speech at the university as part of us plans to step up support for education in indonesia .

these types of ultra-high-speed smash-ups at the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- are an attempt to re-create the explosion , known as the big bang , which is believed to have begun the universe .
as spokeswoman barbara warmbein told the associated press , the cern experiment over the weekend produced " a very , very , very small bang . "
lead ions are lead atoms whose electrons have been removed , and are much heavier than the protons that the researchers had been using .
that may be beneficial , as the energy required to smash them is higher , and thus may be closer to the conditions the scientists are trying to analyze .
as the research continues , scientists are trying to create " quark-gluon plasma , " an extremely hot and dense type of matter that may unlock some secrets in the early universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lead ion experiments will continue until cern shuts down for the winter on december 6 " the experiments are already providing an exciting glimpse of the new frontier , " sergio bertolucci , cern 's director for research and computing , told afp news agency .
major breakthroughs ' could take years ' the lhc is comprised of a circular , 27-kilometer -lrb- 17-mile -rrb- atom-smasher that cost four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- to build near geneva .
it began operations in september 2008 .
beyond pushing the limits of particle physics , the team is also exploring the frontier of data storage and transfer .
cern is currently using 140 computer centers spread across 34 countries to back up and analyze its data , which is being transferred at peak rates of 10 gigabytes per second , or the equivalent of approximately two dvds per second .
still , warmbein added that it will likely be months , if not years , before cern scientists make any major breakthroughs .

these types of ultra-high-speed smash-ups at the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- are an attempt to re-create the explosion , known as the big bang , which is believed to have begun the universe .
as spokeswoman barbara warmbein told the associated press , the cern experiment over the weekend produced " a very , very , very small bang . "
lead ions are lead atoms whose electrons have been removed , and are much heavier than the protons that the researchers had been using .
that may be beneficial , as the energy required to smash them is higher , and thus may be closer to the conditions the scientists are trying to analyze .
as the research continues , scientists are trying to create " quark-gluon plasma , " an extremely hot and dense type of matter that may unlock some secrets in the early universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lead ion experiments will continue until cern shuts down for the winter on december 6 " the experiments are already providing an exciting glimpse of the new frontier , " sergio bertolucci , cern 's director for research and computing , told afp news agency .
major breakthroughs ' could take years ' the lhc is comprised of a circular , 27-kilometer -lrb- 17-mile -rrb- atom-smasher that cost four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- to build near geneva .
it began operations in september 2008 .
beyond pushing the limits of particle physics , the team is also exploring the frontier of data storage and transfer .
cern is currently using 140 computer centers spread across 34 countries to back up and analyze its data , which is being transferred at peak rates of 10 gigabytes per second , or the equivalent of approximately two dvds per second .
still , warmbein added that it will likely be months , if not years , before cern scientists make any major breakthroughs .

the key speaker at the event was a controversial choice , attacked by german jewish groups for his criticism of israel .
the 1938 kristallnacht is considered to be the first nazi-sanctioned nation-wide attack against jews .
mobs sought out and torched jewish-owned shops , homes and synagogues around the country .
many were murdered , while tens of thousands were deported to nazi concentration camps .
key speaker at the frankfurt st paul 's church ceremony was german-born french author alfred grosser .
as expected , grosser launched into a critique of israeli policies towards the palestinians , saying it could not be expected that those in gaza could " understand the horror of assassinations , if you do not show great sympathy in understanding the suffering in the gaza strip . "
the announcement that grosser would speak at the anniversary ceremony had led to fierce objections from germany 's central council of jews and others in the country 's jewish community .
many threatened to walk out of the proceedings if grosser entered into a diatribe against the jewish state .
grosser said he felt justified in criticizing israel as he considered the country to be part of europe , adding that everybody should be held accountable to western values .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grosser has taken an interest in the israel-palestine conflict despite the 85-year-old 's comments , none of the attendees at the service walked out .
members of the central council of jews attending the ceremony said grosser had not crossed the line in his speech .

the political scientist and author of numerous books and essays is seen as an important pioneer in post-war franco-german understanding .
in recent years he has become increasingly interested in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
his 2009 book " von auschwitz nach jerusalem " -lrb- from auschwitz to jerusalem -rrb- caused controversy as he dealt with the permissibility of questioning the policies of israel .
meanwhile , the president of the central council of jews in germany has used the kristallnacht anniversary to warn of rising anti-semitism in the country .
president charlotte knobloch called for more civil courage from germans to fight xenophobia and anti-semitism .
she stressed that young germans should take a more active roll in remembering the crimes of the nazi era .

the key speaker at the event was a controversial choice , attacked by german jewish groups for his criticism of israel .
the 1938 kristallnacht is considered to be the first nazi-sanctioned nation-wide attack against jews .
mobs sought out and torched jewish-owned shops , homes and synagogues around the country .
many were murdered , while tens of thousands were deported to nazi concentration camps .
key speaker at the frankfurt st paul 's church ceremony was german-born french author alfred grosser .
as expected , grosser launched into a critique of israeli policies towards the palestinians , saying it could not be expected that those in gaza could " understand the horror of assassinations , if you do not show great sympathy in understanding the suffering in the gaza strip . "
the announcement that grosser would speak at the anniversary ceremony had led to fierce objections from germany 's central council of jews and others in the country 's jewish community .
many threatened to walk out of the proceedings if grosser entered into a diatribe against the jewish state .
grosser said he felt justified in criticizing israel as he considered the country to be part of europe , adding that everybody should be held accountable to western values .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grosser has taken an interest in the israel-palestine conflict despite the 85-year-old 's comments , none of the attendees at the service walked out .
members of the central council of jews attending the ceremony said grosser had not crossed the line in his speech .
focus on israel grosser comes from a jewish family which immigrated to france in 1933 .
the political scientist and author of numerous books and essays is seen as an important pioneer in post-war franco-german understanding .
in recent years he has become increasingly interested in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
his 2009 book " von auschwitz nach jerusalem " -lrb- from auschwitz to jerusalem -rrb- caused controversy as he dealt with the permissibility of questioning the policies of israel .
meanwhile , the president of the central council of jews in germany has used the kristallnacht anniversary to warn of rising anti-semitism in the country .
president charlotte knobloch called for more civil courage from germans to fight xenophobia and anti-semitism .
she stressed that young germans should take a more active roll in remembering the crimes of the nazi era .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 09.11.2010 black market is corrupting efforts to save tuna , report says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blue fin tuna are top predators and play a crucial role in balancing the oceans ' ecosystem a team of investigative reporters has revealed a flourishing illicit trade in bluefin tuna .
after months of digging , their probe suggests governments and regulators have willingly turned a blind eye to the problem . it is no secret that the past decade has seen sushi gain popularity in the western world , but the methods for feeding this appetite have been kept fairly well hidden .
until now .
in a report detailing the findings of its seven-month long probe into the business of bluefin tuna fishing , the international consortium of investigative journalists -lrb- icij -rrb- has unveiled a culture of over-exploitation , tacitly approved by government authorities .
the report details systematic over-fishing , falsely reported catch volumes , ignored bans of spotter planes to track down schools of tuna and illegal sales of national quotas from one vessel to another .
all told , the investigation paints a bleak picture in which thousands of tons of fish were illegally hauled between 1998 and 2007 - as many as one in every three bluefin tuna may have been caught illegally during this period .
the report also unveils a complex network of fishing fleets , farms , ministries and distributors from countries such as france , spain , italy , turkey and japan involved in the creation of a flourishing black market trade .
the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- said the inquiry had confirmed its repeated warnings of widespread illegalities .
" no consumer , no business , no government can be sure they are dealing with responsibly caught and traded bluefin tuna , " sergi tudela , head of fisheries at wwf mediterranean said in a statement .
" the whole chain is tarnished . "
parallels to the drug trade bildunterschrift : quotas for tuna are being flouted and authorities are looking away , investigators say .
eastern atlantic bluefin tuna are a catch in more than one sense of the word .
one large tuna , which can be three meters long and weigh more than 500 kilos , can fetch as much as 71,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- on the japanese market , the source of most of the world 's demand for tuna .
as marine biologist , daniel pauly told the icij , the promise of a slice of such wealth is too enticing for many to resist .
" fisheries are one of the most criminalized sectors in the world , " pauly said .
" this generates so much money that it 's like drugs . "
the report said the black market trade in tuna was worth at least $ 4 billion -lrb- 2.9 billion euros -rrb- between 1998 and 2007 .
while mostly taking aim at suppliers and the governments that turned a blind eye to their exporters ' behaviour , the report also reveals how japanese dealers evaded tuna quotas by importing tuna as another species of fish , only to re-label them as tuna at market . as the demand for the fish has grown , the industry has evolved in an increasingly detrimental way .

in a report detailing the findings of its seven-month long probe into the business of bluefin tuna fishing , the international consortium of investigative journalists -lrb- icij -rrb- has unveiled a culture of over-exploitation , tacitly approved by government authorities .
the report details systematic over-fishing , falsely reported catch volumes , ignored bans of spotter planes to track down schools of tuna and illegal sales of national quotas from one vessel to another .
all told , the investigation paints a bleak picture in which thousands of tons of fish were illegally hauled between 1998 and 2007 - as many as one in every three bluefin tuna may have been caught illegally during this period .
the report also unveils a complex network of fishing fleets , farms , ministries and distributors from countries such as france , spain , italy , turkey and japan involved in the creation of a flourishing black market trade .
the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- said the inquiry had confirmed its repeated warnings of widespread illegalities .

" fisheries are one of the most criminalized sectors in the world , " pauly said .
" this generates so much money that it 's like drugs . "
the report said the black market trade in tuna was worth at least $ 4 billion -lrb- 2.9 billion euros -rrb- between 1998 and 2007 .
while mostly taking aim at suppliers and the governments that turned a blind eye to their exporters ' behaviour , the report also reveals how japanese dealers evaded tuna quotas by importing tuna as another species of fish , only to re-label them as tuna at market . as the demand for the fish has grown , the industry has evolved in an increasingly detrimental way .

in a report detailing the findings of its seven-month long probe into the business of bluefin tuna fishing , the international consortium of investigative journalists -lrb- icij -rrb- has unveiled a culture of over-exploitation , tacitly approved by government authorities .
the report details systematic over-fishing , falsely reported catch volumes , ignored bans of spotter planes to track down schools of tuna and illegal sales of national quotas from one vessel to another .
all told , the investigation paints a bleak picture in which thousands of tons of fish were illegally hauled between 1998 and 2007 - as many as one in every three bluefin tuna may have been caught illegally during this period .
the report also unveils a complex network of fishing fleets , farms , ministries and distributors from countries such as france , spain , italy , turkey and japan involved in the creation of a flourishing black market trade .
the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- said the inquiry had confirmed its repeated warnings of widespread illegalities .
" no consumer , no business , no government can be sure they are dealing with responsibly caught and traded bluefin tuna , " sergi tudela , head of fisheries at wwf mediterranean said in a statement .
" the whole chain is tarnished . "
parallels to the drug trade bildunterschrift : quotas for tuna are being flouted and authorities are looking away , investigators say .
eastern atlantic bluefin tuna are a catch in more than one sense of the word .
one large tuna , which can be three meters long and weigh more than 500 kilos , can fetch as much as 71,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- on the japanese market , the source of most of the world 's demand for tuna .
as marine biologist , daniel pauly told the icij , the promise of a slice of such wealth is too enticing for many to resist .
" fisheries are one of the most criminalized sectors in the world , " pauly said .
" this generates so much money that it 's like drugs . "
the report said the black market trade in tuna was worth at least $ 4 billion -lrb- 2.9 billion euros -rrb- between 1998 and 2007 .
while mostly taking aim at suppliers and the governments that turned a blind eye to their exporters ' behaviour , the report also reveals how japanese dealers evaded tuna quotas by importing tuna as another species of fish , only to re-label them as tuna at market . as the demand for the fish has grown , the industry has evolved in an increasingly detrimental way .
tuna farms have sprung up throughout the mediterranean , fishermen regularly plunder stocks in spawning areas and more boats – often subsidised at taxpayers ' expense – have been put to sea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the demand for tuna stems from japan , though fishing occurs internationally fish stocks dwindling the report singles out the burgeoning practice of purse-seining - in which entire schools of fish are encircled by vast nets and dragged to farms to be harvested .
as a consequence , numbers of bluefin tuna , which play a crucial role at the top of the marine food chain , have plummeted by almost three quarters over the past four decades , while the size of the average captured bluefin tuna has almost halved .
" if we want to continue being able to fish bluefin tuna at all , we need to backtrack 20 years , " gemma parkes , a spokeswoman for wwf mediterranean , told deutsche welle .
the extent of the problem first surfaced in 2007 when france was revealed to have caught almost twice the quota it is allowed under the international commission for the conservation of the atlantic tunas -lrb- iccat -rrb- – the tuna fishing industry 's watchdog .
the fishermen involved in the case were charged , and the regulatory body responded by introducing a new system , known as the bluefin tuna catch document -lrb- bcd -rrb- , to help monitor catch sizes .
but the team of investigative reporters at the icij says this system is full of so many holes that the data it gathers is practically useless .
moreover the wwf says it has seen evidence to prove that the bluefin industry still suffers from plenty of illegal activity bildunterschrift : a smaller specimen just minutes away from becoming sushi tougher measures this week , the iccat commission is meeting in paris to consider the current situation and find solutions .
exactly what shape these could take is far from clear , but parkes says the answers are simple .
" we are pushing for quotas to be cut from 13,500 to between zero and 6,000 tons , for a phasing out of purse-seining and the establishment of ' no fishing zones ' in spawning areas . "
to lend weight to its demands , the wwf has gathered the support of businesses and restaurants that have agreed to remove bluefin tuna from their shelves and menus until the stocks have had a chance to replenish .
exactly when that might be , nobody can tell , but parkes insists that the wwf 's suggestions would at the very least give the coveted species a much-needed break .
" there has been a depressingly widespread lack of control and respect for rules , " parkes said .
" but these rules would be so clear cut that they would be easy to police . "

the agency , the energy arm of the organization for economic cooperation and development , a grouping of the world 's richest nations , forecast that global oil demand will rise to 99 million barrels a day by 2035 , some 15 million barrels a day higher than last year .
" the message is clear , the price will go up , especially if consuming countries do not make changes in the way they consume oil , especially in the transport sector , " the iea 's chief economist and lead author of the report , fatih birol told reuters in an interview .
oil prices will exceed $ 200 -lrb- 144 euro -rrb- a barrel by 2035 , and will likely stay over $ 100 a barrel after 2015 , the report said .
on tuesday the price of oil stood at roughly $ 87 a barrel .
china drives demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace wants even more emphasis on renewables china and other emerging economies are driving demand for oil higher .
" all the net growth comes from non-oecd countries , almost half from china alone , mainly driven by rising use of transport fuels , " the iea said in the report .
oil subsidies were limiting the scope for higher prices to choke off demand and change consumer habits , the iea said , and called for oil subsidies to be reduced .
" if subsidy policy does not change , with increasing price assumptions , these $ 312 billion in subsidies for 2009 will reach $ 600 billion in 2015 .
that 's huge , " birol said .
the report estimated that renewable energy only receives $ 57 billion in subsidies , a fraction of the ongoing support for the fossil fuel sector .
eradicating fossil fuel subsidies would boost the global economy , environment and energy security , the iea said , referring to a pledge made by g20 countries .
g20 leaders committed in pittsburgh in 2009 to phase out , over the medium-term , inefficient fossil fuel subsidies which distort the energy market and encourage wasteful consumption .
a g20 meeting in seoul this week may update progress on fossil fuels . greenpeace welcomed the iea 's call to cut the $ 312 billion in global fossil fuel subsidies .
" the iea report clearly states that fossil fuels are heavily subsidized … leading to unfair competition with clean and climate friendly renewable energies .
we welcome that renewables are now in the focus of the 2010 edition , " said sven teske , renewable energy director at greenpeace international , in a press release .
gas glut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surplus of gas may hinder development in renewable energy the future of renewable energy depended on strong government support , said the iea report , especially given an expected " ten year glut in gas " which would suppress fossil fuel power prices and make renewables look even less competitive .
" the gas glut will be with us ten more years , " birol told reuters .
" cheaper gas prices will put additional pressure on renewable energies especially in the us and europe .
if natural gas is as plenty and cheap as we think , then life for renewables will be even more difficult , " he added although greenpeace praised the iea for making renewable energy more prominent in this year 's report , teske from greenpeace international criticized the iea 's emphasis on other energy sources such as nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- for coal power stations .
" the iea is failing to shift technology recommendations from unproven , dangerous and expensive technologies such as ccs and nuclear power plants , " teske said .
greenpeace would like to see more emphasis on renewable energy and greater efficiency to reduce co2 emissions .

china drives demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace wants even more emphasis on renewables china and other emerging economies are driving demand for oil higher .
" all the net growth comes from non-oecd countries , almost half from china alone , mainly driven by rising use of transport fuels , " the iea said in the report .
oil subsidies were limiting the scope for higher prices to choke off demand and change consumer habits , the iea said , and called for oil subsidies to be reduced .
" if subsidy policy does not change , with increasing price assumptions , these $ 312 billion in subsidies for 2009 will reach $ 600 billion in 2015 .
that 's huge , " birol said .
the report estimated that renewable energy only receives $ 57 billion in subsidies , a fraction of the ongoing support for the fossil fuel sector .
eradicating fossil fuel subsidies would boost the global economy , environment and energy security , the iea said , referring to a pledge made by g20 countries .
g20 leaders committed in pittsburgh in 2009 to phase out , over the medium-term , inefficient fossil fuel subsidies which distort the energy market and encourage wasteful consumption .
a g20 meeting in seoul this week may update progress on fossil fuels . greenpeace welcomed the iea 's call to cut the $ 312 billion in global fossil fuel subsidies .
" the iea report clearly states that fossil fuels are heavily subsidized … leading to unfair competition with clean and climate friendly renewable energies .
we welcome that renewables are now in the focus of the 2010 edition , " said sven teske , renewable energy director at greenpeace international , in a press release .
gas glut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surplus of gas may hinder development in renewable energy the future of renewable energy depended on strong government support , said the iea report , especially given an expected " ten year glut in gas " which would suppress fossil fuel power prices and make renewables look even less competitive .
" the gas glut will be with us ten more years , " birol told reuters .
" cheaper gas prices will put additional pressure on renewable energies especially in the us and europe .
if natural gas is as plenty and cheap as we think , then life for renewables will be even more difficult , " he added although greenpeace praised the iea for making renewable energy more prominent in this year 's report , teske from greenpeace international criticized the iea 's emphasis on other energy sources such as nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- for coal power stations .
" the iea is failing to shift technology recommendations from unproven , dangerous and expensive technologies such as ccs and nuclear power plants , " teske said .
greenpeace would like to see more emphasis on renewable energy and greater efficiency to reduce co2 emissions .

nonnenmacher was recently implicated in a spying scandal at the bank . the axe appears to be about to fall on the head of one of germany 's powerful state banks , hsh nordbank , after the lender 's major shareholders asked its supervisory board to give scandal-plagued ceo dirk jens nonnenmacher the sack .
nonnenmacher 's tenure as hsh chief was thrown into doubt after he was implicated in allegations of spying at the state-controlled bank .
the 47-year-old has also been investigated by prosecutors over risky investments that led to the bank losing millions of euros .
hsh nordbank 's biggest investors , the states of schleswig-holstein and hamburg , have reportedly asked the bank 's supervisory board chairman hilmar kopper to begin proceedings to find a new ceo for the lender .
in a written statement , the state governments said nonnenmacher 's dismissal was necessary to " win back lost trust " in hsh , whose main commercial focus is on shipping , transportation , real estate and renewable energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nonnenmacher has been in the post for around two years kopper said the supervisory board " took note " of the request by the state governments .
however , a decision will likely have to wait until at least the next board meeting on december 2 .
" -lsb- nonnenmacher -rsb- will continue with his duties for the time being with the necessary energy and reliability , " kopper said tuesday .
nonnenmacher 's contract at the bank runs until october 2012 .
a trained mathematician , he worked for several private banks before joining hsh nordbank in 2007 .
he became chairman in november 2008 , succeeding hans berger .
hsh nordbank is currently emerging from a financially rocky period brought on by the global financial crisis .
hamburg and schleswig-holstein were forced to provide the bank with 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.18 billion -rrb- in capital and 10 billion euros in guarantees .
the bank also received around 17 billion euros in guarantees from the federal government 's soffin bank rescue fund .

" the negotiations with croatia are now in their final phase , " the european commission said in its annual report on the progress of would-be eu members .
the commission pointed to widespread corruption and organized crime problems in other western balkan applicant countries as the biggest hurdle to their joining the bloc in the short term , although it did announce that montenegro was ready for full candidate status , saying the country 's democracy " is largely in line with european principles and standards . "
montenegro 's application has already been recognized by the eu , and with the commission 's approval , member states will now debate whether to grant the country candidate status and begin the process of negotiating membership .
croatia , iceland , turkey and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia are the four candidates that have already reached this final phase of the accession process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks voted for constitutional changes meant to appease brussels in a september referendum turkey began its official negotiations five years ago , but the eu acknowledged in its report that the process has hit rather rocky ground .
" negotiations advanced , albeit rather slowly , " the commission said of accession talks with ankara .
several stumbling blocks despite praising constitutional reforms designed to fight corruption , wrest some political power away from the military , and improve the protection of human rights as " a step in the right direction , " the commission said that turkey was still lagging behind in areas like press freedom , freedom of expression and religion , the rights of women and trade unions , and the integration of the kurdish minority in the country .
" the pace of reform in turkey dictates the pace of the accession process , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle said in berlin , shortly after the report was released .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the division of cyprus has soured turkish relations with eu members greece and cyprus the european commission also called on turkey to open trade ties with cyprus and redouble diplomatic efforts with the country , describing the need for progress in this area as " urgent . "
eu member state cyprus and turkey are locked in a territorial dispute over the northern part of the island , which has been occupied by turkish forces since 1974 .
reunification talks have stalled , and turkey says it will not open trade ties with cyprus until the problem is resolved .
and while cyprus tries to slow turkey 's accession into the eu , turkey is using its membership of nato to hamper cyprus ' bid to join that alliance .
another problem facing turkey 's membership bid that did not get highlighted in the eu commission 's annual report is the sheer size of the country .
a 2009 census put turkey 's population at 72 million , which would make it the second most populous member of the bloc .
" that means turkey would be represented in the european parliament with a number of mps to reflect its size , and the size of its population would also mean a lot of weight in decisions in the council of ministers , " the head of the eu program at the german council on foreign relations , almut moeller , told deutsche welle .
moeller said that eu insiders often talk about the influence turkey would wield in the bloc , and the affect it would have on the larger countries and their power structure .
" this is a sensitively calibrated order that has been around for a while now , and in the past we have only seen smaller and medium-sized countries entering the bloc .
they have relatively little impact on the big players , but imagine what a country this size would mean for the old order , for the amount of power currently shared between france and germany in the eu , for instance . "
gul : ' strategic imperative ' to let turkey in five years ago , there was an outpouring of pro-european sentiment and euphoria in turkey when the country began the final phase of the eu accession process .
but the mood seems to be souring as other applicants make much smoother process towards membership in the bloc .
on monday , brussels announced plans to grant visa-free travel within the eu 's open-border schengen zone to people from albania and bosnia , and the turkish newspaper haber tuerk responded by proclaiming on tuesday 's front page : " everyone 's allowed into the eu , except us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president gul thinks the eu is short-sighted not to welcome turkey citizens from every balkan country except kosovo , which some eu members consider a part of serbia , are now free to travel within the eu 's open-border area , while turks have to seek special visas .
" the eu will not be weaker , but stronger both politically and economically with turkey 's membership , " turkish president abdullah gul said in a speech in london on monday .
" given the fact that the international balance of power tends to shift towards the east and asia , it is , indeed , a strategic imperative for the eu to have turkey as a member . "
gul , speaking to the chatham house think-tank after receiving the organization 's annual prize for statesmanship , said it was " sad to observe " that some european leaders did not recognize the role turkey could play within the eu .
" this short-sighted vision is the major impediment before the idea of the eu as a global actor , capable of assuming greater responsibilities on political and security issues , complementing its economic clout , " the turkish president said .
in his speech , gul also announced that neighboring iran had asked turkey to host another round of talks with un security council members and germany on tehran 's nuclear program , alluding to the diplomatic role his country might play for the eu .
however , turkey 's international activities were also singled out by the eu for veiled criticism on tuesday , after the country defied the us and eu to vote against tougher un sanctions for iran earlier this year .
" turkey 's foreign policy has become more active in its wider neighborhood , " the commission 's report said .
" this is an asset for the european union , provided it is developed as a complement to turkey 's accession process and in coordination with the eu . "

eu member state cyprus and turkey are locked in a territorial dispute over the northern part of the island , which has been occupied by turkish forces since 1974 .
reunification talks have stalled , and turkey says it will not open trade ties with cyprus until the problem is resolved .
and while cyprus tries to slow turkey 's accession into the eu , turkey is using its membership of nato to hamper cyprus ' bid to join that alliance .
another problem facing turkey 's membership bid that did not get highlighted in the eu commission 's annual report is the sheer size of the country .
a 2009 census put turkey 's population at 72 million , which would make it the second most populous member of the bloc .
" that means turkey would be represented in the european parliament with a number of mps to reflect its size , and the size of its population would also mean a lot of weight in decisions in the council of ministers , " the head of the eu program at the german council on foreign relations , almut moeller , told deutsche welle .
moeller said that eu insiders often talk about the influence turkey would wield in the bloc , and the affect it would have on the larger countries and their power structure .
" this is a sensitively calibrated order that has been around for a while now , and in the past we have only seen smaller and medium-sized countries entering the bloc .
they have relatively little impact on the big players , but imagine what a country this size would mean for the old order , for the amount of power currently shared between france and germany in the eu , for instance . "
gul : ' strategic imperative ' to let turkey in five years ago , there was an outpouring of pro-european sentiment and euphoria in turkey when the country began the final phase of the eu accession process .
but the mood seems to be souring as other applicants make much smoother process towards membership in the bloc .
on monday , brussels announced plans to grant visa-free travel within the eu 's open-border schengen zone to people from albania and bosnia , and the turkish newspaper haber tuerk responded by proclaiming on tuesday 's front page : " everyone 's allowed into the eu , except us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president gul thinks the eu is short-sighted not to welcome turkey citizens from every balkan country except kosovo , which some eu members consider a part of serbia , are now free to travel within the eu 's open-border area , while turks have to seek special visas .
" the eu will not be weaker , but stronger both politically and economically with turkey 's membership , " turkish president abdullah gul said in a speech in london on monday .
" given the fact that the international balance of power tends to shift towards the east and asia , it is , indeed , a strategic imperative for the eu to have turkey as a member . "
gul , speaking to the chatham house think-tank after receiving the organization 's annual prize for statesmanship , said it was " sad to observe " that some european leaders did not recognize the role turkey could play within the eu .
" this short-sighted vision is the major impediment before the idea of the eu as a global actor , capable of assuming greater responsibilities on political and security issues , complementing its economic clout , " the turkish president said .
in his speech , gul also announced that neighboring iran had asked turkey to host another round of talks with un security council members and germany on tehran 's nuclear program , alluding to the diplomatic role his country might play for the eu .
however , turkey 's international activities were also singled out by the eu for veiled criticism on tuesday , after the country defied the us and eu to vote against tougher un sanctions for iran earlier this year .
" turkey 's foreign policy has become more active in its wider neighborhood , " the commission 's report said .
" this is an asset for the european union , provided it is developed as a complement to turkey 's accession process and in coordination with the eu . "

nonnenmacher 's tenure as hsh chief was thrown into doubt after he was implicated in allegations of spying at the state-controlled bank .
the 47-year-old has also been investigated by prosecutors over risky investments that led to the bank losing millions of euros .

nonnenmacher was recently implicated in a spying scandal at the bank . the axe appears to be about to fall on the head of one of germany 's powerful state banks , hsh nordbank , after the lender 's major shareholders asked its supervisory board to give scandal-plagued ceo dirk jens nonnenmacher the sack .
nonnenmacher 's tenure as hsh chief was thrown into doubt after he was implicated in allegations of spying at the state-controlled bank .
the 47-year-old has also been investigated by prosecutors over risky investments that led to the bank losing millions of euros .
hsh nordbank 's biggest investors , the states of schleswig-holstein and hamburg , have reportedly asked the bank 's supervisory board chairman hilmar kopper to begin proceedings to find a new ceo for the lender .
in a written statement , the state governments said nonnenmacher 's dismissal was necessary to " win back lost trust " in hsh , whose main commercial focus is on shipping , transportation , real estate and renewable energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nonnenmacher has been in the post for around two years kopper said the supervisory board " took note " of the request by the state governments .
however , a decision will likely have to wait until at least the next board meeting on december 2 .
" -lsb- nonnenmacher -rsb- will continue with his duties for the time being with the necessary energy and reliability , " kopper said tuesday .
nonnenmacher 's contract at the bank runs until october 2012 .
a trained mathematician , he worked for several private banks before joining hsh nordbank in 2007 .
he became chairman in november 2008 , succeeding hans berger .
hsh nordbank is currently emerging from a financially rocky period brought on by the global financial crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 09.11.2010 eu criticizes turkey in annual report on membership hopefuls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's accession talks with the eu are floundering the eu has called on turkey to open up trade with cyprus , to better promote gender equality and human rights , and to toe the line on foreign policy issues in a lukewarm appraisal of ankara 's path towards eu membership . the european union announced on tuesday that only one of seven candidates for membership in the bloc is close to achieving its goal .
" the negotiations with croatia are now in their final phase , " the european commission said in its annual report on the progress of would-be eu members .
the commission pointed to widespread corruption and organized crime problems in other western balkan applicant countries as the biggest hurdle to their joining the bloc in the short term , although it did announce that montenegro was ready for full candidate status , saying the country 's democracy " is largely in line with european principles and standards . "
montenegro 's application has already been recognized by the eu , and with the commission 's approval , member states will now debate whether to grant the country candidate status and begin the process of negotiating membership .
croatia , iceland , turkey and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia are the four candidates that have already reached this final phase of the accession process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks voted for constitutional changes meant to appease brussels in a september referendum turkey began its official negotiations five years ago , but the eu acknowledged in its report that the process has hit rather rocky ground .
" negotiations advanced , albeit rather slowly , " the commission said of accession talks with ankara .
several stumbling blocks despite praising constitutional reforms designed to fight corruption , wrest some political power away from the military , and improve the protection of human rights as " a step in the right direction , " the commission said that turkey was still lagging behind in areas like press freedom , freedom of expression and religion , the rights of women and trade unions , and the integration of the kurdish minority in the country .
" the pace of reform in turkey dictates the pace of the accession process , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle said in berlin , shortly after the report was released .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the division of cyprus has soured turkish relations with eu members greece and cyprus the european commission also called on turkey to open trade ties with cyprus and redouble diplomatic efforts with the country , describing the need for progress in this area as " urgent . "
eu member state cyprus and turkey are locked in a territorial dispute over the northern part of the island , which has been occupied by turkish forces since 1974 .
reunification talks have stalled , and turkey says it will not open trade ties with cyprus until the problem is resolved .
and while cyprus tries to slow turkey 's accession into the eu , turkey is using its membership of nato to hamper cyprus ' bid to join that alliance .
another problem facing turkey 's membership bid that did not get highlighted in the eu commission 's annual report is the sheer size of the country .
a 2009 census put turkey 's population at 72 million , which would make it the second most populous member of the bloc .
" that means turkey would be represented in the european parliament with a number of mps to reflect its size , and the size of its population would also mean a lot of weight in decisions in the council of ministers , " the head of the eu program at the german council on foreign relations , almut moeller , told deutsche welle .
moeller said that eu insiders often talk about the influence turkey would wield in the bloc , and the affect it would have on the larger countries and their power structure .
" this is a sensitively calibrated order that has been around for a while now , and in the past we have only seen smaller and medium-sized countries entering the bloc .
they have relatively little impact on the big players , but imagine what a country this size would mean for the old order , for the amount of power currently shared between france and germany in the eu , for instance . "
gul : ' strategic imperative ' to let turkey in five years ago , there was an outpouring of pro-european sentiment and euphoria in turkey when the country began the final phase of the eu accession process .
but the mood seems to be souring as other applicants make much smoother process towards membership in the bloc .
on monday , brussels announced plans to grant visa-free travel within the eu 's open-border schengen zone to people from albania and bosnia , and the turkish newspaper haber tuerk responded by proclaiming on tuesday 's front page : " everyone 's allowed into the eu , except us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president gul thinks the eu is short-sighted not to welcome turkey citizens from every balkan country except kosovo , which some eu members consider a part of serbia , are now free to travel within the eu 's open-border area , while turks have to seek special visas .
" the eu will not be weaker , but stronger both politically and economically with turkey 's membership , " turkish president abdullah gul said in a speech in london on monday .
" given the fact that the international balance of power tends to shift towards the east and asia , it is , indeed , a strategic imperative for the eu to have turkey as a member . "
gul , speaking to the chatham house think-tank after receiving the organization 's annual prize for statesmanship , said it was " sad to observe " that some european leaders did not recognize the role turkey could play within the eu .
" this short-sighted vision is the major impediment before the idea of the eu as a global actor , capable of assuming greater responsibilities on political and security issues , complementing its economic clout , " the turkish president said .
in his speech , gul also announced that neighboring iran had asked turkey to host another round of talks with un security council members and germany on tehran 's nuclear program , alluding to the diplomatic role his country might play for the eu .
however , turkey 's international activities were also singled out by the eu for veiled criticism on tuesday , after the country defied the us and eu to vote against tougher un sanctions for iran earlier this year .
" turkey 's foreign policy has become more active in its wider neighborhood , " the commission 's report said .
" this is an asset for the european union , provided it is developed as a complement to turkey 's accession process and in coordination with the eu . "

bush recalls in his book " decision points , " released tuesday in the us , that schroeder 's reversal on supporting the iraq war in a bid to win re-election in 2004 caused their relationship to sour .
bush says schroeder had privately assured him he backed his policy on iraq .
schroeder , along with the then french and russian presidents jacques chirac and vladimir putin , led international opposition to us diplomatic efforts to win support for invading iraq .
the war in iraq was and remains deeply unpopular in germany .
" as someone who valued personal diplomacy , i put a high premium on trust , " bush wrote .
" once that trust was violated , it was hard to have a constructive relationship again . "
schroeder rejects accusation schroeder disputed bush 's version , saying in a statement that he had only promised support if it was shown that saddam hussein 's regime played a role in the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , which was not the case .
" the bush administration 's reasons for the iraq war were based , as we know today , on lies , " schroeder said .
bush also seized upon comments made in 2002 by a german official who compared the us president to adolf hitler .
" i was shocked and furious , " bush writes of the alleged remarks by the then-german justice minister , herta daeubler-gmelin .
" it was hard to think of anything more insulting than being compared to hitler by a german official . "
the minister had to resign .

but not for long .
as researcher philipp gunz explained to deutsche welle , the similarities evolved into differences during the first year of their lives , a finding which proves a cognitive gulf between humans and the extinct species .
" what is being established during that period , both in humans and neanderthals , is synaptic connection among brain cells , " gunz said .
" we know from the example of modern man that even subtle differences can have significant consequences on development , and can contribute to social and communication skills . "
and although gunz says there is little doubt that the neanderthals , which have been extinct for almost 30,000 years , had language and did communicate with each other , they would have seen the world differently to the way we do .
same , same , but not for long bildunterschrift : how alike were we really ?
baby homo neanderthalensis ' elongated braincases – also found in new-born humans – had more to do with the physical make-up of the mothers than anything else .
" the baby has to fit through the birth canal and the shape of both was very similar so that would impose a constraint . "
but once unbridled and free to grow at will , human braincases gradually begin to change form to become more globular .
it is this shape which gunz believes proves early brain development in man which is absent in neanderthals .
human uniqueness in earlier research the scientists discovered that right after birth human brains are quite unlike those of chimpanzees , but that they become more similar at a later stage of development .
this shows that the " globularization phase " sets humans apart from both chimps and neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : chimps and man : not so similar " we think modern humans , chimpanzees and neanderthals share one ancestral growth pattern that that goes back millions of years , " gunz continued .
" but in the first year of life , modern humans depart from this ancestral pattern . "
and contrary to past opinion , it is this first year , and not brain size , which is crucial to cognitive development .
the leipzig anthropologists say it is the internal organization of the brain that matters .
deeper understanding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's in an ancient tooth ?
the scientists hope their research will help them understand a little more about the function of the genes , only a very small number of which separate modern humans from their extinct counterparts .
" we assume that some of these genes are related to brain development , " gunz said .
" in living people these mutations are linked to autism or schizophrenia or down-syndrome . "
and while he is not suggesting that an autistic child is a throwback to tens of thousands of years ago , the leipzig anthropologist does venture a link .
" we know from teeth that neanderthals grew faster , so maybe some of the genes are related to the regulation of brain growth . "

baby homo neanderthalensis ' elongated braincases – also found in new-born humans – had more to do with the physical make-up of the mothers than anything else .
" the baby has to fit through the birth canal and the shape of both was very similar so that would impose a constraint . "
but once unbridled and free to grow at will , human braincases gradually begin to change form to become more globular .
it is this shape which gunz believes proves early brain development in man which is absent in neanderthals .
human uniqueness in earlier research the scientists discovered that right after birth human brains are quite unlike those of chimpanzees , but that they become more similar at a later stage of development .
this shows that the " globularization phase " sets humans apart from both chimps and neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : chimps and man : not so similar " we think modern humans , chimpanzees and neanderthals share one ancestral growth pattern that that goes back millions of years , " gunz continued .

and while he is not suggesting that an autistic child is a throwback to tens of thousands of years ago , the leipzig anthropologist does venture a link .

after months living undercover in picturesque chiemsee , he 's now trying to get political aslyum . tucked away on the border of germany and austria , lake chiemsee has long been popular with holiday-makers .
but now the idyllic alpine region has become the unlikely backdrop for the story of a man wandering into uncharted political territory . in 2007 , andre shepherd walked off the us army base where he was stationed in southern germany .
the apache helicopter mechanic said his experiences on duty in iraq convinced him he could no longer support the war .
" the iraqi people , when i met them , reacted towards us with anger , hostility and fear .
we did n't understand why , because in the us , you think ' oh , we 're the liberators , " ' shepherd told detusche welle .
" but what was going on with the kidnappings , the rapes , and abu ghraib - the population just wanted us out of there . "
unexpected turn shepherd had never planned to make a career of the military .
in his 20 's , his dream of studying computer science fell by the wayside after he could n't afford to keep paying tuition at kent state university in ohio .
for a while , he lived in his car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lake chiemsee is known for its sunsets and alpine beauty , not political drama " i ended up being homeless for about a year , and i joined the military because it was the only way to get a job out of cleveland , " said the ohio native .
after his first tour of duty in iraq , shepherd returned to the base in germany , where he started doing internet research on the iraq war .
gradually , he became convinced that the us-led invasion was a human rights violation .
that was the moment of truth , says shepherd . " i had to decide , ok , do i just go back to the war , knowing what i 'm doing is wrong , that it 's murder , or do i go against the world 's most powerful government and have a lot of problems , be ostracized from society ? "
it took him ten days to make up his mind .
in april 2007 , shepherd walked off the base .
a risky move germany is a main staging post for the us military , with around 60,000 us troops stationed there .
each year , some of those soldiers go awol -lrb- absent without official leave -rrb- .
many get picked up by the german police and sent back to their bases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shepherd refused to take part in a war he calls illegal shepherd avoided being caught .
he did n't contact his family , relying on local friends and the occasional odd job to survive .
after 19 months , he decided to turn himself in and apply for political asylum .
if his application is successful , shepherd will become the first us iraq war veteran to receive political asylum in germany , says rudi friedrich , head of the pacifist organization connection .
friedrich 's organization , which he runs out of his home in a suburb of frankfurt , offers support to conscientious objectors and war deserters and has been guiding shepherd through the asylum-seeking process .
" the recognition that one is not alone is an important experience for a deserter to regain his self-esteem , to be able to say , ' yes , i did make the right choice , i do n't want to shoot at my neighbor , " ' friedrich told deutsche welle .
shepherd 's asylum application cites a 2004 european union regulation that grants refugee status to any soldier who is in danger of being prosecuted if his or her military service " would include crimes or acts " which violate international law .
but some fear granting shepherd asylum could create an easy way out for americans stationed in germany who want to avoid combat duty in iraq .
that 's not likely , says friedrich , because asylum cases are considered individually .
friedrich explains , " if andre shepherd is granted asylum , than that decision will take the form of a letter , exactly one page , with a letterhead .
and it will say , ' in light of the document submitted , andre shepherd is granted asylum . '
that 's it - there is no explanation or rationalization .
so it 's not a political stance , unless you say , the recognition of the asylum application is in and of itself a political stance . "
the waiting game even if his application is granted , shepherd will likely face jail time if he ever attempts to return to the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a decision in shepherd 's case is expected by the end of the year fortunately , shepherd says he feels at home in the tiny town of prien-am-chiemsee . he 's married to a german woman , and works part-time installing solar paneling for her parent 's company .
he also attends daily language classes as part of an integration course .
in september , the berlin newspaper die tageszeitung awarded him its panther prize for his courage in deserting .
shepherd says he feels optimistic , and says he sees parallels between his own case and the lessons of the nuremburg trials .
says shepherd , " if your government is committing war crimes , and you 're taking part knowing that these are crimes , then there is no excuse .
even if you 're just a low ranking soldier , if you 're taking part , then you 're guilty too . "

after months living undercover in picturesque chiemsee , he 's now trying to get political aslyum . tucked away on the border of germany and austria , lake chiemsee has long been popular with holiday-makers .
but now the idyllic alpine region has become the unlikely backdrop for the story of a man wandering into uncharted political territory . in 2007 , andre shepherd walked off the us army base where he was stationed in southern germany .
the apache helicopter mechanic said his experiences on duty in iraq convinced him he could no longer support the war .
" the iraqi people , when i met them , reacted towards us with anger , hostility and fear .
we did n't understand why , because in the us , you think ' oh , we 're the liberators , " ' shepherd told detusche welle .
" but what was going on with the kidnappings , the rapes , and abu ghraib - the population just wanted us out of there . "
unexpected turn shepherd had never planned to make a career of the military .
in his 20 's , his dream of studying computer science fell by the wayside after he could n't afford to keep paying tuition at kent state university in ohio .
for a while , he lived in his car .

after his first tour of duty in iraq , shepherd returned to the base in germany , where he started doing internet research on the iraq war .
gradually , he became convinced that the us-led invasion was a human rights violation .
that was the moment of truth , says shepherd . " i had to decide , ok , do i just go back to the war , knowing what i 'm doing is wrong , that it 's murder , or do i go against the world 's most powerful government and have a lot of problems , be ostracized from society ? "
it took him ten days to make up his mind .
in april 2007 , shepherd walked off the base .
a risky move germany is a main staging post for the us military , with around 60,000 us troops stationed there .
each year , some of those soldiers go awol -lrb- absent without official leave -rrb- .

he did n't contact his family , relying on local friends and the occasional odd job to survive .
after 19 months , he decided to turn himself in and apply for political asylum .
if his application is successful , shepherd will become the first us iraq war veteran to receive political asylum in germany , says rudi friedrich , head of the pacifist organization connection .
friedrich 's organization , which he runs out of his home in a suburb of frankfurt , offers support to conscientious objectors and war deserters and has been guiding shepherd through the asylum-seeking process .
" the recognition that one is not alone is an important experience for a deserter to regain his self-esteem , to be able to say , ' yes , i did make the right choice , i do n't want to shoot at my neighbor , " ' friedrich told deutsche welle .
shepherd 's asylum application cites a 2004 european union regulation that grants refugee status to any soldier who is in danger of being prosecuted if his or her military service " would include crimes or acts " which violate international law .
but some fear granting shepherd asylum could create an easy way out for americans stationed in germany who want to avoid combat duty in iraq .
that 's not likely , says friedrich , because asylum cases are considered individually .
friedrich explains , " if andre shepherd is granted asylum , than that decision will take the form of a letter , exactly one page , with a letterhead .
and it will say , ' in light of the document submitted , andre shepherd is granted asylum . '
that 's it - there is no explanation or rationalization .
so it 's not a political stance , unless you say , the recognition of the asylum application is in and of itself a political stance . "
the waiting game even if his application is granted , shepherd will likely face jail time if he ever attempts to return to the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a decision in shepherd 's case is expected by the end of the year fortunately , shepherd says he feels at home in the tiny town of prien-am-chiemsee . he 's married to a german woman , and works part-time installing solar paneling for her parent 's company .
he also attends daily language classes as part of an integration course .
in september , the berlin newspaper die tageszeitung awarded him its panther prize for his courage in deserting .
shepherd says he feels optimistic , and says he sees parallels between his own case and the lessons of the nuremburg trials .
says shepherd , " if your government is committing war crimes , and you 're taking part knowing that these are crimes , then there is no excuse .
even if you 're just a low ranking soldier , if you 're taking part , then you 're guilty too . "

nonnenmacher was recently implicated in a spying scandal at the bank . the axe appears to be about to fall on the head of one of germany 's powerful state banks , hsh nordbank , after the lender 's major shareholders asked its supervisory board to give scandal-plagued ceo dirk jens nonnenmacher the sack .
nonnenmacher 's tenure as hsh chief was thrown into doubt after he was implicated in allegations of spying at the state-controlled bank .
the 47-year-old has also been investigated by prosecutors over risky investments that led to the bank losing millions of euros .
hsh nordbank 's biggest investors , the states of schleswig-holstein and hamburg , have reportedly asked the bank 's supervisory board chairman hilmar kopper to begin proceedings to find a new ceo for the lender .
in a written statement , the state governments said nonnenmacher 's dismissal was necessary to " win back lost trust " in hsh , whose main commercial focus is on shipping , transportation , real estate and renewable energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nonnenmacher has been in the post for around two years kopper said the supervisory board " took note " of the request by the state governments .

" -lsb- nonnenmacher -rsb- will continue with his duties for the time being with the necessary energy and reliability , " kopper said tuesday .
nonnenmacher 's contract at the bank runs until october 2012 .
a trained mathematician , he worked for several private banks before joining hsh nordbank in 2007 .
he became chairman in november 2008 , succeeding hans berger .
hsh nordbank is currently emerging from a financially rocky period brought on by the global financial crisis .
hamburg and schleswig-holstein were forced to provide the bank with 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.18 billion -rrb- in capital and 10 billion euros in guarantees .
the bank also received around 17 billion euros in guarantees from the federal government 's soffin bank rescue fund .

after nearly two days of blocking a nuclear waste storage site , thousands of protestors have been cleared from the area by police and the transport of 11 containers of nuclear waste has arrived at its destination . police cleared thousands of anti-nuclear activists from roads leading to the nuclear storage facility in gorleben , northern germany on tuesday morning , allowing for the final arrival of 123 tons of nuclear waste .
about 3,000 demonstrators staged a 44-hour sit-in in front of the storage site , including high-level politicians such as green party co-chair claudia roth .
activists from the environmentalist organization greenpeace used a truck disguised as a vehicle carrying beer to block the freight train station in nearby dannenberg , where the waste containers were to be moved to trucks for the final 20 kilometers to the storage site .
two greenpeace activists delayed the transport by about 11 hours by encasing themselves in a cement block , making it so the police could not move them without injuring them .
authorities managed to free the activists early tuesday morning , and the first truck carrying the nuclear waste departed dannenberg at around 8:30 a.m.
the last of the trucks arrived at the storage facility at about 9:50 a.m.
bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists held up the trucks carrying the waste for 11 hours stop-and-go traffic large protests have taken place during past nuclear waste transport operations , but none have delayed the shipment of the waste as much as the most recent .
the waste originated from nuclear reactors in germany and was sent to a plant in northern france for reprocessing .
the waste containers , called " castors " -lrb- cask for storage and transport of radioactive material -rrb- , left france by train on friday afternoon , but were quickly stopped by the first blockade of activists on the train tracks .
the following days were a tedious stop-and-go game , as protestors blocked the train tracks and some of the 16,000 police officers mobilized to secure the transport removed them .
protests to continue leaders of the various " citizens ' initiatives " against nuclear power claimed victory on tuesday , despite the successful transport of the nuclear waste , and some vowed to continue protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors succeeded in delaying the transport on historic levels " we 've shown that we 're a force to be reckoned with , " said kerstin rudek , chairwoman of the citizens ' initiative for environmental protection luechow-dannenberg .
matthias miersch , environment spokesman for the opposition social democrats in parliament , said the movement against the nuclear waste transport was a " very impressive demonstration . "
" this was a very clear signal to the government that this atomic energy policy can not go on , " he told phoenix public television .
" politicians have to understand that decisions are being made now that the people are absolutely unable to relate to . "
transport to russia meanwhile munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that germany had negotiated a deal " ready to be signed " to ship nuclear waste originating from an old atomic research facility in former east germany to russia .
the report said a total of 951 nuclear fuel elements from the east german research center dresden-rossendorf , which have been in temporary storage since 2005 , would be shipped to the mayak atomic complex in the southern urals for reprocessing .
the waste would stay in russia for permanent storage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mayak facility in russia is to reprocess east germany 's radioactive waste the report said the basis for the transport deal was a previous agreement between the united states and russia , which regulates the transport of nuclear waste from reactors that were overseen by the soviet union .
germany 's goal was reportedly to " reduce the amount of highly-enriched uranium as much as possible . "
the deal received criticism from the green party , which has profited politically from a strong anti-nuclear sentiment in germany .
" cheap before safe , that 's what this is about , " green party spokeswoman sylvia kotting-uhl told the newspaper .

but not for long .
as researcher philipp gunz explained to deutsche welle , the similarities evolved into differences during the first year of their lives , a finding which proves a cognitive gulf between humans and the extinct species .
" what is being established during that period , both in humans and neanderthals , is synaptic connection among brain cells , " gunz said .
" we know from the example of modern man that even subtle differences can have significant consequences on development , and can contribute to social and communication skills . "
and although gunz says there is little doubt that the neanderthals , which have been extinct for almost 30,000 years , had language and did communicate with each other , they would have seen the world differently to the way we do .
same , same , but not for long bildunterschrift : how alike were we really ?
baby homo neanderthalensis ' elongated braincases – also found in new-born humans – had more to do with the physical make-up of the mothers than anything else .
" the baby has to fit through the birth canal and the shape of both was very similar so that would impose a constraint . "
but once unbridled and free to grow at will , human braincases gradually begin to change form to become more globular .
it is this shape which gunz believes proves early brain development in man which is absent in neanderthals .
human uniqueness in earlier research the scientists discovered that right after birth human brains are quite unlike those of chimpanzees , but that they become more similar at a later stage of development .
this shows that the " globularization phase " sets humans apart from both chimps and neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : chimps and man : not so similar " we think modern humans , chimpanzees and neanderthals share one ancestral growth pattern that that goes back millions of years , " gunz continued .
" but in the first year of life , modern humans depart from this ancestral pattern . "
and contrary to past opinion , it is this first year , and not brain size , which is crucial to cognitive development .
the leipzig anthropologists say it is the internal organization of the brain that matters .
deeper understanding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's in an ancient tooth ?
the scientists hope their research will help them understand a little more about the function of the genes , only a very small number of which separate modern humans from their extinct counterparts .
" we assume that some of these genes are related to brain development , " gunz said .
" in living people these mutations are linked to autism or schizophrenia or down-syndrome . "
and while he is not suggesting that an autistic child is a throwback to tens of thousands of years ago , the leipzig anthropologist does venture a link .
" we know from teeth that neanderthals grew faster , so maybe some of the genes are related to the regulation of brain growth . "

dw-world.de scientists assert finger length and sexual promiscuity linked in human ancestors in an anthropological study , british researchers found that neanderthals may have had more sexual partners .
scientists still do not know when ancient primates began to migrate from being more to less promiscuous .

after nearly two days of blocking a nuclear waste storage site , thousands of protestors have been cleared from the area by police and the transport of 11 containers of nuclear waste has arrived at its destination . police cleared thousands of anti-nuclear activists from roads leading to the nuclear storage facility in gorleben , northern germany on tuesday morning , allowing for the final arrival of 123 tons of nuclear waste .
about 3,000 demonstrators staged a 44-hour sit-in in front of the storage site , including high-level politicians such as green party co-chair claudia roth .
activists from the environmentalist organization greenpeace used a truck disguised as a vehicle carrying beer to block the freight train station in nearby dannenberg , where the waste containers were to be moved to trucks for the final 20 kilometers to the storage site .
two greenpeace activists delayed the transport by about 11 hours by encasing themselves in a cement block , making it so the police could not move them without injuring them .
authorities managed to free the activists early tuesday morning , and the first truck carrying the nuclear waste departed dannenberg at around 8:30 a.m.
the last of the trucks arrived at the storage facility at about 9:50 a.m.
bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists held up the trucks carrying the waste for 11 hours stop-and-go traffic large protests have taken place during past nuclear waste transport operations , but none have delayed the shipment of the waste as much as the most recent .
the waste originated from nuclear reactors in germany and was sent to a plant in northern france for reprocessing .
the waste containers , called " castors " -lrb- cask for storage and transport of radioactive material -rrb- , left france by train on friday afternoon , but were quickly stopped by the first blockade of activists on the train tracks .
the following days were a tedious stop-and-go game , as protestors blocked the train tracks and some of the 16,000 police officers mobilized to secure the transport removed them .
protests to continue leaders of the various " citizens ' initiatives " against nuclear power claimed victory on tuesday , despite the successful transport of the nuclear waste , and some vowed to continue protests .

" politicians have to understand that decisions are being made now that the people are absolutely unable to relate to . "
transport to russia meanwhile munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that germany had negotiated a deal " ready to be signed " to ship nuclear waste originating from an old atomic research facility in former east germany to russia .
the report said a total of 951 nuclear fuel elements from the east german research center dresden-rossendorf , which have been in temporary storage since 2005 , would be shipped to the mayak atomic complex in the southern urals for reprocessing .
the waste would stay in russia for permanent storage .

after nearly two days of blocking a nuclear waste storage site , thousands of protestors have been cleared from the area by police and the transport of 11 containers of nuclear waste has arrived at its destination . police cleared thousands of anti-nuclear activists from roads leading to the nuclear storage facility in gorleben , northern germany on tuesday morning , allowing for the final arrival of 123 tons of nuclear waste .
about 3,000 demonstrators staged a 44-hour sit-in in front of the storage site , including high-level politicians such as green party co-chair claudia roth .
activists from the environmentalist organization greenpeace used a truck disguised as a vehicle carrying beer to block the freight train station in nearby dannenberg , where the waste containers were to be moved to trucks for the final 20 kilometers to the storage site .
two greenpeace activists delayed the transport by about 11 hours by encasing themselves in a cement block , making it so the police could not move them without injuring them .
authorities managed to free the activists early tuesday morning , and the first truck carrying the nuclear waste departed dannenberg at around 8:30 a.m.
the last of the trucks arrived at the storage facility at about 9:50 a.m.
bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists held up the trucks carrying the waste for 11 hours stop-and-go traffic large protests have taken place during past nuclear waste transport operations , but none have delayed the shipment of the waste as much as the most recent .
the waste originated from nuclear reactors in germany and was sent to a plant in northern france for reprocessing .
the waste containers , called " castors " -lrb- cask for storage and transport of radioactive material -rrb- , left france by train on friday afternoon , but were quickly stopped by the first blockade of activists on the train tracks .
the following days were a tedious stop-and-go game , as protestors blocked the train tracks and some of the 16,000 police officers mobilized to secure the transport removed them .
protests to continue leaders of the various " citizens ' initiatives " against nuclear power claimed victory on tuesday , despite the successful transport of the nuclear waste , and some vowed to continue protests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors succeeded in delaying the transport on historic levels " we 've shown that we 're a force to be reckoned with , " said kerstin rudek , chairwoman of the citizens ' initiative for environmental protection luechow-dannenberg .
matthias miersch , environment spokesman for the opposition social democrats in parliament , said the movement against the nuclear waste transport was a " very impressive demonstration . "
" this was a very clear signal to the government that this atomic energy policy can not go on , " he told phoenix public television .
" politicians have to understand that decisions are being made now that the people are absolutely unable to relate to . "
transport to russia meanwhile munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung reported on tuesday that germany had negotiated a deal " ready to be signed " to ship nuclear waste originating from an old atomic research facility in former east germany to russia .
the report said a total of 951 nuclear fuel elements from the east german research center dresden-rossendorf , which have been in temporary storage since 2005 , would be shipped to the mayak atomic complex in the southern urals for reprocessing .
the waste would stay in russia for permanent storage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mayak facility in russia is to reprocess east germany 's radioactive waste the report said the basis for the transport deal was a previous agreement between the united states and russia , which regulates the transport of nuclear waste from reactors that were overseen by the soviet union .
germany 's goal was reportedly to " reduce the amount of highly-enriched uranium as much as possible . "
the deal received criticism from the green party , which has profited politically from a strong anti-nuclear sentiment in germany .
" cheap before safe , that 's what this is about , " green party spokeswoman sylvia kotting-uhl told the newspaper .

after months living undercover in picturesque chiemsee , he 's now trying to get political aslyum . tucked away on the border of germany and austria , lake chiemsee has long been popular with holiday-makers .
but now the idyllic alpine region has become the unlikely backdrop for the story of a man wandering into uncharted political territory . in 2007 , andre shepherd walked off the us army base where he was stationed in southern germany .
the apache helicopter mechanic said his experiences on duty in iraq convinced him he could no longer support the war .
" the iraqi people , when i met them , reacted towards us with anger , hostility and fear .
we did n't understand why , because in the us , you think ' oh , we 're the liberators , " ' shepherd told detusche welle .
" but what was going on with the kidnappings , the rapes , and abu ghraib - the population just wanted us out of there . "
unexpected turn shepherd had never planned to make a career of the military .
in his 20 's , his dream of studying computer science fell by the wayside after he could n't afford to keep paying tuition at kent state university in ohio .
for a while , he lived in his car .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lake chiemsee is known for its sunsets and alpine beauty , not political drama " i ended up being homeless for about a year , and i joined the military because it was the only way to get a job out of cleveland , " said the ohio native .
after his first tour of duty in iraq , shepherd returned to the base in germany , where he started doing internet research on the iraq war .
gradually , he became convinced that the us-led invasion was a human rights violation .
that was the moment of truth , says shepherd . " i had to decide , ok , do i just go back to the war , knowing what i 'm doing is wrong , that it 's murder , or do i go against the world 's most powerful government and have a lot of problems , be ostracized from society ? "
it took him ten days to make up his mind .
in april 2007 , shepherd walked off the base .
a risky move germany is a main staging post for the us military , with around 60,000 us troops stationed there .
each year , some of those soldiers go awol -lrb- absent without official leave -rrb- .
many get picked up by the german police and sent back to their bases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shepherd refused to take part in a war he calls illegal shepherd avoided being caught .
he did n't contact his family , relying on local friends and the occasional odd job to survive .
after 19 months , he decided to turn himself in and apply for political asylum .
if his application is successful , shepherd will become the first us iraq war veteran to receive political asylum in germany , says rudi friedrich , head of the pacifist organization connection .
friedrich 's organization , which he runs out of his home in a suburb of frankfurt , offers support to conscientious objectors and war deserters and has been guiding shepherd through the asylum-seeking process .
" the recognition that one is not alone is an important experience for a deserter to regain his self-esteem , to be able to say , ' yes , i did make the right choice , i do n't want to shoot at my neighbor , " ' friedrich told deutsche welle .
shepherd 's asylum application cites a 2004 european union regulation that grants refugee status to any soldier who is in danger of being prosecuted if his or her military service " would include crimes or acts " which violate international law .
but some fear granting shepherd asylum could create an easy way out for americans stationed in germany who want to avoid combat duty in iraq .
that 's not likely , says friedrich , because asylum cases are considered individually .
friedrich explains , " if andre shepherd is granted asylum , than that decision will take the form of a letter , exactly one page , with a letterhead .
and it will say , ' in light of the document submitted , andre shepherd is granted asylum . '
that 's it - there is no explanation or rationalization .
so it 's not a political stance , unless you say , the recognition of the asylum application is in and of itself a political stance . "
the waiting game even if his application is granted , shepherd will likely face jail time if he ever attempts to return to the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a decision in shepherd 's case is expected by the end of the year fortunately , shepherd says he feels at home in the tiny town of prien-am-chiemsee . he 's married to a german woman , and works part-time installing solar paneling for her parent 's company .
he also attends daily language classes as part of an integration course .
in september , the berlin newspaper die tageszeitung awarded him its panther prize for his courage in deserting .
shepherd says he feels optimistic , and says he sees parallels between his own case and the lessons of the nuremburg trials .
says shepherd , " if your government is committing war crimes , and you 're taking part knowing that these are crimes , then there is no excuse .
even if you 're just a low ranking soldier , if you 're taking part , then you 're guilty too . "

these types of ultra-high-speed smash-ups at the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- are an attempt to re-create the explosion , known as the big bang , which is believed to have begun the universe .
as spokeswoman barbara warmbein told the associated press , the cern experiment over the weekend produced " a very , very , very small bang . "
lead ions are lead atoms whose electrons have been removed , and are much heavier than the protons that the researchers had been using .
that may be beneficial , as the energy required to smash them is higher , and thus may be closer to the conditions the scientists are trying to analyze .
as the research continues , scientists are trying to create " quark-gluon plasma , " an extremely hot and dense type of matter that may unlock some secrets in the early universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lead ion experiments will continue until cern shuts down for the winter on december 6 " the experiments are already providing an exciting glimpse of the new frontier , " sergio bertolucci , cern 's director for research and computing , told afp news agency .
major breakthroughs ' could take years ' the lhc is comprised of a circular , 27-kilometer -lrb- 17-mile -rrb- atom-smasher that cost four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- to build near geneva .
it began operations in september 2008 .
beyond pushing the limits of particle physics , the team is also exploring the frontier of data storage and transfer .
cern is currently using 140 computer centers spread across 34 countries to back up and analyze its data , which is being transferred at peak rates of 10 gigabytes per second , or the equivalent of approximately two dvds per second .
still , warmbein added that it will likely be months , if not years , before cern scientists make any major breakthroughs .

" the negotiations with croatia are now in their final phase , " the european commission said in its annual report on the progress of would-be eu members .
the commission pointed to widespread corruption and organized crime problems in other western balkan applicant countries as the biggest hurdle to their joining the bloc in the short term , although it did announce that montenegro was ready for full candidate status , saying the country 's democracy " is largely in line with european principles and standards . "
montenegro 's application has already been recognized by the eu , and with the commission 's approval , member states will now debate whether to grant the country candidate status and begin the process of negotiating membership .
croatia , iceland , turkey and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia are the four candidates that have already reached this final phase of the accession process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks voted for constitutional changes meant to appease brussels in a september referendum turkey began its official negotiations five years ago , but the eu acknowledged in its report that the process has hit rather rocky ground .
" negotiations advanced , albeit rather slowly , " the commission said of accession talks with ankara .
several stumbling blocks despite praising constitutional reforms designed to fight corruption , wrest some political power away from the military , and improve the protection of human rights as " a step in the right direction , " the commission said that turkey was still lagging behind in areas like press freedom , freedom of expression and religion , the rights of women and trade unions , and the integration of the kurdish minority in the country .
" the pace of reform in turkey dictates the pace of the accession process , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle said in berlin , shortly after the report was released .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the division of cyprus has soured turkish relations with eu members greece and cyprus the european commission also called on turkey to open trade ties with cyprus and redouble diplomatic efforts with the country , describing the need for progress in this area as " urgent . "
eu member state cyprus and turkey are locked in a territorial dispute over the northern part of the island , which has been occupied by turkish forces since 1974 .
reunification talks have stalled , and turkey says it will not open trade ties with cyprus until the problem is resolved .
and while cyprus tries to slow turkey 's accession into the eu , turkey is using its membership of nato to hamper cyprus ' bid to join that alliance .
another problem facing turkey 's membership bid that did not get highlighted in the eu commission 's annual report is the sheer size of the country .
a 2009 census put turkey 's population at 72 million , which would make it the second most populous member of the bloc .
" that means turkey would be represented in the european parliament with a number of mps to reflect its size , and the size of its population would also mean a lot of weight in decisions in the council of ministers , " the head of the eu program at the german council on foreign relations , almut moeller , told deutsche welle .
moeller said that eu insiders often talk about the influence turkey would wield in the bloc , and the affect it would have on the larger countries and their power structure .
" this is a sensitively calibrated order that has been around for a while now , and in the past we have only seen smaller and medium-sized countries entering the bloc .
they have relatively little impact on the big players , but imagine what a country this size would mean for the old order , for the amount of power currently shared between france and germany in the eu , for instance . "
gul : ' strategic imperative ' to let turkey in five years ago , there was an outpouring of pro-european sentiment and euphoria in turkey when the country began the final phase of the eu accession process .
but the mood seems to be souring as other applicants make much smoother process towards membership in the bloc .
on monday , brussels announced plans to grant visa-free travel within the eu 's open-border schengen zone to people from albania and bosnia , and the turkish newspaper haber tuerk responded by proclaiming on tuesday 's front page : " everyone 's allowed into the eu , except us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president gul thinks the eu is short-sighted not to welcome turkey citizens from every balkan country except kosovo , which some eu members consider a part of serbia , are now free to travel within the eu 's open-border area , while turks have to seek special visas .
" the eu will not be weaker , but stronger both politically and economically with turkey 's membership , " turkish president abdullah gul said in a speech in london on monday .
" given the fact that the international balance of power tends to shift towards the east and asia , it is , indeed , a strategic imperative for the eu to have turkey as a member . "
gul , speaking to the chatham house think-tank after receiving the organization 's annual prize for statesmanship , said it was " sad to observe " that some european leaders did not recognize the role turkey could play within the eu .
" this short-sighted vision is the major impediment before the idea of the eu as a global actor , capable of assuming greater responsibilities on political and security issues , complementing its economic clout , " the turkish president said .
in his speech , gul also announced that neighboring iran had asked turkey to host another round of talks with un security council members and germany on tehran 's nuclear program , alluding to the diplomatic role his country might play for the eu .
however , turkey 's international activities were also singled out by the eu for veiled criticism on tuesday , after the country defied the us and eu to vote against tougher un sanctions for iran earlier this year .
" turkey 's foreign policy has become more active in its wider neighborhood , " the commission 's report said .
" this is an asset for the european union , provided it is developed as a complement to turkey 's accession process and in coordination with the eu . "

these types of ultra-high-speed smash-ups at the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- are an attempt to re-create the explosion , known as the big bang , which is believed to have begun the universe .
as spokeswoman barbara warmbein told the associated press , the cern experiment over the weekend produced " a very , very , very small bang . "
lead ions are lead atoms whose electrons have been removed , and are much heavier than the protons that the researchers had been using .
that may be beneficial , as the energy required to smash them is higher , and thus may be closer to the conditions the scientists are trying to analyze .
as the research continues , scientists are trying to create " quark-gluon plasma , " an extremely hot and dense type of matter that may unlock some secrets in the early universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lead ion experiments will continue until cern shuts down for the winter on december 6 " the experiments are already providing an exciting glimpse of the new frontier , " sergio bertolucci , cern 's director for research and computing , told afp news agency .

beyond pushing the limits of particle physics , the team is also exploring the frontier of data storage and transfer .
cern is currently using 140 computer centers spread across 34 countries to back up and analyze its data , which is being transferred at peak rates of 10 gigabytes per second , or the equivalent of approximately two dvds per second .

but not for long .
as researcher philipp gunz explained to deutsche welle , the similarities evolved into differences during the first year of their lives , a finding which proves a cognitive gulf between humans and the extinct species .
" what is being established during that period , both in humans and neanderthals , is synaptic connection among brain cells , " gunz said .
" we know from the example of modern man that even subtle differences can have significant consequences on development , and can contribute to social and communication skills . "
and although gunz says there is little doubt that the neanderthals , which have been extinct for almost 30,000 years , had language and did communicate with each other , they would have seen the world differently to the way we do .
same , same , but not for long bildunterschrift : how alike were we really ?
baby homo neanderthalensis ' elongated braincases – also found in new-born humans – had more to do with the physical make-up of the mothers than anything else .
" the baby has to fit through the birth canal and the shape of both was very similar so that would impose a constraint . "
but once unbridled and free to grow at will , human braincases gradually begin to change form to become more globular .
it is this shape which gunz believes proves early brain development in man which is absent in neanderthals .
human uniqueness in earlier research the scientists discovered that right after birth human brains are quite unlike those of chimpanzees , but that they become more similar at a later stage of development .
this shows that the " globularization phase " sets humans apart from both chimps and neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : chimps and man : not so similar " we think modern humans , chimpanzees and neanderthals share one ancestral growth pattern that that goes back millions of years , " gunz continued .
" but in the first year of life , modern humans depart from this ancestral pattern . "
and contrary to past opinion , it is this first year , and not brain size , which is crucial to cognitive development .
the leipzig anthropologists say it is the internal organization of the brain that matters .
deeper understanding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's in an ancient tooth ?
the scientists hope their research will help them understand a little more about the function of the genes , only a very small number of which separate modern humans from their extinct counterparts .
" we assume that some of these genes are related to brain development , " gunz said .
" in living people these mutations are linked to autism or schizophrenia or down-syndrome . "
and while he is not suggesting that an autistic child is a throwback to tens of thousands of years ago , the leipzig anthropologist does venture a link .
" we know from teeth that neanderthals grew faster , so maybe some of the genes are related to the regulation of brain growth . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 09.11.2010 eu criticizes turkey in annual report on membership hopefuls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's accession talks with the eu are floundering the eu has called on turkey to open up trade with cyprus , to better promote gender equality and human rights , and to toe the line on foreign policy issues in a lukewarm appraisal of ankara 's path towards eu membership . the european union announced on tuesday that only one of seven candidates for membership in the bloc is close to achieving its goal .
" the negotiations with croatia are now in their final phase , " the european commission said in its annual report on the progress of would-be eu members .
the commission pointed to widespread corruption and organized crime problems in other western balkan applicant countries as the biggest hurdle to their joining the bloc in the short term , although it did announce that montenegro was ready for full candidate status , saying the country 's democracy " is largely in line with european principles and standards . "
montenegro 's application has already been recognized by the eu , and with the commission 's approval , member states will now debate whether to grant the country candidate status and begin the process of negotiating membership .
croatia , iceland , turkey and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia are the four candidates that have already reached this final phase of the accession process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks voted for constitutional changes meant to appease brussels in a september referendum turkey began its official negotiations five years ago , but the eu acknowledged in its report that the process has hit rather rocky ground .
" negotiations advanced , albeit rather slowly , " the commission said of accession talks with ankara .
several stumbling blocks despite praising constitutional reforms designed to fight corruption , wrest some political power away from the military , and improve the protection of human rights as " a step in the right direction , " the commission said that turkey was still lagging behind in areas like press freedom , freedom of expression and religion , the rights of women and trade unions , and the integration of the kurdish minority in the country .
" the pace of reform in turkey dictates the pace of the accession process , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle said in berlin , shortly after the report was released .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the division of cyprus has soured turkish relations with eu members greece and cyprus the european commission also called on turkey to open trade ties with cyprus and redouble diplomatic efforts with the country , describing the need for progress in this area as " urgent . "
eu member state cyprus and turkey are locked in a territorial dispute over the northern part of the island , which has been occupied by turkish forces since 1974 .
reunification talks have stalled , and turkey says it will not open trade ties with cyprus until the problem is resolved .
and while cyprus tries to slow turkey 's accession into the eu , turkey is using its membership of nato to hamper cyprus ' bid to join that alliance .
another problem facing turkey 's membership bid that did not get highlighted in the eu commission 's annual report is the sheer size of the country .
a 2009 census put turkey 's population at 72 million , which would make it the second most populous member of the bloc .
" that means turkey would be represented in the european parliament with a number of mps to reflect its size , and the size of its population would also mean a lot of weight in decisions in the council of ministers , " the head of the eu program at the german council on foreign relations , almut moeller , told deutsche welle .
moeller said that eu insiders often talk about the influence turkey would wield in the bloc , and the affect it would have on the larger countries and their power structure .
" this is a sensitively calibrated order that has been around for a while now , and in the past we have only seen smaller and medium-sized countries entering the bloc .
they have relatively little impact on the big players , but imagine what a country this size would mean for the old order , for the amount of power currently shared between france and germany in the eu , for instance . "
gul : ' strategic imperative ' to let turkey in five years ago , there was an outpouring of pro-european sentiment and euphoria in turkey when the country began the final phase of the eu accession process .
but the mood seems to be souring as other applicants make much smoother process towards membership in the bloc .
on monday , brussels announced plans to grant visa-free travel within the eu 's open-border schengen zone to people from albania and bosnia , and the turkish newspaper haber tuerk responded by proclaiming on tuesday 's front page : " everyone 's allowed into the eu , except us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president gul thinks the eu is short-sighted not to welcome turkey citizens from every balkan country except kosovo , which some eu members consider a part of serbia , are now free to travel within the eu 's open-border area , while turks have to seek special visas .
" the eu will not be weaker , but stronger both politically and economically with turkey 's membership , " turkish president abdullah gul said in a speech in london on monday .
" given the fact that the international balance of power tends to shift towards the east and asia , it is , indeed , a strategic imperative for the eu to have turkey as a member . "
gul , speaking to the chatham house think-tank after receiving the organization 's annual prize for statesmanship , said it was " sad to observe " that some european leaders did not recognize the role turkey could play within the eu .
" this short-sighted vision is the major impediment before the idea of the eu as a global actor , capable of assuming greater responsibilities on political and security issues , complementing its economic clout , " the turkish president said .
in his speech , gul also announced that neighboring iran had asked turkey to host another round of talks with un security council members and germany on tehran 's nuclear program , alluding to the diplomatic role his country might play for the eu .
however , turkey 's international activities were also singled out by the eu for veiled criticism on tuesday , after the country defied the us and eu to vote against tougher un sanctions for iran earlier this year .
" turkey 's foreign policy has become more active in its wider neighborhood , " the commission 's report said .
" this is an asset for the european union , provided it is developed as a complement to turkey 's accession process and in coordination with the eu . "

dw-world.de opinion : a guilty conscience is no basis for membership how should the eu deal with turkey 's membership hopes ?

these types of ultra-high-speed smash-ups at the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- are an attempt to re-create the explosion , known as the big bang , which is believed to have begun the universe .
as spokeswoman barbara warmbein told the associated press , the cern experiment over the weekend produced " a very , very , very small bang . "
lead ions are lead atoms whose electrons have been removed , and are much heavier than the protons that the researchers had been using .
that may be beneficial , as the energy required to smash them is higher , and thus may be closer to the conditions the scientists are trying to analyze .
as the research continues , scientists are trying to create " quark-gluon plasma , " an extremely hot and dense type of matter that may unlock some secrets in the early universe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lead ion experiments will continue until cern shuts down for the winter on december 6 " the experiments are already providing an exciting glimpse of the new frontier , " sergio bertolucci , cern 's director for research and computing , told afp news agency .
major breakthroughs ' could take years ' the lhc is comprised of a circular , 27-kilometer -lrb- 17-mile -rrb- atom-smasher that cost four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.2 billion -rrb- to build near geneva .
it began operations in september 2008 .
beyond pushing the limits of particle physics , the team is also exploring the frontier of data storage and transfer .
cern is currently using 140 computer centers spread across 34 countries to back up and analyze its data , which is being transferred at peak rates of 10 gigabytes per second , or the equivalent of approximately two dvds per second .
still , warmbein added that it will likely be months , if not years , before cern scientists make any major breakthroughs .

but not for long .
as researcher philipp gunz explained to deutsche welle , the similarities evolved into differences during the first year of their lives , a finding which proves a cognitive gulf between humans and the extinct species .
" what is being established during that period , both in humans and neanderthals , is synaptic connection among brain cells , " gunz said .
" we know from the example of modern man that even subtle differences can have significant consequences on development , and can contribute to social and communication skills . "
and although gunz says there is little doubt that the neanderthals , which have been extinct for almost 30,000 years , had language and did communicate with each other , they would have seen the world differently to the way we do .
same , same , but not for long bildunterschrift : how alike were we really ?
baby homo neanderthalensis ' elongated braincases – also found in new-born humans – had more to do with the physical make-up of the mothers than anything else .
" the baby has to fit through the birth canal and the shape of both was very similar so that would impose a constraint . "
but once unbridled and free to grow at will , human braincases gradually begin to change form to become more globular .
it is this shape which gunz believes proves early brain development in man which is absent in neanderthals .
human uniqueness in earlier research the scientists discovered that right after birth human brains are quite unlike those of chimpanzees , but that they become more similar at a later stage of development .
this shows that the " globularization phase " sets humans apart from both chimps and neanderthals .
bildunterschrift : chimps and man : not so similar " we think modern humans , chimpanzees and neanderthals share one ancestral growth pattern that that goes back millions of years , " gunz continued .
" but in the first year of life , modern humans depart from this ancestral pattern . "
and contrary to past opinion , it is this first year , and not brain size , which is crucial to cognitive development .
the leipzig anthropologists say it is the internal organization of the brain that matters .
deeper understanding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what 's in an ancient tooth ?
the scientists hope their research will help them understand a little more about the function of the genes , only a very small number of which separate modern humans from their extinct counterparts .
" we assume that some of these genes are related to brain development , " gunz said .
" in living people these mutations are linked to autism or schizophrenia or down-syndrome . "
and while he is not suggesting that an autistic child is a throwback to tens of thousands of years ago , the leipzig anthropologist does venture a link .
" we know from teeth that neanderthals grew faster , so maybe some of the genes are related to the regulation of brain growth . "

the key speaker at the event was a controversial choice , attacked by german jewish groups for his criticism of israel .
the 1938 kristallnacht is considered to be the first nazi-sanctioned nation-wide attack against jews .
mobs sought out and torched jewish-owned shops , homes and synagogues around the country .
many were murdered , while tens of thousands were deported to nazi concentration camps .
key speaker at the frankfurt st paul 's church ceremony was german-born french author alfred grosser .
as expected , grosser launched into a critique of israeli policies towards the palestinians , saying it could not be expected that those in gaza could " understand the horror of assassinations , if you do not show great sympathy in understanding the suffering in the gaza strip . "
the announcement that grosser would speak at the anniversary ceremony had led to fierce objections from germany 's central council of jews and others in the country 's jewish community .
many threatened to walk out of the proceedings if grosser entered into a diatribe against the jewish state .
grosser said he felt justified in criticizing israel as he considered the country to be part of europe , adding that everybody should be held accountable to western values .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grosser has taken an interest in the israel-palestine conflict despite the 85-year-old 's comments , none of the attendees at the service walked out .
members of the central council of jews attending the ceremony said grosser had not crossed the line in his speech .
focus on israel grosser comes from a jewish family which immigrated to france in 1933 .
the political scientist and author of numerous books and essays is seen as an important pioneer in post-war franco-german understanding .
in recent years he has become increasingly interested in the israeli-palestinian conflict .
his 2009 book " von auschwitz nach jerusalem " -lrb- from auschwitz to jerusalem -rrb- caused controversy as he dealt with the permissibility of questioning the policies of israel .
meanwhile , the president of the central council of jews in germany has used the kristallnacht anniversary to warn of rising anti-semitism in the country .
president charlotte knobloch called for more civil courage from germans to fight xenophobia and anti-semitism .
she stressed that young germans should take a more active roll in remembering the crimes of the nazi era .

the agency , the energy arm of the organization for economic cooperation and development , a grouping of the world 's richest nations , forecast that global oil demand will rise to 99 million barrels a day by 2035 , some 15 million barrels a day higher than last year .
" the message is clear , the price will go up , especially if consuming countries do not make changes in the way they consume oil , especially in the transport sector , " the iea 's chief economist and lead author of the report , fatih birol told reuters in an interview .
oil prices will exceed $ 200 -lrb- 144 euro -rrb- a barrel by 2035 , and will likely stay over $ 100 a barrel after 2015 , the report said .
on tuesday the price of oil stood at roughly $ 87 a barrel .
china drives demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace wants even more emphasis on renewables china and other emerging economies are driving demand for oil higher .
" all the net growth comes from non-oecd countries , almost half from china alone , mainly driven by rising use of transport fuels , " the iea said in the report .
oil subsidies were limiting the scope for higher prices to choke off demand and change consumer habits , the iea said , and called for oil subsidies to be reduced .
" if subsidy policy does not change , with increasing price assumptions , these $ 312 billion in subsidies for 2009 will reach $ 600 billion in 2015 .
that 's huge , " birol said .
the report estimated that renewable energy only receives $ 57 billion in subsidies , a fraction of the ongoing support for the fossil fuel sector .
eradicating fossil fuel subsidies would boost the global economy , environment and energy security , the iea said , referring to a pledge made by g20 countries .
g20 leaders committed in pittsburgh in 2009 to phase out , over the medium-term , inefficient fossil fuel subsidies which distort the energy market and encourage wasteful consumption .
a g20 meeting in seoul this week may update progress on fossil fuels . greenpeace welcomed the iea 's call to cut the $ 312 billion in global fossil fuel subsidies .
" the iea report clearly states that fossil fuels are heavily subsidized … leading to unfair competition with clean and climate friendly renewable energies .
we welcome that renewables are now in the focus of the 2010 edition , " said sven teske , renewable energy director at greenpeace international , in a press release .
gas glut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surplus of gas may hinder development in renewable energy the future of renewable energy depended on strong government support , said the iea report , especially given an expected " ten year glut in gas " which would suppress fossil fuel power prices and make renewables look even less competitive .
" the gas glut will be with us ten more years , " birol told reuters .
" cheaper gas prices will put additional pressure on renewable energies especially in the us and europe .
if natural gas is as plenty and cheap as we think , then life for renewables will be even more difficult , " he added although greenpeace praised the iea for making renewable energy more prominent in this year 's report , teske from greenpeace international criticized the iea 's emphasis on other energy sources such as nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- for coal power stations .
" the iea is failing to shift technology recommendations from unproven , dangerous and expensive technologies such as ccs and nuclear power plants , " teske said .
greenpeace would like to see more emphasis on renewable energy and greater efficiency to reduce co2 emissions .

wittenberg 's grandfather was a rabbi there during the so-called kristallnacht , or night of broken glass .
all throughout germany and austria , jewish homes , business , and synagogues were ransacked and thousands of jews were deported to concentration camps .
now , accompanied by his dog mitzpah , he is carrying the torch by foot and by ferry .
in london , he will use it to symbolically light the eternal flame of a new synagogue for his own congregation .
the three-week project also serves as a fundraiser to support a variety of charities and interfaith projects .
deutsche welle spoke with the rabbi in cologne , at the midway point through his walk .
deutsche welle : rabbi wittenberg , can you tell me where the idea came from to take this walk , and what the journey is really all about ?
jonathan wittenberg : it was really when i was rereading my grandfather 's memoirs , at the 70th anniversary of kristallnacht .
i just wanted to remember what had happened to him .
and i read there how he was called by the gestapo on the 10th of november , on the allegation that he had the keys to the westend synagogue , which he did n't . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rabbi stopped at maria-laach abbey , in germany 's eifel region he wrote that he came to the main synagogue ; the fire brigade was there , and they were doing nothing .
he heard people in the crowd say -lsb- … -rsb- that the interior of the westend synagogue had been destroyed - wrecked and trashed - but that the eternal light -lsb- a constant flame that is lit in every synagogue ; eds . -rsb- was still burning .
and people took that for a miracle .
this spoke to me .
my own synagogue is building a new building .
we 've been working on it for 15 years and it 's nearing completion .
and i had the thought , because i am a lover of walking , of coming to frankfurt , of lighting a symbolic flame , and bringing it back to london to light our new eternal light . so you made ' light ' the subject of your walk ?
i was very struck by this idea , of light that burns despite darkness .
it 's an image that speaks to me in all kinds of ways as a rabbi .
i encounter a lot of darkness people struggle with .
i see the courage of people in facing illness , in facing death .
i also see the courage of people in a political context .
one of the organizations i am supporting on this walk is the parents ' circle , made up of parents who 've lost children on both sides of the israeli-palestinian conflict .
this group of parents , instead of blaming the others , instead of hating , they 're saying , ' well , this is a message that we need understanding . '
tell me about the ' eternal light ' that you are carrying .
how did you get it , and how are you transporting it ?
very simply , it 's an electric torch - a flashlight .
it 's symbolic .
i 'm not an olympic runner , and nobody 's going to let me into a cafe along the way with a great big torch on fire .
but what i did n't want to do was just to come by plane and take the torch and just fly back .
there 's no substance to something like that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the route traverses german wine country the trip began at the westend synagogue on october 24 .
i was there with a group of about 20 people from london who came to share the start of the journey .
the ceremony where i took the light was simple , just a couple of verses : " god is my light , and my salvation . "
one of the people with us was a hazzan -lsb- a singer trained to accompany jewish religious services ; eds . -rsb- who very beautifully sang those verses .
coincidentally , that day was the celebration of the 100-year anniversary of the westend synagogue .
i was invited to speak .
it was very , very moving .
my grandfather - my mother 's father - had been the main rabbi there for almost 30 years .
he died in 1975 .
what do you feel you 've learned about light along the way so far ?
my understanding of the meaning of light is constantly growing and constantly changing .
and just as light expands , so my understanding of it has expanded .
there is the beautiful natural light , while walking along the main and rhine rivers .
and then there is the tremendous amount of kindness i 've met in very ordinary circumstances .
on the second day , i was walking with a friend of mine who is a protestant minister .
i needed something to eat , and we went into a place - it turned out to be in a castle along the hiking trail , a very posh place .
i asked , ' can i have some bread please ? '
and the man came back with a basket of fruit and all kinds of bread .
i took out my purse to pay , and he said , ' no , please take it .
it 's a gift . '
i had n't told him what i was doing but it was obvious that i was somehow … en route .
i 've encountered that kind of kindness all along .
that is a kind of light .
you 're not just trekking on this trip - you 're visiting various religious sites , holding talks with social-interest groups , and visiting jewish monuments .
has that added to your understanding of light ?
yes .
there have been moments of contact with people who are engaged with what was the jewish past in germany .
we stopped in the town of bingen , at the study group for judaism there .
i asked the lady who leads it , ' why do you do this ? '
she was n't jewish , did n't have jewish ancestors .
none of them did .
she said she did it because her father had a close relationship to the jewish community and had been helped by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rabbi stopped at a thai buddhist center along the way have you found anything unexpected so far ?
well , walking in the lower rhineland up to cologne , i 've thought a lot about the shoah , obviously .
but i 've also been conscious that here was a thousand years of jewish creative history .
we were in a tiny village , st. goar .
and in that tiny rhineland village , the sefer ha-maharil , which is a key work in the progression of ashkenazy jewish law , was composed .
it still affects our practices today .
so , i had n't expected to feel such continuity with jewish culture as i have felt - this sense of jewish history , of learning , creativity , and study .
i expected to feel far more estranged .
your grandfather was german , and you speak excellent german although you yourself are english .
has this walk raised any thoughts about your own german ancestry ?
i 've been to germany many times before , but never for this long .
my grandfather loved the german jewish culture .
unlike many , he did n't teach us to hate germany .
he said we should differentiate between nazism and german culture .
i think there are a lot of questions to be asked about whether that differentiation could be made quite as neatly as that .
but that was certainly his attitude , so i have n't had to overcome an inner revulsion to being in germany - i never had it .
and i deeply do n't believe you can blame one generation for what another generation did .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the second fundraising walk wittenberg has taken with his dog , mitzpah but there is no doubt that there is a legacy .
and i think finding ways to face that legacy together as much as possible - you ca n't do it with major perpetrators - but with people who are struggling with what the past has meant to them , i think enabling that kind of conversation is very important .
was being on this trip during kristallnacht , the night of broken glass , part of your plan ?
on november 9 i 'll be in holland , since i 've been asked to speak there .
it would have made more sense to be in germany , but that 's where it worked out .
in any case i definitely wanted to be traveling the route on kristallnacht .
towards the end of the walk i pick up the route of the kindertransporte , -lsb- the name given to the movement to rescue some 10,000 jewish children from the nazis by sending them to live in the uk , just prior to the outbreak of world war ii ; eds . -rsb-
so that 's something i find deeply moving .
i 'm guessing you are something of a strange sight in the german countryside - a rabbi wearing a yarmulke and a backpack , with a dog in tow .
have you gotten some odd reactions ?
not at all - although people do keep stopping me to tell me that the flashlight in my backpack has been left on .
they do n't know i 've done it on purpose .

wittenberg 's grandfather was a rabbi there during the so-called kristallnacht , or night of broken glass .
all throughout germany and austria , jewish homes , business , and synagogues were ransacked and thousands of jews were deported to concentration camps .
now , accompanied by his dog mitzpah , he is carrying the torch by foot and by ferry .
in london , he will use it to symbolically light the eternal flame of a new synagogue for his own congregation .
the three-week project also serves as a fundraiser to support a variety of charities and interfaith projects .
deutsche welle spoke with the rabbi in cologne , at the midway point through his walk .
deutsche welle : rabbi wittenberg , can you tell me where the idea came from to take this walk , and what the journey is really all about ?
jonathan wittenberg : it was really when i was rereading my grandfather 's memoirs , at the 70th anniversary of kristallnacht .
i just wanted to remember what had happened to him .
and i read there how he was called by the gestapo on the 10th of november , on the allegation that he had the keys to the westend synagogue , which he did n't . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rabbi stopped at maria-laach abbey , in germany 's eifel region he wrote that he came to the main synagogue ; the fire brigade was there , and they were doing nothing .
he heard people in the crowd say -lsb- … -rsb- that the interior of the westend synagogue had been destroyed - wrecked and trashed - but that the eternal light -lsb- a constant flame that is lit in every synagogue ; eds . -rsb- was still burning .
and people took that for a miracle .
this spoke to me .
my own synagogue is building a new building .
we 've been working on it for 15 years and it 's nearing completion .
and i had the thought , because i am a lover of walking , of coming to frankfurt , of lighting a symbolic flame , and bringing it back to london to light our new eternal light . so you made ' light ' the subject of your walk ?
i was very struck by this idea , of light that burns despite darkness .
it 's an image that speaks to me in all kinds of ways as a rabbi .
i encounter a lot of darkness people struggle with .
i see the courage of people in facing illness , in facing death .
i also see the courage of people in a political context .
one of the organizations i am supporting on this walk is the parents ' circle , made up of parents who 've lost children on both sides of the israeli-palestinian conflict .
this group of parents , instead of blaming the others , instead of hating , they 're saying , ' well , this is a message that we need understanding . '
tell me about the ' eternal light ' that you are carrying .
how did you get it , and how are you transporting it ?
very simply , it 's an electric torch - a flashlight .
it 's symbolic .
i 'm not an olympic runner , and nobody 's going to let me into a cafe along the way with a great big torch on fire .
but what i did n't want to do was just to come by plane and take the torch and just fly back .
there 's no substance to something like that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the route traverses german wine country the trip began at the westend synagogue on october 24 .
i was there with a group of about 20 people from london who came to share the start of the journey .
the ceremony where i took the light was simple , just a couple of verses : " god is my light , and my salvation . "
one of the people with us was a hazzan -lsb- a singer trained to accompany jewish religious services ; eds . -rsb- who very beautifully sang those verses .
coincidentally , that day was the celebration of the 100-year anniversary of the westend synagogue .
i was invited to speak .
it was very , very moving .
my grandfather - my mother 's father - had been the main rabbi there for almost 30 years .
he died in 1975 .

the agency , the energy arm of the organization for economic cooperation and development , a grouping of the world 's richest nations , forecast that global oil demand will rise to 99 million barrels a day by 2035 , some 15 million barrels a day higher than last year .
" the message is clear , the price will go up , especially if consuming countries do not make changes in the way they consume oil , especially in the transport sector , " the iea 's chief economist and lead author of the report , fatih birol told reuters in an interview .
oil prices will exceed $ 200 -lrb- 144 euro -rrb- a barrel by 2035 , and will likely stay over $ 100 a barrel after 2015 , the report said .
on tuesday the price of oil stood at roughly $ 87 a barrel .
china drives demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace wants even more emphasis on renewables china and other emerging economies are driving demand for oil higher .
" all the net growth comes from non-oecd countries , almost half from china alone , mainly driven by rising use of transport fuels , " the iea said in the report .
oil subsidies were limiting the scope for higher prices to choke off demand and change consumer habits , the iea said , and called for oil subsidies to be reduced .
" if subsidy policy does not change , with increasing price assumptions , these $ 312 billion in subsidies for 2009 will reach $ 600 billion in 2015 .
that 's huge , " birol said .
the report estimated that renewable energy only receives $ 57 billion in subsidies , a fraction of the ongoing support for the fossil fuel sector .
eradicating fossil fuel subsidies would boost the global economy , environment and energy security , the iea said , referring to a pledge made by g20 countries .
g20 leaders committed in pittsburgh in 2009 to phase out , over the medium-term , inefficient fossil fuel subsidies which distort the energy market and encourage wasteful consumption .
a g20 meeting in seoul this week may update progress on fossil fuels . greenpeace welcomed the iea 's call to cut the $ 312 billion in global fossil fuel subsidies .
" the iea report clearly states that fossil fuels are heavily subsidized … leading to unfair competition with clean and climate friendly renewable energies .
we welcome that renewables are now in the focus of the 2010 edition , " said sven teske , renewable energy director at greenpeace international , in a press release .
gas glut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surplus of gas may hinder development in renewable energy the future of renewable energy depended on strong government support , said the iea report , especially given an expected " ten year glut in gas " which would suppress fossil fuel power prices and make renewables look even less competitive .
" the gas glut will be with us ten more years , " birol told reuters .
" cheaper gas prices will put additional pressure on renewable energies especially in the us and europe .
if natural gas is as plenty and cheap as we think , then life for renewables will be even more difficult , " he added although greenpeace praised the iea for making renewable energy more prominent in this year 's report , teske from greenpeace international criticized the iea 's emphasis on other energy sources such as nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- for coal power stations .
" the iea is failing to shift technology recommendations from unproven , dangerous and expensive technologies such as ccs and nuclear power plants , " teske said .
greenpeace would like to see more emphasis on renewable energy and greater efficiency to reduce co2 emissions .

and people took that for a miracle .
this spoke to me .
my own synagogue is building a new building .
we 've been working on it for 15 years and it 's nearing completion .
and i had the thought , because i am a lover of walking , of coming to frankfurt , of lighting a symbolic flame , and bringing it back to london to light our new eternal light . so you made ' light ' the subject of your walk ?
i was very struck by this idea , of light that burns despite darkness .

this group of parents , instead of blaming the others , instead of hating , they 're saying , ' well , this is a message that we need understanding . '
tell me about the ' eternal light ' that you are carrying .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the route traverses german wine country the trip began at the westend synagogue on october 24 .
i was there with a group of about 20 people from london who came to share the start of the journey .
the ceremony where i took the light was simple , just a couple of verses : " god is my light , and my salvation . "
one of the people with us was a hazzan -lsb- a singer trained to accompany jewish religious services ; eds . -rsb- who very beautifully sang those verses .
coincidentally , that day was the celebration of the 100-year anniversary of the westend synagogue .
i was invited to speak .
it was very , very moving .
my grandfather - my mother 's father - had been the main rabbi there for almost 30 years .
he died in 1975 .
what do you feel you 've learned about light along the way so far ?
my understanding of the meaning of light is constantly growing and constantly changing .
and just as light expands , so my understanding of it has expanded .
there is the beautiful natural light , while walking along the main and rhine rivers .
and then there is the tremendous amount of kindness i 've met in very ordinary circumstances .
on the second day , i was walking with a friend of mine who is a protestant minister .
i needed something to eat , and we went into a place - it turned out to be in a castle along the hiking trail , a very posh place .
i asked , ' can i have some bread please ? '
and the man came back with a basket of fruit and all kinds of bread .
i took out my purse to pay , and he said , ' no , please take it .
it 's a gift . '
i had n't told him what i was doing but it was obvious that i was somehow … en route .
i 've encountered that kind of kindness all along .
that is a kind of light .
you 're not just trekking on this trip - you 're visiting various religious sites , holding talks with social-interest groups , and visiting jewish monuments .
has that added to your understanding of light ?
yes .
there have been moments of contact with people who are engaged with what was the jewish past in germany .
we stopped in the town of bingen , at the study group for judaism there .
i asked the lady who leads it , ' why do you do this ? '
she was n't jewish , did n't have jewish ancestors .
none of them did .
she said she did it because her father had a close relationship to the jewish community and had been helped by them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rabbi stopped at a thai buddhist center along the way have you found anything unexpected so far ?
well , walking in the lower rhineland up to cologne , i 've thought a lot about the shoah , obviously .
but i 've also been conscious that here was a thousand years of jewish creative history .
we were in a tiny village , st. goar .
and in that tiny rhineland village , the sefer ha-maharil , which is a key work in the progression of ashkenazy jewish law , was composed .
it still affects our practices today .
so , i had n't expected to feel such continuity with jewish culture as i have felt - this sense of jewish history , of learning , creativity , and study .
i expected to feel far more estranged .
your grandfather was german , and you speak excellent german although you yourself are english .
has this walk raised any thoughts about your own german ancestry ?
i 've been to germany many times before , but never for this long .
my grandfather loved the german jewish culture .
unlike many , he did n't teach us to hate germany .
he said we should differentiate between nazism and german culture .
i think there are a lot of questions to be asked about whether that differentiation could be made quite as neatly as that .
but that was certainly his attitude , so i have n't had to overcome an inner revulsion to being in germany - i never had it .
and i deeply do n't believe you can blame one generation for what another generation did .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the second fundraising walk wittenberg has taken with his dog , mitzpah but there is no doubt that there is a legacy .
and i think finding ways to face that legacy together as much as possible - you ca n't do it with major perpetrators - but with people who are struggling with what the past has meant to them , i think enabling that kind of conversation is very important .
was being on this trip during kristallnacht , the night of broken glass , part of your plan ?
on november 9 i 'll be in holland , since i 've been asked to speak there .
it would have made more sense to be in germany , but that 's where it worked out .
in any case i definitely wanted to be traveling the route on kristallnacht .
towards the end of the walk i pick up the route of the kindertransporte , -lsb- the name given to the movement to rescue some 10,000 jewish children from the nazis by sending them to live in the uk , just prior to the outbreak of world war ii ; eds . -rsb-
so that 's something i find deeply moving .
i 'm guessing you are something of a strange sight in the german countryside - a rabbi wearing a yarmulke and a backpack , with a dog in tow .
have you gotten some odd reactions ?
not at all - although people do keep stopping me to tell me that the flashlight in my backpack has been left on .
they do n't know i 've done it on purpose .

bush recalls in his book " decision points , " released tuesday in the us , that schroeder 's reversal on supporting the iraq war in a bid to win re-election in 2004 caused their relationship to sour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 09.11.2010 iea predicts oil prices will more than double by 2035 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iea wants countries to change the way they consume oil the international energy agency has called for oil subsidies to be eradicated as it predicts that oil demand and prices will rise in the next 25 years , despite a push towards green energy . the international energy agency has warned that governments need to do more to increase efficiency and boost green technologies to meet a forecasted 36 percent jump in energy demand between 2008 and 2035 .
the agency , the energy arm of the organization for economic cooperation and development , a grouping of the world 's richest nations , forecast that global oil demand will rise to 99 million barrels a day by 2035 , some 15 million barrels a day higher than last year .
" the message is clear , the price will go up , especially if consuming countries do not make changes in the way they consume oil , especially in the transport sector , " the iea 's chief economist and lead author of the report , fatih birol told reuters in an interview .
oil prices will exceed $ 200 -lrb- 144 euro -rrb- a barrel by 2035 , and will likely stay over $ 100 a barrel after 2015 , the report said .
on tuesday the price of oil stood at roughly $ 87 a barrel .
china drives demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace wants even more emphasis on renewables china and other emerging economies are driving demand for oil higher .
" all the net growth comes from non-oecd countries , almost half from china alone , mainly driven by rising use of transport fuels , " the iea said in the report .
oil subsidies were limiting the scope for higher prices to choke off demand and change consumer habits , the iea said , and called for oil subsidies to be reduced .
" if subsidy policy does not change , with increasing price assumptions , these $ 312 billion in subsidies for 2009 will reach $ 600 billion in 2015 .
that 's huge , " birol said .
the report estimated that renewable energy only receives $ 57 billion in subsidies , a fraction of the ongoing support for the fossil fuel sector .
eradicating fossil fuel subsidies would boost the global economy , environment and energy security , the iea said , referring to a pledge made by g20 countries .
g20 leaders committed in pittsburgh in 2009 to phase out , over the medium-term , inefficient fossil fuel subsidies which distort the energy market and encourage wasteful consumption .
a g20 meeting in seoul this week may update progress on fossil fuels . greenpeace welcomed the iea 's call to cut the $ 312 billion in global fossil fuel subsidies .
" the iea report clearly states that fossil fuels are heavily subsidized … leading to unfair competition with clean and climate friendly renewable energies .
we welcome that renewables are now in the focus of the 2010 edition , " said sven teske , renewable energy director at greenpeace international , in a press release .
gas glut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surplus of gas may hinder development in renewable energy the future of renewable energy depended on strong government support , said the iea report , especially given an expected " ten year glut in gas " which would suppress fossil fuel power prices and make renewables look even less competitive .
" the gas glut will be with us ten more years , " birol told reuters .
" cheaper gas prices will put additional pressure on renewable energies especially in the us and europe .
if natural gas is as plenty and cheap as we think , then life for renewables will be even more difficult , " he added although greenpeace praised the iea for making renewable energy more prominent in this year 's report , teske from greenpeace international criticized the iea 's emphasis on other energy sources such as nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- for coal power stations .
" the iea is failing to shift technology recommendations from unproven , dangerous and expensive technologies such as ccs and nuclear power plants , " teske said .
greenpeace would like to see more emphasis on renewable energy and greater efficiency to reduce co2 emissions .

they are now on display at the neues museum in berlin . a collection of classical modernist sculptures has been uncovered in central berlin , found during excavation work for an underground metro link .
the 11 pieces had been missing for decades after being labeled by the nazis as " degenerate art . " eight of the sculptures , some of which are damaged , have been identified as the works of german artists otto baum , otto freundlich , karl knappe , marg moll , emy roeder , edwin scharff , gustav heinrich wolff and naum slutzky . the other three have not yet been identified , according to hermann parzinger , head of the berlin-based prussian cultural heritage foundation . a lucky strike the sculptures were found underground next to berlin 's town hall ; what is now a large open space used to be a city center , full of houses , shops and offices . according to archeologist and director of berlin 's museum of early history , matthias wemhoff , the excavators suddenly came across an object that fell down and produced a rather metallic sound .
it was " totally covered in grout " but later identified as the sculpture of actress anni mewes by artist edwin scharff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the works were found near berlin 's town hall , in the heart of the city " you think you 're excavating a town hall from the 13th century , which is already significant enough in itself , " said hermann parzinger from the prussian cultural heritage foundation , " -lsb- … -rsb- and then you find ' degenerate ' art . " the nazis categorized as " degenerate " modern art that did not glorify their ideals .
the affected artists , many of them jewish , were subject to sanctions .
some works were destroyed , while others were hidden from the authorities , only to be rediscovered discovered after the war - in this case , many years later . berlin mayor klaus wowereit said he saw the find as " a small miracle " and a successfully foiled nazi attempt to " ban this classical modernity from german history . " there are indications that the artworks had been stored in what used to be house number 50 on koenigstrasse , now known as rathausstrasse .
number 50 housed the office of tax advisor erhard oewerdieck , a man who at one point employed jewish bookkeeper martin lange and provided him with a hiding place before organizing his escape to the us . " we have no proof that the sculptures were in erhard oewerdieck 's possession or stored in the apartment - we only have clues , " said wemhoff .
" we now have to find out who else had this apartment . " survivors of neglect the identified sculptures , created in the 1920s and early 1930s , include standing figures by otto baum , gustav heinrich and karl knappe , a head by otto freundlich , a dancing figure by marg moll , a pregnant woman by emy roeder , the bust of anni mewes by edwin scharff and a bust of a woman by naum slutzky . although they have been relatively well preserved , according to wemhoff , they still show signs of the neglect they suffered . " if you look at this sculpture now , it 's very different from the way it was in the 30s , " said wemhoff of the dancer figure by marg moll .
" it 's no longer shiny brass .
it 's a sculpture that has experienced a certain transformation . " he also took the figure created by karl knappe as an example , pointing out the eroded structures of its face , which is " marked by fire . " " that 's when you see what fate these sculptures have suffered , " added wemhoff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bust of anni mewes was found covered in grout confiscated by the nazis , the sculptures were part of a " degenerate art " exhibition in 1937 and then delivered to the third reich 's ministry of propaganda .
during world war ii they disappeared without a trace and were subsequently classified as " lost " by german museums . decisions about the future the prussian cultural heritage foundation is working together with the museums that used to display the sculptures to work out the issue of ownership .
however , according to klaus wowereit , the most important thing is that the sculptures have been found .
" that 's the special thing , and that 's why for me the question of where or who they belong to , or where they will stand later , is not the priority right now , " said wowereit .
" being able to present them is an unusually fortunate situation . " as of november 9 , the rediscovered works are on display in berlin 's neues museum . author : juergen koenig -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet despite booming export rates , the country 's economic growth appears to be headed for a setback . german exports have reached their highest level in more than two years .
according to figures released by the federal statistics office on monday , sales abroad rose by three percent to 84.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 117.4 billion -rrb- .
" the exports sector remains the driving force behind the country 's economic recovery , " said anton boerner , president of the federation of german wholesale , foreign trade and services .
powered by demand from emerging economies like china , the increase in exports was twice the expected 1.5 percent rise predicted by analysts .
industrial output drops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boerner says exports remain the driving force behind germany 's economic recovery but the new data came as industrial output slumped , with both industrial production and factory orders falling short of expectations .
instead of a predicted 0.5 percent increase , industrial output in october dropped by 0.8 percent compared to the previous month .
despite releasing disappointing figures , the economics ministry in berlin insisted that germany 's economic recovery was not in danger .
berlin insists overall trend is positive " industrial production is still trending upwards .
in the third quarter , output could again rise above the level of the second quarter , when we saw strong growth , " the ministry said in a statement . in september , berlin had raised its 2010 growth forecast to 3.4 percent , following a crippling contraction of 4.7 percent in 2009 .
at the same time , unemployment dropped to 7.5 percent in the seasonally adjusted term .
the number of total unemployed dropped to below 3 million for the first time in two decades .

the agency , the energy arm of the organization for economic cooperation and development , a grouping of the world 's richest nations , forecast that global oil demand will rise to 99 million barrels a day by 2035 , some 15 million barrels a day higher than last year .
" the message is clear , the price will go up , especially if consuming countries do not make changes in the way they consume oil , especially in the transport sector , " the iea 's chief economist and lead author of the report , fatih birol told reuters in an interview .
oil prices will exceed $ 200 -lrb- 144 euro -rrb- a barrel by 2035 , and will likely stay over $ 100 a barrel after 2015 , the report said .
on tuesday the price of oil stood at roughly $ 87 a barrel .
china drives demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace wants even more emphasis on renewables china and other emerging economies are driving demand for oil higher .
" all the net growth comes from non-oecd countries , almost half from china alone , mainly driven by rising use of transport fuels , " the iea said in the report .
oil subsidies were limiting the scope for higher prices to choke off demand and change consumer habits , the iea said , and called for oil subsidies to be reduced .
" if subsidy policy does not change , with increasing price assumptions , these $ 312 billion in subsidies for 2009 will reach $ 600 billion in 2015 .
that 's huge , " birol said .
the report estimated that renewable energy only receives $ 57 billion in subsidies , a fraction of the ongoing support for the fossil fuel sector .
eradicating fossil fuel subsidies would boost the global economy , environment and energy security , the iea said , referring to a pledge made by g20 countries .
g20 leaders committed in pittsburgh in 2009 to phase out , over the medium-term , inefficient fossil fuel subsidies which distort the energy market and encourage wasteful consumption .
a g20 meeting in seoul this week may update progress on fossil fuels . greenpeace welcomed the iea 's call to cut the $ 312 billion in global fossil fuel subsidies .
" the iea report clearly states that fossil fuels are heavily subsidized … leading to unfair competition with clean and climate friendly renewable energies .
we welcome that renewables are now in the focus of the 2010 edition , " said sven teske , renewable energy director at greenpeace international , in a press release .
gas glut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surplus of gas may hinder development in renewable energy the future of renewable energy depended on strong government support , said the iea report , especially given an expected " ten year glut in gas " which would suppress fossil fuel power prices and make renewables look even less competitive .
" the gas glut will be with us ten more years , " birol told reuters .
" cheaper gas prices will put additional pressure on renewable energies especially in the us and europe .
if natural gas is as plenty and cheap as we think , then life for renewables will be even more difficult , " he added although greenpeace praised the iea for making renewable energy more prominent in this year 's report , teske from greenpeace international criticized the iea 's emphasis on other energy sources such as nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage -lrb- ccs -rrb- for coal power stations .
" the iea is failing to shift technology recommendations from unproven , dangerous and expensive technologies such as ccs and nuclear power plants , " teske said .
greenpeace would like to see more emphasis on renewable energy and greater efficiency to reduce co2 emissions .

nonnenmacher was recently implicated in a spying scandal at the bank . the axe appears to be about to fall on the head of one of germany 's powerful state banks , hsh nordbank , after the lender 's major shareholders asked its supervisory board to give scandal-plagued ceo dirk jens nonnenmacher the sack .
nonnenmacher 's tenure as hsh chief was thrown into doubt after he was implicated in allegations of spying at the state-controlled bank .
the 47-year-old has also been investigated by prosecutors over risky investments that led to the bank losing millions of euros .
hsh nordbank 's biggest investors , the states of schleswig-holstein and hamburg , have reportedly asked the bank 's supervisory board chairman hilmar kopper to begin proceedings to find a new ceo for the lender .
in a written statement , the state governments said nonnenmacher 's dismissal was necessary to " win back lost trust " in hsh , whose main commercial focus is on shipping , transportation , real estate and renewable energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nonnenmacher has been in the post for around two years kopper said the supervisory board " took note " of the request by the state governments .
however , a decision will likely have to wait until at least the next board meeting on december 2 .
" -lsb- nonnenmacher -rsb- will continue with his duties for the time being with the necessary energy and reliability , " kopper said tuesday .
nonnenmacher 's contract at the bank runs until october 2012 .
a trained mathematician , he worked for several private banks before joining hsh nordbank in 2007 .
he became chairman in november 2008 , succeeding hans berger .
hsh nordbank is currently emerging from a financially rocky period brought on by the global financial crisis .
hamburg and schleswig-holstein were forced to provide the bank with 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.18 billion -rrb- in capital and 10 billion euros in guarantees .
the bank also received around 17 billion euros in guarantees from the federal government 's soffin bank rescue fund .

bush recalls in his book " decision points , " released tuesday in the us , that schroeder 's reversal on supporting the iraq war in a bid to win re-election in 2004 caused their relationship to sour .
bush says schroeder had privately assured him he backed his policy on iraq .
schroeder , along with the then french and russian presidents jacques chirac and vladimir putin , led international opposition to us diplomatic efforts to win support for invading iraq .
the war in iraq was and remains deeply unpopular in germany .
" as someone who valued personal diplomacy , i put a high premium on trust , " bush wrote .
" once that trust was violated , it was hard to have a constructive relationship again . "
schroeder rejects accusation schroeder disputed bush 's version , saying in a statement that he had only promised support if it was shown that saddam hussein 's regime played a role in the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , which was not the case .
" the bush administration 's reasons for the iraq war were based , as we know today , on lies , " schroeder said .
bush also seized upon comments made in 2002 by a german official who compared the us president to adolf hitler .
" i was shocked and furious , " bush writes of the alleged remarks by the then-german justice minister , herta daeubler-gmelin .
" it was hard to think of anything more insulting than being compared to hitler by a german official . "
the minister had to resign .

however in this part of the city , tourist buses line the streets - and it 's all because this is the location of oskar schindler 's factory .
the american film director steven spielberg made the factory famous in 1993 when he filmed parts of his oscar-winning film " schindler 's list " at the factory .
the story follows schindler as he tries to save his jewish workforce from nazi persecution and the concentration camps .
until recently , people had to peer through the locked gates to get a look at the factory .
but as of this summer , the building is now open to all visitors .
the krakow authorities have converted the factory into a museum , which is currently housing an exhibition called " krakow : occupation 1939-1945 , " examining life during nazi rule .

schindler 's place in history oskar schindler lived from 1908 to 1974 , and was the son of an industrialist .
in 1939 , after the occupation of poland by nazi germany , schindler acquired an enamel factory which had previously been in jewish hands .
the factory produced tin ware and later shells and detonators for the war effort .
schindler directly benefitted from the so-called ' ayranization ' of jewish factories and businesses , and as the war progressed he made a fortune on the black market .
despite his nazi membership , schindler became increasingly concerned about the cruel fate of his jewish workforce .
he added 1,200 workers to his famous list , labeling them ' essential ' to the war effort .
by doing so , he saved them from certain death at a nazi concentration camp .
after the war , schindler 's enamel factory became state-owned and was converted for use by a telecommunications company .
in 2002 it was abandoned , only to be bought by the city council three years later .
" the council decided to turn it into a museum , " said bednarek .
with the help of eu funding , the building was renovated .

" first of all we see the history before the war , so we can understand what happened during the war , " explained bendarek .
then the exhibits chart the outbreak of war , as german soldiers marched through poland on september 6 , 1939 .
there 's even a reconstruction of the jewish ghetto .
with the help of touch-screen displays , life-size murals and multimedia exhibits , the history of the period is brought to life .
the curators hope these types of techniques will help appeal to younger visitors .
" with this technology we can reach young people , " said grzegorz jezowski , who helped put together the exhibition .
" it makes it more attractive for them . "
a memorial to oskar schindler schindler himself only features quite briefly in the exhibition .
his story is told through photos , original documents and furniture from the factory .
in the middle of one room is a giant transparent cube , filled with tin pots , bowls and plates that were produced in schindler 's factory .
the instillation is meant to represent the history of the entrepreneur and his workers .
in the center hang the names of around 1,200 jewish workers whose lives were saved by schindler .

there 's even a reconstruction of the jewish ghetto .
with the help of touch-screen displays , life-size murals and multimedia exhibits , the history of the period is brought to life .
the curators hope these types of techniques will help appeal to younger visitors .
" with this technology we can reach young people , " said grzegorz jezowski , who helped put together the exhibition .
" it makes it more attractive for them . "
a memorial to oskar schindler schindler himself only features quite briefly in the exhibition .
his story is told through photos , original documents and furniture from the factory .
in the middle of one room is a giant transparent cube , filled with tin pots , bowls and plates that were produced in schindler 's factory .
the instillation is meant to represent the history of the entrepreneur and his workers .
in the center hang the names of around 1,200 jewish workers whose lives were saved by schindler .

bush recalls in his book " decision points , " released tuesday in the us , that schroeder 's reversal on supporting the iraq war in a bid to win re-election in 2004 caused their relationship to sour .
bush says schroeder had privately assured him he backed his policy on iraq .
schroeder , along with the then french and russian presidents jacques chirac and vladimir putin , led international opposition to us diplomatic efforts to win support for invading iraq .
the war in iraq was and remains deeply unpopular in germany .
" as someone who valued personal diplomacy , i put a high premium on trust , " bush wrote .
" once that trust was violated , it was hard to have a constructive relationship again . "
schroeder rejects accusation schroeder disputed bush 's version , saying in a statement that he had only promised support if it was shown that saddam hussein 's regime played a role in the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , which was not the case .
" the bush administration 's reasons for the iraq war were based , as we know today , on lies , " schroeder said .
bush also seized upon comments made in 2002 by a german official who compared the us president to adolf hitler .
" i was shocked and furious , " bush writes of the alleged remarks by the then-german justice minister , herta daeubler-gmelin .
" it was hard to think of anything more insulting than being compared to hitler by a german official . "
the minister had to resign .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 09.11.2010 eu criticizes turkey in annual report on membership hopefuls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's accession talks with the eu are floundering the eu has called on turkey to open up trade with cyprus , to better promote gender equality and human rights , and to toe the line on foreign policy issues in a lukewarm appraisal of ankara 's path towards eu membership . the european union announced on tuesday that only one of seven candidates for membership in the bloc is close to achieving its goal .
" the negotiations with croatia are now in their final phase , " the european commission said in its annual report on the progress of would-be eu members .
the commission pointed to widespread corruption and organized crime problems in other western balkan applicant countries as the biggest hurdle to their joining the bloc in the short term , although it did announce that montenegro was ready for full candidate status , saying the country 's democracy " is largely in line with european principles and standards . "
montenegro 's application has already been recognized by the eu , and with the commission 's approval , member states will now debate whether to grant the country candidate status and begin the process of negotiating membership .
croatia , iceland , turkey and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia are the four candidates that have already reached this final phase of the accession process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks voted for constitutional changes meant to appease brussels in a september referendum turkey began its official negotiations five years ago , but the eu acknowledged in its report that the process has hit rather rocky ground .
" negotiations advanced , albeit rather slowly , " the commission said of accession talks with ankara .
several stumbling blocks despite praising constitutional reforms designed to fight corruption , wrest some political power away from the military , and improve the protection of human rights as " a step in the right direction , " the commission said that turkey was still lagging behind in areas like press freedom , freedom of expression and religion , the rights of women and trade unions , and the integration of the kurdish minority in the country .
" the pace of reform in turkey dictates the pace of the accession process , " german foreign minister guido westerwelle said in berlin , shortly after the report was released .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the division of cyprus has soured turkish relations with eu members greece and cyprus the european commission also called on turkey to open trade ties with cyprus and redouble diplomatic efforts with the country , describing the need for progress in this area as " urgent . "
eu member state cyprus and turkey are locked in a territorial dispute over the northern part of the island , which has been occupied by turkish forces since 1974 .
reunification talks have stalled , and turkey says it will not open trade ties with cyprus until the problem is resolved .
and while cyprus tries to slow turkey 's accession into the eu , turkey is using its membership of nato to hamper cyprus ' bid to join that alliance .
another problem facing turkey 's membership bid that did not get highlighted in the eu commission 's annual report is the sheer size of the country .
a 2009 census put turkey 's population at 72 million , which would make it the second most populous member of the bloc .
" that means turkey would be represented in the european parliament with a number of mps to reflect its size , and the size of its population would also mean a lot of weight in decisions in the council of ministers , " the head of the eu program at the german council on foreign relations , almut moeller , told deutsche welle .
moeller said that eu insiders often talk about the influence turkey would wield in the bloc , and the affect it would have on the larger countries and their power structure .
" this is a sensitively calibrated order that has been around for a while now , and in the past we have only seen smaller and medium-sized countries entering the bloc .
they have relatively little impact on the big players , but imagine what a country this size would mean for the old order , for the amount of power currently shared between france and germany in the eu , for instance . "
gul : ' strategic imperative ' to let turkey in five years ago , there was an outpouring of pro-european sentiment and euphoria in turkey when the country began the final phase of the eu accession process .
but the mood seems to be souring as other applicants make much smoother process towards membership in the bloc .
on monday , brussels announced plans to grant visa-free travel within the eu 's open-border schengen zone to people from albania and bosnia , and the turkish newspaper haber tuerk responded by proclaiming on tuesday 's front page : " everyone 's allowed into the eu , except us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president gul thinks the eu is short-sighted not to welcome turkey citizens from every balkan country except kosovo , which some eu members consider a part of serbia , are now free to travel within the eu 's open-border area , while turks have to seek special visas .
" the eu will not be weaker , but stronger both politically and economically with turkey 's membership , " turkish president abdullah gul said in a speech in london on monday .
" given the fact that the international balance of power tends to shift towards the east and asia , it is , indeed , a strategic imperative for the eu to have turkey as a member . "
gul , speaking to the chatham house think-tank after receiving the organization 's annual prize for statesmanship , said it was " sad to observe " that some european leaders did not recognize the role turkey could play within the eu .
" this short-sighted vision is the major impediment before the idea of the eu as a global actor , capable of assuming greater responsibilities on political and security issues , complementing its economic clout , " the turkish president said .
in his speech , gul also announced that neighboring iran had asked turkey to host another round of talks with un security council members and germany on tehran 's nuclear program , alluding to the diplomatic role his country might play for the eu .
however , turkey 's international activities were also singled out by the eu for veiled criticism on tuesday , after the country defied the us and eu to vote against tougher un sanctions for iran earlier this year .
" turkey 's foreign policy has become more active in its wider neighborhood , " the commission 's report said .
" this is an asset for the european union , provided it is developed as a complement to turkey 's accession process and in coordination with the eu . "

after months of digging , their probe suggests governments and regulators have willingly turned a blind eye to the problem . it is no secret that the past decade has seen sushi gain popularity in the western world , but the methods for feeding this appetite have been kept fairly well hidden .
until now .
in a report detailing the findings of its seven-month long probe into the business of bluefin tuna fishing , the international consortium of investigative journalists -lrb- icij -rrb- has unveiled a culture of over-exploitation , tacitly approved by government authorities .
the report details systematic over-fishing , falsely reported catch volumes , ignored bans of spotter planes to track down schools of tuna and illegal sales of national quotas from one vessel to another .
all told , the investigation paints a bleak picture in which thousands of tons of fish were illegally hauled between 1998 and 2007 - as many as one in every three bluefin tuna may have been caught illegally during this period .
the report also unveils a complex network of fishing fleets , farms , ministries and distributors from countries such as france , spain , italy , turkey and japan involved in the creation of a flourishing black market trade .
the world wide fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- said the inquiry had confirmed its repeated warnings of widespread illegalities .
" no consumer , no business , no government can be sure they are dealing with responsibly caught and traded bluefin tuna , " sergi tudela , head of fisheries at wwf mediterranean said in a statement .
" the whole chain is tarnished . "
parallels to the drug trade bildunterschrift : quotas for tuna are being flouted and authorities are looking away , investigators say .
eastern atlantic bluefin tuna are a catch in more than one sense of the word .
one large tuna , which can be three meters long and weigh more than 500 kilos , can fetch as much as 71,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- on the japanese market , the source of most of the world 's demand for tuna .
as marine biologist , daniel pauly told the icij , the promise of a slice of such wealth is too enticing for many to resist .
" fisheries are one of the most criminalized sectors in the world , " pauly said .
" this generates so much money that it 's like drugs . "
the report said the black market trade in tuna was worth at least $ 4 billion -lrb- 2.9 billion euros -rrb- between 1998 and 2007 .
while mostly taking aim at suppliers and the governments that turned a blind eye to their exporters ' behaviour , the report also reveals how japanese dealers evaded tuna quotas by importing tuna as another species of fish , only to re-label them as tuna at market . as the demand for the fish has grown , the industry has evolved in an increasingly detrimental way .
tuna farms have sprung up throughout the mediterranean , fishermen regularly plunder stocks in spawning areas and more boats – often subsidised at taxpayers ' expense – have been put to sea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the demand for tuna stems from japan , though fishing occurs internationally fish stocks dwindling the report singles out the burgeoning practice of purse-seining - in which entire schools of fish are encircled by vast nets and dragged to farms to be harvested .
as a consequence , numbers of bluefin tuna , which play a crucial role at the top of the marine food chain , have plummeted by almost three quarters over the past four decades , while the size of the average captured bluefin tuna has almost halved .
" if we want to continue being able to fish bluefin tuna at all , we need to backtrack 20 years , " gemma parkes , a spokeswoman for wwf mediterranean , told deutsche welle .
the extent of the problem first surfaced in 2007 when france was revealed to have caught almost twice the quota it is allowed under the international commission for the conservation of the atlantic tunas -lrb- iccat -rrb- – the tuna fishing industry 's watchdog .
the fishermen involved in the case were charged , and the regulatory body responded by introducing a new system , known as the bluefin tuna catch document -lrb- bcd -rrb- , to help monitor catch sizes .
but the team of investigative reporters at the icij says this system is full of so many holes that the data it gathers is practically useless .
moreover the wwf says it has seen evidence to prove that the bluefin industry still suffers from plenty of illegal activity bildunterschrift : a smaller specimen just minutes away from becoming sushi tougher measures this week , the iccat commission is meeting in paris to consider the current situation and find solutions .
exactly what shape these could take is far from clear , but parkes says the answers are simple .
" we are pushing for quotas to be cut from 13,500 to between zero and 6,000 tons , for a phasing out of purse-seining and the establishment of ' no fishing zones ' in spawning areas . "
to lend weight to its demands , the wwf has gathered the support of businesses and restaurants that have agreed to remove bluefin tuna from their shelves and menus until the stocks have had a chance to replenish .
exactly when that might be , nobody can tell , but parkes insists that the wwf 's suggestions would at the very least give the coveted species a much-needed break .
" there has been a depressingly widespread lack of control and respect for rules , " parkes said .
" but these rules would be so clear cut that they would be easy to police . "

the fishermen involved in the case were charged , and the regulatory body responded by introducing a new system , known as the bluefin tuna catch document -lrb- bcd -rrb- , to help monitor catch sizes .
but the team of investigative reporters at the icij says this system is full of so many holes that the data it gathers is practically useless .
moreover the wwf says it has seen evidence to prove that the bluefin industry still suffers from plenty of illegal activity bildunterschrift : a smaller specimen just minutes away from becoming sushi tougher measures this week , the iccat commission is meeting in paris to consider the current situation and find solutions .
exactly what shape these could take is far from clear , but parkes says the answers are simple .
" we are pushing for quotas to be cut from 13,500 to between zero and 6,000 tons , for a phasing out of purse-seining and the establishment of ' no fishing zones ' in spawning areas . "
to lend weight to its demands , the wwf has gathered the support of businesses and restaurants that have agreed to remove bluefin tuna from their shelves and menus until the stocks have had a chance to replenish .
exactly when that might be , nobody can tell , but parkes insists that the wwf 's suggestions would at the very least give the coveted species a much-needed break .
" there has been a depressingly widespread lack of control and respect for rules , " parkes said .
" but these rules would be so clear cut that they would be easy to police . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 09.11.2010 werder bremen have gone from heavyweights to sparring partners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conceding goals has been an all too regular occurence for werder this year for years , bremen have been a model of consistency , stability and harmony .
but with this season already a likely write-off , even hardcore fans are calling for some major changes on the river weser . if there was any small consolation for bremen after their 6-0 thrashing by stuttgart on sunday , it was that the scoreline could have been worse .
after all , goalkeeper tim wiese had saved a penalty in the 60th minute .
but wiese remained disconsolate .
" the way we played here was embarrassing , " the keeper told reporters after the match .
" i 'm ashamed of us , and every one else should be ashamed as well . "
it was werder 's second straight league loss after an unexpected home to defeat to nuremberg in round 10 .
coach thomas schaaf took refuge in gallows humor .
" we were a good sparring partner , " schaaf told the press .
" that 's an opponent you invite to your training camp , when you want to stay fit .
it was like in practice , and that 's not enough for a competitive match . "
werder are currently eleventh in the table , 15 points behind leaders dortmund .
the team has been in similar positions before , but rarely have things looked so black for the men in green .
in 2008-9 , bremen stumbled to tenth place in the bundesliga but salvaged their season by reaching the final of the europa league and winning the german cup .
this year , they are already out of the cup and adrift at the bottom of their champions league group .
werder have qualified for international competition every year since 2004 and have missed the champions league only once , making them germany 's second most successful team .
nonetheless , the problems they are currently encountering have been in the making for some time .
achilles ' heel bildunterschrift : silvestre is one of the main problems in a terrible defense werder have always conceded more goals than the other top german teams but have thrived because they also scored more .
that 's down to the style favored by schaaf , which features the defenders pushed relatively far upfield .
but after 11 matches this season , bremen have already conceded 27 goals .
by way of comparison , werder 's season average for the past six campaigns is 41.5 .
schaaf and company have sorely missed central defender naldo , who 's out indefinitely while recovering from an operation to combat necrosis of the knee .
neither sebastian proedl nor mikael silvestre has been an adequate replacement , and germany international per mertesacker has been unable to compensate .
werder 's goal production – 19 – is also down , which has something to do with the hole left behind by mesut oezil , who left this summer for real madrid .
aaron hunt , a converted striker , has not been able to fill the playmaker role , and new acquisition wesley has been forced to play in the back four .
as a relatively low-budget club by top european standards , bremen are used to losing star players .
schaaf and commercial manager klaus allofs have always shown a remarkable knack for finding replacements .
not this season , though , and that 's causing some major friction in the werder family .
fussing and feuding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaaf and allofs are no longer beyond criticism schaaf and allofs have been running things at werder since 1999 , a unique record of longevity in the hire- ‘ em-fire- ‘ em bundesliga , and harmony has been the rule in their eleven-year tenure .
but questionable personnel decisions and curious management reactions have created an atmosphere of conflict .
disappointed with the team 's early form , allofs took the strange step of freezing players ' wages earlier this season .
that created a climate of tension that may have emerged when striker marko arnautovic reportedly hurled an obscenity in allofs ' direction after being substituted out in bremen 's most recent champions league loss .
the serbian-austrian is known for his mercurial temperament , and many fans questioned the decision to acquire him this summer .
but that 's nothing compared to the outrage directed at the 33-year-old silvestre .
the frenchman was brought in despite coming off a horrible year with arsenal and is , according to the grades handed out by kicker magazine , by far and away the worst defender in the bundesliga .
he was roundly booed after the nuremberg match , an understandable reaction from disappointed ticket-holders .
but schaaf subsequently went on local radio accusing supporters of not being “ real fans . ”
and that has the werder faithful up in arms .
" werder bremen is suffering from the arrogance and vanity of schaaf and allofs , " wrote one enraged user on the fanszene-bremen internet forum .
" these gentlemen have lost touch after having so much success and being treated with kid gloves by the media .
criticism , including boos , is interpreted as an insult to their royal highnesses . "
a fellow supporter , writing on a different platform , concurred .
" here everyone blames a team that is playing badly , " the user opined on forum.werder.de.
" that 's one issue .
another one is that klaus allofs is n't capable of buying reasonable players and thomas schaaf has been unable to form them into a reasonable team . "
a couple of wins would probably be enough to silence the voices of dissent , and bremen get a chance to make amends on saturday when they host frankfurt – a team they 'd expect to beat most seasons .
but this season is anything but typical .
frankfurt are riding high in fourth place , while werder bremen are facing a potential relegation fight – and an ill-tempered debate about the future of the club .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 09.11.2010 werder bremen have gone from heavyweights to sparring partners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conceding goals has been an all too regular occurence for werder this year for years , bremen have been a model of consistency , stability and harmony .
but with this season already a likely write-off , even hardcore fans are calling for some major changes on the river weser . if there was any small consolation for bremen after their 6-0 thrashing by stuttgart on sunday , it was that the scoreline could have been worse .
after all , goalkeeper tim wiese had saved a penalty in the 60th minute .
but wiese remained disconsolate .
" the way we played here was embarrassing , " the keeper told reporters after the match .
" i 'm ashamed of us , and every one else should be ashamed as well . "
it was werder 's second straight league loss after an unexpected home to defeat to nuremberg in round 10 .
coach thomas schaaf took refuge in gallows humor .
" we were a good sparring partner , " schaaf told the press .
" that 's an opponent you invite to your training camp , when you want to stay fit .
it was like in practice , and that 's not enough for a competitive match . "
werder are currently eleventh in the table , 15 points behind leaders dortmund .
the team has been in similar positions before , but rarely have things looked so black for the men in green .
in 2008-9 , bremen stumbled to tenth place in the bundesliga but salvaged their season by reaching the final of the europa league and winning the german cup .
this year , they are already out of the cup and adrift at the bottom of their champions league group .
werder have qualified for international competition every year since 2004 and have missed the champions league only once , making them germany 's second most successful team .
nonetheless , the problems they are currently encountering have been in the making for some time .
achilles ' heel bildunterschrift : silvestre is one of the main problems in a terrible defense werder have always conceded more goals than the other top german teams but have thrived because they also scored more .
that 's down to the style favored by schaaf , which features the defenders pushed relatively far upfield .
but after 11 matches this season , bremen have already conceded 27 goals .
by way of comparison , werder 's season average for the past six campaigns is 41.5 .
schaaf and company have sorely missed central defender naldo , who 's out indefinitely while recovering from an operation to combat necrosis of the knee .
neither sebastian proedl nor mikael silvestre has been an adequate replacement , and germany international per mertesacker has been unable to compensate .
werder 's goal production – 19 – is also down , which has something to do with the hole left behind by mesut oezil , who left this summer for real madrid .
aaron hunt , a converted striker , has not been able to fill the playmaker role , and new acquisition wesley has been forced to play in the back four .
as a relatively low-budget club by top european standards , bremen are used to losing star players .
schaaf and commercial manager klaus allofs have always shown a remarkable knack for finding replacements .
not this season , though , and that 's causing some major friction in the werder family .
fussing and feuding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaaf and allofs are no longer beyond criticism schaaf and allofs have been running things at werder since 1999 , a unique record of longevity in the hire- ‘ em-fire- ‘ em bundesliga , and harmony has been the rule in their eleven-year tenure .
but questionable personnel decisions and curious management reactions have created an atmosphere of conflict .
disappointed with the team 's early form , allofs took the strange step of freezing players ' wages earlier this season .
that created a climate of tension that may have emerged when striker marko arnautovic reportedly hurled an obscenity in allofs ' direction after being substituted out in bremen 's most recent champions league loss .
the serbian-austrian is known for his mercurial temperament , and many fans questioned the decision to acquire him this summer .
but that 's nothing compared to the outrage directed at the 33-year-old silvestre .
the frenchman was brought in despite coming off a horrible year with arsenal and is , according to the grades handed out by kicker magazine , by far and away the worst defender in the bundesliga .
