red bull team mates sebastian vettel and mark webber crashed while fighting for the lead ; vettel retired , webber salvaged third place . mclaren 's pair of british world champions could scarcely believe their luck in istanbul , when an inter-team crash ahead of them left them with an easy one-two finish at the turkish grand prix .
red bull 's mark webber was leading at roughly two-thirds race distance , ahead of german team mate sebastian vettel , with the mclarens pressuring behind in third and fourth places .
then the red bull duo evidently forgot motor sport 's golden rule : never take out your team mate .
vettel tried an ambitious overtaking maneuver on webber 's red bull , and the pair collided .
the german retired immediately , while webber had to pit for repairs and finished up in third place .
" it 's stupid between team mates , but i should have been given the necessary space , " vettel lamented in the pit lane after retiring , blaming webber for the collision .
" it was a disaster , " webber said afterwards , although he did n't share vettel 's interpretation of the crash .
" it can happen .
he had a slight speed advantage , but he turned right into me and made contact and … well , that was it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel 's car was ruined in the crash , webber managed to limp home the crash was the latest in a string of problems that have stopped red bull , whose car still seems the class of the field , from converting their pace into results .
" all we ask for " after the crash , mclaren 's british world champions hamilton and button had their own wheel-to-wheel battle for the lead , but they managed to keep it fairly clean , with only minimal contact between the pair .
hamilton watched the red bull crash from his cockpit , saying it was " like an action movie in 3d .
" i do n't know what happened , " he said in the winner 's press conference , " but they collided and we got past them , and then we had a bit of a battle - a fair one , i must say - before the end . "
button , who succeeded hamilton as world champion in 2009 , also complemented his team mate for keeping the battle between them clean .
meanwhile , a disappointed red bull team boss christian horner also offered indirect praise to the mclaren duo , saying he wished his drivers had shown similar restraint under pressure .
" we saw lewis -lrb- hamilton -rrb- and jenson -lrb- button -rrb- racing each other and giving each other space .
that 's all we ask for , " he said .
schumacher 's best of the season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : normally strong , ferrari had a difficult day in the mid-field returning seven-time champion michael schumacher finished in fourth for mercedes , with his german team mate nico rosberg glued to his gearbox in fifth .
fourth position is the best result of 2010 for schumacher , who is still looking for his first podium finish since launching a comeback this season .
the two mercedes drivers managed to keep the hard-charging renault of robert kubica at bay throughout the race , but lacked the pace to challenge the leaders .
adrian sutil finished ninth for force india , behind the ferraris of felipe massa and fernando alonso , meaning that three of the six germans on the grid scored points in turkey .
in the race for the world championship , third place was enough to maintain mark webber 's lead in the standings , but the mclaren duo of button and hamilton are close behind .
vettel 's retirement means he drops to fifth in the standings , behind ferrari 's fernando alonso .
but vettel , webber , and red bull will all be wondering how large their leads over the competition might have been , had the first seven races of the season ran more smoothly .

they have promised severe budget cuts to trim the country 's growing deficit . what a difference a day makes .
for the past six months , the center-left social democrats - led by the abrasive jiri paroubek - had been riding high in the opinion polls , heading for what most surveys predicted would be a clear victory : 30 percent , maybe more .
on the actual day , though , it was rather different .
and on sunday , czechs woke to the prospect of having the strongest government in years after one of the biggest political shake-ups since czechoslovakia split in 1993 .
pyrrhic victory there were gasps of surprise at the party 's lidovy dum headquarters on saturday when czech television released exit polls showing the social democrats tied in first place with the civic democrats , both at 20 percent .
but surprise turned to despair as the results came in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democratic party chairman jiri paroubek , resigned after the vote results came in in the end , paroubek 's party scored 22 percent - still the largest party , but a pyrrhic victory if ever there was one .
paroubek resigned almost immediately , conceding it was clear the country was heading for a center-right coalition .
plans to create a minority social democrat adminstration propped up by the communist party lay in tatters .
voters , it appears , had rejected his plans to tax the rich and preserve generous social benefits .
" it seems that people have chosen the direction the country should go in and it is a different direction than the one the social democrats were offering , ” paroubek told reporters , his new wife standing by his side .
czech media reported that waiters at the lidovy dum later circulated with trays of champagne bought to celebrate victory .
no one would touch them .
avoiding greek-style crisis across town , however , the champagne corks were popping at the headquarters of two brand new parliamentary parties : top09 , which was formed out of disgruntled civic democrat and christian democrat members and led by the aristocrat karel schwarzenberg ; and public affairs , a rather mysterious centrist party promoting direct democracy and promising to wage war on corruption .

westermann fractured his left foot in saturday evening 's friendly match against hungary . german soccer coach joachim loew must be wondering if he 'll have any healthy players left by the time the world cup begins in south africa next month .
central defender heiko westermann is the latest first-team player to be ruled out of the competition , having fractured his left foot in saturday 's 3-0 friendly win against hungary in budapest .
" heiko would have played a very important role at the world cup for our team .
that is because of his multi-faceted play .
in training he was in superb physical condition , " loew said .
the 27-year-old central defender , who has 19 caps , played a crucial role in schalke 's failed push for the bundesliga title this season , cementing himself as a regular in the national team in the process .
" naturally i am devastated because it was my big goal to take part in the world cup , " said westermann .
" i felt fully fit but now the only thing left for me to do is to wish the team all the best at the tournament . "
bildunterschrift : torn ankle ligaments have already sidelined captain michael ballack five down , 23 required westermann is the fifth german player to be ruled out of the world cup with injury in a matter of weeks .
captain michael ballack is out with an ankle ligament injury , with fellow midfielders christian traesch and simon rolfes also unable to represent their country .
first choice goalkeeper rene adler 's broken ribs mean that westermann 's schalke team mate , manuel neuer , will wear the number one shirt in south africa .
both adler and neuer are relatively new to international soccer , after the tragic suicide of former first choice goalie robert enke late last year .

be proud . "
hundreds of foreign residents in russia are victims of violent right-wing extremism every year .
authorities are taking the problem seriously , but xenophobic attitudes are widespread in russian society . on an outdoor court at the university of vladivostok , a group of chinese exchange students are dribbling and shooting hoops in their own corner around a single net , separate from their russian counterparts .
here on the russian pacific coast , these exchange students are only 60 kilometers away from their home country , and yet russia does not feel like home to them .
" they 're afraid for their safety , " one russian student told deutsche welle .
" that 's why they spend entire days here and at the student residences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students usually only leave their dorms in vladivostok in groups when these exchange students do venture into town beyond the safe bubble of their dormitory , lecture halls and the basketball courts , then they only go in groups .
always on guard right-wing extremists in vladivostok have become more active in recent years , stoked by local mistrust of russia 's up-and-coming neighbor china as well as by worries about a weak economy and more foreigners coming into the country .
one chinese student in vladivostok told deutsche welle about her boyfriend 's encounter with a gang of thugs .
" about ten guys broke his nose , " she said .
" just like that , without saying anything . "
the young man ran away from his attackers , but according to his girlfriend , he was n't safe again until he was back at the university .
according to the sova center in moscow , an organization that researches racism and xenophobia , last year in russia around 70 people were killed in racially motivated attacks , while more than 300 were injured .
the center says that moscow and st. petersburg are especially dangerous places for central asians and people from the caucasus .
however , the situation has improved and those numbers have fallen by a third since 2008 .
police and judges are now taking the matter more seriously , according to the center 's director , alexander verkhovsky .
he says special police forces have been established to tackle right-wing extremism and that they have made several arrests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander verkhovsky is director of the anti-racist sova center in moscow a shock for the kremlin however , it took russian authorities some time to recognize the danger of right-wing radicals .
for years , critics of the kremlin felt that the government was more accommodating to extremist nationalists than it was to the country 's democratic opposition .
a turning point came in 2006 when extremists led a deadly pogrom against caucasian-owned businesses and restaurants in the small city of kondopoga , in russia 's northwest karelia region .
according to verkhovsky , it was only when the kremlin realized that it had lost control over kondopoga for a day that the kremlin started taking extremist nationalists seriously .
" it greatly alarmed the government , " said verkhovsky , who said the kremlin saw the event as " a political threat . "
still waters run deep verkhovsky told deutsche welle that the kremlin 's fight against racism has deeper roots than a push to secure power .
according to him , the nation 's authoritarian political climate has made open discussion of the topic taboo .
based on the silence of politicians , he said , many extremists have felt that russian society was on their side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china looms on vladivostok 's horizon " those who are out killing people feel they are pioneering a people 's movement , " he said .
in fact , extremist ideas are deeply anchored in the mindset of russian society .
according to some surveys , 55 percent of russians want to see foreign residents – especially those from central asia or the caucasus – stripped of their rights or even deported , and this , despite the fact that the russian economy depends on the cheap labor of people from these countries .
at the basketball court in vladivostok where chinese exchange students take refuge , many native students are certain that pacific russia 's economic prosperity depends on china .

red bull team mates sebastian vettel and mark webber crashed while fighting for the lead ; vettel retired , webber salvaged third place . mclaren 's pair of british world champions could scarcely believe their luck in istanbul , when an inter-team crash ahead of them left them with an easy one-two finish at the turkish grand prix .
red bull 's mark webber was leading at roughly two-thirds race distance , ahead of german team mate sebastian vettel , with the mclarens pressuring behind in third and fourth places .
then the red bull duo evidently forgot motor sport 's golden rule : never take out your team mate .
vettel tried an ambitious overtaking maneuver on webber 's red bull , and the pair collided .
the german retired immediately , while webber had to pit for repairs and finished up in third place .
" it 's stupid between team mates , but i should have been given the necessary space , " vettel lamented in the pit lane after retiring , blaming webber for the collision .
" it was a disaster , " webber said afterwards , although he did n't share vettel 's interpretation of the crash .
" it can happen .
he had a slight speed advantage , but he turned right into me and made contact and … well , that was it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel 's car was ruined in the crash , webber managed to limp home the crash was the latest in a string of problems that have stopped red bull , whose car still seems the class of the field , from converting their pace into results .
" all we ask for " after the crash , mclaren 's british world champions hamilton and button had their own wheel-to-wheel battle for the lead , but they managed to keep it fairly clean , with only minimal contact between the pair .
hamilton watched the red bull crash from his cockpit , saying it was " like an action movie in 3d .
" i do n't know what happened , " he said in the winner 's press conference , " but they collided and we got past them , and then we had a bit of a battle - a fair one , i must say - before the end . "
button , who succeeded hamilton as world champion in 2009 , also complemented his team mate for keeping the battle between them clean .
meanwhile , a disappointed red bull team boss christian horner also offered indirect praise to the mclaren duo , saying he wished his drivers had shown similar restraint under pressure .
" we saw lewis -lrb- hamilton -rrb- and jenson -lrb- button -rrb- racing each other and giving each other space .
that 's all we ask for , " he said .
schumacher 's best of the season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : normally strong , ferrari had a difficult day in the mid-field returning seven-time champion michael schumacher finished in fourth for mercedes , with his german team mate nico rosberg glued to his gearbox in fifth .
fourth position is the best result of 2010 for schumacher , who is still looking for his first podium finish since launching a comeback this season .
the two mercedes drivers managed to keep the hard-charging renault of robert kubica at bay throughout the race , but lacked the pace to challenge the leaders .
adrian sutil finished ninth for force india , behind the ferraris of felipe massa and fernando alonso , meaning that three of the six germans on the grid scored points in turkey .
in the race for the world championship , third place was enough to maintain mark webber 's lead in the standings , but the mclaren duo of button and hamilton are close behind .
vettel 's retirement means he drops to fifth in the standings , behind ferrari 's fernando alonso .
but vettel , webber , and red bull will all be wondering how large their leads over the competition might have been , had the first seven races of the season ran more smoothly .

hague said relations with washington would be " solid but not slavish " and pointedly omitted any reference to the phrase " special relationship " which has been a staple in statements referring to ties between the uk and the united states .
while attempting to distance britain from the image of being the " poodle " of successive us governments , hague 's " vision of a new , distinctive british foreign policy " did not suggest that europe would be the main beneficiary of the new government 's change of direction on the world stage .
instead of turning its attention to the power base of european politics across the water , hague said britain would develop its own identity and strategic role , following a new foreign-policy agenda which would differ in its " reach and ambition " from that pursued by the previous labour governments .
as well as confirming that britain would not join the euro-zone over the next five years of the new parliament , hague - a well-known eurosceptic - rejected ideas of further and deeper political union with brussels and instead announced the government 's desire for " freeing up the single market to boost economic growth . "
hague says britain will stay out eu 's financial structures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hague said that britain would stay out of eu financial affairs britain , hague said , would not be contributing to the financial assistance offered to the beleaguered economies of the euro-zone in the foreseeable future as it would be " difficult at a time of economic constraint . "
however , while distancing britain from the eu , hague said that his government would like the eu to " use its collective weight more effectively on the world stage . "
" in terms of joining the euro zone and keeping out of the bailout operations , this shows continuity with labour 's views on these topics , " thomas klau , head of the paris office of the european council for foreign relations and an eu expert , told deutsche welle .
" what cameron and hague have shown so far in europe , and indeed in washington , is that continuity is set to prevail over radical change . "
" earlier fears that a tory or tory-liberal coalition government would usher in an era of clashes with the eu so far hav n't materialised , " he added .
" this is largely down to the liberals ' inclusion in the coalition and the tories making it clear they wo n't be stepping into margaret thatcher 's shoes and waving her handbag about .
they may be talking tough on the eu but it does n't represent a huge shift away from polices labour adopted under tony blair . "
" in terms of questioning the eu 's role in the world , there was some concern that the tories would set up in opposition to the lisbon treaty and try to undermine the eu 's regulations governing its operations abroad , " klau said .
" there were even fears that they would be down right hostile to this but again , there has been little indication as yet that this will be the case .
hague has said that the eu should have a crucial role in certain areas , especially dealing with non-eu members , specifically russia .
so this policy announcement did n't really include anything worrying or shocking for the eu . "
with the eu kept at arms length and the cosiness of former relations with the us reduced to a firm handshake , the new british foreign policy agenda focuses heavily on london 's ambition to make its influence felt on the world stage . new emphasis on taking lead on global issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan and the middle east are priorities for britain rejecting ideas that britain was in strategic and influential decline , hague targeted increased engagement and cooperation with the emerging economies in the world and deepening of relations with countries in the gulf and the middle east , along with brazil , japan , india and china .
foreign engagement would " run through the veins of the entire administration , " hague said , announcing the creation of a newly-established national security council which would ensure that the " new philosophy will be translated into action . "
hague highlighted britain 's continued role in afghanistan , where the uk has 9,500 troops deployed , and relations with pakistan as areas of prime importance .
he added that britain would continue to back a two-state solution in the middle east and pursue a dual approach of " engagement and sanctions " in regard to iran , while backing current moves in the united nations to tighten punitive measures .
prime minister david cameron recently called on the international community to " ratchet up " pressure on tehran through sanctions in a bid to prevent the islamic republic pursuing what the west suspects is a nuclear weapons program .
britain stands more chance of success with eu , say experts " britain 's global policy is going to be shaped by the events which happen during the lifespan of this coalition , " klau said .
" will we see a clear break from labour policies on climate change , financial regulation , iran and the middle east ?
not necessarily .
the middle east in particular was a high priority for blair and this will be the same for cameron . "
" whether this ambitious britain can make a meaningful contribution with global resonance outside of the eu is another matter , " he added .
" all major eu powers must recognise that there 's not much governments can do when they act alone .
the chances of success are low when their efforts are not within the framework of a joint eu initiative .
the best they can hope for is a photo opportunity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say britain can achieve more with the eu than without almut moeller , head of the alfred von oppenheim centre for european policy studies at the german council on foreign relations , agrees that it is impossible for any state to work individually with success on global issues without being part of a framework .
but she believes that britain could actually benefit from being more involved with the eu at this time , not less .
" this is actually a really good opportunity for britain to become more engaged in european policies , " moeller told deutsche welle .
" there is a will to cooperate and a consensus that it makes sense to work together so if the british want pursue certain goals and shape european policies , especially in security and defence issues , then this is the right time .
there are a number of security and defence issues within the lisbon treaty which have stalled and there are no discussions being taken on these .
britain could give these and other policies which are lacking leadership the impetus they need . "

hague said relations with washington would be " solid but not slavish " and pointedly omitted any reference to the phrase " special relationship " which has been a staple in statements referring to ties between the uk and the united states .
while attempting to distance britain from the image of being the " poodle " of successive us governments , hague 's " vision of a new , distinctive british foreign policy " did not suggest that europe would be the main beneficiary of the new government 's change of direction on the world stage .
instead of turning its attention to the power base of european politics across the water , hague said britain would develop its own identity and strategic role , following a new foreign-policy agenda which would differ in its " reach and ambition " from that pursued by the previous labour governments .
as well as confirming that britain would not join the euro-zone over the next five years of the new parliament , hague - a well-known eurosceptic - rejected ideas of further and deeper political union with brussels and instead announced the government 's desire for " freeing up the single market to boost economic growth . "
hague says britain will stay out eu 's financial structures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hague said that britain would stay out of eu financial affairs britain , hague said , would not be contributing to the financial assistance offered to the beleaguered economies of the euro-zone in the foreseeable future as it would be " difficult at a time of economic constraint . "
however , while distancing britain from the eu , hague said that his government would like the eu to " use its collective weight more effectively on the world stage . "
" in terms of joining the euro zone and keeping out of the bailout operations , this shows continuity with labour 's views on these topics , " thomas klau , head of the paris office of the european council for foreign relations and an eu expert , told deutsche welle .
" what cameron and hague have shown so far in europe , and indeed in washington , is that continuity is set to prevail over radical change . "
" earlier fears that a tory or tory-liberal coalition government would usher in an era of clashes with the eu so far hav n't materialised , " he added .
" this is largely down to the liberals ' inclusion in the coalition and the tories making it clear they wo n't be stepping into margaret thatcher 's shoes and waving her handbag about .
they may be talking tough on the eu but it does n't represent a huge shift away from polices labour adopted under tony blair . "
" in terms of questioning the eu 's role in the world , there was some concern that the tories would set up in opposition to the lisbon treaty and try to undermine the eu 's regulations governing its operations abroad , " klau said .
" there were even fears that they would be down right hostile to this but again , there has been little indication as yet that this will be the case .
hague has said that the eu should have a crucial role in certain areas , especially dealing with non-eu members , specifically russia .
so this policy announcement did n't really include anything worrying or shocking for the eu . "
with the eu kept at arms length and the cosiness of former relations with the us reduced to a firm handshake , the new british foreign policy agenda focuses heavily on london 's ambition to make its influence felt on the world stage . new emphasis on taking lead on global issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan and the middle east are priorities for britain rejecting ideas that britain was in strategic and influential decline , hague targeted increased engagement and cooperation with the emerging economies in the world and deepening of relations with countries in the gulf and the middle east , along with brazil , japan , india and china .
foreign engagement would " run through the veins of the entire administration , " hague said , announcing the creation of a newly-established national security council which would ensure that the " new philosophy will be translated into action . "
hague highlighted britain 's continued role in afghanistan , where the uk has 9,500 troops deployed , and relations with pakistan as areas of prime importance .
he added that britain would continue to back a two-state solution in the middle east and pursue a dual approach of " engagement and sanctions " in regard to iran , while backing current moves in the united nations to tighten punitive measures .
prime minister david cameron recently called on the international community to " ratchet up " pressure on tehran through sanctions in a bid to prevent the islamic republic pursuing what the west suspects is a nuclear weapons program .
britain stands more chance of success with eu , say experts " britain 's global policy is going to be shaped by the events which happen during the lifespan of this coalition , " klau said .
" will we see a clear break from labour policies on climate change , financial regulation , iran and the middle east ?
not necessarily .
the middle east in particular was a high priority for blair and this will be the same for cameron . "
" whether this ambitious britain can make a meaningful contribution with global resonance outside of the eu is another matter , " he added .
" all major eu powers must recognise that there 's not much governments can do when they act alone .
the chances of success are low when their efforts are not within the framework of a joint eu initiative .
the best they can hope for is a photo opportunity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say britain can achieve more with the eu than without almut moeller , head of the alfred von oppenheim centre for european policy studies at the german council on foreign relations , agrees that it is impossible for any state to work individually with success on global issues without being part of a framework .
but she believes that britain could actually benefit from being more involved with the eu at this time , not less .
" this is actually a really good opportunity for britain to become more engaged in european policies , " moeller told deutsche welle .
" there is a will to cooperate and a consensus that it makes sense to work together so if the british want pursue certain goals and shape european policies , especially in security and defence issues , then this is the right time .
there are a number of security and defence issues within the lisbon treaty which have stalled and there are no discussions being taken on these .
britain could give these and other policies which are lacking leadership the impetus they need . "

hundreds of foreign residents in russia are victims of violent right-wing extremism every year .
authorities are taking the problem seriously , but xenophobic attitudes are widespread in russian society . on an outdoor court at the university of vladivostok , a group of chinese exchange students are dribbling and shooting hoops in their own corner around a single net , separate from their russian counterparts .
here on the russian pacific coast , these exchange students are only 60 kilometers away from their home country , and yet russia does not feel like home to them .
" they 're afraid for their safety , " one russian student told deutsche welle .
" that 's why they spend entire days here and at the student residences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students usually only leave their dorms in vladivostok in groups when these exchange students do venture into town beyond the safe bubble of their dormitory , lecture halls and the basketball courts , then they only go in groups .
always on guard right-wing extremists in vladivostok have become more active in recent years , stoked by local mistrust of russia 's up-and-coming neighbor china as well as by worries about a weak economy and more foreigners coming into the country .
one chinese student in vladivostok told deutsche welle about her boyfriend 's encounter with a gang of thugs .
" about ten guys broke his nose , " she said .
" just like that , without saying anything . "
the young man ran away from his attackers , but according to his girlfriend , he was n't safe again until he was back at the university .
according to the sova center in moscow , an organization that researches racism and xenophobia , last year in russia around 70 people were killed in racially motivated attacks , while more than 300 were injured .
the center says that moscow and st. petersburg are especially dangerous places for central asians and people from the caucasus .
however , the situation has improved and those numbers have fallen by a third since 2008 .
police and judges are now taking the matter more seriously , according to the center 's director , alexander verkhovsky .
he says special police forces have been established to tackle right-wing extremism and that they have made several arrests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander verkhovsky is director of the anti-racist sova center in moscow a shock for the kremlin however , it took russian authorities some time to recognize the danger of right-wing radicals .
for years , critics of the kremlin felt that the government was more accommodating to extremist nationalists than it was to the country 's democratic opposition .
a turning point came in 2006 when extremists led a deadly pogrom against caucasian-owned businesses and restaurants in the small city of kondopoga , in russia 's northwest karelia region .
according to verkhovsky , it was only when the kremlin realized that it had lost control over kondopoga for a day that the kremlin started taking extremist nationalists seriously .
" it greatly alarmed the government , " said verkhovsky , who said the kremlin saw the event as " a political threat . "
still waters run deep verkhovsky told deutsche welle that the kremlin 's fight against racism has deeper roots than a push to secure power .
according to him , the nation 's authoritarian political climate has made open discussion of the topic taboo .

hundreds of foreign residents in russia are victims of violent right-wing extremism every year .
authorities are taking the problem seriously , but xenophobic attitudes are widespread in russian society . on an outdoor court at the university of vladivostok , a group of chinese exchange students are dribbling and shooting hoops in their own corner around a single net , separate from their russian counterparts .
here on the russian pacific coast , these exchange students are only 60 kilometers away from their home country , and yet russia does not feel like home to them .
" they 're afraid for their safety , " one russian student told deutsche welle .
" that 's why they spend entire days here and at the student residences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students usually only leave their dorms in vladivostok in groups when these exchange students do venture into town beyond the safe bubble of their dormitory , lecture halls and the basketball courts , then they only go in groups .
always on guard right-wing extremists in vladivostok have become more active in recent years , stoked by local mistrust of russia 's up-and-coming neighbor china as well as by worries about a weak economy and more foreigners coming into the country .
one chinese student in vladivostok told deutsche welle about her boyfriend 's encounter with a gang of thugs .
" about ten guys broke his nose , " she said .
" just like that , without saying anything . "
the young man ran away from his attackers , but according to his girlfriend , he was n't safe again until he was back at the university .
according to the sova center in moscow , an organization that researches racism and xenophobia , last year in russia around 70 people were killed in racially motivated attacks , while more than 300 were injured .
the center says that moscow and st. petersburg are especially dangerous places for central asians and people from the caucasus .
however , the situation has improved and those numbers have fallen by a third since 2008 .
police and judges are now taking the matter more seriously , according to the center 's director , alexander verkhovsky .
he says special police forces have been established to tackle right-wing extremism and that they have made several arrests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander verkhovsky is director of the anti-racist sova center in moscow a shock for the kremlin however , it took russian authorities some time to recognize the danger of right-wing radicals .
for years , critics of the kremlin felt that the government was more accommodating to extremist nationalists than it was to the country 's democratic opposition .
a turning point came in 2006 when extremists led a deadly pogrom against caucasian-owned businesses and restaurants in the small city of kondopoga , in russia 's northwest karelia region .
according to verkhovsky , it was only when the kremlin realized that it had lost control over kondopoga for a day that the kremlin started taking extremist nationalists seriously .
" it greatly alarmed the government , " said verkhovsky , who said the kremlin saw the event as " a political threat . "
still waters run deep verkhovsky told deutsche welle that the kremlin 's fight against racism has deeper roots than a push to secure power .
according to him , the nation 's authoritarian political climate has made open discussion of the topic taboo .
based on the silence of politicians , he said , many extremists have felt that russian society was on their side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china looms on vladivostok 's horizon " those who are out killing people feel they are pioneering a people 's movement , " he said .
in fact , extremist ideas are deeply anchored in the mindset of russian society .
according to some surveys , 55 percent of russians want to see foreign residents – especially those from central asia or the caucasus – stripped of their rights or even deported , and this , despite the fact that the russian economy depends on the cheap labor of people from these countries .
at the basketball court in vladivostok where chinese exchange students take refuge , many native students are certain that pacific russia 's economic prosperity depends on china .

laws , whose job had been to oversee cuts to public spending , stood down over expenses revelations . cabinet minister david laws has stepped down from his high-ranking position in britain 's financial ministry after only 18 day in office , following revelations about expenses and his private life .
laws , a member of the liberal democrat party , resigned from his position as chief secretary to the treasury after the daily telegraph newspaper reported he had claimed more than 40,000 pounds -lrb- 47,100 euros , $ 57,800 -rrb- in expenses to pay rent to his long-term male partner .
" i do not see how i can carry out my crucial work on the budget and spending review while i have to deal with the private and public implications of recent revelations , ” laws said in a statement on saturday .
the millionaire former banker said he had not disclosed the financial arrangement due to his " desire to keep my sexuality a secret . "
he said he had not considered himself in breach of rules on expenses because he and his partner , lobbyist james lundie , had separate bank accounts and led separate social lives .
public spending cuts in his position at the finance ministry , laws was deputy to chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- george osborne .
the pair were overseeing tough austerity cuts aimed at reducing britain 's budget deficit , which stands at about 156 billion pounds , exceeding 11 percent of gross domestic product .
the british government last week agreed to immediate spending cuts totaling some 6 billion pounds .
the resignation is an early blow for britain 's first coalition government for 65 years , formed between britain 's conservative and liberal democrat parties .
conservative prime minister david cameron called laws ' decision " honorable . "
the liberal democrat leader , deputy prime minister nick clegg , said laws had taken a " very painful decision . " rc / reuters / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hague said relations with washington would be " solid but not slavish " and pointedly omitted any reference to the phrase " special relationship " which has been a staple in statements referring to ties between the uk and the united states .
while attempting to distance britain from the image of being the " poodle " of successive us governments , hague 's " vision of a new , distinctive british foreign policy " did not suggest that europe would be the main beneficiary of the new government 's change of direction on the world stage .
instead of turning its attention to the power base of european politics across the water , hague said britain would develop its own identity and strategic role , following a new foreign-policy agenda which would differ in its " reach and ambition " from that pursued by the previous labour governments .
as well as confirming that britain would not join the euro-zone over the next five years of the new parliament , hague - a well-known eurosceptic - rejected ideas of further and deeper political union with brussels and instead announced the government 's desire for " freeing up the single market to boost economic growth . "
hague says britain will stay out eu 's financial structures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hague said that britain would stay out of eu financial affairs britain , hague said , would not be contributing to the financial assistance offered to the beleaguered economies of the euro-zone in the foreseeable future as it would be " difficult at a time of economic constraint . "
however , while distancing britain from the eu , hague said that his government would like the eu to " use its collective weight more effectively on the world stage . "
" in terms of joining the euro zone and keeping out of the bailout operations , this shows continuity with labour 's views on these topics , " thomas klau , head of the paris office of the european council for foreign relations and an eu expert , told deutsche welle .
" what cameron and hague have shown so far in europe , and indeed in washington , is that continuity is set to prevail over radical change . "
" earlier fears that a tory or tory-liberal coalition government would usher in an era of clashes with the eu so far hav n't materialised , " he added .
" this is largely down to the liberals ' inclusion in the coalition and the tories making it clear they wo n't be stepping into margaret thatcher 's shoes and waving her handbag about .
they may be talking tough on the eu but it does n't represent a huge shift away from polices labour adopted under tony blair . "
" in terms of questioning the eu 's role in the world , there was some concern that the tories would set up in opposition to the lisbon treaty and try to undermine the eu 's regulations governing its operations abroad , " klau said .
" there were even fears that they would be down right hostile to this but again , there has been little indication as yet that this will be the case .
hague has said that the eu should have a crucial role in certain areas , especially dealing with non-eu members , specifically russia .
so this policy announcement did n't really include anything worrying or shocking for the eu . "
with the eu kept at arms length and the cosiness of former relations with the us reduced to a firm handshake , the new british foreign policy agenda focuses heavily on london 's ambition to make its influence felt on the world stage . new emphasis on taking lead on global issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan and the middle east are priorities for britain rejecting ideas that britain was in strategic and influential decline , hague targeted increased engagement and cooperation with the emerging economies in the world and deepening of relations with countries in the gulf and the middle east , along with brazil , japan , india and china .
foreign engagement would " run through the veins of the entire administration , " hague said , announcing the creation of a newly-established national security council which would ensure that the " new philosophy will be translated into action . "
hague highlighted britain 's continued role in afghanistan , where the uk has 9,500 troops deployed , and relations with pakistan as areas of prime importance .
he added that britain would continue to back a two-state solution in the middle east and pursue a dual approach of " engagement and sanctions " in regard to iran , while backing current moves in the united nations to tighten punitive measures .
prime minister david cameron recently called on the international community to " ratchet up " pressure on tehran through sanctions in a bid to prevent the islamic republic pursuing what the west suspects is a nuclear weapons program .
britain stands more chance of success with eu , say experts " britain 's global policy is going to be shaped by the events which happen during the lifespan of this coalition , " klau said .
" will we see a clear break from labour policies on climate change , financial regulation , iran and the middle east ?
not necessarily .
the middle east in particular was a high priority for blair and this will be the same for cameron . "
" whether this ambitious britain can make a meaningful contribution with global resonance outside of the eu is another matter , " he added .
" all major eu powers must recognise that there 's not much governments can do when they act alone .
the chances of success are low when their efforts are not within the framework of a joint eu initiative .
the best they can hope for is a photo opportunity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say britain can achieve more with the eu than without almut moeller , head of the alfred von oppenheim centre for european policy studies at the german council on foreign relations , agrees that it is impossible for any state to work individually with success on global issues without being part of a framework .
but she believes that britain could actually benefit from being more involved with the eu at this time , not less .
" this is actually a really good opportunity for britain to become more engaged in european policies , " moeller told deutsche welle .
" there is a will to cooperate and a consensus that it makes sense to work together so if the british want pursue certain goals and shape european policies , especially in security and defence issues , then this is the right time .
there are a number of security and defence issues within the lisbon treaty which have stalled and there are no discussions being taken on these .
britain could give these and other policies which are lacking leadership the impetus they need . "

" in terms of joining the euro zone and keeping out of the bailout operations , this shows continuity with labour 's views on these topics , " thomas klau , head of the paris office of the european council for foreign relations and an eu expert , told deutsche welle .
" what cameron and hague have shown so far in europe , and indeed in washington , is that continuity is set to prevail over radical change . "
" earlier fears that a tory or tory-liberal coalition government would usher in an era of clashes with the eu so far hav n't materialised , " he added .
" this is largely down to the liberals ' inclusion in the coalition and the tories making it clear they wo n't be stepping into margaret thatcher 's shoes and waving her handbag about .
they may be talking tough on the eu but it does n't represent a huge shift away from polices labour adopted under tony blair . "
" in terms of questioning the eu 's role in the world , there was some concern that the tories would set up in opposition to the lisbon treaty and try to undermine the eu 's regulations governing its operations abroad , " klau said .
" there were even fears that they would be down right hostile to this but again , there has been little indication as yet that this will be the case .
hague has said that the eu should have a crucial role in certain areas , especially dealing with non-eu members , specifically russia .
so this policy announcement did n't really include anything worrying or shocking for the eu . "
with the eu kept at arms length and the cosiness of former relations with the us reduced to a firm handshake , the new british foreign policy agenda focuses heavily on london 's ambition to make its influence felt on the world stage . new emphasis on taking lead on global issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan and the middle east are priorities for britain rejecting ideas that britain was in strategic and influential decline , hague targeted increased engagement and cooperation with the emerging economies in the world and deepening of relations with countries in the gulf and the middle east , along with brazil , japan , india and china .
foreign engagement would " run through the veins of the entire administration , " hague said , announcing the creation of a newly-established national security council which would ensure that the " new philosophy will be translated into action . "
hague highlighted britain 's continued role in afghanistan , where the uk has 9,500 troops deployed , and relations with pakistan as areas of prime importance .
he added that britain would continue to back a two-state solution in the middle east and pursue a dual approach of " engagement and sanctions " in regard to iran , while backing current moves in the united nations to tighten punitive measures .
prime minister david cameron recently called on the international community to " ratchet up " pressure on tehran through sanctions in a bid to prevent the islamic republic pursuing what the west suspects is a nuclear weapons program .
britain stands more chance of success with eu , say experts " britain 's global policy is going to be shaped by the events which happen during the lifespan of this coalition , " klau said .
" will we see a clear break from labour policies on climate change , financial regulation , iran and the middle east ?
not necessarily .
the middle east in particular was a high priority for blair and this will be the same for cameron . "
" whether this ambitious britain can make a meaningful contribution with global resonance outside of the eu is another matter , " he added .
" all major eu powers must recognise that there 's not much governments can do when they act alone .
the chances of success are low when their efforts are not within the framework of a joint eu initiative .
the best they can hope for is a photo opportunity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say britain can achieve more with the eu than without almut moeller , head of the alfred von oppenheim centre for european policy studies at the german council on foreign relations , agrees that it is impossible for any state to work individually with success on global issues without being part of a framework .
but she believes that britain could actually benefit from being more involved with the eu at this time , not less .
" this is actually a really good opportunity for britain to become more engaged in european policies , " moeller told deutsche welle .
" there is a will to cooperate and a consensus that it makes sense to work together so if the british want pursue certain goals and shape european policies , especially in security and defence issues , then this is the right time .
there are a number of security and defence issues within the lisbon treaty which have stalled and there are no discussions being taken on these .
britain could give these and other policies which are lacking leadership the impetus they need . "

laws , whose job had been to oversee cuts to public spending , stood down over expenses revelations . cabinet minister david laws has stepped down from his high-ranking position in britain 's financial ministry after only 18 day in office , following revelations about expenses and his private life .
laws , a member of the liberal democrat party , resigned from his position as chief secretary to the treasury after the daily telegraph newspaper reported he had claimed more than 40,000 pounds -lrb- 47,100 euros , $ 57,800 -rrb- in expenses to pay rent to his long-term male partner .
" i do not see how i can carry out my crucial work on the budget and spending review while i have to deal with the private and public implications of recent revelations , ” laws said in a statement on saturday .
the millionaire former banker said he had not disclosed the financial arrangement due to his " desire to keep my sexuality a secret . "
he said he had not considered himself in breach of rules on expenses because he and his partner , lobbyist james lundie , had separate bank accounts and led separate social lives .
public spending cuts in his position at the finance ministry , laws was deputy to chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- george osborne .
the pair were overseeing tough austerity cuts aimed at reducing britain 's budget deficit , which stands at about 156 billion pounds , exceeding 11 percent of gross domestic product .
the british government last week agreed to immediate spending cuts totaling some 6 billion pounds .
the resignation is an early blow for britain 's first coalition government for 65 years , formed between britain 's conservative and liberal democrat parties .
conservative prime minister david cameron called laws ' decision " honorable . "
the liberal democrat leader , deputy prime minister nick clegg , said laws had taken a " very painful decision . " rc / reuters / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was germany 's first win in nearly three decades and the victory means it will host next year 's eurovision . lena meyer-landrut may have made her name with the song " satellite " but , at least for the moment , she 's a superstar in germany .
the 19-year-old ended germany 's long losing streak in the popular european-wide song competition with an improbable triumph over 24 other finalists in a live program from oslo on saturday night watched by more than 100 million people across europe .
thousands of fans braved bad weather to greet the teenage pop sensation in her home town , some 15 hours after she destroyed the competition at the eurovision song contest in oslo .
" you guys are really mad !
go back inside , it 's raining , " she told her loyal supporters , blowing kisses to the crowd .
some of them had been waiting for hours for her return .
lena flew home on a special lufthansa charter from norway , and officials in the city of hanover even rolled out the red carpet for the youngster .
" normally this is how we welcome presidents , " state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff , said .
" but i think lena has earned it .
she has represented our country to that level . "
political praise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 70,000 lena fans watched her win on hanover 's big screen even german chancellor angela merkel saw fit to congratulate lena , saying she was thrilled by the teenager 's " super success " in the eurovision song contest .
" lena strongly impressed me with her unpretentiousness and warmth , " the chancellor told mass circulation tabloid bild .
" she is a wonderful example of young germany . "
certainly no one could accuse the 19-year-old of a pretentious demeanor , or of seeming old beyond her years during her on-screen acceptance speech .
" this is so absolutely awesome , " she raved at the live ceremony in oslo after securing a comfortable victory with 246 points .
" i feel that this is not real .
i 'm kind of freaking out .
this feels incredibly good . "
foreign minister guido westerwelle was also impressed by the attractive youngster 's " rousing performance " , which " dazzled germany and sang -lsb- her -rsb- into the heart of europe . "
he said that lena had possibly succeeded in making his job of promoting germany abroad somewhat simpler .
" whether you wanted to be or not , you are an ambassador for our country who , in one night , charmingly disproved a few old stereotypes , " he said .
bildunterschrift : germany waited almost three decades for its second eurovision triumph " europe does like us ! "
the press in germany agreed that lena 's comprehensive win - after estonia , latvia , denmark , sweden , norway , finland , switzerland , spain and slovakia all awarded the maximum 12 points for her performance - helped banish a string of stereotypes about german culture , and german pop music .
" europe does like us ! " wrote the bild am sonntag sunday paper on page one , having bemoaned the country 's poor placing in past competitions .
" why does n't anyone like us ? " , the paper complained in 2008 , when germany sent established pop stars " no angels " to the competition in a bid for success .
but the band scored a miserable 14 points , in joint-last place .
since 2005 , germany had never finished higher than fifteenth in the 25-act competition , and the country had only ever won eurovision in 1982 with an anti-war ballad " ein bisschen frieden " -lrb- " a little peace " -rrb- by female vocalist nicole hohloch .

be proud . "
hundreds of foreign residents in russia are victims of violent right-wing extremism every year .
authorities are taking the problem seriously , but xenophobic attitudes are widespread in russian society . on an outdoor court at the university of vladivostok , a group of chinese exchange students are dribbling and shooting hoops in their own corner around a single net , separate from their russian counterparts .
here on the russian pacific coast , these exchange students are only 60 kilometers away from their home country , and yet russia does not feel like home to them .
" they 're afraid for their safety , " one russian student told deutsche welle .
" that 's why they spend entire days here and at the student residences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students usually only leave their dorms in vladivostok in groups when these exchange students do venture into town beyond the safe bubble of their dormitory , lecture halls and the basketball courts , then they only go in groups .
always on guard right-wing extremists in vladivostok have become more active in recent years , stoked by local mistrust of russia 's up-and-coming neighbor china as well as by worries about a weak economy and more foreigners coming into the country .
one chinese student in vladivostok told deutsche welle about her boyfriend 's encounter with a gang of thugs .
" about ten guys broke his nose , " she said .
" just like that , without saying anything . "
the young man ran away from his attackers , but according to his girlfriend , he was n't safe again until he was back at the university .
according to the sova center in moscow , an organization that researches racism and xenophobia , last year in russia around 70 people were killed in racially motivated attacks , while more than 300 were injured .
the center says that moscow and st. petersburg are especially dangerous places for central asians and people from the caucasus .
however , the situation has improved and those numbers have fallen by a third since 2008 .
police and judges are now taking the matter more seriously , according to the center 's director , alexander verkhovsky .
he says special police forces have been established to tackle right-wing extremism and that they have made several arrests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander verkhovsky is director of the anti-racist sova center in moscow a shock for the kremlin however , it took russian authorities some time to recognize the danger of right-wing radicals .
for years , critics of the kremlin felt that the government was more accommodating to extremist nationalists than it was to the country 's democratic opposition .
a turning point came in 2006 when extremists led a deadly pogrom against caucasian-owned businesses and restaurants in the small city of kondopoga , in russia 's northwest karelia region .
according to verkhovsky , it was only when the kremlin realized that it had lost control over kondopoga for a day that the kremlin started taking extremist nationalists seriously .
" it greatly alarmed the government , " said verkhovsky , who said the kremlin saw the event as " a political threat . "
still waters run deep verkhovsky told deutsche welle that the kremlin 's fight against racism has deeper roots than a push to secure power .
according to him , the nation 's authoritarian political climate has made open discussion of the topic taboo .
based on the silence of politicians , he said , many extremists have felt that russian society was on their side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china looms on vladivostok 's horizon " those who are out killing people feel they are pioneering a people 's movement , " he said .
in fact , extremist ideas are deeply anchored in the mindset of russian society .
according to some surveys , 55 percent of russians want to see foreign residents – especially those from central asia or the caucasus – stripped of their rights or even deported , and this , despite the fact that the russian economy depends on the cheap labor of people from these countries .
at the basketball court in vladivostok where chinese exchange students take refuge , many native students are certain that pacific russia 's economic prosperity depends on china .

red bull team mates sebastian vettel and mark webber crashed while fighting for the lead ; vettel retired , webber salvaged third place . mclaren 's pair of british world champions could scarcely believe their luck in istanbul , when an inter-team crash ahead of them left them with an easy one-two finish at the turkish grand prix .
red bull 's mark webber was leading at roughly two-thirds race distance , ahead of german team mate sebastian vettel , with the mclarens pressuring behind in third and fourth places .
then the red bull duo evidently forgot motor sport 's golden rule : never take out your team mate .
vettel tried an ambitious overtaking maneuver on webber 's red bull , and the pair collided .
the german retired immediately , while webber had to pit for repairs and finished up in third place .
" it 's stupid between team mates , but i should have been given the necessary space , " vettel lamented in the pit lane after retiring , blaming webber for the collision .
" it was a disaster , " webber said afterwards , although he did n't share vettel 's interpretation of the crash .
" it can happen .
he had a slight speed advantage , but he turned right into me and made contact and … well , that was it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel 's car was ruined in the crash , webber managed to limp home the crash was the latest in a string of problems that have stopped red bull , whose car still seems the class of the field , from converting their pace into results .
" all we ask for " after the crash , mclaren 's british world champions hamilton and button had their own wheel-to-wheel battle for the lead , but they managed to keep it fairly clean , with only minimal contact between the pair .
hamilton watched the red bull crash from his cockpit , saying it was " like an action movie in 3d .
" i do n't know what happened , " he said in the winner 's press conference , " but they collided and we got past them , and then we had a bit of a battle - a fair one , i must say - before the end . "
button , who succeeded hamilton as world champion in 2009 , also complemented his team mate for keeping the battle between them clean .
meanwhile , a disappointed red bull team boss christian horner also offered indirect praise to the mclaren duo , saying he wished his drivers had shown similar restraint under pressure .
" we saw lewis -lrb- hamilton -rrb- and jenson -lrb- button -rrb- racing each other and giving each other space .
that 's all we ask for , " he said .
schumacher 's best of the season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : normally strong , ferrari had a difficult day in the mid-field returning seven-time champion michael schumacher finished in fourth for mercedes , with his german team mate nico rosberg glued to his gearbox in fifth .
fourth position is the best result of 2010 for schumacher , who is still looking for his first podium finish since launching a comeback this season .
the two mercedes drivers managed to keep the hard-charging renault of robert kubica at bay throughout the race , but lacked the pace to challenge the leaders .
adrian sutil finished ninth for force india , behind the ferraris of felipe massa and fernando alonso , meaning that three of the six germans on the grid scored points in turkey .
in the race for the world championship , third place was enough to maintain mark webber 's lead in the standings , but the mclaren duo of button and hamilton are close behind .
vettel 's retirement means he drops to fifth in the standings , behind ferrari 's fernando alonso .
but vettel , webber , and red bull will all be wondering how large their leads over the competition might have been , had the first seven races of the season ran more smoothly .

be proud . "
hundreds of foreign residents in russia are victims of violent right-wing extremism every year .
authorities are taking the problem seriously , but xenophobic attitudes are widespread in russian society . on an outdoor court at the university of vladivostok , a group of chinese exchange students are dribbling and shooting hoops in their own corner around a single net , separate from their russian counterparts .
here on the russian pacific coast , these exchange students are only 60 kilometers away from their home country , and yet russia does not feel like home to them .
" they 're afraid for their safety , " one russian student told deutsche welle .
" that 's why they spend entire days here and at the student residences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students usually only leave their dorms in vladivostok in groups when these exchange students do venture into town beyond the safe bubble of their dormitory , lecture halls and the basketball courts , then they only go in groups .
always on guard right-wing extremists in vladivostok have become more active in recent years , stoked by local mistrust of russia 's up-and-coming neighbor china as well as by worries about a weak economy and more foreigners coming into the country .
one chinese student in vladivostok told deutsche welle about her boyfriend 's encounter with a gang of thugs .
" about ten guys broke his nose , " she said .
" just like that , without saying anything . "
the young man ran away from his attackers , but according to his girlfriend , he was n't safe again until he was back at the university .
according to the sova center in moscow , an organization that researches racism and xenophobia , last year in russia around 70 people were killed in racially motivated attacks , while more than 300 were injured .
the center says that moscow and st. petersburg are especially dangerous places for central asians and people from the caucasus .
however , the situation has improved and those numbers have fallen by a third since 2008 .
police and judges are now taking the matter more seriously , according to the center 's director , alexander verkhovsky .
he says special police forces have been established to tackle right-wing extremism and that they have made several arrests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander verkhovsky is director of the anti-racist sova center in moscow a shock for the kremlin however , it took russian authorities some time to recognize the danger of right-wing radicals .
for years , critics of the kremlin felt that the government was more accommodating to extremist nationalists than it was to the country 's democratic opposition .
a turning point came in 2006 when extremists led a deadly pogrom against caucasian-owned businesses and restaurants in the small city of kondopoga , in russia 's northwest karelia region .
according to verkhovsky , it was only when the kremlin realized that it had lost control over kondopoga for a day that the kremlin started taking extremist nationalists seriously .
" it greatly alarmed the government , " said verkhovsky , who said the kremlin saw the event as " a political threat . "
still waters run deep verkhovsky told deutsche welle that the kremlin 's fight against racism has deeper roots than a push to secure power .
according to him , the nation 's authoritarian political climate has made open discussion of the topic taboo .
based on the silence of politicians , he said , many extremists have felt that russian society was on their side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china looms on vladivostok 's horizon " those who are out killing people feel they are pioneering a people 's movement , " he said .
in fact , extremist ideas are deeply anchored in the mindset of russian society .
according to some surveys , 55 percent of russians want to see foreign residents – especially those from central asia or the caucasus – stripped of their rights or even deported , and this , despite the fact that the russian economy depends on the cheap labor of people from these countries .
at the basketball court in vladivostok where chinese exchange students take refuge , many native students are certain that pacific russia 's economic prosperity depends on china .

laws , whose job had been to oversee cuts to public spending , stood down over expenses revelations . cabinet minister david laws has stepped down from his high-ranking position in britain 's financial ministry after only 18 day in office , following revelations about expenses and his private life .
laws , a member of the liberal democrat party , resigned from his position as chief secretary to the treasury after the daily telegraph newspaper reported he had claimed more than 40,000 pounds -lrb- 47,100 euros , $ 57,800 -rrb- in expenses to pay rent to his long-term male partner .
" i do not see how i can carry out my crucial work on the budget and spending review while i have to deal with the private and public implications of recent revelations , ” laws said in a statement on saturday .
the millionaire former banker said he had not disclosed the financial arrangement due to his " desire to keep my sexuality a secret . "
he said he had not considered himself in breach of rules on expenses because he and his partner , lobbyist james lundie , had separate bank accounts and led separate social lives .
public spending cuts in his position at the finance ministry , laws was deputy to chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- george osborne .
the pair were overseeing tough austerity cuts aimed at reducing britain 's budget deficit , which stands at about 156 billion pounds , exceeding 11 percent of gross domestic product .
the british government last week agreed to immediate spending cuts totaling some 6 billion pounds .
the resignation is an early blow for britain 's first coalition government for 65 years , formed between britain 's conservative and liberal democrat parties .
conservative prime minister david cameron called laws ' decision " honorable . "
the liberal democrat leader , deputy prime minister nick clegg , said laws had taken a " very painful decision . " rc / reuters / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

westermann fractured his left foot in saturday evening 's friendly match against hungary . german soccer coach joachim loew must be wondering if he 'll have any healthy players left by the time the world cup begins in south africa next month .
central defender heiko westermann is the latest first-team player to be ruled out of the competition , having fractured his left foot in saturday 's 3-0 friendly win against hungary in budapest .
" heiko would have played a very important role at the world cup for our team .
that is because of his multi-faceted play .
in training he was in superb physical condition , " loew said .
the 27-year-old central defender , who has 19 caps , played a crucial role in schalke 's failed push for the bundesliga title this season , cementing himself as a regular in the national team in the process .
" naturally i am devastated because it was my big goal to take part in the world cup , " said westermann .
" i felt fully fit but now the only thing left for me to do is to wish the team all the best at the tournament . "
bildunterschrift : torn ankle ligaments have already sidelined captain michael ballack five down , 23 required westermann is the fifth german player to be ruled out of the world cup with injury in a matter of weeks .
captain michael ballack is out with an ankle ligament injury , with fellow midfielders christian traesch and simon rolfes also unable to represent their country .
first choice goalkeeper rene adler 's broken ribs mean that westermann 's schalke team mate , manuel neuer , will wear the number one shirt in south africa .
both adler and neuer are relatively new to international soccer , after the tragic suicide of former first choice goalie robert enke late last year .

red bull team mates sebastian vettel and mark webber crashed while fighting for the lead ; vettel retired , webber salvaged third place . mclaren 's pair of british world champions could scarcely believe their luck in istanbul , when an inter-team crash ahead of them left them with an easy one-two finish at the turkish grand prix .
red bull 's mark webber was leading at roughly two-thirds race distance , ahead of german team mate sebastian vettel , with the mclarens pressuring behind in third and fourth places .
then the red bull duo evidently forgot motor sport 's golden rule : never take out your team mate .
vettel tried an ambitious overtaking maneuver on webber 's red bull , and the pair collided .
the german retired immediately , while webber had to pit for repairs and finished up in third place .
" it 's stupid between team mates , but i should have been given the necessary space , " vettel lamented in the pit lane after retiring , blaming webber for the collision .
" it was a disaster , " webber said afterwards , although he did n't share vettel 's interpretation of the crash .
" it can happen .
he had a slight speed advantage , but he turned right into me and made contact and … well , that was it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel 's car was ruined in the crash , webber managed to limp home the crash was the latest in a string of problems that have stopped red bull , whose car still seems the class of the field , from converting their pace into results .
" all we ask for " after the crash , mclaren 's british world champions hamilton and button had their own wheel-to-wheel battle for the lead , but they managed to keep it fairly clean , with only minimal contact between the pair .

they have promised severe budget cuts to trim the country 's growing deficit . what a difference a day makes .
for the past six months , the center-left social democrats - led by the abrasive jiri paroubek - had been riding high in the opinion polls , heading for what most surveys predicted would be a clear victory : 30 percent , maybe more .
on the actual day , though , it was rather different .
and on sunday , czechs woke to the prospect of having the strongest government in years after one of the biggest political shake-ups since czechoslovakia split in 1993 .
pyrrhic victory there were gasps of surprise at the party 's lidovy dum headquarters on saturday when czech television released exit polls showing the social democrats tied in first place with the civic democrats , both at 20 percent .
but surprise turned to despair as the results came in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democratic party chairman jiri paroubek , resigned after the vote results came in in the end , paroubek 's party scored 22 percent - still the largest party , but a pyrrhic victory if ever there was one .
paroubek resigned almost immediately , conceding it was clear the country was heading for a center-right coalition .
plans to create a minority social democrat adminstration propped up by the communist party lay in tatters .
voters , it appears , had rejected his plans to tax the rich and preserve generous social benefits .
" it seems that people have chosen the direction the country should go in and it is a different direction than the one the social democrats were offering , ” paroubek told reporters , his new wife standing by his side .
czech media reported that waiters at the lidovy dum later circulated with trays of champagne bought to celebrate victory .
no one would touch them .
avoiding greek-style crisis across town , however , the champagne corks were popping at the headquarters of two brand new parliamentary parties : top09 , which was formed out of disgruntled civic democrat and christian democrat members and led by the aristocrat karel schwarzenberg ; and public affairs , a rather mysterious centrist party promoting direct democracy and promising to wage war on corruption .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top09 chairman karel schwarzenberg they came out of nowhere and now control a third of the seats in parliament .
" i 'm hugely pleased with the czech people , " schwarzenberg , whose full title is his serene highness the prince of schwarzenberg , count of sulz , princely landgrave in klettgau , and duke of krumlov .
a former chancellor to ex-president vaclav havel , he 's popular with urban , right-wing voters , and enjoys something of cult status among the young .
" czech voters have rejected demogoguery , rejected the extremists , and have given their votes to us , who did n't promise them anything but who gave them a clear vision of the future . "
that vision is built on fiscal responsibility – slashing public spending to reduce the czech republic 's debt and reforming key expenditures such as pensions and healthcare .
a slap for civic democrats schwarzenberg is already holding talks with the man most likely to become prime minister – petr necas , the interim leader of the conservative civic democrats .
they came second in the poll but unlike the social democrats , they have the potential to put together a majority center-right coalition and will lead efforts to form a new government , together with the centrist public affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech voters chose a path of fiscal responsibility , analysts say but even though the civic democrats - founded in 1991 by vaclav klaus , now president - will play a leading role in the new government , it was not a great election for the party .
they did particularly poorly in prague - a bastion of civic democrat support since the early 1990s .
it used to be said that even vaclav klaus ' tennis racquet could win a seat in prague .
one commentator said that phrase should now be amended : even karel schwarzenberg 's pipe could stand for office and win in the capital , he said .
" there 's not much to celebrate , " civic democrat deputy leader david vodrazka told lidove noviny newspaper .
" the voters – especially in prague – did n't just wave a warning finger at us .
they slapped us round the back of the head . "
day of resignations indeed it was something of an earthquake for czech politics , as voters punished the two big parties - and several smaller ones as well .
paroubek was not the only party leader to resign .
ondrej liska , head of the greens , immediately announced his resignation after his party lost all its seats .
cyril svoboda , leader of the christian democrats , followed suit after his party was unceremoniously kicked out of parliament .
and finally milos zeman – the oafish , heavy drinking former social democrat prime minister known for his brilliant acerbic wit – announced he was resigning after his leftist citizens ' rights party failed to gain enough votes to enter parliament .
but in many ways his was the real success story of the evening – he had developed a personal animosity towards social democrat leader paroubek .
in the end zeman 's party won 4.3 percent – almost all of them social democrat voters , helping to deprive paroubek of the victory he so craved .

the two mercedes drivers managed to keep the hard-charging renault of robert kubica at bay throughout the race , but lacked the pace to challenge the leaders .
adrian sutil finished ninth for force india , behind the ferraris of felipe massa and fernando alonso , meaning that three of the six germans on the grid scored points in turkey .
in the race for the world championship , third place was enough to maintain mark webber 's lead in the standings , but the mclaren duo of button and hamilton are close behind .
vettel 's retirement means he drops to fifth in the standings , behind ferrari 's fernando alonso .
but vettel , webber , and red bull will all be wondering how large their leads over the competition might have been , had the first seven races of the season ran more smoothly .

it was germany 's first win in nearly three decades and the victory means it will host next year 's eurovision . lena meyer-landrut may have made her name with the song " satellite " but , at least for the moment , she 's a superstar in germany .
the 19-year-old ended germany 's long losing streak in the popular european-wide song competition with an improbable triumph over 24 other finalists in a live program from oslo on saturday night watched by more than 100 million people across europe .
thousands of fans braved bad weather to greet the teenage pop sensation in her home town , some 15 hours after she destroyed the competition at the eurovision song contest in oslo .
" you guys are really mad !
go back inside , it 's raining , " she told her loyal supporters , blowing kisses to the crowd .
some of them had been waiting for hours for her return .
lena flew home on a special lufthansa charter from norway , and officials in the city of hanover even rolled out the red carpet for the youngster .
" normally this is how we welcome presidents , " state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff , said .
" but i think lena has earned it .
she has represented our country to that level . "
political praise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 70,000 lena fans watched her win on hanover 's big screen even german chancellor angela merkel saw fit to congratulate lena , saying she was thrilled by the teenager 's " super success " in the eurovision song contest .
" lena strongly impressed me with her unpretentiousness and warmth , " the chancellor told mass circulation tabloid bild .
" she is a wonderful example of young germany . "
certainly no one could accuse the 19-year-old of a pretentious demeanor , or of seeming old beyond her years during her on-screen acceptance speech .
" this is so absolutely awesome , " she raved at the live ceremony in oslo after securing a comfortable victory with 246 points .
" i feel that this is not real .
i 'm kind of freaking out .
this feels incredibly good . "
foreign minister guido westerwelle was also impressed by the attractive youngster 's " rousing performance " , which " dazzled germany and sang -lsb- her -rsb- into the heart of europe . "
he said that lena had possibly succeeded in making his job of promoting germany abroad somewhat simpler .
" whether you wanted to be or not , you are an ambassador for our country who , in one night , charmingly disproved a few old stereotypes , " he said .
bildunterschrift : germany waited almost three decades for its second eurovision triumph " europe does like us ! "
the press in germany agreed that lena 's comprehensive win - after estonia , latvia , denmark , sweden , norway , finland , switzerland , spain and slovakia all awarded the maximum 12 points for her performance - helped banish a string of stereotypes about german culture , and german pop music .
" europe does like us ! " wrote the bild am sonntag sunday paper on page one , having bemoaned the country 's poor placing in past competitions .
" why does n't anyone like us ? " , the paper complained in 2008 , when germany sent established pop stars " no angels " to the competition in a bid for success .
but the band scored a miserable 14 points , in joint-last place .
since 2005 , germany had never finished higher than fifteenth in the 25-act competition , and the country had only ever won eurovision in 1982 with an anti-war ballad " ein bisschen frieden " -lrb- " a little peace " -rrb- by female vocalist nicole hohloch .
however , as reigning champions , germany will now host the 2011 eurovision song contest next summer. msh / ap / apn / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

laws , whose job had been to oversee cuts to public spending , stood down over expenses revelations . cabinet minister david laws has stepped down from his high-ranking position in britain 's financial ministry after only 18 day in office , following revelations about expenses and his private life .
laws , a member of the liberal democrat party , resigned from his position as chief secretary to the treasury after the daily telegraph newspaper reported he had claimed more than 40,000 pounds -lrb- 47,100 euros , $ 57,800 -rrb- in expenses to pay rent to his long-term male partner .
" i do not see how i can carry out my crucial work on the budget and spending review while i have to deal with the private and public implications of recent revelations , ” laws said in a statement on saturday .
the millionaire former banker said he had not disclosed the financial arrangement due to his " desire to keep my sexuality a secret . "
he said he had not considered himself in breach of rules on expenses because he and his partner , lobbyist james lundie , had separate bank accounts and led separate social lives .
public spending cuts in his position at the finance ministry , laws was deputy to chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- george osborne .
the pair were overseeing tough austerity cuts aimed at reducing britain 's budget deficit , which stands at about 156 billion pounds , exceeding 11 percent of gross domestic product .
the british government last week agreed to immediate spending cuts totaling some 6 billion pounds .
the resignation is an early blow for britain 's first coalition government for 65 years , formed between britain 's conservative and liberal democrat parties .
conservative prime minister david cameron called laws ' decision " honorable . "

to keep it up against serbia , manuel neuer will have to keep things tidy in goal . manuel neuer 's career is stuck in fast-forward .
the goalkeeper was just 20 when he deposed seasoned no.1 frank rost between the sticks at schalke .
at the age of 21 , he was the penalty-saving hero as his hometown club found itself in the champions league quarter-finals .
last summer , he was part of the germany under-21 team that won the european championships .
and now this summer he 's been trusted with keeping goal for the full side at the world cup .
" i feel ready for the task , " neuer told sport bild newspaper before the tournament .
jens lehmann is among those who are n't as sure .
" if we want to be world champions , it would be difficult to imagine it with manuel neuer as our number one goalkeeper , " the former national ' keeper told bild .
" he has made mistakes over and over again .
but i do like neuer , he will make a good goalkeeper one day . "
whether that day has yet come is something that will become clear as the tournament progresses - but neuer himself seems to have no problem with lehmann ’ s comments - time and again , he names the former arsenal man as one of his idols .
bildunterschrift : the world cup will be another leap forward for the schalke man all the tools in his locker neuer has just six international caps to date , and coming into the tournament none of them had been in competitive games .
he made his debut less than a year ago , impressing against the united arab emirates .
but he was at fault for ivory coast 's first goal in a friendly in november 2009 , his clearance bouncing off emmanuel eboue and into the goal .
picked for germany 's recent world cup warm-up against with malta , he had a quiet evening , but stayed alert enough to make one superb save and deny roderick briffa .
the hallmark of a top-level goalkeeper .
therein lies the frustration many feel with neuer 's ability .
he is an unrivalled shot-stopper , but prone to costly lapses in concentration .
he might grow out of it , he 's only 24 .
neuer is a one-club man , born in gelsenkirchen and on the books at schalke since the age of five .
he got his chance in the first-team early in the 2006-07 season , and has n't relinquished the position since .
" it all happened so fast , there was no time to think about the whole situation , " said the young keeper .
in his second season as no.1 he made two point-blank saves in normal time , and two more in the penalty shoot-out , to drop fc porto and win schalke a place in the last eight of the champions league .
he finished this season in confident fashion with a penalty save against bundesliga rivals mainz , showing a penalty-stopping specialism that augurs well with tournament football approaching .
neuer , who stands at around 195cm -lrb- 6 ' 5 " -rrb- , is both imposing and agile .
germany would do well to use his strong throw to launch quick counter attacks , as schalke have done to good effect .
involvement in several contentious incidents in last september 's ruhr derby against dortmund shows a feisty side to his character .
moreover , neuer is a commanding figure for the defenders in front of him .
it 's an important consideration for national coach joachim loew , with the gloves of lehmann - not to mention greats like oliver kahn and toni schumacher - still to be filled .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 30.05.2010 some progress , but xenophobia still widespread in russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : graffitti in vladivostok : " you are russian .
be proud . "
hundreds of foreign residents in russia are victims of violent right-wing extremism every year .
authorities are taking the problem seriously , but xenophobic attitudes are widespread in russian society . on an outdoor court at the university of vladivostok , a group of chinese exchange students are dribbling and shooting hoops in their own corner around a single net , separate from their russian counterparts .
here on the russian pacific coast , these exchange students are only 60 kilometers away from their home country , and yet russia does not feel like home to them .
" they 're afraid for their safety , " one russian student told deutsche welle .
" that 's why they spend entire days here and at the student residences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students usually only leave their dorms in vladivostok in groups when these exchange students do venture into town beyond the safe bubble of their dormitory , lecture halls and the basketball courts , then they only go in groups .
always on guard right-wing extremists in vladivostok have become more active in recent years , stoked by local mistrust of russia 's up-and-coming neighbor china as well as by worries about a weak economy and more foreigners coming into the country .
one chinese student in vladivostok told deutsche welle about her boyfriend 's encounter with a gang of thugs .
" about ten guys broke his nose , " she said .
" just like that , without saying anything . "
the young man ran away from his attackers , but according to his girlfriend , he was n't safe again until he was back at the university .
according to the sova center in moscow , an organization that researches racism and xenophobia , last year in russia around 70 people were killed in racially motivated attacks , while more than 300 were injured .
the center says that moscow and st. petersburg are especially dangerous places for central asians and people from the caucasus .
however , the situation has improved and those numbers have fallen by a third since 2008 .
police and judges are now taking the matter more seriously , according to the center 's director , alexander verkhovsky .
he says special police forces have been established to tackle right-wing extremism and that they have made several arrests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander verkhovsky is director of the anti-racist sova center in moscow a shock for the kremlin however , it took russian authorities some time to recognize the danger of right-wing radicals .
for years , critics of the kremlin felt that the government was more accommodating to extremist nationalists than it was to the country 's democratic opposition .
a turning point came in 2006 when extremists led a deadly pogrom against caucasian-owned businesses and restaurants in the small city of kondopoga , in russia 's northwest karelia region .
according to verkhovsky , it was only when the kremlin realized that it had lost control over kondopoga for a day that the kremlin started taking extremist nationalists seriously .
" it greatly alarmed the government , " said verkhovsky , who said the kremlin saw the event as " a political threat . "
still waters run deep verkhovsky told deutsche welle that the kremlin 's fight against racism has deeper roots than a push to secure power .
according to him , the nation 's authoritarian political climate has made open discussion of the topic taboo .
based on the silence of politicians , he said , many extremists have felt that russian society was on their side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china looms on vladivostok 's horizon " those who are out killing people feel they are pioneering a people 's movement , " he said .
in fact , extremist ideas are deeply anchored in the mindset of russian society .
according to some surveys , 55 percent of russians want to see foreign residents – especially those from central asia or the caucasus – stripped of their rights or even deported , and this , despite the fact that the russian economy depends on the cheap labor of people from these countries .
at the basketball court in vladivostok where chinese exchange students take refuge , many native students are certain that pacific russia 's economic prosperity depends on china .

topping the list : a historic dance hall . it 's early enough for morning fog to be still hanging above the high ash mountains in the sudetenland - a part of the czech republic annexed by nazi germany in the build-up to the second world war .
despite the early hour , a small group of students has already put in quite a trip to be here .
a mini-bus has brought them along meandering roads , through pine forests and villages that nestle between peaks in the hilly landscape .
at the end of the long drive is an old house in the woods .
it 's made of wood , but apart from the roof and the support beams , not much is left .
it 's just a ruin in the forest , but this group is determined to change that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stained glass cast colorful silhouettes of the dancers from the dance floor " we have tools here : rakes , shovels , brooms - that sort of thing , " says tomas hradil , head of the student group that is working on the house .
" first we 'll make things clean and tidy .
flood waters have washed away the stones , so we have to stack them around the perimeter .
then we 'll give it all a once over with a scythe . "
hradil is in his late thirties , and sports a full , dark beard .
his handshake is strong , but as his students fan out and get to work around him , hradil lets out a sigh and shows he has a soft spot for the ruined building in the woods .
" look around here , there used to be stairs that led up to the top floor , " he says .
" now all you see are the stone foundations .
the wood and all the ornamentation were removed by people over the years and taken back to their own homes . "
a bright stage for dancing when it opened in 1904 , the building was a dance hall in the middle of the forest , and it shone elegantly in its prime .
the outer walls consisted of window frames , filled with colored panes in art nouveau style .
inside was a single large room and a dance floor , and crystal chandeliers hung from the ceiling .
people from the entire area came whenever there was a reason to celebrate .
they were mostly germans , but czechs and poles came as well .
today there 's nothing left of the original building other than the foundation and supports - and the dreams of the students who are working to restore it .
" how magnificent it must have been when these windows still shone with all their colors ! " says one of hradil 's students .
" when they had a party here , and everything was brightly lit , and you could see the silhouettes of the people who were dancing inside , and hear the music outside … " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomas hradil heads the student group ' brontosaurus ' today , shards of the art nouveau windows lie all around the building .
hradil says vandals smashed the glass .
if it were up to him , he would rebuild the whole dance hall , but that project is a bit too big for the time being .
financial limitations keep his group , which calls itself ' brontosaurus , ' from undertaking anything too big .
in the past , old fountains on the hiking path near the spa town of jesenik have been restored , and new nature trails through the mountainous country have been blazed .
now , the student volunteers who come from all over the czech republic on their holidays have their sights set on the old dance hall .
if they ca n't fully reconstruct it , they hope at least to keep it from collapsing .
relics from the past should the project ever reach a point where a full reconstruction is possible , hradil thinks he 'd be able to count on some locals to help in tracking down some of the original contents .
" we 've come to realize that the people who stripped the building of all the valuables have actually done us a service , " says hradil .
" the people did n't want to give the communist regime the satisfaction of getting them .
and now they are contacting us , because they heard we are working on restructuring the hall . "
as word spreads about the project , items from the dance hall are slowly being returned .
little gestures like these are like a small miracle in the sudetenland , which had once been lost and forgotten for decades .

to keep it up against serbia , manuel neuer will have to keep things tidy in goal . manuel neuer 's career is stuck in fast-forward .
the goalkeeper was just 20 when he deposed seasoned no.1 frank rost between the sticks at schalke .
at the age of 21 , he was the penalty-saving hero as his hometown club found itself in the champions league quarter-finals .
last summer , he was part of the germany under-21 team that won the european championships .
and now this summer he 's been trusted with keeping goal for the full side at the world cup .
" i feel ready for the task , " neuer told sport bild newspaper before the tournament .
jens lehmann is among those who are n't as sure .
" if we want to be world champions , it would be difficult to imagine it with manuel neuer as our number one goalkeeper , " the former national ' keeper told bild .
" he has made mistakes over and over again .
but i do like neuer , he will make a good goalkeeper one day . "
whether that day has yet come is something that will become clear as the tournament progresses - but neuer himself seems to have no problem with lehmann ’ s comments - time and again , he names the former arsenal man as one of his idols .
bildunterschrift : the world cup will be another leap forward for the schalke man all the tools in his locker neuer has just six international caps to date , and coming into the tournament none of them had been in competitive games .
he made his debut less than a year ago , impressing against the united arab emirates .
but he was at fault for ivory coast 's first goal in a friendly in november 2009 , his clearance bouncing off emmanuel eboue and into the goal .
picked for germany 's recent world cup warm-up against with malta , he had a quiet evening , but stayed alert enough to make one superb save and deny roderick briffa .
the hallmark of a top-level goalkeeper .
therein lies the frustration many feel with neuer 's ability .
he is an unrivalled shot-stopper , but prone to costly lapses in concentration .
he might grow out of it , he 's only 24 .
neuer is a one-club man , born in gelsenkirchen and on the books at schalke since the age of five .
he got his chance in the first-team early in the 2006-07 season , and has n't relinquished the position since .
" it all happened so fast , there was no time to think about the whole situation , " said the young keeper .
in his second season as no.1 he made two point-blank saves in normal time , and two more in the penalty shoot-out , to drop fc porto and win schalke a place in the last eight of the champions league .
he finished this season in confident fashion with a penalty save against bundesliga rivals mainz , showing a penalty-stopping specialism that augurs well with tournament football approaching .
neuer , who stands at around 195cm -lrb- 6 ' 5 " -rrb- , is both imposing and agile .
germany would do well to use his strong throw to launch quick counter attacks , as schalke have done to good effect .
involvement in several contentious incidents in last september 's ruhr derby against dortmund shows a feisty side to his character .
moreover , neuer is a commanding figure for the defenders in front of him .
it 's an important consideration for national coach joachim loew , with the gloves of lehmann - not to mention greats like oliver kahn and toni schumacher - still to be filled .

hague said relations with washington would be " solid but not slavish " and pointedly omitted any reference to the phrase " special relationship " which has been a staple in statements referring to ties between the uk and the united states .
while attempting to distance britain from the image of being the " poodle " of successive us governments , hague 's " vision of a new , distinctive british foreign policy " did not suggest that europe would be the main beneficiary of the new government 's change of direction on the world stage .
instead of turning its attention to the power base of european politics across the water , hague said britain would develop its own identity and strategic role , following a new foreign-policy agenda which would differ in its " reach and ambition " from that pursued by the previous labour governments .
as well as confirming that britain would not join the euro-zone over the next five years of the new parliament , hague - a well-known eurosceptic - rejected ideas of further and deeper political union with brussels and instead announced the government 's desire for " freeing up the single market to boost economic growth . "
hague says britain will stay out eu 's financial structures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hague said that britain would stay out of eu financial affairs britain , hague said , would not be contributing to the financial assistance offered to the beleaguered economies of the euro-zone in the foreseeable future as it would be " difficult at a time of economic constraint . "
however , while distancing britain from the eu , hague said that his government would like the eu to " use its collective weight more effectively on the world stage . "
" in terms of joining the euro zone and keeping out of the bailout operations , this shows continuity with labour 's views on these topics , " thomas klau , head of the paris office of the european council for foreign relations and an eu expert , told deutsche welle .
" what cameron and hague have shown so far in europe , and indeed in washington , is that continuity is set to prevail over radical change . "
" earlier fears that a tory or tory-liberal coalition government would usher in an era of clashes with the eu so far hav n't materialised , " he added .
" this is largely down to the liberals ' inclusion in the coalition and the tories making it clear they wo n't be stepping into margaret thatcher 's shoes and waving her handbag about .
they may be talking tough on the eu but it does n't represent a huge shift away from polices labour adopted under tony blair . "
" in terms of questioning the eu 's role in the world , there was some concern that the tories would set up in opposition to the lisbon treaty and try to undermine the eu 's regulations governing its operations abroad , " klau said .
" there were even fears that they would be down right hostile to this but again , there has been little indication as yet that this will be the case .
hague has said that the eu should have a crucial role in certain areas , especially dealing with non-eu members , specifically russia .
so this policy announcement did n't really include anything worrying or shocking for the eu . "
with the eu kept at arms length and the cosiness of former relations with the us reduced to a firm handshake , the new british foreign policy agenda focuses heavily on london 's ambition to make its influence felt on the world stage . new emphasis on taking lead on global issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan and the middle east are priorities for britain rejecting ideas that britain was in strategic and influential decline , hague targeted increased engagement and cooperation with the emerging economies in the world and deepening of relations with countries in the gulf and the middle east , along with brazil , japan , india and china .
foreign engagement would " run through the veins of the entire administration , " hague said , announcing the creation of a newly-established national security council which would ensure that the " new philosophy will be translated into action . "
hague highlighted britain 's continued role in afghanistan , where the uk has 9,500 troops deployed , and relations with pakistan as areas of prime importance .
he added that britain would continue to back a two-state solution in the middle east and pursue a dual approach of " engagement and sanctions " in regard to iran , while backing current moves in the united nations to tighten punitive measures .
prime minister david cameron recently called on the international community to " ratchet up " pressure on tehran through sanctions in a bid to prevent the islamic republic pursuing what the west suspects is a nuclear weapons program .
britain stands more chance of success with eu , say experts " britain 's global policy is going to be shaped by the events which happen during the lifespan of this coalition , " klau said .
" will we see a clear break from labour policies on climate change , financial regulation , iran and the middle east ?
not necessarily .
the middle east in particular was a high priority for blair and this will be the same for cameron . "
" whether this ambitious britain can make a meaningful contribution with global resonance outside of the eu is another matter , " he added .
" all major eu powers must recognise that there 's not much governments can do when they act alone .
the chances of success are low when their efforts are not within the framework of a joint eu initiative .
the best they can hope for is a photo opportunity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say britain can achieve more with the eu than without almut moeller , head of the alfred von oppenheim centre for european policy studies at the german council on foreign relations , agrees that it is impossible for any state to work individually with success on global issues without being part of a framework .
but she believes that britain could actually benefit from being more involved with the eu at this time , not less .
" this is actually a really good opportunity for britain to become more engaged in european policies , " moeller told deutsche welle .
" there is a will to cooperate and a consensus that it makes sense to work together so if the british want pursue certain goals and shape european policies , especially in security and defence issues , then this is the right time .
there are a number of security and defence issues within the lisbon treaty which have stalled and there are no discussions being taken on these .
britain could give these and other policies which are lacking leadership the impetus they need . "

be proud . "
hundreds of foreign residents in russia are victims of violent right-wing extremism every year .
authorities are taking the problem seriously , but xenophobic attitudes are widespread in russian society . on an outdoor court at the university of vladivostok , a group of chinese exchange students are dribbling and shooting hoops in their own corner around a single net , separate from their russian counterparts .
here on the russian pacific coast , these exchange students are only 60 kilometers away from their home country , and yet russia does not feel like home to them .
" they 're afraid for their safety , " one russian student told deutsche welle .
" that 's why they spend entire days here and at the student residences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students usually only leave their dorms in vladivostok in groups when these exchange students do venture into town beyond the safe bubble of their dormitory , lecture halls and the basketball courts , then they only go in groups .
always on guard right-wing extremists in vladivostok have become more active in recent years , stoked by local mistrust of russia 's up-and-coming neighbor china as well as by worries about a weak economy and more foreigners coming into the country .
one chinese student in vladivostok told deutsche welle about her boyfriend 's encounter with a gang of thugs .
" about ten guys broke his nose , " she said .
" just like that , without saying anything . "
the young man ran away from his attackers , but according to his girlfriend , he was n't safe again until he was back at the university .
according to the sova center in moscow , an organization that researches racism and xenophobia , last year in russia around 70 people were killed in racially motivated attacks , while more than 300 were injured .
the center says that moscow and st. petersburg are especially dangerous places for central asians and people from the caucasus .
however , the situation has improved and those numbers have fallen by a third since 2008 .
police and judges are now taking the matter more seriously , according to the center 's director , alexander verkhovsky .
he says special police forces have been established to tackle right-wing extremism and that they have made several arrests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander verkhovsky is director of the anti-racist sova center in moscow a shock for the kremlin however , it took russian authorities some time to recognize the danger of right-wing radicals .
for years , critics of the kremlin felt that the government was more accommodating to extremist nationalists than it was to the country 's democratic opposition .
a turning point came in 2006 when extremists led a deadly pogrom against caucasian-owned businesses and restaurants in the small city of kondopoga , in russia 's northwest karelia region .
according to verkhovsky , it was only when the kremlin realized that it had lost control over kondopoga for a day that the kremlin started taking extremist nationalists seriously .
" it greatly alarmed the government , " said verkhovsky , who said the kremlin saw the event as " a political threat . "
still waters run deep verkhovsky told deutsche welle that the kremlin 's fight against racism has deeper roots than a push to secure power .
according to him , the nation 's authoritarian political climate has made open discussion of the topic taboo .
based on the silence of politicians , he said , many extremists have felt that russian society was on their side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china looms on vladivostok 's horizon " those who are out killing people feel they are pioneering a people 's movement , " he said .
in fact , extremist ideas are deeply anchored in the mindset of russian society .
according to some surveys , 55 percent of russians want to see foreign residents – especially those from central asia or the caucasus – stripped of their rights or even deported , and this , despite the fact that the russian economy depends on the cheap labor of people from these countries .
at the basketball court in vladivostok where chinese exchange students take refuge , many native students are certain that pacific russia 's economic prosperity depends on china .

to keep it up against serbia , manuel neuer will have to keep things tidy in goal . manuel neuer 's career is stuck in fast-forward .
the goalkeeper was just 20 when he deposed seasoned no.1 frank rost between the sticks at schalke .
at the age of 21 , he was the penalty-saving hero as his hometown club found itself in the champions league quarter-finals .
last summer , he was part of the germany under-21 team that won the european championships .
and now this summer he 's been trusted with keeping goal for the full side at the world cup .
" i feel ready for the task , " neuer told sport bild newspaper before the tournament .
jens lehmann is among those who are n't as sure .
" if we want to be world champions , it would be difficult to imagine it with manuel neuer as our number one goalkeeper , " the former national ' keeper told bild .
" he has made mistakes over and over again .
but i do like neuer , he will make a good goalkeeper one day . "
whether that day has yet come is something that will become clear as the tournament progresses - but neuer himself seems to have no problem with lehmann ’ s comments - time and again , he names the former arsenal man as one of his idols .
bildunterschrift : the world cup will be another leap forward for the schalke man all the tools in his locker neuer has just six international caps to date , and coming into the tournament none of them had been in competitive games .
he made his debut less than a year ago , impressing against the united arab emirates .
but he was at fault for ivory coast 's first goal in a friendly in november 2009 , his clearance bouncing off emmanuel eboue and into the goal .
picked for germany 's recent world cup warm-up against with malta , he had a quiet evening , but stayed alert enough to make one superb save and deny roderick briffa .
the hallmark of a top-level goalkeeper .
therein lies the frustration many feel with neuer 's ability .
he is an unrivalled shot-stopper , but prone to costly lapses in concentration .
he might grow out of it , he 's only 24 .
neuer is a one-club man , born in gelsenkirchen and on the books at schalke since the age of five .
he got his chance in the first-team early in the 2006-07 season , and has n't relinquished the position since .
" it all happened so fast , there was no time to think about the whole situation , " said the young keeper .
in his second season as no.1 he made two point-blank saves in normal time , and two more in the penalty shoot-out , to drop fc porto and win schalke a place in the last eight of the champions league .
he finished this season in confident fashion with a penalty save against bundesliga rivals mainz , showing a penalty-stopping specialism that augurs well with tournament football approaching .
neuer , who stands at around 195cm -lrb- 6 ' 5 " -rrb- , is both imposing and agile .
germany would do well to use his strong throw to launch quick counter attacks , as schalke have done to good effect .
involvement in several contentious incidents in last september 's ruhr derby against dortmund shows a feisty side to his character .
moreover , neuer is a commanding figure for the defenders in front of him .
it 's an important consideration for national coach joachim loew , with the gloves of lehmann - not to mention greats like oliver kahn and toni schumacher - still to be filled .

hundreds of foreign residents in russia are victims of violent right-wing extremism every year .
authorities are taking the problem seriously , but xenophobic attitudes are widespread in russian society . on an outdoor court at the university of vladivostok , a group of chinese exchange students are dribbling and shooting hoops in their own corner around a single net , separate from their russian counterparts .
here on the russian pacific coast , these exchange students are only 60 kilometers away from their home country , and yet russia does not feel like home to them .
" they 're afraid for their safety , " one russian student told deutsche welle .
" that 's why they spend entire days here and at the student residences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students usually only leave their dorms in vladivostok in groups when these exchange students do venture into town beyond the safe bubble of their dormitory , lecture halls and the basketball courts , then they only go in groups .
always on guard right-wing extremists in vladivostok have become more active in recent years , stoked by local mistrust of russia 's up-and-coming neighbor china as well as by worries about a weak economy and more foreigners coming into the country .
one chinese student in vladivostok told deutsche welle about her boyfriend 's encounter with a gang of thugs .
" about ten guys broke his nose , " she said .
" just like that , without saying anything . "
the young man ran away from his attackers , but according to his girlfriend , he was n't safe again until he was back at the university .
according to the sova center in moscow , an organization that researches racism and xenophobia , last year in russia around 70 people were killed in racially motivated attacks , while more than 300 were injured .
the center says that moscow and st. petersburg are especially dangerous places for central asians and people from the caucasus .
however , the situation has improved and those numbers have fallen by a third since 2008 .
police and judges are now taking the matter more seriously , according to the center 's director , alexander verkhovsky .
he says special police forces have been established to tackle right-wing extremism and that they have made several arrests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander verkhovsky is director of the anti-racist sova center in moscow a shock for the kremlin however , it took russian authorities some time to recognize the danger of right-wing radicals .
for years , critics of the kremlin felt that the government was more accommodating to extremist nationalists than it was to the country 's democratic opposition .
a turning point came in 2006 when extremists led a deadly pogrom against caucasian-owned businesses and restaurants in the small city of kondopoga , in russia 's northwest karelia region .
according to verkhovsky , it was only when the kremlin realized that it had lost control over kondopoga for a day that the kremlin started taking extremist nationalists seriously .
" it greatly alarmed the government , " said verkhovsky , who said the kremlin saw the event as " a political threat . "
still waters run deep verkhovsky told deutsche welle that the kremlin 's fight against racism has deeper roots than a push to secure power .
according to him , the nation 's authoritarian political climate has made open discussion of the topic taboo .
based on the silence of politicians , he said , many extremists have felt that russian society was on their side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china looms on vladivostok 's horizon " those who are out killing people feel they are pioneering a people 's movement , " he said .
in fact , extremist ideas are deeply anchored in the mindset of russian society .
according to some surveys , 55 percent of russians want to see foreign residents – especially those from central asia or the caucasus – stripped of their rights or even deported , and this , despite the fact that the russian economy depends on the cheap labor of people from these countries .
at the basketball court in vladivostok where chinese exchange students take refuge , many native students are certain that pacific russia 's economic prosperity depends on china .

to keep it up against serbia , manuel neuer will have to keep things tidy in goal . manuel neuer 's career is stuck in fast-forward .
the goalkeeper was just 20 when he deposed seasoned no.1 frank rost between the sticks at schalke .
at the age of 21 , he was the penalty-saving hero as his hometown club found itself in the champions league quarter-finals .
last summer , he was part of the germany under-21 team that won the european championships .
and now this summer he 's been trusted with keeping goal for the full side at the world cup .
" i feel ready for the task , " neuer told sport bild newspaper before the tournament .
jens lehmann is among those who are n't as sure .
" if we want to be world champions , it would be difficult to imagine it with manuel neuer as our number one goalkeeper , " the former national ' keeper told bild .
" he has made mistakes over and over again .

hague said relations with washington would be " solid but not slavish " and pointedly omitted any reference to the phrase " special relationship " which has been a staple in statements referring to ties between the uk and the united states .
while attempting to distance britain from the image of being the " poodle " of successive us governments , hague 's " vision of a new , distinctive british foreign policy " did not suggest that europe would be the main beneficiary of the new government 's change of direction on the world stage .
instead of turning its attention to the power base of european politics across the water , hague said britain would develop its own identity and strategic role , following a new foreign-policy agenda which would differ in its " reach and ambition " from that pursued by the previous labour governments .
as well as confirming that britain would not join the euro-zone over the next five years of the new parliament , hague - a well-known eurosceptic - rejected ideas of further and deeper political union with brussels and instead announced the government 's desire for " freeing up the single market to boost economic growth . "
hague says britain will stay out eu 's financial structures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hague said that britain would stay out of eu financial affairs britain , hague said , would not be contributing to the financial assistance offered to the beleaguered economies of the euro-zone in the foreseeable future as it would be " difficult at a time of economic constraint . "
however , while distancing britain from the eu , hague said that his government would like the eu to " use its collective weight more effectively on the world stage . "
" in terms of joining the euro zone and keeping out of the bailout operations , this shows continuity with labour 's views on these topics , " thomas klau , head of the paris office of the european council for foreign relations and an eu expert , told deutsche welle .
" what cameron and hague have shown so far in europe , and indeed in washington , is that continuity is set to prevail over radical change . "
" earlier fears that a tory or tory-liberal coalition government would usher in an era of clashes with the eu so far hav n't materialised , " he added .
" this is largely down to the liberals ' inclusion in the coalition and the tories making it clear they wo n't be stepping into margaret thatcher 's shoes and waving her handbag about .
they may be talking tough on the eu but it does n't represent a huge shift away from polices labour adopted under tony blair . "
" in terms of questioning the eu 's role in the world , there was some concern that the tories would set up in opposition to the lisbon treaty and try to undermine the eu 's regulations governing its operations abroad , " klau said .
" there were even fears that they would be down right hostile to this but again , there has been little indication as yet that this will be the case .
hague has said that the eu should have a crucial role in certain areas , especially dealing with non-eu members , specifically russia .
so this policy announcement did n't really include anything worrying or shocking for the eu . "
with the eu kept at arms length and the cosiness of former relations with the us reduced to a firm handshake , the new british foreign policy agenda focuses heavily on london 's ambition to make its influence felt on the world stage . new emphasis on taking lead on global issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan and the middle east are priorities for britain rejecting ideas that britain was in strategic and influential decline , hague targeted increased engagement and cooperation with the emerging economies in the world and deepening of relations with countries in the gulf and the middle east , along with brazil , japan , india and china .
foreign engagement would " run through the veins of the entire administration , " hague said , announcing the creation of a newly-established national security council which would ensure that the " new philosophy will be translated into action . "
hague highlighted britain 's continued role in afghanistan , where the uk has 9,500 troops deployed , and relations with pakistan as areas of prime importance .
he added that britain would continue to back a two-state solution in the middle east and pursue a dual approach of " engagement and sanctions " in regard to iran , while backing current moves in the united nations to tighten punitive measures .
prime minister david cameron recently called on the international community to " ratchet up " pressure on tehran through sanctions in a bid to prevent the islamic republic pursuing what the west suspects is a nuclear weapons program .
britain stands more chance of success with eu , say experts " britain 's global policy is going to be shaped by the events which happen during the lifespan of this coalition , " klau said .
" will we see a clear break from labour policies on climate change , financial regulation , iran and the middle east ?
not necessarily .
the middle east in particular was a high priority for blair and this will be the same for cameron . "
" whether this ambitious britain can make a meaningful contribution with global resonance outside of the eu is another matter , " he added .
" all major eu powers must recognise that there 's not much governments can do when they act alone .
the chances of success are low when their efforts are not within the framework of a joint eu initiative .
the best they can hope for is a photo opportunity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say britain can achieve more with the eu than without almut moeller , head of the alfred von oppenheim centre for european policy studies at the german council on foreign relations , agrees that it is impossible for any state to work individually with success on global issues without being part of a framework .
but she believes that britain could actually benefit from being more involved with the eu at this time , not less .
" this is actually a really good opportunity for britain to become more engaged in european policies , " moeller told deutsche welle .
" there is a will to cooperate and a consensus that it makes sense to work together so if the british want pursue certain goals and shape european policies , especially in security and defence issues , then this is the right time .
there are a number of security and defence issues within the lisbon treaty which have stalled and there are no discussions being taken on these .
britain could give these and other policies which are lacking leadership the impetus they need . "

to keep it up against serbia , manuel neuer will have to keep things tidy in goal . manuel neuer 's career is stuck in fast-forward .
the goalkeeper was just 20 when he deposed seasoned no.1 frank rost between the sticks at schalke .
at the age of 21 , he was the penalty-saving hero as his hometown club found itself in the champions league quarter-finals .
last summer , he was part of the germany under-21 team that won the european championships .

hague said relations with washington would be " solid but not slavish " and pointedly omitted any reference to the phrase " special relationship " which has been a staple in statements referring to ties between the uk and the united states .
while attempting to distance britain from the image of being the " poodle " of successive us governments , hague 's " vision of a new , distinctive british foreign policy " did not suggest that europe would be the main beneficiary of the new government 's change of direction on the world stage .
instead of turning its attention to the power base of european politics across the water , hague said britain would develop its own identity and strategic role , following a new foreign-policy agenda which would differ in its " reach and ambition " from that pursued by the previous labour governments .
as well as confirming that britain would not join the euro-zone over the next five years of the new parliament , hague - a well-known eurosceptic - rejected ideas of further and deeper political union with brussels and instead announced the government 's desire for " freeing up the single market to boost economic growth . "
hague says britain will stay out eu 's financial structures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hague said that britain would stay out of eu financial affairs britain , hague said , would not be contributing to the financial assistance offered to the beleaguered economies of the euro-zone in the foreseeable future as it would be " difficult at a time of economic constraint . "
however , while distancing britain from the eu , hague said that his government would like the eu to " use its collective weight more effectively on the world stage . "
" in terms of joining the euro zone and keeping out of the bailout operations , this shows continuity with labour 's views on these topics , " thomas klau , head of the paris office of the european council for foreign relations and an eu expert , told deutsche welle .
" what cameron and hague have shown so far in europe , and indeed in washington , is that continuity is set to prevail over radical change . "
" earlier fears that a tory or tory-liberal coalition government would usher in an era of clashes with the eu so far hav n't materialised , " he added .
" this is largely down to the liberals ' inclusion in the coalition and the tories making it clear they wo n't be stepping into margaret thatcher 's shoes and waving her handbag about .
they may be talking tough on the eu but it does n't represent a huge shift away from polices labour adopted under tony blair . "
" in terms of questioning the eu 's role in the world , there was some concern that the tories would set up in opposition to the lisbon treaty and try to undermine the eu 's regulations governing its operations abroad , " klau said .
" there were even fears that they would be down right hostile to this but again , there has been little indication as yet that this will be the case .
hague has said that the eu should have a crucial role in certain areas , especially dealing with non-eu members , specifically russia .
so this policy announcement did n't really include anything worrying or shocking for the eu . "
with the eu kept at arms length and the cosiness of former relations with the us reduced to a firm handshake , the new british foreign policy agenda focuses heavily on london 's ambition to make its influence felt on the world stage . new emphasis on taking lead on global issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan and the middle east are priorities for britain rejecting ideas that britain was in strategic and influential decline , hague targeted increased engagement and cooperation with the emerging economies in the world and deepening of relations with countries in the gulf and the middle east , along with brazil , japan , india and china .
foreign engagement would " run through the veins of the entire administration , " hague said , announcing the creation of a newly-established national security council which would ensure that the " new philosophy will be translated into action . "
hague highlighted britain 's continued role in afghanistan , where the uk has 9,500 troops deployed , and relations with pakistan as areas of prime importance .
he added that britain would continue to back a two-state solution in the middle east and pursue a dual approach of " engagement and sanctions " in regard to iran , while backing current moves in the united nations to tighten punitive measures .
prime minister david cameron recently called on the international community to " ratchet up " pressure on tehran through sanctions in a bid to prevent the islamic republic pursuing what the west suspects is a nuclear weapons program .
britain stands more chance of success with eu , say experts " britain 's global policy is going to be shaped by the events which happen during the lifespan of this coalition , " klau said .
" will we see a clear break from labour policies on climate change , financial regulation , iran and the middle east ?
not necessarily .
the middle east in particular was a high priority for blair and this will be the same for cameron . "
" whether this ambitious britain can make a meaningful contribution with global resonance outside of the eu is another matter , " he added .
" all major eu powers must recognise that there 's not much governments can do when they act alone .
the chances of success are low when their efforts are not within the framework of a joint eu initiative .
the best they can hope for is a photo opportunity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say britain can achieve more with the eu than without almut moeller , head of the alfred von oppenheim centre for european policy studies at the german council on foreign relations , agrees that it is impossible for any state to work individually with success on global issues without being part of a framework .
but she believes that britain could actually benefit from being more involved with the eu at this time , not less .
" this is actually a really good opportunity for britain to become more engaged in european policies , " moeller told deutsche welle .
" there is a will to cooperate and a consensus that it makes sense to work together so if the british want pursue certain goals and shape european policies , especially in security and defence issues , then this is the right time .
there are a number of security and defence issues within the lisbon treaty which have stalled and there are no discussions being taken on these .
britain could give these and other policies which are lacking leadership the impetus they need . "

be proud . "
hundreds of foreign residents in russia are victims of violent right-wing extremism every year .
authorities are taking the problem seriously , but xenophobic attitudes are widespread in russian society . on an outdoor court at the university of vladivostok , a group of chinese exchange students are dribbling and shooting hoops in their own corner around a single net , separate from their russian counterparts .
here on the russian pacific coast , these exchange students are only 60 kilometers away from their home country , and yet russia does not feel like home to them .
" they 're afraid for their safety , " one russian student told deutsche welle .
" that 's why they spend entire days here and at the student residences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students usually only leave their dorms in vladivostok in groups when these exchange students do venture into town beyond the safe bubble of their dormitory , lecture halls and the basketball courts , then they only go in groups .
always on guard right-wing extremists in vladivostok have become more active in recent years , stoked by local mistrust of russia 's up-and-coming neighbor china as well as by worries about a weak economy and more foreigners coming into the country .
one chinese student in vladivostok told deutsche welle about her boyfriend 's encounter with a gang of thugs .
" about ten guys broke his nose , " she said .
" just like that , without saying anything . "
the young man ran away from his attackers , but according to his girlfriend , he was n't safe again until he was back at the university .
according to the sova center in moscow , an organization that researches racism and xenophobia , last year in russia around 70 people were killed in racially motivated attacks , while more than 300 were injured .
the center says that moscow and st. petersburg are especially dangerous places for central asians and people from the caucasus .
however , the situation has improved and those numbers have fallen by a third since 2008 .
police and judges are now taking the matter more seriously , according to the center 's director , alexander verkhovsky .
he says special police forces have been established to tackle right-wing extremism and that they have made several arrests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander verkhovsky is director of the anti-racist sova center in moscow a shock for the kremlin however , it took russian authorities some time to recognize the danger of right-wing radicals .
for years , critics of the kremlin felt that the government was more accommodating to extremist nationalists than it was to the country 's democratic opposition .
a turning point came in 2006 when extremists led a deadly pogrom against caucasian-owned businesses and restaurants in the small city of kondopoga , in russia 's northwest karelia region .
according to verkhovsky , it was only when the kremlin realized that it had lost control over kondopoga for a day that the kremlin started taking extremist nationalists seriously .
" it greatly alarmed the government , " said verkhovsky , who said the kremlin saw the event as " a political threat . "
still waters run deep verkhovsky told deutsche welle that the kremlin 's fight against racism has deeper roots than a push to secure power .
according to him , the nation 's authoritarian political climate has made open discussion of the topic taboo .
based on the silence of politicians , he said , many extremists have felt that russian society was on their side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china looms on vladivostok 's horizon " those who are out killing people feel they are pioneering a people 's movement , " he said .
in fact , extremist ideas are deeply anchored in the mindset of russian society .
according to some surveys , 55 percent of russians want to see foreign residents – especially those from central asia or the caucasus – stripped of their rights or even deported , and this , despite the fact that the russian economy depends on the cheap labor of people from these countries .
at the basketball court in vladivostok where chinese exchange students take refuge , many native students are certain that pacific russia 's economic prosperity depends on china .

be proud . "
hundreds of foreign residents in russia are victims of violent right-wing extremism every year .
authorities are taking the problem seriously , but xenophobic attitudes are widespread in russian society . on an outdoor court at the university of vladivostok , a group of chinese exchange students are dribbling and shooting hoops in their own corner around a single net , separate from their russian counterparts .
here on the russian pacific coast , these exchange students are only 60 kilometers away from their home country , and yet russia does not feel like home to them .
" they 're afraid for their safety , " one russian student told deutsche welle .
" that 's why they spend entire days here and at the student residences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students usually only leave their dorms in vladivostok in groups when these exchange students do venture into town beyond the safe bubble of their dormitory , lecture halls and the basketball courts , then they only go in groups .
always on guard right-wing extremists in vladivostok have become more active in recent years , stoked by local mistrust of russia 's up-and-coming neighbor china as well as by worries about a weak economy and more foreigners coming into the country .
one chinese student in vladivostok told deutsche welle about her boyfriend 's encounter with a gang of thugs .
" about ten guys broke his nose , " she said .
" just like that , without saying anything . "
the young man ran away from his attackers , but according to his girlfriend , he was n't safe again until he was back at the university .
according to the sova center in moscow , an organization that researches racism and xenophobia , last year in russia around 70 people were killed in racially motivated attacks , while more than 300 were injured .
the center says that moscow and st. petersburg are especially dangerous places for central asians and people from the caucasus .
however , the situation has improved and those numbers have fallen by a third since 2008 .
police and judges are now taking the matter more seriously , according to the center 's director , alexander verkhovsky .
he says special police forces have been established to tackle right-wing extremism and that they have made several arrests .

laws , whose job had been to oversee cuts to public spending , stood down over expenses revelations . cabinet minister david laws has stepped down from his high-ranking position in britain 's financial ministry after only 18 day in office , following revelations about expenses and his private life .
laws , a member of the liberal democrat party , resigned from his position as chief secretary to the treasury after the daily telegraph newspaper reported he had claimed more than 40,000 pounds -lrb- 47,100 euros , $ 57,800 -rrb- in expenses to pay rent to his long-term male partner .
" i do not see how i can carry out my crucial work on the budget and spending review while i have to deal with the private and public implications of recent revelations , ” laws said in a statement on saturday .
the millionaire former banker said he had not disclosed the financial arrangement due to his " desire to keep my sexuality a secret . "
he said he had not considered himself in breach of rules on expenses because he and his partner , lobbyist james lundie , had separate bank accounts and led separate social lives .
public spending cuts in his position at the finance ministry , laws was deputy to chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- george osborne .
the pair were overseeing tough austerity cuts aimed at reducing britain 's budget deficit , which stands at about 156 billion pounds , exceeding 11 percent of gross domestic product .
the british government last week agreed to immediate spending cuts totaling some 6 billion pounds .
the resignation is an early blow for britain 's first coalition government for 65 years , formed between britain 's conservative and liberal democrat parties .
conservative prime minister david cameron called laws ' decision " honorable . "
the liberal democrat leader , deputy prime minister nick clegg , said laws had taken a " very painful decision . " rc / reuters / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the british oil giant has said it will try a new strategy to stop the leak , but it wo n't be put into place for 4-7 days . bp has said that its " top kill " strategy for plugging a ruptured well that is gushing oil into the gulf of mexico has failed .
efforts by engineers to pump drilling fluid into the leaking well head in order to smother the gushing crude failed , but bp officials said they did n't know why .
" we do n't know that for certain , " bp chief operations officer doug suttles told a press briefing , adding that " we were unable to sustainably overcome the flow . "
the british oil giant has said it will resort to a new strategy to try to top the leak , but it wo n't be put into place for almost a week . the news of the failure was a blow to residents around the gulf coast , whose communities are still recovering from the 2005 hurricane katrina and now have to contend with oil invading fragile marshlands and waters vital to wildlife and the region 's lucrative commercial fishing industry .
louisiana 's plaquemines parish president billy nungesser was about to address a crowd when he got news of the top kill failure .
" i did n't have the heart to tell them it did n't work , " he told broadcaster cnn .

officials in the us state of louisiana , which has been badly effected by the spill , have called on bp to create a 300-million-dollar fund to mitigate the immediate and long-term impact of the spill on businesses and local residents .
state agencies also sent a letter to bp seeking 372 million euros -lrb- $ 457 million -rrb- for a food-safety fund , warning that " the future of this industry is in peril .

they have promised severe budget cuts to trim the country 's growing deficit . what a difference a day makes .
for the past six months , the center-left social democrats - led by the abrasive jiri paroubek - had been riding high in the opinion polls , heading for what most surveys predicted would be a clear victory : 30 percent , maybe more .
on the actual day , though , it was rather different .
and on sunday , czechs woke to the prospect of having the strongest government in years after one of the biggest political shake-ups since czechoslovakia split in 1993 .
pyrrhic victory there were gasps of surprise at the party 's lidovy dum headquarters on saturday when czech television released exit polls showing the social democrats tied in first place with the civic democrats , both at 20 percent .
but surprise turned to despair as the results came in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democratic party chairman jiri paroubek , resigned after the vote results came in in the end , paroubek 's party scored 22 percent - still the largest party , but a pyrrhic victory if ever there was one .
paroubek resigned almost immediately , conceding it was clear the country was heading for a center-right coalition .
plans to create a minority social democrat adminstration propped up by the communist party lay in tatters .
voters , it appears , had rejected his plans to tax the rich and preserve generous social benefits .
" it seems that people have chosen the direction the country should go in and it is a different direction than the one the social democrats were offering , ” paroubek told reporters , his new wife standing by his side .
czech media reported that waiters at the lidovy dum later circulated with trays of champagne bought to celebrate victory .
no one would touch them .
avoiding greek-style crisis across town , however , the champagne corks were popping at the headquarters of two brand new parliamentary parties : top09 , which was formed out of disgruntled civic democrat and christian democrat members and led by the aristocrat karel schwarzenberg ; and public affairs , a rather mysterious centrist party promoting direct democracy and promising to wage war on corruption .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top09 chairman karel schwarzenberg they came out of nowhere and now control a third of the seats in parliament .

" czech voters have rejected demogoguery , rejected the extremists , and have given their votes to us , who did n't promise them anything but who gave them a clear vision of the future . "
that vision is built on fiscal responsibility – slashing public spending to reduce the czech republic 's debt and reforming key expenditures such as pensions and healthcare .
a slap for civic democrats schwarzenberg is already holding talks with the man most likely to become prime minister – petr necas , the interim leader of the conservative civic democrats .
they came second in the poll but unlike the social democrats , they have the potential to put together a majority center-right coalition and will lead efforts to form a new government , together with the centrist public affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech voters chose a path of fiscal responsibility , analysts say but even though the civic democrats - founded in 1991 by vaclav klaus , now president - will play a leading role in the new government , it was not a great election for the party .

" the voters – especially in prague – did n't just wave a warning finger at us .

be proud . "
hundreds of foreign residents in russia are victims of violent right-wing extremism every year .
authorities are taking the problem seriously , but xenophobic attitudes are widespread in russian society . on an outdoor court at the university of vladivostok , a group of chinese exchange students are dribbling and shooting hoops in their own corner around a single net , separate from their russian counterparts .
here on the russian pacific coast , these exchange students are only 60 kilometers away from their home country , and yet russia does not feel like home to them .
" they 're afraid for their safety , " one russian student told deutsche welle .
" that 's why they spend entire days here and at the student residences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students usually only leave their dorms in vladivostok in groups when these exchange students do venture into town beyond the safe bubble of their dormitory , lecture halls and the basketball courts , then they only go in groups .
always on guard right-wing extremists in vladivostok have become more active in recent years , stoked by local mistrust of russia 's up-and-coming neighbor china as well as by worries about a weak economy and more foreigners coming into the country .
one chinese student in vladivostok told deutsche welle about her boyfriend 's encounter with a gang of thugs .
" about ten guys broke his nose , " she said .
" just like that , without saying anything . "
the young man ran away from his attackers , but according to his girlfriend , he was n't safe again until he was back at the university .
according to the sova center in moscow , an organization that researches racism and xenophobia , last year in russia around 70 people were killed in racially motivated attacks , while more than 300 were injured .
the center says that moscow and st. petersburg are especially dangerous places for central asians and people from the caucasus .
however , the situation has improved and those numbers have fallen by a third since 2008 .
police and judges are now taking the matter more seriously , according to the center 's director , alexander verkhovsky .
he says special police forces have been established to tackle right-wing extremism and that they have made several arrests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander verkhovsky is director of the anti-racist sova center in moscow a shock for the kremlin however , it took russian authorities some time to recognize the danger of right-wing radicals .
for years , critics of the kremlin felt that the government was more accommodating to extremist nationalists than it was to the country 's democratic opposition .
a turning point came in 2006 when extremists led a deadly pogrom against caucasian-owned businesses and restaurants in the small city of kondopoga , in russia 's northwest karelia region .
according to verkhovsky , it was only when the kremlin realized that it had lost control over kondopoga for a day that the kremlin started taking extremist nationalists seriously .
" it greatly alarmed the government , " said verkhovsky , who said the kremlin saw the event as " a political threat . "
still waters run deep verkhovsky told deutsche welle that the kremlin 's fight against racism has deeper roots than a push to secure power .
according to him , the nation 's authoritarian political climate has made open discussion of the topic taboo .
based on the silence of politicians , he said , many extremists have felt that russian society was on their side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china looms on vladivostok 's horizon " those who are out killing people feel they are pioneering a people 's movement , " he said .
in fact , extremist ideas are deeply anchored in the mindset of russian society .
according to some surveys , 55 percent of russians want to see foreign residents – especially those from central asia or the caucasus – stripped of their rights or even deported , and this , despite the fact that the russian economy depends on the cheap labor of people from these countries .
at the basketball court in vladivostok where chinese exchange students take refuge , many native students are certain that pacific russia 's economic prosperity depends on china .

red bull team mates sebastian vettel and mark webber crashed while fighting for the lead ; vettel retired , webber salvaged third place . mclaren 's pair of british world champions could scarcely believe their luck in istanbul , when an inter-team crash ahead of them left them with an easy one-two finish at the turkish grand prix .
red bull 's mark webber was leading at roughly two-thirds race distance , ahead of german team mate sebastian vettel , with the mclarens pressuring behind in third and fourth places .
then the red bull duo evidently forgot motor sport 's golden rule : never take out your team mate .
vettel tried an ambitious overtaking maneuver on webber 's red bull , and the pair collided .
the german retired immediately , while webber had to pit for repairs and finished up in third place .
" it 's stupid between team mates , but i should have been given the necessary space , " vettel lamented in the pit lane after retiring , blaming webber for the collision .
" it was a disaster , " webber said afterwards , although he did n't share vettel 's interpretation of the crash .
" it can happen .
he had a slight speed advantage , but he turned right into me and made contact and … well , that was it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel 's car was ruined in the crash , webber managed to limp home the crash was the latest in a string of problems that have stopped red bull , whose car still seems the class of the field , from converting their pace into results .
" all we ask for " after the crash , mclaren 's british world champions hamilton and button had their own wheel-to-wheel battle for the lead , but they managed to keep it fairly clean , with only minimal contact between the pair .
hamilton watched the red bull crash from his cockpit , saying it was " like an action movie in 3d .
" i do n't know what happened , " he said in the winner 's press conference , " but they collided and we got past them , and then we had a bit of a battle - a fair one , i must say - before the end . "
button , who succeeded hamilton as world champion in 2009 , also complemented his team mate for keeping the battle between them clean .
meanwhile , a disappointed red bull team boss christian horner also offered indirect praise to the mclaren duo , saying he wished his drivers had shown similar restraint under pressure .
" we saw lewis -lrb- hamilton -rrb- and jenson -lrb- button -rrb- racing each other and giving each other space .
that 's all we ask for , " he said .
schumacher 's best of the season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : normally strong , ferrari had a difficult day in the mid-field returning seven-time champion michael schumacher finished in fourth for mercedes , with his german team mate nico rosberg glued to his gearbox in fifth .
fourth position is the best result of 2010 for schumacher , who is still looking for his first podium finish since launching a comeback this season .
the two mercedes drivers managed to keep the hard-charging renault of robert kubica at bay throughout the race , but lacked the pace to challenge the leaders .
adrian sutil finished ninth for force india , behind the ferraris of felipe massa and fernando alonso , meaning that three of the six germans on the grid scored points in turkey .
in the race for the world championship , third place was enough to maintain mark webber 's lead in the standings , but the mclaren duo of button and hamilton are close behind .
vettel 's retirement means he drops to fifth in the standings , behind ferrari 's fernando alonso .
but vettel , webber , and red bull will all be wondering how large their leads over the competition might have been , had the first seven races of the season ran more smoothly .

red bull team mates sebastian vettel and mark webber crashed while fighting for the lead ; vettel retired , webber salvaged third place . mclaren 's pair of british world champions could scarcely believe their luck in istanbul , when an inter-team crash ahead of them left them with an easy one-two finish at the turkish grand prix .
red bull 's mark webber was leading at roughly two-thirds race distance , ahead of german team mate sebastian vettel , with the mclarens pressuring behind in third and fourth places .
then the red bull duo evidently forgot motor sport 's golden rule : never take out your team mate .
vettel tried an ambitious overtaking maneuver on webber 's red bull , and the pair collided .
the german retired immediately , while webber had to pit for repairs and finished up in third place .
" it 's stupid between team mates , but i should have been given the necessary space , " vettel lamented in the pit lane after retiring , blaming webber for the collision .
" it was a disaster , " webber said afterwards , although he did n't share vettel 's interpretation of the crash .
" it can happen .
he had a slight speed advantage , but he turned right into me and made contact and … well , that was it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel 's car was ruined in the crash , webber managed to limp home the crash was the latest in a string of problems that have stopped red bull , whose car still seems the class of the field , from converting their pace into results .
" all we ask for " after the crash , mclaren 's british world champions hamilton and button had their own wheel-to-wheel battle for the lead , but they managed to keep it fairly clean , with only minimal contact between the pair .
hamilton watched the red bull crash from his cockpit , saying it was " like an action movie in 3d .
" i do n't know what happened , " he said in the winner 's press conference , " but they collided and we got past them , and then we had a bit of a battle - a fair one , i must say - before the end . "
button , who succeeded hamilton as world champion in 2009 , also complemented his team mate for keeping the battle between them clean .
meanwhile , a disappointed red bull team boss christian horner also offered indirect praise to the mclaren duo , saying he wished his drivers had shown similar restraint under pressure .
" we saw lewis -lrb- hamilton -rrb- and jenson -lrb- button -rrb- racing each other and giving each other space .
that 's all we ask for , " he said .
schumacher 's best of the season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : normally strong , ferrari had a difficult day in the mid-field returning seven-time champion michael schumacher finished in fourth for mercedes , with his german team mate nico rosberg glued to his gearbox in fifth .
fourth position is the best result of 2010 for schumacher , who is still looking for his first podium finish since launching a comeback this season .
the two mercedes drivers managed to keep the hard-charging renault of robert kubica at bay throughout the race , but lacked the pace to challenge the leaders .
adrian sutil finished ninth for force india , behind the ferraris of felipe massa and fernando alonso , meaning that three of the six germans on the grid scored points in turkey .
in the race for the world championship , third place was enough to maintain mark webber 's lead in the standings , but the mclaren duo of button and hamilton are close behind .
vettel 's retirement means he drops to fifth in the standings , behind ferrari 's fernando alonso .
but vettel , webber , and red bull will all be wondering how large their leads over the competition might have been , had the first seven races of the season ran more smoothly .

the 27-year-old central defender , who has 19 caps , played a crucial role in schalke 's failed push for the bundesliga title this season , cementing himself as a regular in the national team in the process .
" naturally i am devastated because it was my big goal to take part in the world cup , " said westermann .
" i felt fully fit but now the only thing left for me to do is to wish the team all the best at the tournament . "
bildunterschrift : torn ankle ligaments have already sidelined captain michael ballack five down , 23 required westermann is the fifth german player to be ruled out of the world cup with injury in a matter of weeks .
captain michael ballack is out with an ankle ligament injury , with fellow midfielders christian traesch and simon rolfes also unable to represent their country .
first choice goalkeeper rene adler 's broken ribs mean that westermann 's schalke team mate , manuel neuer , will wear the number one shirt in south africa .
both adler and neuer are relatively new to international soccer , after the tragic suicide of former first choice goalie robert enke late last year .

to keep it up against serbia , manuel neuer will have to keep things tidy in goal . manuel neuer 's career is stuck in fast-forward .
the goalkeeper was just 20 when he deposed seasoned no.1 frank rost between the sticks at schalke .
at the age of 21 , he was the penalty-saving hero as his hometown club found itself in the champions league quarter-finals .
last summer , he was part of the germany under-21 team that won the european championships .
and now this summer he 's been trusted with keeping goal for the full side at the world cup .
" i feel ready for the task , " neuer told sport bild newspaper before the tournament .
jens lehmann is among those who are n't as sure .
" if we want to be world champions , it would be difficult to imagine it with manuel neuer as our number one goalkeeper , " the former national ' keeper told bild .
" he has made mistakes over and over again .
but i do like neuer , he will make a good goalkeeper one day . "
whether that day has yet come is something that will become clear as the tournament progresses - but neuer himself seems to have no problem with lehmann ’ s comments - time and again , he names the former arsenal man as one of his idols .
bildunterschrift : the world cup will be another leap forward for the schalke man all the tools in his locker neuer has just six international caps to date , and coming into the tournament none of them had been in competitive games .
he made his debut less than a year ago , impressing against the united arab emirates .
but he was at fault for ivory coast 's first goal in a friendly in november 2009 , his clearance bouncing off emmanuel eboue and into the goal .
picked for germany 's recent world cup warm-up against with malta , he had a quiet evening , but stayed alert enough to make one superb save and deny roderick briffa .
the hallmark of a top-level goalkeeper .
therein lies the frustration many feel with neuer 's ability .
he is an unrivalled shot-stopper , but prone to costly lapses in concentration .
he might grow out of it , he 's only 24 .
neuer is a one-club man , born in gelsenkirchen and on the books at schalke since the age of five .
he got his chance in the first-team early in the 2006-07 season , and has n't relinquished the position since .
" it all happened so fast , there was no time to think about the whole situation , " said the young keeper .
in his second season as no.1 he made two point-blank saves in normal time , and two more in the penalty shoot-out , to drop fc porto and win schalke a place in the last eight of the champions league .
he finished this season in confident fashion with a penalty save against bundesliga rivals mainz , showing a penalty-stopping specialism that augurs well with tournament football approaching .
neuer , who stands at around 195cm -lrb- 6 ' 5 " -rrb- , is both imposing and agile .
germany would do well to use his strong throw to launch quick counter attacks , as schalke have done to good effect .
involvement in several contentious incidents in last september 's ruhr derby against dortmund shows a feisty side to his character .
moreover , neuer is a commanding figure for the defenders in front of him .
it 's an important consideration for national coach joachim loew , with the gloves of lehmann - not to mention greats like oliver kahn and toni schumacher - still to be filled .

hague said relations with washington would be " solid but not slavish " and pointedly omitted any reference to the phrase " special relationship " which has been a staple in statements referring to ties between the uk and the united states .
while attempting to distance britain from the image of being the " poodle " of successive us governments , hague 's " vision of a new , distinctive british foreign policy " did not suggest that europe would be the main beneficiary of the new government 's change of direction on the world stage .
instead of turning its attention to the power base of european politics across the water , hague said britain would develop its own identity and strategic role , following a new foreign-policy agenda which would differ in its " reach and ambition " from that pursued by the previous labour governments .
as well as confirming that britain would not join the euro-zone over the next five years of the new parliament , hague - a well-known eurosceptic - rejected ideas of further and deeper political union with brussels and instead announced the government 's desire for " freeing up the single market to boost economic growth . "
hague says britain will stay out eu 's financial structures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hague said that britain would stay out of eu financial affairs britain , hague said , would not be contributing to the financial assistance offered to the beleaguered economies of the euro-zone in the foreseeable future as it would be " difficult at a time of economic constraint . "
however , while distancing britain from the eu , hague said that his government would like the eu to " use its collective weight more effectively on the world stage . "
" in terms of joining the euro zone and keeping out of the bailout operations , this shows continuity with labour 's views on these topics , " thomas klau , head of the paris office of the european council for foreign relations and an eu expert , told deutsche welle .
" what cameron and hague have shown so far in europe , and indeed in washington , is that continuity is set to prevail over radical change . "
" earlier fears that a tory or tory-liberal coalition government would usher in an era of clashes with the eu so far hav n't materialised , " he added .
" this is largely down to the liberals ' inclusion in the coalition and the tories making it clear they wo n't be stepping into margaret thatcher 's shoes and waving her handbag about .
they may be talking tough on the eu but it does n't represent a huge shift away from polices labour adopted under tony blair . "
" in terms of questioning the eu 's role in the world , there was some concern that the tories would set up in opposition to the lisbon treaty and try to undermine the eu 's regulations governing its operations abroad , " klau said .
" there were even fears that they would be down right hostile to this but again , there has been little indication as yet that this will be the case .
hague has said that the eu should have a crucial role in certain areas , especially dealing with non-eu members , specifically russia .
so this policy announcement did n't really include anything worrying or shocking for the eu . "
with the eu kept at arms length and the cosiness of former relations with the us reduced to a firm handshake , the new british foreign policy agenda focuses heavily on london 's ambition to make its influence felt on the world stage . new emphasis on taking lead on global issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan and the middle east are priorities for britain rejecting ideas that britain was in strategic and influential decline , hague targeted increased engagement and cooperation with the emerging economies in the world and deepening of relations with countries in the gulf and the middle east , along with brazil , japan , india and china .
foreign engagement would " run through the veins of the entire administration , " hague said , announcing the creation of a newly-established national security council which would ensure that the " new philosophy will be translated into action . "
hague highlighted britain 's continued role in afghanistan , where the uk has 9,500 troops deployed , and relations with pakistan as areas of prime importance .
he added that britain would continue to back a two-state solution in the middle east and pursue a dual approach of " engagement and sanctions " in regard to iran , while backing current moves in the united nations to tighten punitive measures .
prime minister david cameron recently called on the international community to " ratchet up " pressure on tehran through sanctions in a bid to prevent the islamic republic pursuing what the west suspects is a nuclear weapons program .
britain stands more chance of success with eu , say experts " britain 's global policy is going to be shaped by the events which happen during the lifespan of this coalition , " klau said .
" will we see a clear break from labour policies on climate change , financial regulation , iran and the middle east ?
not necessarily .
the middle east in particular was a high priority for blair and this will be the same for cameron . "
" whether this ambitious britain can make a meaningful contribution with global resonance outside of the eu is another matter , " he added .
" all major eu powers must recognise that there 's not much governments can do when they act alone .
the chances of success are low when their efforts are not within the framework of a joint eu initiative .
the best they can hope for is a photo opportunity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say britain can achieve more with the eu than without almut moeller , head of the alfred von oppenheim centre for european policy studies at the german council on foreign relations , agrees that it is impossible for any state to work individually with success on global issues without being part of a framework .
but she believes that britain could actually benefit from being more involved with the eu at this time , not less .
" this is actually a really good opportunity for britain to become more engaged in european policies , " moeller told deutsche welle .
" there is a will to cooperate and a consensus that it makes sense to work together so if the british want pursue certain goals and shape european policies , especially in security and defence issues , then this is the right time .
there are a number of security and defence issues within the lisbon treaty which have stalled and there are no discussions being taken on these .
britain could give these and other policies which are lacking leadership the impetus they need . "

laws , whose job had been to oversee cuts to public spending , stood down over expenses revelations . cabinet minister david laws has stepped down from his high-ranking position in britain 's financial ministry after only 18 day in office , following revelations about expenses and his private life .
laws , a member of the liberal democrat party , resigned from his position as chief secretary to the treasury after the daily telegraph newspaper reported he had claimed more than 40,000 pounds -lrb- 47,100 euros , $ 57,800 -rrb- in expenses to pay rent to his long-term male partner .
" i do not see how i can carry out my crucial work on the budget and spending review while i have to deal with the private and public implications of recent revelations , ” laws said in a statement on saturday .
the millionaire former banker said he had not disclosed the financial arrangement due to his " desire to keep my sexuality a secret . "
he said he had not considered himself in breach of rules on expenses because he and his partner , lobbyist james lundie , had separate bank accounts and led separate social lives .
public spending cuts in his position at the finance ministry , laws was deputy to chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- george osborne .
the pair were overseeing tough austerity cuts aimed at reducing britain 's budget deficit , which stands at about 156 billion pounds , exceeding 11 percent of gross domestic product .
the british government last week agreed to immediate spending cuts totaling some 6 billion pounds .
the resignation is an early blow for britain 's first coalition government for 65 years , formed between britain 's conservative and liberal democrat parties .
conservative prime minister david cameron called laws ' decision " honorable . "
the liberal democrat leader , deputy prime minister nick clegg , said laws had taken a " very painful decision . " rc / reuters / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

laws , whose job had been to oversee cuts to public spending , stood down over expenses revelations . cabinet minister david laws has stepped down from his high-ranking position in britain 's financial ministry after only 18 day in office , following revelations about expenses and his private life .
laws , a member of the liberal democrat party , resigned from his position as chief secretary to the treasury after the daily telegraph newspaper reported he had claimed more than 40,000 pounds -lrb- 47,100 euros , $ 57,800 -rrb- in expenses to pay rent to his long-term male partner .
" i do not see how i can carry out my crucial work on the budget and spending review while i have to deal with the private and public implications of recent revelations , ” laws said in a statement on saturday .
the millionaire former banker said he had not disclosed the financial arrangement due to his " desire to keep my sexuality a secret . "
he said he had not considered himself in breach of rules on expenses because he and his partner , lobbyist james lundie , had separate bank accounts and led separate social lives .
public spending cuts in his position at the finance ministry , laws was deputy to chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- george osborne .
the pair were overseeing tough austerity cuts aimed at reducing britain 's budget deficit , which stands at about 156 billion pounds , exceeding 11 percent of gross domestic product .
the british government last week agreed to immediate spending cuts totaling some 6 billion pounds .
the resignation is an early blow for britain 's first coalition government for 65 years , formed between britain 's conservative and liberal democrat parties .
conservative prime minister david cameron called laws ' decision " honorable . "
the liberal democrat leader , deputy prime minister nick clegg , said laws had taken a " very painful decision . " rc / reuters / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for the past six months , the center-left social democrats - led by the abrasive jiri paroubek - had been riding high in the opinion polls , heading for what most surveys predicted would be a clear victory : 30 percent , maybe more .

and on sunday , czechs woke to the prospect of having the strongest government in years after one of the biggest political shake-ups since czechoslovakia split in 1993 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democratic party chairman jiri paroubek , resigned after the vote results came in in the end , paroubek 's party scored 22 percent - still the largest party , but a pyrrhic victory if ever there was one .
paroubek resigned almost immediately , conceding it was clear the country was heading for a center-right coalition .
plans to create a minority social democrat adminstration propped up by the communist party lay in tatters .
voters , it appears , had rejected his plans to tax the rich and preserve generous social benefits .
" it seems that people have chosen the direction the country should go in and it is a different direction than the one the social democrats were offering , ” paroubek told reporters , his new wife standing by his side .
czech media reported that waiters at the lidovy dum later circulated with trays of champagne bought to celebrate victory .
no one would touch them .
avoiding greek-style crisis across town , however , the champagne corks were popping at the headquarters of two brand new parliamentary parties : top09 , which was formed out of disgruntled civic democrat and christian democrat members and led by the aristocrat karel schwarzenberg ; and public affairs , a rather mysterious centrist party promoting direct democracy and promising to wage war on corruption .

that vision is built on fiscal responsibility – slashing public spending to reduce the czech republic 's debt and reforming key expenditures such as pensions and healthcare .
a slap for civic democrats schwarzenberg is already holding talks with the man most likely to become prime minister – petr necas , the interim leader of the conservative civic democrats .
they came second in the poll but unlike the social democrats , they have the potential to put together a majority center-right coalition and will lead efforts to form a new government , together with the centrist public affairs .

they did particularly poorly in prague - a bastion of civic democrat support since the early 1990s .

" there 's not much to celebrate , " civic democrat deputy leader david vodrazka told lidove noviny newspaper .
" the voters – especially in prague – did n't just wave a warning finger at us .

but in many ways his was the real success story of the evening – he had developed a personal animosity towards social democrat leader paroubek .
in the end zeman 's party won 4.3 percent – almost all of them social democrat voters , helping to deprive paroubek of the victory he so craved .

they have promised severe budget cuts to trim the country 's growing deficit . what a difference a day makes .
for the past six months , the center-left social democrats - led by the abrasive jiri paroubek - had been riding high in the opinion polls , heading for what most surveys predicted would be a clear victory : 30 percent , maybe more .
on the actual day , though , it was rather different .
and on sunday , czechs woke to the prospect of having the strongest government in years after one of the biggest political shake-ups since czechoslovakia split in 1993 .
pyrrhic victory there were gasps of surprise at the party 's lidovy dum headquarters on saturday when czech television released exit polls showing the social democrats tied in first place with the civic democrats , both at 20 percent .
but surprise turned to despair as the results came in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democratic party chairman jiri paroubek , resigned after the vote results came in in the end , paroubek 's party scored 22 percent - still the largest party , but a pyrrhic victory if ever there was one .
paroubek resigned almost immediately , conceding it was clear the country was heading for a center-right coalition .
plans to create a minority social democrat adminstration propped up by the communist party lay in tatters .
voters , it appears , had rejected his plans to tax the rich and preserve generous social benefits .
" it seems that people have chosen the direction the country should go in and it is a different direction than the one the social democrats were offering , ” paroubek told reporters , his new wife standing by his side .
czech media reported that waiters at the lidovy dum later circulated with trays of champagne bought to celebrate victory .
no one would touch them .
avoiding greek-style crisis across town , however , the champagne corks were popping at the headquarters of two brand new parliamentary parties : top09 , which was formed out of disgruntled civic democrat and christian democrat members and led by the aristocrat karel schwarzenberg ; and public affairs , a rather mysterious centrist party promoting direct democracy and promising to wage war on corruption .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top09 chairman karel schwarzenberg they came out of nowhere and now control a third of the seats in parliament .
" i 'm hugely pleased with the czech people , " schwarzenberg , whose full title is his serene highness the prince of schwarzenberg , count of sulz , princely landgrave in klettgau , and duke of krumlov .
a former chancellor to ex-president vaclav havel , he 's popular with urban , right-wing voters , and enjoys something of cult status among the young .
" czech voters have rejected demogoguery , rejected the extremists , and have given their votes to us , who did n't promise them anything but who gave them a clear vision of the future . "
that vision is built on fiscal responsibility – slashing public spending to reduce the czech republic 's debt and reforming key expenditures such as pensions and healthcare .
a slap for civic democrats schwarzenberg is already holding talks with the man most likely to become prime minister – petr necas , the interim leader of the conservative civic democrats .
they came second in the poll but unlike the social democrats , they have the potential to put together a majority center-right coalition and will lead efforts to form a new government , together with the centrist public affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech voters chose a path of fiscal responsibility , analysts say but even though the civic democrats - founded in 1991 by vaclav klaus , now president - will play a leading role in the new government , it was not a great election for the party .
they did particularly poorly in prague - a bastion of civic democrat support since the early 1990s .
it used to be said that even vaclav klaus ' tennis racquet could win a seat in prague .
one commentator said that phrase should now be amended : even karel schwarzenberg 's pipe could stand for office and win in the capital , he said .
" there 's not much to celebrate , " civic democrat deputy leader david vodrazka told lidove noviny newspaper .
" the voters – especially in prague – did n't just wave a warning finger at us .
they slapped us round the back of the head . "
day of resignations indeed it was something of an earthquake for czech politics , as voters punished the two big parties - and several smaller ones as well .
paroubek was not the only party leader to resign .
ondrej liska , head of the greens , immediately announced his resignation after his party lost all its seats .
cyril svoboda , leader of the christian democrats , followed suit after his party was unceremoniously kicked out of parliament .
and finally milos zeman – the oafish , heavy drinking former social democrat prime minister known for his brilliant acerbic wit – announced he was resigning after his leftist citizens ' rights party failed to gain enough votes to enter parliament .
but in many ways his was the real success story of the evening – he had developed a personal animosity towards social democrat leader paroubek .
in the end zeman 's party won 4.3 percent – almost all of them social democrat voters , helping to deprive paroubek of the victory he so craved .

red bull 's mark webber was leading at roughly two-thirds race distance , ahead of german team mate sebastian vettel , with the mclarens pressuring behind in third and fourth places .
then the red bull duo evidently forgot motor sport 's golden rule : never take out your team mate .
vettel tried an ambitious overtaking maneuver on webber 's red bull , and the pair collided .
the german retired immediately , while webber had to pit for repairs and finished up in third place .
" it 's stupid between team mates , but i should have been given the necessary space , " vettel lamented in the pit lane after retiring , blaming webber for the collision .

meanwhile , a disappointed red bull team boss christian horner also offered indirect praise to the mclaren duo , saying he wished his drivers had shown similar restraint under pressure .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.05.2010 continuity trumps change as ambitious britain sets foreign policy goals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's tory-liberal coalition wants to lead on global issues britain 's recently elected coalition government announced a set of new and ambitious foreign policy goals this week with a focus on leading - not following - on global issues . britain 's new conservative-liberal coalition government gave the clearest signs yet that the years of slavishly following a policy line drawn by united states were over as foreign secretary william hague announced the uk 's new foreign policy agenda in london on thursday .
hague said relations with washington would be " solid but not slavish " and pointedly omitted any reference to the phrase " special relationship " which has been a staple in statements referring to ties between the uk and the united states .
while attempting to distance britain from the image of being the " poodle " of successive us governments , hague 's " vision of a new , distinctive british foreign policy " did not suggest that europe would be the main beneficiary of the new government 's change of direction on the world stage .
instead of turning its attention to the power base of european politics across the water , hague said britain would develop its own identity and strategic role , following a new foreign-policy agenda which would differ in its " reach and ambition " from that pursued by the previous labour governments .
as well as confirming that britain would not join the euro-zone over the next five years of the new parliament , hague - a well-known eurosceptic - rejected ideas of further and deeper political union with brussels and instead announced the government 's desire for " freeing up the single market to boost economic growth . "
hague says britain will stay out eu 's financial structures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hague said that britain would stay out of eu financial affairs britain , hague said , would not be contributing to the financial assistance offered to the beleaguered economies of the euro-zone in the foreseeable future as it would be " difficult at a time of economic constraint . "
however , while distancing britain from the eu , hague said that his government would like the eu to " use its collective weight more effectively on the world stage . "
" in terms of joining the euro zone and keeping out of the bailout operations , this shows continuity with labour 's views on these topics , " thomas klau , head of the paris office of the european council for foreign relations and an eu expert , told deutsche welle .
" what cameron and hague have shown so far in europe , and indeed in washington , is that continuity is set to prevail over radical change . "
" earlier fears that a tory or tory-liberal coalition government would usher in an era of clashes with the eu so far hav n't materialised , " he added .
" this is largely down to the liberals ' inclusion in the coalition and the tories making it clear they wo n't be stepping into margaret thatcher 's shoes and waving her handbag about .
they may be talking tough on the eu but it does n't represent a huge shift away from polices labour adopted under tony blair . "
" in terms of questioning the eu 's role in the world , there was some concern that the tories would set up in opposition to the lisbon treaty and try to undermine the eu 's regulations governing its operations abroad , " klau said .
" there were even fears that they would be down right hostile to this but again , there has been little indication as yet that this will be the case .
hague has said that the eu should have a crucial role in certain areas , especially dealing with non-eu members , specifically russia .
so this policy announcement did n't really include anything worrying or shocking for the eu . "
with the eu kept at arms length and the cosiness of former relations with the us reduced to a firm handshake , the new british foreign policy agenda focuses heavily on london 's ambition to make its influence felt on the world stage . new emphasis on taking lead on global issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan and the middle east are priorities for britain rejecting ideas that britain was in strategic and influential decline , hague targeted increased engagement and cooperation with the emerging economies in the world and deepening of relations with countries in the gulf and the middle east , along with brazil , japan , india and china .
foreign engagement would " run through the veins of the entire administration , " hague said , announcing the creation of a newly-established national security council which would ensure that the " new philosophy will be translated into action . "
hague highlighted britain 's continued role in afghanistan , where the uk has 9,500 troops deployed , and relations with pakistan as areas of prime importance .
he added that britain would continue to back a two-state solution in the middle east and pursue a dual approach of " engagement and sanctions " in regard to iran , while backing current moves in the united nations to tighten punitive measures .
prime minister david cameron recently called on the international community to " ratchet up " pressure on tehran through sanctions in a bid to prevent the islamic republic pursuing what the west suspects is a nuclear weapons program .
britain stands more chance of success with eu , say experts " britain 's global policy is going to be shaped by the events which happen during the lifespan of this coalition , " klau said .
" will we see a clear break from labour policies on climate change , financial regulation , iran and the middle east ?
not necessarily .
the middle east in particular was a high priority for blair and this will be the same for cameron . "
" whether this ambitious britain can make a meaningful contribution with global resonance outside of the eu is another matter , " he added .
" all major eu powers must recognise that there 's not much governments can do when they act alone .
the chances of success are low when their efforts are not within the framework of a joint eu initiative .
the best they can hope for is a photo opportunity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say britain can achieve more with the eu than without almut moeller , head of the alfred von oppenheim centre for european policy studies at the german council on foreign relations , agrees that it is impossible for any state to work individually with success on global issues without being part of a framework .
but she believes that britain could actually benefit from being more involved with the eu at this time , not less .
" this is actually a really good opportunity for britain to become more engaged in european policies , " moeller told deutsche welle .
" there is a will to cooperate and a consensus that it makes sense to work together so if the british want pursue certain goals and shape european policies , especially in security and defence issues , then this is the right time .
there are a number of security and defence issues within the lisbon treaty which have stalled and there are no discussions being taken on these .
britain could give these and other policies which are lacking leadership the impetus they need . "

red bull team mates sebastian vettel and mark webber crashed while fighting for the lead ; vettel retired , webber salvaged third place . mclaren 's pair of british world champions could scarcely believe their luck in istanbul , when an inter-team crash ahead of them left them with an easy one-two finish at the turkish grand prix .
red bull 's mark webber was leading at roughly two-thirds race distance , ahead of german team mate sebastian vettel , with the mclarens pressuring behind in third and fourth places .
then the red bull duo evidently forgot motor sport 's golden rule : never take out your team mate .
vettel tried an ambitious overtaking maneuver on webber 's red bull , and the pair collided .
the german retired immediately , while webber had to pit for repairs and finished up in third place .
" it 's stupid between team mates , but i should have been given the necessary space , " vettel lamented in the pit lane after retiring , blaming webber for the collision .
" it was a disaster , " webber said afterwards , although he did n't share vettel 's interpretation of the crash .
" it can happen .
he had a slight speed advantage , but he turned right into me and made contact and … well , that was it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel 's car was ruined in the crash , webber managed to limp home the crash was the latest in a string of problems that have stopped red bull , whose car still seems the class of the field , from converting their pace into results .
" all we ask for " after the crash , mclaren 's british world champions hamilton and button had their own wheel-to-wheel battle for the lead , but they managed to keep it fairly clean , with only minimal contact between the pair .
hamilton watched the red bull crash from his cockpit , saying it was " like an action movie in 3d .
" i do n't know what happened , " he said in the winner 's press conference , " but they collided and we got past them , and then we had a bit of a battle - a fair one , i must say - before the end . "
button , who succeeded hamilton as world champion in 2009 , also complemented his team mate for keeping the battle between them clean .
meanwhile , a disappointed red bull team boss christian horner also offered indirect praise to the mclaren duo , saying he wished his drivers had shown similar restraint under pressure .
" we saw lewis -lrb- hamilton -rrb- and jenson -lrb- button -rrb- racing each other and giving each other space .
that 's all we ask for , " he said .
schumacher 's best of the season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : normally strong , ferrari had a difficult day in the mid-field returning seven-time champion michael schumacher finished in fourth for mercedes , with his german team mate nico rosberg glued to his gearbox in fifth .
fourth position is the best result of 2010 for schumacher , who is still looking for his first podium finish since launching a comeback this season .
the two mercedes drivers managed to keep the hard-charging renault of robert kubica at bay throughout the race , but lacked the pace to challenge the leaders .
adrian sutil finished ninth for force india , behind the ferraris of felipe massa and fernando alonso , meaning that three of the six germans on the grid scored points in turkey .
in the race for the world championship , third place was enough to maintain mark webber 's lead in the standings , but the mclaren duo of button and hamilton are close behind .
vettel 's retirement means he drops to fifth in the standings , behind ferrari 's fernando alonso .
but vettel , webber , and red bull will all be wondering how large their leads over the competition might have been , had the first seven races of the season ran more smoothly .

westermann fractured his left foot in saturday evening 's friendly match against hungary . german soccer coach joachim loew must be wondering if he 'll have any healthy players left by the time the world cup begins in south africa next month .
central defender heiko westermann is the latest first-team player to be ruled out of the competition , having fractured his left foot in saturday 's 3-0 friendly win against hungary in budapest .
" heiko would have played a very important role at the world cup for our team .
that is because of his multi-faceted play .
in training he was in superb physical condition , " loew said .
the 27-year-old central defender , who has 19 caps , played a crucial role in schalke 's failed push for the bundesliga title this season , cementing himself as a regular in the national team in the process .
" naturally i am devastated because it was my big goal to take part in the world cup , " said westermann .
" i felt fully fit but now the only thing left for me to do is to wish the team all the best at the tournament . "
bildunterschrift : torn ankle ligaments have already sidelined captain michael ballack five down , 23 required westermann is the fifth german player to be ruled out of the world cup with injury in a matter of weeks .
captain michael ballack is out with an ankle ligament injury , with fellow midfielders christian traesch and simon rolfes also unable to represent their country .
first choice goalkeeper rene adler 's broken ribs mean that westermann 's schalke team mate , manuel neuer , will wear the number one shirt in south africa .
both adler and neuer are relatively new to international soccer , after the tragic suicide of former first choice goalie robert enke late last year .
coach joachim loew , still with one of the strongest squads of any of the 32 world cup competitors at his disposal , must name his final 23-man selection for the competition on tuesday .

topping the list : a historic dance hall . it 's early enough for morning fog to be still hanging above the high ash mountains in the sudetenland - a part of the czech republic annexed by nazi germany in the build-up to the second world war .
despite the early hour , a small group of students has already put in quite a trip to be here .
a mini-bus has brought them along meandering roads , through pine forests and villages that nestle between peaks in the hilly landscape .
at the end of the long drive is an old house in the woods .
it 's made of wood , but apart from the roof and the support beams , not much is left .
it 's just a ruin in the forest , but this group is determined to change that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stained glass cast colorful silhouettes of the dancers from the dance floor " we have tools here : rakes , shovels , brooms - that sort of thing , " says tomas hradil , head of the student group that is working on the house .
" first we 'll make things clean and tidy .
flood waters have washed away the stones , so we have to stack them around the perimeter .
then we 'll give it all a once over with a scythe . "
hradil is in his late thirties , and sports a full , dark beard .
his handshake is strong , but as his students fan out and get to work around him , hradil lets out a sigh and shows he has a soft spot for the ruined building in the woods .
" look around here , there used to be stairs that led up to the top floor , " he says .
" now all you see are the stone foundations .
the wood and all the ornamentation were removed by people over the years and taken back to their own homes . "
a bright stage for dancing when it opened in 1904 , the building was a dance hall in the middle of the forest , and it shone elegantly in its prime .
the outer walls consisted of window frames , filled with colored panes in art nouveau style .
inside was a single large room and a dance floor , and crystal chandeliers hung from the ceiling .
people from the entire area came whenever there was a reason to celebrate .
they were mostly germans , but czechs and poles came as well .
today there 's nothing left of the original building other than the foundation and supports - and the dreams of the students who are working to restore it .
" how magnificent it must have been when these windows still shone with all their colors ! " says one of hradil 's students .
" when they had a party here , and everything was brightly lit , and you could see the silhouettes of the people who were dancing inside , and hear the music outside … " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomas hradil heads the student group ' brontosaurus ' today , shards of the art nouveau windows lie all around the building .
hradil says vandals smashed the glass .
if it were up to him , he would rebuild the whole dance hall , but that project is a bit too big for the time being .
financial limitations keep his group , which calls itself ' brontosaurus , ' from undertaking anything too big .
in the past , old fountains on the hiking path near the spa town of jesenik have been restored , and new nature trails through the mountainous country have been blazed .
now , the student volunteers who come from all over the czech republic on their holidays have their sights set on the old dance hall .
if they ca n't fully reconstruct it , they hope at least to keep it from collapsing .
relics from the past should the project ever reach a point where a full reconstruction is possible , hradil thinks he 'd be able to count on some locals to help in tracking down some of the original contents .
" we 've come to realize that the people who stripped the building of all the valuables have actually done us a service , " says hradil .
" the people did n't want to give the communist regime the satisfaction of getting them .
and now they are contacting us , because they heard we are working on restructuring the hall . "
as word spreads about the project , items from the dance hall are slowly being returned .
little gestures like these are like a small miracle in the sudetenland , which had once been lost and forgotten for decades .

topping the list : a historic dance hall . it 's early enough for morning fog to be still hanging above the high ash mountains in the sudetenland - a part of the czech republic annexed by nazi germany in the build-up to the second world war .
despite the early hour , a small group of students has already put in quite a trip to be here .
a mini-bus has brought them along meandering roads , through pine forests and villages that nestle between peaks in the hilly landscape .
at the end of the long drive is an old house in the woods .
it 's made of wood , but apart from the roof and the support beams , not much is left .
it 's just a ruin in the forest , but this group is determined to change that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stained glass cast colorful silhouettes of the dancers from the dance floor " we have tools here : rakes , shovels , brooms - that sort of thing , " says tomas hradil , head of the student group that is working on the house .
" first we 'll make things clean and tidy .
flood waters have washed away the stones , so we have to stack them around the perimeter .
then we 'll give it all a once over with a scythe . "
hradil is in his late thirties , and sports a full , dark beard .
his handshake is strong , but as his students fan out and get to work around him , hradil lets out a sigh and shows he has a soft spot for the ruined building in the woods .
" look around here , there used to be stairs that led up to the top floor , " he says .
" now all you see are the stone foundations .
the wood and all the ornamentation were removed by people over the years and taken back to their own homes . "
a bright stage for dancing when it opened in 1904 , the building was a dance hall in the middle of the forest , and it shone elegantly in its prime .
the outer walls consisted of window frames , filled with colored panes in art nouveau style .
inside was a single large room and a dance floor , and crystal chandeliers hung from the ceiling .
people from the entire area came whenever there was a reason to celebrate .
they were mostly germans , but czechs and poles came as well .
today there 's nothing left of the original building other than the foundation and supports - and the dreams of the students who are working to restore it .
" how magnificent it must have been when these windows still shone with all their colors ! " says one of hradil 's students .
" when they had a party here , and everything was brightly lit , and you could see the silhouettes of the people who were dancing inside , and hear the music outside … " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomas hradil heads the student group ' brontosaurus ' today , shards of the art nouveau windows lie all around the building .
hradil says vandals smashed the glass .
if it were up to him , he would rebuild the whole dance hall , but that project is a bit too big for the time being .
financial limitations keep his group , which calls itself ' brontosaurus , ' from undertaking anything too big .
in the past , old fountains on the hiking path near the spa town of jesenik have been restored , and new nature trails through the mountainous country have been blazed .
now , the student volunteers who come from all over the czech republic on their holidays have their sights set on the old dance hall .
if they ca n't fully reconstruct it , they hope at least to keep it from collapsing .
relics from the past should the project ever reach a point where a full reconstruction is possible , hradil thinks he 'd be able to count on some locals to help in tracking down some of the original contents .
" we 've come to realize that the people who stripped the building of all the valuables have actually done us a service , " says hradil .

be proud . "
hundreds of foreign residents in russia are victims of violent right-wing extremism every year .
authorities are taking the problem seriously , but xenophobic attitudes are widespread in russian society . on an outdoor court at the university of vladivostok , a group of chinese exchange students are dribbling and shooting hoops in their own corner around a single net , separate from their russian counterparts .
here on the russian pacific coast , these exchange students are only 60 kilometers away from their home country , and yet russia does not feel like home to them .
" they 're afraid for their safety , " one russian student told deutsche welle .
" that 's why they spend entire days here and at the student residences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students usually only leave their dorms in vladivostok in groups when these exchange students do venture into town beyond the safe bubble of their dormitory , lecture halls and the basketball courts , then they only go in groups .
always on guard right-wing extremists in vladivostok have become more active in recent years , stoked by local mistrust of russia 's up-and-coming neighbor china as well as by worries about a weak economy and more foreigners coming into the country .
one chinese student in vladivostok told deutsche welle about her boyfriend 's encounter with a gang of thugs .
" about ten guys broke his nose , " she said .
" just like that , without saying anything . "
the young man ran away from his attackers , but according to his girlfriend , he was n't safe again until he was back at the university .
according to the sova center in moscow , an organization that researches racism and xenophobia , last year in russia around 70 people were killed in racially motivated attacks , while more than 300 were injured .
the center says that moscow and st. petersburg are especially dangerous places for central asians and people from the caucasus .
however , the situation has improved and those numbers have fallen by a third since 2008 .
police and judges are now taking the matter more seriously , according to the center 's director , alexander verkhovsky .
he says special police forces have been established to tackle right-wing extremism and that they have made several arrests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander verkhovsky is director of the anti-racist sova center in moscow a shock for the kremlin however , it took russian authorities some time to recognize the danger of right-wing radicals .
for years , critics of the kremlin felt that the government was more accommodating to extremist nationalists than it was to the country 's democratic opposition .
a turning point came in 2006 when extremists led a deadly pogrom against caucasian-owned businesses and restaurants in the small city of kondopoga , in russia 's northwest karelia region .
according to verkhovsky , it was only when the kremlin realized that it had lost control over kondopoga for a day that the kremlin started taking extremist nationalists seriously .
" it greatly alarmed the government , " said verkhovsky , who said the kremlin saw the event as " a political threat . "
still waters run deep verkhovsky told deutsche welle that the kremlin 's fight against racism has deeper roots than a push to secure power .
according to him , the nation 's authoritarian political climate has made open discussion of the topic taboo .
based on the silence of politicians , he said , many extremists have felt that russian society was on their side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china looms on vladivostok 's horizon " those who are out killing people feel they are pioneering a people 's movement , " he said .
in fact , extremist ideas are deeply anchored in the mindset of russian society .
according to some surveys , 55 percent of russians want to see foreign residents – especially those from central asia or the caucasus – stripped of their rights or even deported , and this , despite the fact that the russian economy depends on the cheap labor of people from these countries .
at the basketball court in vladivostok where chinese exchange students take refuge , many native students are certain that pacific russia 's economic prosperity depends on china .

be proud . "
hundreds of foreign residents in russia are victims of violent right-wing extremism every year .
authorities are taking the problem seriously , but xenophobic attitudes are widespread in russian society . on an outdoor court at the university of vladivostok , a group of chinese exchange students are dribbling and shooting hoops in their own corner around a single net , separate from their russian counterparts .
here on the russian pacific coast , these exchange students are only 60 kilometers away from their home country , and yet russia does not feel like home to them .
" they 're afraid for their safety , " one russian student told deutsche welle .
" that 's why they spend entire days here and at the student residences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students usually only leave their dorms in vladivostok in groups when these exchange students do venture into town beyond the safe bubble of their dormitory , lecture halls and the basketball courts , then they only go in groups .
always on guard right-wing extremists in vladivostok have become more active in recent years , stoked by local mistrust of russia 's up-and-coming neighbor china as well as by worries about a weak economy and more foreigners coming into the country .
one chinese student in vladivostok told deutsche welle about her boyfriend 's encounter with a gang of thugs .
" about ten guys broke his nose , " she said .
" just like that , without saying anything . "
the young man ran away from his attackers , but according to his girlfriend , he was n't safe again until he was back at the university .
according to the sova center in moscow , an organization that researches racism and xenophobia , last year in russia around 70 people were killed in racially motivated attacks , while more than 300 were injured .
the center says that moscow and st. petersburg are especially dangerous places for central asians and people from the caucasus .
however , the situation has improved and those numbers have fallen by a third since 2008 .
police and judges are now taking the matter more seriously , according to the center 's director , alexander verkhovsky .
he says special police forces have been established to tackle right-wing extremism and that they have made several arrests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander verkhovsky is director of the anti-racist sova center in moscow a shock for the kremlin however , it took russian authorities some time to recognize the danger of right-wing radicals .
for years , critics of the kremlin felt that the government was more accommodating to extremist nationalists than it was to the country 's democratic opposition .
a turning point came in 2006 when extremists led a deadly pogrom against caucasian-owned businesses and restaurants in the small city of kondopoga , in russia 's northwest karelia region .
according to verkhovsky , it was only when the kremlin realized that it had lost control over kondopoga for a day that the kremlin started taking extremist nationalists seriously .
" it greatly alarmed the government , " said verkhovsky , who said the kremlin saw the event as " a political threat . "
still waters run deep verkhovsky told deutsche welle that the kremlin 's fight against racism has deeper roots than a push to secure power .
according to him , the nation 's authoritarian political climate has made open discussion of the topic taboo .
based on the silence of politicians , he said , many extremists have felt that russian society was on their side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china looms on vladivostok 's horizon " those who are out killing people feel they are pioneering a people 's movement , " he said .
in fact , extremist ideas are deeply anchored in the mindset of russian society .
according to some surveys , 55 percent of russians want to see foreign residents – especially those from central asia or the caucasus – stripped of their rights or even deported , and this , despite the fact that the russian economy depends on the cheap labor of people from these countries .
at the basketball court in vladivostok where chinese exchange students take refuge , many native students are certain that pacific russia 's economic prosperity depends on china .

laws , whose job had been to oversee cuts to public spending , stood down over expenses revelations . cabinet minister david laws has stepped down from his high-ranking position in britain 's financial ministry after only 18 day in office , following revelations about expenses and his private life .
laws , a member of the liberal democrat party , resigned from his position as chief secretary to the treasury after the daily telegraph newspaper reported he had claimed more than 40,000 pounds -lrb- 47,100 euros , $ 57,800 -rrb- in expenses to pay rent to his long-term male partner .
" i do not see how i can carry out my crucial work on the budget and spending review while i have to deal with the private and public implications of recent revelations , ” laws said in a statement on saturday .
the millionaire former banker said he had not disclosed the financial arrangement due to his " desire to keep my sexuality a secret . "
he said he had not considered himself in breach of rules on expenses because he and his partner , lobbyist james lundie , had separate bank accounts and led separate social lives .
public spending cuts in his position at the finance ministry , laws was deputy to chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- george osborne .
the pair were overseeing tough austerity cuts aimed at reducing britain 's budget deficit , which stands at about 156 billion pounds , exceeding 11 percent of gross domestic product .
the british government last week agreed to immediate spending cuts totaling some 6 billion pounds .
the resignation is an early blow for britain 's first coalition government for 65 years , formed between britain 's conservative and liberal democrat parties .
conservative prime minister david cameron called laws ' decision " honorable . "
the liberal democrat leader , deputy prime minister nick clegg , said laws had taken a " very painful decision . " rc / reuters / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

red bull team mates sebastian vettel and mark webber crashed while fighting for the lead ; vettel retired , webber salvaged third place . mclaren 's pair of british world champions could scarcely believe their luck in istanbul , when an inter-team crash ahead of them left them with an easy one-two finish at the turkish grand prix .
red bull 's mark webber was leading at roughly two-thirds race distance , ahead of german team mate sebastian vettel , with the mclarens pressuring behind in third and fourth places .
then the red bull duo evidently forgot motor sport 's golden rule : never take out your team mate .
vettel tried an ambitious overtaking maneuver on webber 's red bull , and the pair collided .
the german retired immediately , while webber had to pit for repairs and finished up in third place .
" it 's stupid between team mates , but i should have been given the necessary space , " vettel lamented in the pit lane after retiring , blaming webber for the collision .
" it was a disaster , " webber said afterwards , although he did n't share vettel 's interpretation of the crash .
" it can happen .
he had a slight speed advantage , but he turned right into me and made contact and … well , that was it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel 's car was ruined in the crash , webber managed to limp home the crash was the latest in a string of problems that have stopped red bull , whose car still seems the class of the field , from converting their pace into results .
" all we ask for " after the crash , mclaren 's british world champions hamilton and button had their own wheel-to-wheel battle for the lead , but they managed to keep it fairly clean , with only minimal contact between the pair .
hamilton watched the red bull crash from his cockpit , saying it was " like an action movie in 3d .
" i do n't know what happened , " he said in the winner 's press conference , " but they collided and we got past them , and then we had a bit of a battle - a fair one , i must say - before the end . "
button , who succeeded hamilton as world champion in 2009 , also complemented his team mate for keeping the battle between them clean .
meanwhile , a disappointed red bull team boss christian horner also offered indirect praise to the mclaren duo , saying he wished his drivers had shown similar restraint under pressure .
" we saw lewis -lrb- hamilton -rrb- and jenson -lrb- button -rrb- racing each other and giving each other space .
that 's all we ask for , " he said .
schumacher 's best of the season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : normally strong , ferrari had a difficult day in the mid-field returning seven-time champion michael schumacher finished in fourth for mercedes , with his german team mate nico rosberg glued to his gearbox in fifth .
fourth position is the best result of 2010 for schumacher , who is still looking for his first podium finish since launching a comeback this season .
the two mercedes drivers managed to keep the hard-charging renault of robert kubica at bay throughout the race , but lacked the pace to challenge the leaders .
adrian sutil finished ninth for force india , behind the ferraris of felipe massa and fernando alonso , meaning that three of the six germans on the grid scored points in turkey .
in the race for the world championship , third place was enough to maintain mark webber 's lead in the standings , but the mclaren duo of button and hamilton are close behind .
vettel 's retirement means he drops to fifth in the standings , behind ferrari 's fernando alonso .
but vettel , webber , and red bull will all be wondering how large their leads over the competition might have been , had the first seven races of the season ran more smoothly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 30.05.2010 czech election brings big political shake-up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petr necas , chairman of the civic democratic party , could well be the next prime minister czech center-right parties are beginning talks on forming a coalition government , after their surprising success in the polls this weekend .
they have promised severe budget cuts to trim the country 's growing deficit . what a difference a day makes .
for the past six months , the center-left social democrats - led by the abrasive jiri paroubek - had been riding high in the opinion polls , heading for what most surveys predicted would be a clear victory : 30 percent , maybe more .
on the actual day , though , it was rather different .
and on sunday , czechs woke to the prospect of having the strongest government in years after one of the biggest political shake-ups since czechoslovakia split in 1993 .
pyrrhic victory there were gasps of surprise at the party 's lidovy dum headquarters on saturday when czech television released exit polls showing the social democrats tied in first place with the civic democrats , both at 20 percent .
but surprise turned to despair as the results came in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democratic party chairman jiri paroubek , resigned after the vote results came in in the end , paroubek 's party scored 22 percent - still the largest party , but a pyrrhic victory if ever there was one .
paroubek resigned almost immediately , conceding it was clear the country was heading for a center-right coalition .
plans to create a minority social democrat adminstration propped up by the communist party lay in tatters .
voters , it appears , had rejected his plans to tax the rich and preserve generous social benefits .
" it seems that people have chosen the direction the country should go in and it is a different direction than the one the social democrats were offering , ” paroubek told reporters , his new wife standing by his side .
czech media reported that waiters at the lidovy dum later circulated with trays of champagne bought to celebrate victory .
no one would touch them .
avoiding greek-style crisis across town , however , the champagne corks were popping at the headquarters of two brand new parliamentary parties : top09 , which was formed out of disgruntled civic democrat and christian democrat members and led by the aristocrat karel schwarzenberg ; and public affairs , a rather mysterious centrist party promoting direct democracy and promising to wage war on corruption .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top09 chairman karel schwarzenberg they came out of nowhere and now control a third of the seats in parliament .
" i 'm hugely pleased with the czech people , " schwarzenberg , whose full title is his serene highness the prince of schwarzenberg , count of sulz , princely landgrave in klettgau , and duke of krumlov .
a former chancellor to ex-president vaclav havel , he 's popular with urban , right-wing voters , and enjoys something of cult status among the young .
" czech voters have rejected demogoguery , rejected the extremists , and have given their votes to us , who did n't promise them anything but who gave them a clear vision of the future . "
that vision is built on fiscal responsibility – slashing public spending to reduce the czech republic 's debt and reforming key expenditures such as pensions and healthcare .
a slap for civic democrats schwarzenberg is already holding talks with the man most likely to become prime minister – petr necas , the interim leader of the conservative civic democrats .
they came second in the poll but unlike the social democrats , they have the potential to put together a majority center-right coalition and will lead efforts to form a new government , together with the centrist public affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech voters chose a path of fiscal responsibility , analysts say but even though the civic democrats - founded in 1991 by vaclav klaus , now president - will play a leading role in the new government , it was not a great election for the party .
they did particularly poorly in prague - a bastion of civic democrat support since the early 1990s .
it used to be said that even vaclav klaus ' tennis racquet could win a seat in prague .
one commentator said that phrase should now be amended : even karel schwarzenberg 's pipe could stand for office and win in the capital , he said .
" there 's not much to celebrate , " civic democrat deputy leader david vodrazka told lidove noviny newspaper .
" the voters – especially in prague – did n't just wave a warning finger at us .
they slapped us round the back of the head . "
day of resignations indeed it was something of an earthquake for czech politics , as voters punished the two big parties - and several smaller ones as well .
paroubek was not the only party leader to resign .
ondrej liska , head of the greens , immediately announced his resignation after his party lost all its seats .
cyril svoboda , leader of the christian democrats , followed suit after his party was unceremoniously kicked out of parliament .
and finally milos zeman – the oafish , heavy drinking former social democrat prime minister known for his brilliant acerbic wit – announced he was resigning after his leftist citizens ' rights party failed to gain enough votes to enter parliament .
but in many ways his was the real success story of the evening – he had developed a personal animosity towards social democrat leader paroubek .
in the end zeman 's party won 4.3 percent – almost all of them social democrat voters , helping to deprive paroubek of the victory he so craved .

to keep it up against serbia , manuel neuer will have to keep things tidy in goal . manuel neuer 's career is stuck in fast-forward .
the goalkeeper was just 20 when he deposed seasoned no.1 frank rost between the sticks at schalke .
at the age of 21 , he was the penalty-saving hero as his hometown club found itself in the champions league quarter-finals .
last summer , he was part of the germany under-21 team that won the european championships .
and now this summer he 's been trusted with keeping goal for the full side at the world cup .
" i feel ready for the task , " neuer told sport bild newspaper before the tournament .
jens lehmann is among those who are n't as sure .
" if we want to be world champions , it would be difficult to imagine it with manuel neuer as our number one goalkeeper , " the former national ' keeper told bild .
" he has made mistakes over and over again .
but i do like neuer , he will make a good goalkeeper one day . "
whether that day has yet come is something that will become clear as the tournament progresses - but neuer himself seems to have no problem with lehmann ’ s comments - time and again , he names the former arsenal man as one of his idols .
bildunterschrift : the world cup will be another leap forward for the schalke man all the tools in his locker neuer has just six international caps to date , and coming into the tournament none of them had been in competitive games .
he made his debut less than a year ago , impressing against the united arab emirates .
but he was at fault for ivory coast 's first goal in a friendly in november 2009 , his clearance bouncing off emmanuel eboue and into the goal .
picked for germany 's recent world cup warm-up against with malta , he had a quiet evening , but stayed alert enough to make one superb save and deny roderick briffa .
the hallmark of a top-level goalkeeper .
therein lies the frustration many feel with neuer 's ability .
he is an unrivalled shot-stopper , but prone to costly lapses in concentration .
he might grow out of it , he 's only 24 .
neuer is a one-club man , born in gelsenkirchen and on the books at schalke since the age of five .
he got his chance in the first-team early in the 2006-07 season , and has n't relinquished the position since .
" it all happened so fast , there was no time to think about the whole situation , " said the young keeper .
in his second season as no.1 he made two point-blank saves in normal time , and two more in the penalty shoot-out , to drop fc porto and win schalke a place in the last eight of the champions league .
he finished this season in confident fashion with a penalty save against bundesliga rivals mainz , showing a penalty-stopping specialism that augurs well with tournament football approaching .
neuer , who stands at around 195cm -lrb- 6 ' 5 " -rrb- , is both imposing and agile .
germany would do well to use his strong throw to launch quick counter attacks , as schalke have done to good effect .
involvement in several contentious incidents in last september 's ruhr derby against dortmund shows a feisty side to his character .
moreover , neuer is a commanding figure for the defenders in front of him .
it 's an important consideration for national coach joachim loew , with the gloves of lehmann - not to mention greats like oliver kahn and toni schumacher - still to be filled .

to keep it up against serbia , manuel neuer will have to keep things tidy in goal . manuel neuer 's career is stuck in fast-forward .
the goalkeeper was just 20 when he deposed seasoned no.1 frank rost between the sticks at schalke .
at the age of 21 , he was the penalty-saving hero as his hometown club found itself in the champions league quarter-finals .
last summer , he was part of the germany under-21 team that won the european championships .
and now this summer he 's been trusted with keeping goal for the full side at the world cup .
" i feel ready for the task , " neuer told sport bild newspaper before the tournament .
jens lehmann is among those who are n't as sure .
" if we want to be world champions , it would be difficult to imagine it with manuel neuer as our number one goalkeeper , " the former national ' keeper told bild .
" he has made mistakes over and over again .
but i do like neuer , he will make a good goalkeeper one day . "
whether that day has yet come is something that will become clear as the tournament progresses - but neuer himself seems to have no problem with lehmann ’ s comments - time and again , he names the former arsenal man as one of his idols .
bildunterschrift : the world cup will be another leap forward for the schalke man all the tools in his locker neuer has just six international caps to date , and coming into the tournament none of them had been in competitive games .
he made his debut less than a year ago , impressing against the united arab emirates .
but he was at fault for ivory coast 's first goal in a friendly in november 2009 , his clearance bouncing off emmanuel eboue and into the goal .
picked for germany 's recent world cup warm-up against with malta , he had a quiet evening , but stayed alert enough to make one superb save and deny roderick briffa .
the hallmark of a top-level goalkeeper .
therein lies the frustration many feel with neuer 's ability .
he is an unrivalled shot-stopper , but prone to costly lapses in concentration .
he might grow out of it , he 's only 24 .
neuer is a one-club man , born in gelsenkirchen and on the books at schalke since the age of five .
he got his chance in the first-team early in the 2006-07 season , and has n't relinquished the position since .
" it all happened so fast , there was no time to think about the whole situation , " said the young keeper .
in his second season as no.1 he made two point-blank saves in normal time , and two more in the penalty shoot-out , to drop fc porto and win schalke a place in the last eight of the champions league .
he finished this season in confident fashion with a penalty save against bundesliga rivals mainz , showing a penalty-stopping specialism that augurs well with tournament football approaching .
neuer , who stands at around 195cm -lrb- 6 ' 5 " -rrb- , is both imposing and agile .
germany would do well to use his strong throw to launch quick counter attacks , as schalke have done to good effect .
involvement in several contentious incidents in last september 's ruhr derby against dortmund shows a feisty side to his character .
moreover , neuer is a commanding figure for the defenders in front of him .
it 's an important consideration for national coach joachim loew , with the gloves of lehmann - not to mention greats like oliver kahn and toni schumacher - still to be filled .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 30.05.2010 czech election brings big political shake-up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petr necas , chairman of the civic democratic party , could well be the next prime minister czech center-right parties are beginning talks on forming a coalition government , after their surprising success in the polls this weekend .
they have promised severe budget cuts to trim the country 's growing deficit . what a difference a day makes .
for the past six months , the center-left social democrats - led by the abrasive jiri paroubek - had been riding high in the opinion polls , heading for what most surveys predicted would be a clear victory : 30 percent , maybe more .
on the actual day , though , it was rather different .
and on sunday , czechs woke to the prospect of having the strongest government in years after one of the biggest political shake-ups since czechoslovakia split in 1993 .
pyrrhic victory there were gasps of surprise at the party 's lidovy dum headquarters on saturday when czech television released exit polls showing the social democrats tied in first place with the civic democrats , both at 20 percent .
but surprise turned to despair as the results came in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democratic party chairman jiri paroubek , resigned after the vote results came in in the end , paroubek 's party scored 22 percent - still the largest party , but a pyrrhic victory if ever there was one .
paroubek resigned almost immediately , conceding it was clear the country was heading for a center-right coalition .
plans to create a minority social democrat adminstration propped up by the communist party lay in tatters .
voters , it appears , had rejected his plans to tax the rich and preserve generous social benefits .
" it seems that people have chosen the direction the country should go in and it is a different direction than the one the social democrats were offering , ” paroubek told reporters , his new wife standing by his side .
czech media reported that waiters at the lidovy dum later circulated with trays of champagne bought to celebrate victory .
no one would touch them .
avoiding greek-style crisis across town , however , the champagne corks were popping at the headquarters of two brand new parliamentary parties : top09 , which was formed out of disgruntled civic democrat and christian democrat members and led by the aristocrat karel schwarzenberg ; and public affairs , a rather mysterious centrist party promoting direct democracy and promising to wage war on corruption .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top09 chairman karel schwarzenberg they came out of nowhere and now control a third of the seats in parliament .
" i 'm hugely pleased with the czech people , " schwarzenberg , whose full title is his serene highness the prince of schwarzenberg , count of sulz , princely landgrave in klettgau , and duke of krumlov .
a former chancellor to ex-president vaclav havel , he 's popular with urban , right-wing voters , and enjoys something of cult status among the young .
" czech voters have rejected demogoguery , rejected the extremists , and have given their votes to us , who did n't promise them anything but who gave them a clear vision of the future . "
that vision is built on fiscal responsibility – slashing public spending to reduce the czech republic 's debt and reforming key expenditures such as pensions and healthcare .

it was germany 's first win in nearly three decades and the victory means it will host next year 's eurovision . lena meyer-landrut may have made her name with the song " satellite " but , at least for the moment , she 's a superstar in germany .
the 19-year-old ended germany 's long losing streak in the popular european-wide song competition with an improbable triumph over 24 other finalists in a live program from oslo on saturday night watched by more than 100 million people across europe .
thousands of fans braved bad weather to greet the teenage pop sensation in her home town , some 15 hours after she destroyed the competition at the eurovision song contest in oslo .
" you guys are really mad !
go back inside , it 's raining , " she told her loyal supporters , blowing kisses to the crowd .
some of them had been waiting for hours for her return .
lena flew home on a special lufthansa charter from norway , and officials in the city of hanover even rolled out the red carpet for the youngster .
" normally this is how we welcome presidents , " state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff , said .
" but i think lena has earned it .
she has represented our country to that level . "
political praise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 70,000 lena fans watched her win on hanover 's big screen even german chancellor angela merkel saw fit to congratulate lena , saying she was thrilled by the teenager 's " super success " in the eurovision song contest .
" lena strongly impressed me with her unpretentiousness and warmth , " the chancellor told mass circulation tabloid bild .
" she is a wonderful example of young germany . "
certainly no one could accuse the 19-year-old of a pretentious demeanor , or of seeming old beyond her years during her on-screen acceptance speech .
" this is so absolutely awesome , " she raved at the live ceremony in oslo after securing a comfortable victory with 246 points .
" i feel that this is not real .
i 'm kind of freaking out .
this feels incredibly good . "
foreign minister guido westerwelle was also impressed by the attractive youngster 's " rousing performance " , which " dazzled germany and sang -lsb- her -rsb- into the heart of europe . "
he said that lena had possibly succeeded in making his job of promoting germany abroad somewhat simpler .
" whether you wanted to be or not , you are an ambassador for our country who , in one night , charmingly disproved a few old stereotypes , " he said .
bildunterschrift : germany waited almost three decades for its second eurovision triumph " europe does like us ! "
the press in germany agreed that lena 's comprehensive win - after estonia , latvia , denmark , sweden , norway , finland , switzerland , spain and slovakia all awarded the maximum 12 points for her performance - helped banish a string of stereotypes about german culture , and german pop music .
" europe does like us ! " wrote the bild am sonntag sunday paper on page one , having bemoaned the country 's poor placing in past competitions .
" why does n't anyone like us ? " , the paper complained in 2008 , when germany sent established pop stars " no angels " to the competition in a bid for success .
but the band scored a miserable 14 points , in joint-last place .
since 2005 , germany had never finished higher than fifteenth in the 25-act competition , and the country had only ever won eurovision in 1982 with an anti-war ballad " ein bisschen frieden " -lrb- " a little peace " -rrb- by female vocalist nicole hohloch .
however , as reigning champions , germany will now host the 2011 eurovision song contest next summer. msh / ap / apn / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

red bull team mates sebastian vettel and mark webber crashed while fighting for the lead ; vettel retired , webber salvaged third place . mclaren 's pair of british world champions could scarcely believe their luck in istanbul , when an inter-team crash ahead of them left them with an easy one-two finish at the turkish grand prix .
red bull 's mark webber was leading at roughly two-thirds race distance , ahead of german team mate sebastian vettel , with the mclarens pressuring behind in third and fourth places .
then the red bull duo evidently forgot motor sport 's golden rule : never take out your team mate .
vettel tried an ambitious overtaking maneuver on webber 's red bull , and the pair collided .
the german retired immediately , while webber had to pit for repairs and finished up in third place .
" it 's stupid between team mates , but i should have been given the necessary space , " vettel lamented in the pit lane after retiring , blaming webber for the collision .
" it was a disaster , " webber said afterwards , although he did n't share vettel 's interpretation of the crash .
" it can happen .
he had a slight speed advantage , but he turned right into me and made contact and … well , that was it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel 's car was ruined in the crash , webber managed to limp home the crash was the latest in a string of problems that have stopped red bull , whose car still seems the class of the field , from converting their pace into results .
" all we ask for " after the crash , mclaren 's british world champions hamilton and button had their own wheel-to-wheel battle for the lead , but they managed to keep it fairly clean , with only minimal contact between the pair .
hamilton watched the red bull crash from his cockpit , saying it was " like an action movie in 3d .
" i do n't know what happened , " he said in the winner 's press conference , " but they collided and we got past them , and then we had a bit of a battle - a fair one , i must say - before the end . "
button , who succeeded hamilton as world champion in 2009 , also complemented his team mate for keeping the battle between them clean .
meanwhile , a disappointed red bull team boss christian horner also offered indirect praise to the mclaren duo , saying he wished his drivers had shown similar restraint under pressure .
" we saw lewis -lrb- hamilton -rrb- and jenson -lrb- button -rrb- racing each other and giving each other space .
that 's all we ask for , " he said .
schumacher 's best of the season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : normally strong , ferrari had a difficult day in the mid-field returning seven-time champion michael schumacher finished in fourth for mercedes , with his german team mate nico rosberg glued to his gearbox in fifth .
fourth position is the best result of 2010 for schumacher , who is still looking for his first podium finish since launching a comeback this season .
the two mercedes drivers managed to keep the hard-charging renault of robert kubica at bay throughout the race , but lacked the pace to challenge the leaders .
adrian sutil finished ninth for force india , behind the ferraris of felipe massa and fernando alonso , meaning that three of the six germans on the grid scored points in turkey .
in the race for the world championship , third place was enough to maintain mark webber 's lead in the standings , but the mclaren duo of button and hamilton are close behind .
vettel 's retirement means he drops to fifth in the standings , behind ferrari 's fernando alonso .
but vettel , webber , and red bull will all be wondering how large their leads over the competition might have been , had the first seven races of the season ran more smoothly .

hague said relations with washington would be " solid but not slavish " and pointedly omitted any reference to the phrase " special relationship " which has been a staple in statements referring to ties between the uk and the united states .
while attempting to distance britain from the image of being the " poodle " of successive us governments , hague 's " vision of a new , distinctive british foreign policy " did not suggest that europe would be the main beneficiary of the new government 's change of direction on the world stage .
instead of turning its attention to the power base of european politics across the water , hague said britain would develop its own identity and strategic role , following a new foreign-policy agenda which would differ in its " reach and ambition " from that pursued by the previous labour governments .
as well as confirming that britain would not join the euro-zone over the next five years of the new parliament , hague - a well-known eurosceptic - rejected ideas of further and deeper political union with brussels and instead announced the government 's desire for " freeing up the single market to boost economic growth . "
hague says britain will stay out eu 's financial structures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hague said that britain would stay out of eu financial affairs britain , hague said , would not be contributing to the financial assistance offered to the beleaguered economies of the euro-zone in the foreseeable future as it would be " difficult at a time of economic constraint . "
however , while distancing britain from the eu , hague said that his government would like the eu to " use its collective weight more effectively on the world stage . "
" in terms of joining the euro zone and keeping out of the bailout operations , this shows continuity with labour 's views on these topics , " thomas klau , head of the paris office of the european council for foreign relations and an eu expert , told deutsche welle .
" what cameron and hague have shown so far in europe , and indeed in washington , is that continuity is set to prevail over radical change . "
" earlier fears that a tory or tory-liberal coalition government would usher in an era of clashes with the eu so far hav n't materialised , " he added .
" this is largely down to the liberals ' inclusion in the coalition and the tories making it clear they wo n't be stepping into margaret thatcher 's shoes and waving her handbag about .
they may be talking tough on the eu but it does n't represent a huge shift away from polices labour adopted under tony blair . "
" in terms of questioning the eu 's role in the world , there was some concern that the tories would set up in opposition to the lisbon treaty and try to undermine the eu 's regulations governing its operations abroad , " klau said .
" there were even fears that they would be down right hostile to this but again , there has been little indication as yet that this will be the case .
hague has said that the eu should have a crucial role in certain areas , especially dealing with non-eu members , specifically russia .
so this policy announcement did n't really include anything worrying or shocking for the eu . "
with the eu kept at arms length and the cosiness of former relations with the us reduced to a firm handshake , the new british foreign policy agenda focuses heavily on london 's ambition to make its influence felt on the world stage . new emphasis on taking lead on global issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan and the middle east are priorities for britain rejecting ideas that britain was in strategic and influential decline , hague targeted increased engagement and cooperation with the emerging economies in the world and deepening of relations with countries in the gulf and the middle east , along with brazil , japan , india and china .
foreign engagement would " run through the veins of the entire administration , " hague said , announcing the creation of a newly-established national security council which would ensure that the " new philosophy will be translated into action . "
hague highlighted britain 's continued role in afghanistan , where the uk has 9,500 troops deployed , and relations with pakistan as areas of prime importance .
he added that britain would continue to back a two-state solution in the middle east and pursue a dual approach of " engagement and sanctions " in regard to iran , while backing current moves in the united nations to tighten punitive measures .
prime minister david cameron recently called on the international community to " ratchet up " pressure on tehran through sanctions in a bid to prevent the islamic republic pursuing what the west suspects is a nuclear weapons program .
britain stands more chance of success with eu , say experts " britain 's global policy is going to be shaped by the events which happen during the lifespan of this coalition , " klau said .
" will we see a clear break from labour policies on climate change , financial regulation , iran and the middle east ?
not necessarily .
the middle east in particular was a high priority for blair and this will be the same for cameron . "
" whether this ambitious britain can make a meaningful contribution with global resonance outside of the eu is another matter , " he added .
" all major eu powers must recognise that there 's not much governments can do when they act alone .
the chances of success are low when their efforts are not within the framework of a joint eu initiative .
the best they can hope for is a photo opportunity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say britain can achieve more with the eu than without almut moeller , head of the alfred von oppenheim centre for european policy studies at the german council on foreign relations , agrees that it is impossible for any state to work individually with success on global issues without being part of a framework .
but she believes that britain could actually benefit from being more involved with the eu at this time , not less .
" this is actually a really good opportunity for britain to become more engaged in european policies , " moeller told deutsche welle .
" there is a will to cooperate and a consensus that it makes sense to work together so if the british want pursue certain goals and shape european policies , especially in security and defence issues , then this is the right time .
there are a number of security and defence issues within the lisbon treaty which have stalled and there are no discussions being taken on these .
britain could give these and other policies which are lacking leadership the impetus they need . "

hundreds of foreign residents in russia are victims of violent right-wing extremism every year .
authorities are taking the problem seriously , but xenophobic attitudes are widespread in russian society . on an outdoor court at the university of vladivostok , a group of chinese exchange students are dribbling and shooting hoops in their own corner around a single net , separate from their russian counterparts .
here on the russian pacific coast , these exchange students are only 60 kilometers away from their home country , and yet russia does not feel like home to them .
" they 're afraid for their safety , " one russian student told deutsche welle .
" that 's why they spend entire days here and at the student residences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students usually only leave their dorms in vladivostok in groups when these exchange students do venture into town beyond the safe bubble of their dormitory , lecture halls and the basketball courts , then they only go in groups .
always on guard right-wing extremists in vladivostok have become more active in recent years , stoked by local mistrust of russia 's up-and-coming neighbor china as well as by worries about a weak economy and more foreigners coming into the country .
one chinese student in vladivostok told deutsche welle about her boyfriend 's encounter with a gang of thugs .
" about ten guys broke his nose , " she said .
" just like that , without saying anything . "
the young man ran away from his attackers , but according to his girlfriend , he was n't safe again until he was back at the university .
according to the sova center in moscow , an organization that researches racism and xenophobia , last year in russia around 70 people were killed in racially motivated attacks , while more than 300 were injured .
the center says that moscow and st. petersburg are especially dangerous places for central asians and people from the caucasus .
however , the situation has improved and those numbers have fallen by a third since 2008 .
police and judges are now taking the matter more seriously , according to the center 's director , alexander verkhovsky .
he says special police forces have been established to tackle right-wing extremism and that they have made several arrests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander verkhovsky is director of the anti-racist sova center in moscow a shock for the kremlin however , it took russian authorities some time to recognize the danger of right-wing radicals .
for years , critics of the kremlin felt that the government was more accommodating to extremist nationalists than it was to the country 's democratic opposition .
a turning point came in 2006 when extremists led a deadly pogrom against caucasian-owned businesses and restaurants in the small city of kondopoga , in russia 's northwest karelia region .
according to verkhovsky , it was only when the kremlin realized that it had lost control over kondopoga for a day that the kremlin started taking extremist nationalists seriously .
" it greatly alarmed the government , " said verkhovsky , who said the kremlin saw the event as " a political threat . "
still waters run deep verkhovsky told deutsche welle that the kremlin 's fight against racism has deeper roots than a push to secure power .
according to him , the nation 's authoritarian political climate has made open discussion of the topic taboo .
based on the silence of politicians , he said , many extremists have felt that russian society was on their side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china looms on vladivostok 's horizon " those who are out killing people feel they are pioneering a people 's movement , " he said .
in fact , extremist ideas are deeply anchored in the mindset of russian society .
according to some surveys , 55 percent of russians want to see foreign residents – especially those from central asia or the caucasus – stripped of their rights or even deported , and this , despite the fact that the russian economy depends on the cheap labor of people from these countries .
at the basketball court in vladivostok where chinese exchange students take refuge , many native students are certain that pacific russia 's economic prosperity depends on china .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander verkhovsky is director of the anti-racist sova center in moscow a shock for the kremlin however , it took russian authorities some time to recognize the danger of right-wing radicals .
for years , critics of the kremlin felt that the government was more accommodating to extremist nationalists than it was to the country 's democratic opposition .
a turning point came in 2006 when extremists led a deadly pogrom against caucasian-owned businesses and restaurants in the small city of kondopoga , in russia 's northwest karelia region .
according to verkhovsky , it was only when the kremlin realized that it had lost control over kondopoga for a day that the kremlin started taking extremist nationalists seriously .
" it greatly alarmed the government , " said verkhovsky , who said the kremlin saw the event as " a political threat . "
still waters run deep verkhovsky told deutsche welle that the kremlin 's fight against racism has deeper roots than a push to secure power .
according to him , the nation 's authoritarian political climate has made open discussion of the topic taboo .
based on the silence of politicians , he said , many extremists have felt that russian society was on their side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china looms on vladivostok 's horizon " those who are out killing people feel they are pioneering a people 's movement , " he said .
in fact , extremist ideas are deeply anchored in the mindset of russian society .
according to some surveys , 55 percent of russians want to see foreign residents – especially those from central asia or the caucasus – stripped of their rights or even deported , and this , despite the fact that the russian economy depends on the cheap labor of people from these countries .
at the basketball court in vladivostok where chinese exchange students take refuge , many native students are certain that pacific russia 's economic prosperity depends on china .

red bull team mates sebastian vettel and mark webber crashed while fighting for the lead ; vettel retired , webber salvaged third place . mclaren 's pair of british world champions could scarcely believe their luck in istanbul , when an inter-team crash ahead of them left them with an easy one-two finish at the turkish grand prix .
red bull 's mark webber was leading at roughly two-thirds race distance , ahead of german team mate sebastian vettel , with the mclarens pressuring behind in third and fourth places .
then the red bull duo evidently forgot motor sport 's golden rule : never take out your team mate .
vettel tried an ambitious overtaking maneuver on webber 's red bull , and the pair collided .
the german retired immediately , while webber had to pit for repairs and finished up in third place .
" it 's stupid between team mates , but i should have been given the necessary space , " vettel lamented in the pit lane after retiring , blaming webber for the collision .
" it was a disaster , " webber said afterwards , although he did n't share vettel 's interpretation of the crash .
" it can happen .
he had a slight speed advantage , but he turned right into me and made contact and … well , that was it . "

" all we ask for " after the crash , mclaren 's british world champions hamilton and button had their own wheel-to-wheel battle for the lead , but they managed to keep it fairly clean , with only minimal contact between the pair .
hamilton watched the red bull crash from his cockpit , saying it was " like an action movie in 3d .
" i do n't know what happened , " he said in the winner 's press conference , " but they collided and we got past them , and then we had a bit of a battle - a fair one , i must say - before the end . "
button , who succeeded hamilton as world champion in 2009 , also complemented his team mate for keeping the battle between them clean .
meanwhile , a disappointed red bull team boss christian horner also offered indirect praise to the mclaren duo , saying he wished his drivers had shown similar restraint under pressure .

westermann fractured his left foot in saturday evening 's friendly match against hungary . german soccer coach joachim loew must be wondering if he 'll have any healthy players left by the time the world cup begins in south africa next month .
central defender heiko westermann is the latest first-team player to be ruled out of the competition , having fractured his left foot in saturday 's 3-0 friendly win against hungary in budapest .
" heiko would have played a very important role at the world cup for our team .
that is because of his multi-faceted play .
in training he was in superb physical condition , " loew said .
the 27-year-old central defender , who has 19 caps , played a crucial role in schalke 's failed push for the bundesliga title this season , cementing himself as a regular in the national team in the process .
" naturally i am devastated because it was my big goal to take part in the world cup , " said westermann .
" i felt fully fit but now the only thing left for me to do is to wish the team all the best at the tournament . "
bildunterschrift : torn ankle ligaments have already sidelined captain michael ballack five down , 23 required westermann is the fifth german player to be ruled out of the world cup with injury in a matter of weeks .
captain michael ballack is out with an ankle ligament injury , with fellow midfielders christian traesch and simon rolfes also unable to represent their country .
first choice goalkeeper rene adler 's broken ribs mean that westermann 's schalke team mate , manuel neuer , will wear the number one shirt in south africa .
both adler and neuer are relatively new to international soccer , after the tragic suicide of former first choice goalie robert enke late last year .
coach joachim loew , still with one of the strongest squads of any of the 32 world cup competitors at his disposal , must name his final 23-man selection for the competition on tuesday .

red bull team mates sebastian vettel and mark webber crashed while fighting for the lead ; vettel retired , webber salvaged third place . mclaren 's pair of british world champions could scarcely believe their luck in istanbul , when an inter-team crash ahead of them left them with an easy one-two finish at the turkish grand prix .
red bull 's mark webber was leading at roughly two-thirds race distance , ahead of german team mate sebastian vettel , with the mclarens pressuring behind in third and fourth places .
then the red bull duo evidently forgot motor sport 's golden rule : never take out your team mate .
vettel tried an ambitious overtaking maneuver on webber 's red bull , and the pair collided .
the german retired immediately , while webber had to pit for repairs and finished up in third place .
" it 's stupid between team mates , but i should have been given the necessary space , " vettel lamented in the pit lane after retiring , blaming webber for the collision .
" it was a disaster , " webber said afterwards , although he did n't share vettel 's interpretation of the crash .
" it can happen .
he had a slight speed advantage , but he turned right into me and made contact and … well , that was it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel 's car was ruined in the crash , webber managed to limp home the crash was the latest in a string of problems that have stopped red bull , whose car still seems the class of the field , from converting their pace into results .
" all we ask for " after the crash , mclaren 's british world champions hamilton and button had their own wheel-to-wheel battle for the lead , but they managed to keep it fairly clean , with only minimal contact between the pair .
hamilton watched the red bull crash from his cockpit , saying it was " like an action movie in 3d .
" i do n't know what happened , " he said in the winner 's press conference , " but they collided and we got past them , and then we had a bit of a battle - a fair one , i must say - before the end . "
button , who succeeded hamilton as world champion in 2009 , also complemented his team mate for keeping the battle between them clean .
meanwhile , a disappointed red bull team boss christian horner also offered indirect praise to the mclaren duo , saying he wished his drivers had shown similar restraint under pressure .
" we saw lewis -lrb- hamilton -rrb- and jenson -lrb- button -rrb- racing each other and giving each other space .
that 's all we ask for , " he said .
schumacher 's best of the season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : normally strong , ferrari had a difficult day in the mid-field returning seven-time champion michael schumacher finished in fourth for mercedes , with his german team mate nico rosberg glued to his gearbox in fifth .
fourth position is the best result of 2010 for schumacher , who is still looking for his first podium finish since launching a comeback this season .
the two mercedes drivers managed to keep the hard-charging renault of robert kubica at bay throughout the race , but lacked the pace to challenge the leaders .
adrian sutil finished ninth for force india , behind the ferraris of felipe massa and fernando alonso , meaning that three of the six germans on the grid scored points in turkey .
in the race for the world championship , third place was enough to maintain mark webber 's lead in the standings , but the mclaren duo of button and hamilton are close behind .
vettel 's retirement means he drops to fifth in the standings , behind ferrari 's fernando alonso .
but vettel , webber , and red bull will all be wondering how large their leads over the competition might have been , had the first seven races of the season ran more smoothly .

it was germany 's first win in nearly three decades and the victory means it will host next year 's eurovision . lena meyer-landrut may have made her name with the song " satellite " but , at least for the moment , she 's a superstar in germany .
the 19-year-old ended germany 's long losing streak in the popular european-wide song competition with an improbable triumph over 24 other finalists in a live program from oslo on saturday night watched by more than 100 million people across europe .
thousands of fans braved bad weather to greet the teenage pop sensation in her home town , some 15 hours after she destroyed the competition at the eurovision song contest in oslo .
" you guys are really mad !
go back inside , it 's raining , " she told her loyal supporters , blowing kisses to the crowd .
some of them had been waiting for hours for her return .
lena flew home on a special lufthansa charter from norway , and officials in the city of hanover even rolled out the red carpet for the youngster .
" normally this is how we welcome presidents , " state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff , said .
" but i think lena has earned it .
she has represented our country to that level . "
political praise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 70,000 lena fans watched her win on hanover 's big screen even german chancellor angela merkel saw fit to congratulate lena , saying she was thrilled by the teenager 's " super success " in the eurovision song contest .
" lena strongly impressed me with her unpretentiousness and warmth , " the chancellor told mass circulation tabloid bild .
" she is a wonderful example of young germany . "
certainly no one could accuse the 19-year-old of a pretentious demeanor , or of seeming old beyond her years during her on-screen acceptance speech .
" this is so absolutely awesome , " she raved at the live ceremony in oslo after securing a comfortable victory with 246 points .
" i feel that this is not real .
i 'm kind of freaking out .
this feels incredibly good . "
foreign minister guido westerwelle was also impressed by the attractive youngster 's " rousing performance " , which " dazzled germany and sang -lsb- her -rsb- into the heart of europe . "
he said that lena had possibly succeeded in making his job of promoting germany abroad somewhat simpler .
" whether you wanted to be or not , you are an ambassador for our country who , in one night , charmingly disproved a few old stereotypes , " he said .
bildunterschrift : germany waited almost three decades for its second eurovision triumph " europe does like us ! "
the press in germany agreed that lena 's comprehensive win - after estonia , latvia , denmark , sweden , norway , finland , switzerland , spain and slovakia all awarded the maximum 12 points for her performance - helped banish a string of stereotypes about german culture , and german pop music .
" europe does like us ! " wrote the bild am sonntag sunday paper on page one , having bemoaned the country 's poor placing in past competitions .
" why does n't anyone like us ? " , the paper complained in 2008 , when germany sent established pop stars " no angels " to the competition in a bid for success .
but the band scored a miserable 14 points , in joint-last place .
since 2005 , germany had never finished higher than fifteenth in the 25-act competition , and the country had only ever won eurovision in 1982 with an anti-war ballad " ein bisschen frieden " -lrb- " a little peace " -rrb- by female vocalist nicole hohloch .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 30.05.2010 germany loses yet another world cup player to injury großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westermann is a defender but could have provided cover in midfield central defender heiko westermann is the latest german player to be ruled out of the soccer world cup .
westermann fractured his left foot in saturday evening 's friendly match against hungary . german soccer coach joachim loew must be wondering if he 'll have any healthy players left by the time the world cup begins in south africa next month .
central defender heiko westermann is the latest first-team player to be ruled out of the competition , having fractured his left foot in saturday 's 3-0 friendly win against hungary in budapest .
" heiko would have played a very important role at the world cup for our team .
that is because of his multi-faceted play .
in training he was in superb physical condition , " loew said .
the 27-year-old central defender , who has 19 caps , played a crucial role in schalke 's failed push for the bundesliga title this season , cementing himself as a regular in the national team in the process .
" naturally i am devastated because it was my big goal to take part in the world cup , " said westermann .
" i felt fully fit but now the only thing left for me to do is to wish the team all the best at the tournament . "
bildunterschrift : torn ankle ligaments have already sidelined captain michael ballack five down , 23 required westermann is the fifth german player to be ruled out of the world cup with injury in a matter of weeks .
captain michael ballack is out with an ankle ligament injury , with fellow midfielders christian traesch and simon rolfes also unable to represent their country .
first choice goalkeeper rene adler 's broken ribs mean that westermann 's schalke team mate , manuel neuer , will wear the number one shirt in south africa .

westermann fractured his left foot in saturday evening 's friendly match against hungary . german soccer coach joachim loew must be wondering if he 'll have any healthy players left by the time the world cup begins in south africa next month .
central defender heiko westermann is the latest first-team player to be ruled out of the competition , having fractured his left foot in saturday 's 3-0 friendly win against hungary in budapest .
" heiko would have played a very important role at the world cup for our team .
that is because of his multi-faceted play .
in training he was in superb physical condition , " loew said .
the 27-year-old central defender , who has 19 caps , played a crucial role in schalke 's failed push for the bundesliga title this season , cementing himself as a regular in the national team in the process .
" naturally i am devastated because it was my big goal to take part in the world cup , " said westermann .
" i felt fully fit but now the only thing left for me to do is to wish the team all the best at the tournament . "
bildunterschrift : torn ankle ligaments have already sidelined captain michael ballack five down , 23 required westermann is the fifth german player to be ruled out of the world cup with injury in a matter of weeks .
captain michael ballack is out with an ankle ligament injury , with fellow midfielders christian traesch and simon rolfes also unable to represent their country .
first choice goalkeeper rene adler 's broken ribs mean that westermann 's schalke team mate , manuel neuer , will wear the number one shirt in south africa .
both adler and neuer are relatively new to international soccer , after the tragic suicide of former first choice goalie robert enke late last year .
coach joachim loew , still with one of the strongest squads of any of the 32 world cup competitors at his disposal , must name his final 23-man selection for the competition on tuesday .

they have promised severe budget cuts to trim the country 's growing deficit . what a difference a day makes .
for the past six months , the center-left social democrats - led by the abrasive jiri paroubek - had been riding high in the opinion polls , heading for what most surveys predicted would be a clear victory : 30 percent , maybe more .
on the actual day , though , it was rather different .
and on sunday , czechs woke to the prospect of having the strongest government in years after one of the biggest political shake-ups since czechoslovakia split in 1993 .
pyrrhic victory there were gasps of surprise at the party 's lidovy dum headquarters on saturday when czech television released exit polls showing the social democrats tied in first place with the civic democrats , both at 20 percent .
but surprise turned to despair as the results came in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democratic party chairman jiri paroubek , resigned after the vote results came in in the end , paroubek 's party scored 22 percent - still the largest party , but a pyrrhic victory if ever there was one .
paroubek resigned almost immediately , conceding it was clear the country was heading for a center-right coalition .
plans to create a minority social democrat adminstration propped up by the communist party lay in tatters .
voters , it appears , had rejected his plans to tax the rich and preserve generous social benefits .
" it seems that people have chosen the direction the country should go in and it is a different direction than the one the social democrats were offering , ” paroubek told reporters , his new wife standing by his side .
czech media reported that waiters at the lidovy dum later circulated with trays of champagne bought to celebrate victory .
no one would touch them .
avoiding greek-style crisis across town , however , the champagne corks were popping at the headquarters of two brand new parliamentary parties : top09 , which was formed out of disgruntled civic democrat and christian democrat members and led by the aristocrat karel schwarzenberg ; and public affairs , a rather mysterious centrist party promoting direct democracy and promising to wage war on corruption .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top09 chairman karel schwarzenberg they came out of nowhere and now control a third of the seats in parliament .

a former chancellor to ex-president vaclav havel , he 's popular with urban , right-wing voters , and enjoys something of cult status among the young .
" czech voters have rejected demogoguery , rejected the extremists , and have given their votes to us , who did n't promise them anything but who gave them a clear vision of the future . "
that vision is built on fiscal responsibility – slashing public spending to reduce the czech republic 's debt and reforming key expenditures such as pensions and healthcare .
a slap for civic democrats schwarzenberg is already holding talks with the man most likely to become prime minister – petr necas , the interim leader of the conservative civic democrats .
they came second in the poll but unlike the social democrats , they have the potential to put together a majority center-right coalition and will lead efforts to form a new government , together with the centrist public affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech voters chose a path of fiscal responsibility , analysts say but even though the civic democrats - founded in 1991 by vaclav klaus , now president - will play a leading role in the new government , it was not a great election for the party .
they did particularly poorly in prague - a bastion of civic democrat support since the early 1990s .
it used to be said that even vaclav klaus ' tennis racquet could win a seat in prague .
one commentator said that phrase should now be amended : even karel schwarzenberg 's pipe could stand for office and win in the capital , he said .
" there 's not much to celebrate , " civic democrat deputy leader david vodrazka told lidove noviny newspaper .
" the voters – especially in prague – did n't just wave a warning finger at us .
they slapped us round the back of the head . "
day of resignations indeed it was something of an earthquake for czech politics , as voters punished the two big parties - and several smaller ones as well .
paroubek was not the only party leader to resign .
ondrej liska , head of the greens , immediately announced his resignation after his party lost all its seats .
cyril svoboda , leader of the christian democrats , followed suit after his party was unceremoniously kicked out of parliament .
and finally milos zeman – the oafish , heavy drinking former social democrat prime minister known for his brilliant acerbic wit – announced he was resigning after his leftist citizens ' rights party failed to gain enough votes to enter parliament .
but in many ways his was the real success story of the evening – he had developed a personal animosity towards social democrat leader paroubek .
in the end zeman 's party won 4.3 percent – almost all of them social democrat voters , helping to deprive paroubek of the victory he so craved .

they have promised severe budget cuts to trim the country 's growing deficit . what a difference a day makes .
for the past six months , the center-left social democrats - led by the abrasive jiri paroubek - had been riding high in the opinion polls , heading for what most surveys predicted would be a clear victory : 30 percent , maybe more .
on the actual day , though , it was rather different .
and on sunday , czechs woke to the prospect of having the strongest government in years after one of the biggest political shake-ups since czechoslovakia split in 1993 .
pyrrhic victory there were gasps of surprise at the party 's lidovy dum headquarters on saturday when czech television released exit polls showing the social democrats tied in first place with the civic democrats , both at 20 percent .
but surprise turned to despair as the results came in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democratic party chairman jiri paroubek , resigned after the vote results came in in the end , paroubek 's party scored 22 percent - still the largest party , but a pyrrhic victory if ever there was one .
paroubek resigned almost immediately , conceding it was clear the country was heading for a center-right coalition .
plans to create a minority social democrat adminstration propped up by the communist party lay in tatters .
voters , it appears , had rejected his plans to tax the rich and preserve generous social benefits .
" it seems that people have chosen the direction the country should go in and it is a different direction than the one the social democrats were offering , ” paroubek told reporters , his new wife standing by his side .
czech media reported that waiters at the lidovy dum later circulated with trays of champagne bought to celebrate victory .
no one would touch them .
avoiding greek-style crisis across town , however , the champagne corks were popping at the headquarters of two brand new parliamentary parties : top09 , which was formed out of disgruntled civic democrat and christian democrat members and led by the aristocrat karel schwarzenberg ; and public affairs , a rather mysterious centrist party promoting direct democracy and promising to wage war on corruption .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top09 chairman karel schwarzenberg they came out of nowhere and now control a third of the seats in parliament .
" i 'm hugely pleased with the czech people , " schwarzenberg , whose full title is his serene highness the prince of schwarzenberg , count of sulz , princely landgrave in klettgau , and duke of krumlov .
a former chancellor to ex-president vaclav havel , he 's popular with urban , right-wing voters , and enjoys something of cult status among the young .
" czech voters have rejected demogoguery , rejected the extremists , and have given their votes to us , who did n't promise them anything but who gave them a clear vision of the future . "
that vision is built on fiscal responsibility – slashing public spending to reduce the czech republic 's debt and reforming key expenditures such as pensions and healthcare .
a slap for civic democrats schwarzenberg is already holding talks with the man most likely to become prime minister – petr necas , the interim leader of the conservative civic democrats .
they came second in the poll but unlike the social democrats , they have the potential to put together a majority center-right coalition and will lead efforts to form a new government , together with the centrist public affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech voters chose a path of fiscal responsibility , analysts say but even though the civic democrats - founded in 1991 by vaclav klaus , now president - will play a leading role in the new government , it was not a great election for the party .
they did particularly poorly in prague - a bastion of civic democrat support since the early 1990s .
it used to be said that even vaclav klaus ' tennis racquet could win a seat in prague .
one commentator said that phrase should now be amended : even karel schwarzenberg 's pipe could stand for office and win in the capital , he said .
" there 's not much to celebrate , " civic democrat deputy leader david vodrazka told lidove noviny newspaper .
" the voters – especially in prague – did n't just wave a warning finger at us .
they slapped us round the back of the head . "
day of resignations indeed it was something of an earthquake for czech politics , as voters punished the two big parties - and several smaller ones as well .
paroubek was not the only party leader to resign .
ondrej liska , head of the greens , immediately announced his resignation after his party lost all its seats .
cyril svoboda , leader of the christian democrats , followed suit after his party was unceremoniously kicked out of parliament .
and finally milos zeman – the oafish , heavy drinking former social democrat prime minister known for his brilliant acerbic wit – announced he was resigning after his leftist citizens ' rights party failed to gain enough votes to enter parliament .
but in many ways his was the real success story of the evening – he had developed a personal animosity towards social democrat leader paroubek .
in the end zeman 's party won 4.3 percent – almost all of them social democrat voters , helping to deprive paroubek of the victory he so craved .

laws , whose job had been to oversee cuts to public spending , stood down over expenses revelations . cabinet minister david laws has stepped down from his high-ranking position in britain 's financial ministry after only 18 day in office , following revelations about expenses and his private life .
laws , a member of the liberal democrat party , resigned from his position as chief secretary to the treasury after the daily telegraph newspaper reported he had claimed more than 40,000 pounds -lrb- 47,100 euros , $ 57,800 -rrb- in expenses to pay rent to his long-term male partner .
" i do not see how i can carry out my crucial work on the budget and spending review while i have to deal with the private and public implications of recent revelations , ” laws said in a statement on saturday .
the millionaire former banker said he had not disclosed the financial arrangement due to his " desire to keep my sexuality a secret . "
he said he had not considered himself in breach of rules on expenses because he and his partner , lobbyist james lundie , had separate bank accounts and led separate social lives .
public spending cuts in his position at the finance ministry , laws was deputy to chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- george osborne .
the pair were overseeing tough austerity cuts aimed at reducing britain 's budget deficit , which stands at about 156 billion pounds , exceeding 11 percent of gross domestic product .
the british government last week agreed to immediate spending cuts totaling some 6 billion pounds .
the resignation is an early blow for britain 's first coalition government for 65 years , formed between britain 's conservative and liberal democrat parties .
conservative prime minister david cameron called laws ' decision " honorable . "

laws , whose job had been to oversee cuts to public spending , stood down over expenses revelations . cabinet minister david laws has stepped down from his high-ranking position in britain 's financial ministry after only 18 day in office , following revelations about expenses and his private life .
laws , a member of the liberal democrat party , resigned from his position as chief secretary to the treasury after the daily telegraph newspaper reported he had claimed more than 40,000 pounds -lrb- 47,100 euros , $ 57,800 -rrb- in expenses to pay rent to his long-term male partner .
" i do not see how i can carry out my crucial work on the budget and spending review while i have to deal with the private and public implications of recent revelations , ” laws said in a statement on saturday .
the millionaire former banker said he had not disclosed the financial arrangement due to his " desire to keep my sexuality a secret . "

it was germany 's first win in nearly three decades and the victory means it will host next year 's eurovision . lena meyer-landrut may have made her name with the song " satellite " but , at least for the moment , she 's a superstar in germany .
the 19-year-old ended germany 's long losing streak in the popular european-wide song competition with an improbable triumph over 24 other finalists in a live program from oslo on saturday night watched by more than 100 million people across europe .
thousands of fans braved bad weather to greet the teenage pop sensation in her home town , some 15 hours after she destroyed the competition at the eurovision song contest in oslo .
" you guys are really mad !
go back inside , it 's raining , " she told her loyal supporters , blowing kisses to the crowd .
some of them had been waiting for hours for her return .
lena flew home on a special lufthansa charter from norway , and officials in the city of hanover even rolled out the red carpet for the youngster .
" normally this is how we welcome presidents , " state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff , said .
" but i think lena has earned it .
she has represented our country to that level . "
political praise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 70,000 lena fans watched her win on hanover 's big screen even german chancellor angela merkel saw fit to congratulate lena , saying she was thrilled by the teenager 's " super success " in the eurovision song contest .
" lena strongly impressed me with her unpretentiousness and warmth , " the chancellor told mass circulation tabloid bild .
" she is a wonderful example of young germany . "
certainly no one could accuse the 19-year-old of a pretentious demeanor , or of seeming old beyond her years during her on-screen acceptance speech .
" this is so absolutely awesome , " she raved at the live ceremony in oslo after securing a comfortable victory with 246 points .
" i feel that this is not real .
i 'm kind of freaking out .
this feels incredibly good . "
foreign minister guido westerwelle was also impressed by the attractive youngster 's " rousing performance " , which " dazzled germany and sang -lsb- her -rsb- into the heart of europe . "
he said that lena had possibly succeeded in making his job of promoting germany abroad somewhat simpler .
" whether you wanted to be or not , you are an ambassador for our country who , in one night , charmingly disproved a few old stereotypes , " he said .
bildunterschrift : germany waited almost three decades for its second eurovision triumph " europe does like us ! "
the press in germany agreed that lena 's comprehensive win - after estonia , latvia , denmark , sweden , norway , finland , switzerland , spain and slovakia all awarded the maximum 12 points for her performance - helped banish a string of stereotypes about german culture , and german pop music .
" europe does like us ! " wrote the bild am sonntag sunday paper on page one , having bemoaned the country 's poor placing in past competitions .
" why does n't anyone like us ? " , the paper complained in 2008 , when germany sent established pop stars " no angels " to the competition in a bid for success .
but the band scored a miserable 14 points , in joint-last place .
since 2005 , germany had never finished higher than fifteenth in the 25-act competition , and the country had only ever won eurovision in 1982 with an anti-war ballad " ein bisschen frieden " -lrb- " a little peace " -rrb- by female vocalist nicole hohloch .

it was germany 's first win in nearly three decades and the victory means it will host next year 's eurovision . lena meyer-landrut may have made her name with the song " satellite " but , at least for the moment , she 's a superstar in germany .
the 19-year-old ended germany 's long losing streak in the popular european-wide song competition with an improbable triumph over 24 other finalists in a live program from oslo on saturday night watched by more than 100 million people across europe .
thousands of fans braved bad weather to greet the teenage pop sensation in her home town , some 15 hours after she destroyed the competition at the eurovision song contest in oslo .
" you guys are really mad !
go back inside , it 's raining , " she told her loyal supporters , blowing kisses to the crowd .
some of them had been waiting for hours for her return .
lena flew home on a special lufthansa charter from norway , and officials in the city of hanover even rolled out the red carpet for the youngster .
" normally this is how we welcome presidents , " state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff , said .
" but i think lena has earned it .
she has represented our country to that level . "
political praise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 70,000 lena fans watched her win on hanover 's big screen even german chancellor angela merkel saw fit to congratulate lena , saying she was thrilled by the teenager 's " super success " in the eurovision song contest .
" lena strongly impressed me with her unpretentiousness and warmth , " the chancellor told mass circulation tabloid bild .
" she is a wonderful example of young germany . "
certainly no one could accuse the 19-year-old of a pretentious demeanor , or of seeming old beyond her years during her on-screen acceptance speech .
" this is so absolutely awesome , " she raved at the live ceremony in oslo after securing a comfortable victory with 246 points .
" i feel that this is not real .
i 'm kind of freaking out .
this feels incredibly good . "
foreign minister guido westerwelle was also impressed by the attractive youngster 's " rousing performance " , which " dazzled germany and sang -lsb- her -rsb- into the heart of europe . "
he said that lena had possibly succeeded in making his job of promoting germany abroad somewhat simpler .
" whether you wanted to be or not , you are an ambassador for our country who , in one night , charmingly disproved a few old stereotypes , " he said .
bildunterschrift : germany waited almost three decades for its second eurovision triumph " europe does like us ! "
the press in germany agreed that lena 's comprehensive win - after estonia , latvia , denmark , sweden , norway , finland , switzerland , spain and slovakia all awarded the maximum 12 points for her performance - helped banish a string of stereotypes about german culture , and german pop music .
" europe does like us ! " wrote the bild am sonntag sunday paper on page one , having bemoaned the country 's poor placing in past competitions .
" why does n't anyone like us ? " , the paper complained in 2008 , when germany sent established pop stars " no angels " to the competition in a bid for success .
but the band scored a miserable 14 points , in joint-last place .
since 2005 , germany had never finished higher than fifteenth in the 25-act competition , and the country had only ever won eurovision in 1982 with an anti-war ballad " ein bisschen frieden " -lrb- " a little peace " -rrb- by female vocalist nicole hohloch .
however , as reigning champions , germany will now host the 2011 eurovision song contest next summer. msh / ap / apn / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

westermann fractured his left foot in saturday evening 's friendly match against hungary . german soccer coach joachim loew must be wondering if he 'll have any healthy players left by the time the world cup begins in south africa next month .
central defender heiko westermann is the latest first-team player to be ruled out of the competition , having fractured his left foot in saturday 's 3-0 friendly win against hungary in budapest .

that is because of his multi-faceted play .

the 27-year-old central defender , who has 19 caps , played a crucial role in schalke 's failed push for the bundesliga title this season , cementing himself as a regular in the national team in the process .
" naturally i am devastated because it was my big goal to take part in the world cup , " said westermann .
" i felt fully fit but now the only thing left for me to do is to wish the team all the best at the tournament . "

it was germany 's first win in nearly three decades and the victory means it will host next year 's eurovision . lena meyer-landrut may have made her name with the song " satellite " but , at least for the moment , she 's a superstar in germany .
the 19-year-old ended germany 's long losing streak in the popular european-wide song competition with an improbable triumph over 24 other finalists in a live program from oslo on saturday night watched by more than 100 million people across europe .
thousands of fans braved bad weather to greet the teenage pop sensation in her home town , some 15 hours after she destroyed the competition at the eurovision song contest in oslo .
" you guys are really mad !
go back inside , it 's raining , " she told her loyal supporters , blowing kisses to the crowd .
some of them had been waiting for hours for her return .
lena flew home on a special lufthansa charter from norway , and officials in the city of hanover even rolled out the red carpet for the youngster .
" normally this is how we welcome presidents , " state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff , said .
" but i think lena has earned it .
she has represented our country to that level . "
political praise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 70,000 lena fans watched her win on hanover 's big screen even german chancellor angela merkel saw fit to congratulate lena , saying she was thrilled by the teenager 's " super success " in the eurovision song contest .
" lena strongly impressed me with her unpretentiousness and warmth , " the chancellor told mass circulation tabloid bild .
" she is a wonderful example of young germany . "
certainly no one could accuse the 19-year-old of a pretentious demeanor , or of seeming old beyond her years during her on-screen acceptance speech .
" this is so absolutely awesome , " she raved at the live ceremony in oslo after securing a comfortable victory with 246 points .
" i feel that this is not real .
i 'm kind of freaking out .
this feels incredibly good . "
foreign minister guido westerwelle was also impressed by the attractive youngster 's " rousing performance " , which " dazzled germany and sang -lsb- her -rsb- into the heart of europe . "
he said that lena had possibly succeeded in making his job of promoting germany abroad somewhat simpler .
" whether you wanted to be or not , you are an ambassador for our country who , in one night , charmingly disproved a few old stereotypes , " he said .
bildunterschrift : germany waited almost three decades for its second eurovision triumph " europe does like us ! "
the press in germany agreed that lena 's comprehensive win - after estonia , latvia , denmark , sweden , norway , finland , switzerland , spain and slovakia all awarded the maximum 12 points for her performance - helped banish a string of stereotypes about german culture , and german pop music .
" europe does like us ! " wrote the bild am sonntag sunday paper on page one , having bemoaned the country 's poor placing in past competitions .
" why does n't anyone like us ? " , the paper complained in 2008 , when germany sent established pop stars " no angels " to the competition in a bid for success .
but the band scored a miserable 14 points , in joint-last place .
since 2005 , germany had never finished higher than fifteenth in the 25-act competition , and the country had only ever won eurovision in 1982 with an anti-war ballad " ein bisschen frieden " -lrb- " a little peace " -rrb- by female vocalist nicole hohloch .
however , as reigning champions , germany will now host the 2011 eurovision song contest next summer. msh / ap / apn / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

westermann fractured his left foot in saturday evening 's friendly match against hungary . german soccer coach joachim loew must be wondering if he 'll have any healthy players left by the time the world cup begins in south africa next month .
central defender heiko westermann is the latest first-team player to be ruled out of the competition , having fractured his left foot in saturday 's 3-0 friendly win against hungary in budapest .
" heiko would have played a very important role at the world cup for our team .
that is because of his multi-faceted play .
in training he was in superb physical condition , " loew said .
the 27-year-old central defender , who has 19 caps , played a crucial role in schalke 's failed push for the bundesliga title this season , cementing himself as a regular in the national team in the process .
" naturally i am devastated because it was my big goal to take part in the world cup , " said westermann .
" i felt fully fit but now the only thing left for me to do is to wish the team all the best at the tournament . "
bildunterschrift : torn ankle ligaments have already sidelined captain michael ballack five down , 23 required westermann is the fifth german player to be ruled out of the world cup with injury in a matter of weeks .

both adler and neuer are relatively new to international soccer , after the tragic suicide of former first choice goalie robert enke late last year .

hague said relations with washington would be " solid but not slavish " and pointedly omitted any reference to the phrase " special relationship " which has been a staple in statements referring to ties between the uk and the united states .
while attempting to distance britain from the image of being the " poodle " of successive us governments , hague 's " vision of a new , distinctive british foreign policy " did not suggest that europe would be the main beneficiary of the new government 's change of direction on the world stage .
instead of turning its attention to the power base of european politics across the water , hague said britain would develop its own identity and strategic role , following a new foreign-policy agenda which would differ in its " reach and ambition " from that pursued by the previous labour governments .
as well as confirming that britain would not join the euro-zone over the next five years of the new parliament , hague - a well-known eurosceptic - rejected ideas of further and deeper political union with brussels and instead announced the government 's desire for " freeing up the single market to boost economic growth . "
hague says britain will stay out eu 's financial structures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hague said that britain would stay out of eu financial affairs britain , hague said , would not be contributing to the financial assistance offered to the beleaguered economies of the euro-zone in the foreseeable future as it would be " difficult at a time of economic constraint . "
however , while distancing britain from the eu , hague said that his government would like the eu to " use its collective weight more effectively on the world stage . "
" in terms of joining the euro zone and keeping out of the bailout operations , this shows continuity with labour 's views on these topics , " thomas klau , head of the paris office of the european council for foreign relations and an eu expert , told deutsche welle .
" what cameron and hague have shown so far in europe , and indeed in washington , is that continuity is set to prevail over radical change . "
" earlier fears that a tory or tory-liberal coalition government would usher in an era of clashes with the eu so far hav n't materialised , " he added .
" this is largely down to the liberals ' inclusion in the coalition and the tories making it clear they wo n't be stepping into margaret thatcher 's shoes and waving her handbag about .
they may be talking tough on the eu but it does n't represent a huge shift away from polices labour adopted under tony blair . "
" in terms of questioning the eu 's role in the world , there was some concern that the tories would set up in opposition to the lisbon treaty and try to undermine the eu 's regulations governing its operations abroad , " klau said .
" there were even fears that they would be down right hostile to this but again , there has been little indication as yet that this will be the case .
hague has said that the eu should have a crucial role in certain areas , especially dealing with non-eu members , specifically russia .
so this policy announcement did n't really include anything worrying or shocking for the eu . "
with the eu kept at arms length and the cosiness of former relations with the us reduced to a firm handshake , the new british foreign policy agenda focuses heavily on london 's ambition to make its influence felt on the world stage . new emphasis on taking lead on global issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan and the middle east are priorities for britain rejecting ideas that britain was in strategic and influential decline , hague targeted increased engagement and cooperation with the emerging economies in the world and deepening of relations with countries in the gulf and the middle east , along with brazil , japan , india and china .
foreign engagement would " run through the veins of the entire administration , " hague said , announcing the creation of a newly-established national security council which would ensure that the " new philosophy will be translated into action . "
hague highlighted britain 's continued role in afghanistan , where the uk has 9,500 troops deployed , and relations with pakistan as areas of prime importance .
he added that britain would continue to back a two-state solution in the middle east and pursue a dual approach of " engagement and sanctions " in regard to iran , while backing current moves in the united nations to tighten punitive measures .
prime minister david cameron recently called on the international community to " ratchet up " pressure on tehran through sanctions in a bid to prevent the islamic republic pursuing what the west suspects is a nuclear weapons program .
britain stands more chance of success with eu , say experts " britain 's global policy is going to be shaped by the events which happen during the lifespan of this coalition , " klau said .
" will we see a clear break from labour policies on climate change , financial regulation , iran and the middle east ?
not necessarily .
the middle east in particular was a high priority for blair and this will be the same for cameron . "
" whether this ambitious britain can make a meaningful contribution with global resonance outside of the eu is another matter , " he added .
" all major eu powers must recognise that there 's not much governments can do when they act alone .
the chances of success are low when their efforts are not within the framework of a joint eu initiative .
the best they can hope for is a photo opportunity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say britain can achieve more with the eu than without almut moeller , head of the alfred von oppenheim centre for european policy studies at the german council on foreign relations , agrees that it is impossible for any state to work individually with success on global issues without being part of a framework .
but she believes that britain could actually benefit from being more involved with the eu at this time , not less .
" this is actually a really good opportunity for britain to become more engaged in european policies , " moeller told deutsche welle .
" there is a will to cooperate and a consensus that it makes sense to work together so if the british want pursue certain goals and shape european policies , especially in security and defence issues , then this is the right time .
there are a number of security and defence issues within the lisbon treaty which have stalled and there are no discussions being taken on these .
britain could give these and other policies which are lacking leadership the impetus they need . "

they have promised severe budget cuts to trim the country 's growing deficit . what a difference a day makes .
for the past six months , the center-left social democrats - led by the abrasive jiri paroubek - had been riding high in the opinion polls , heading for what most surveys predicted would be a clear victory : 30 percent , maybe more .
on the actual day , though , it was rather different .
and on sunday , czechs woke to the prospect of having the strongest government in years after one of the biggest political shake-ups since czechoslovakia split in 1993 .
pyrrhic victory there were gasps of surprise at the party 's lidovy dum headquarters on saturday when czech television released exit polls showing the social democrats tied in first place with the civic democrats , both at 20 percent .
but surprise turned to despair as the results came in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democratic party chairman jiri paroubek , resigned after the vote results came in in the end , paroubek 's party scored 22 percent - still the largest party , but a pyrrhic victory if ever there was one .
paroubek resigned almost immediately , conceding it was clear the country was heading for a center-right coalition .
plans to create a minority social democrat adminstration propped up by the communist party lay in tatters .
voters , it appears , had rejected his plans to tax the rich and preserve generous social benefits .
" it seems that people have chosen the direction the country should go in and it is a different direction than the one the social democrats were offering , ” paroubek told reporters , his new wife standing by his side .
czech media reported that waiters at the lidovy dum later circulated with trays of champagne bought to celebrate victory .
no one would touch them .
avoiding greek-style crisis across town , however , the champagne corks were popping at the headquarters of two brand new parliamentary parties : top09 , which was formed out of disgruntled civic democrat and christian democrat members and led by the aristocrat karel schwarzenberg ; and public affairs , a rather mysterious centrist party promoting direct democracy and promising to wage war on corruption .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top09 chairman karel schwarzenberg they came out of nowhere and now control a third of the seats in parliament .
" i 'm hugely pleased with the czech people , " schwarzenberg , whose full title is his serene highness the prince of schwarzenberg , count of sulz , princely landgrave in klettgau , and duke of krumlov .
a former chancellor to ex-president vaclav havel , he 's popular with urban , right-wing voters , and enjoys something of cult status among the young .
" czech voters have rejected demogoguery , rejected the extremists , and have given their votes to us , who did n't promise them anything but who gave them a clear vision of the future . "
that vision is built on fiscal responsibility – slashing public spending to reduce the czech republic 's debt and reforming key expenditures such as pensions and healthcare .
a slap for civic democrats schwarzenberg is already holding talks with the man most likely to become prime minister – petr necas , the interim leader of the conservative civic democrats .
they came second in the poll but unlike the social democrats , they have the potential to put together a majority center-right coalition and will lead efforts to form a new government , together with the centrist public affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech voters chose a path of fiscal responsibility , analysts say but even though the civic democrats - founded in 1991 by vaclav klaus , now president - will play a leading role in the new government , it was not a great election for the party .
they did particularly poorly in prague - a bastion of civic democrat support since the early 1990s .
it used to be said that even vaclav klaus ' tennis racquet could win a seat in prague .
one commentator said that phrase should now be amended : even karel schwarzenberg 's pipe could stand for office and win in the capital , he said .
" there 's not much to celebrate , " civic democrat deputy leader david vodrazka told lidove noviny newspaper .
" the voters – especially in prague – did n't just wave a warning finger at us .
they slapped us round the back of the head . "
day of resignations indeed it was something of an earthquake for czech politics , as voters punished the two big parties - and several smaller ones as well .
paroubek was not the only party leader to resign .
ondrej liska , head of the greens , immediately announced his resignation after his party lost all its seats .
cyril svoboda , leader of the christian democrats , followed suit after his party was unceremoniously kicked out of parliament .
and finally milos zeman – the oafish , heavy drinking former social democrat prime minister known for his brilliant acerbic wit – announced he was resigning after his leftist citizens ' rights party failed to gain enough votes to enter parliament .
but in many ways his was the real success story of the evening – he had developed a personal animosity towards social democrat leader paroubek .
in the end zeman 's party won 4.3 percent – almost all of them social democrat voters , helping to deprive paroubek of the victory he so craved .

they have promised severe budget cuts to trim the country 's growing deficit . what a difference a day makes .
for the past six months , the center-left social democrats - led by the abrasive jiri paroubek - had been riding high in the opinion polls , heading for what most surveys predicted would be a clear victory : 30 percent , maybe more .
on the actual day , though , it was rather different .
and on sunday , czechs woke to the prospect of having the strongest government in years after one of the biggest political shake-ups since czechoslovakia split in 1993 .
pyrrhic victory there were gasps of surprise at the party 's lidovy dum headquarters on saturday when czech television released exit polls showing the social democrats tied in first place with the civic democrats , both at 20 percent .
but surprise turned to despair as the results came in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democratic party chairman jiri paroubek , resigned after the vote results came in in the end , paroubek 's party scored 22 percent - still the largest party , but a pyrrhic victory if ever there was one .
paroubek resigned almost immediately , conceding it was clear the country was heading for a center-right coalition .
plans to create a minority social democrat adminstration propped up by the communist party lay in tatters .
voters , it appears , had rejected his plans to tax the rich and preserve generous social benefits .
" it seems that people have chosen the direction the country should go in and it is a different direction than the one the social democrats were offering , ” paroubek told reporters , his new wife standing by his side .
czech media reported that waiters at the lidovy dum later circulated with trays of champagne bought to celebrate victory .
no one would touch them .
avoiding greek-style crisis across town , however , the champagne corks were popping at the headquarters of two brand new parliamentary parties : top09 , which was formed out of disgruntled civic democrat and christian democrat members and led by the aristocrat karel schwarzenberg ; and public affairs , a rather mysterious centrist party promoting direct democracy and promising to wage war on corruption .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top09 chairman karel schwarzenberg they came out of nowhere and now control a third of the seats in parliament .
" i 'm hugely pleased with the czech people , " schwarzenberg , whose full title is his serene highness the prince of schwarzenberg , count of sulz , princely landgrave in klettgau , and duke of krumlov .
a former chancellor to ex-president vaclav havel , he 's popular with urban , right-wing voters , and enjoys something of cult status among the young .
" czech voters have rejected demogoguery , rejected the extremists , and have given their votes to us , who did n't promise them anything but who gave them a clear vision of the future . "
that vision is built on fiscal responsibility – slashing public spending to reduce the czech republic 's debt and reforming key expenditures such as pensions and healthcare .
a slap for civic democrats schwarzenberg is already holding talks with the man most likely to become prime minister – petr necas , the interim leader of the conservative civic democrats .
they came second in the poll but unlike the social democrats , they have the potential to put together a majority center-right coalition and will lead efforts to form a new government , together with the centrist public affairs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech voters chose a path of fiscal responsibility , analysts say but even though the civic democrats - founded in 1991 by vaclav klaus , now president - will play a leading role in the new government , it was not a great election for the party .
they did particularly poorly in prague - a bastion of civic democrat support since the early 1990s .
it used to be said that even vaclav klaus ' tennis racquet could win a seat in prague .
one commentator said that phrase should now be amended : even karel schwarzenberg 's pipe could stand for office and win in the capital , he said .
" there 's not much to celebrate , " civic democrat deputy leader david vodrazka told lidove noviny newspaper .
" the voters – especially in prague – did n't just wave a warning finger at us .
they slapped us round the back of the head . "
day of resignations indeed it was something of an earthquake for czech politics , as voters punished the two big parties - and several smaller ones as well .
paroubek was not the only party leader to resign .
ondrej liska , head of the greens , immediately announced his resignation after his party lost all its seats .
cyril svoboda , leader of the christian democrats , followed suit after his party was unceremoniously kicked out of parliament .
and finally milos zeman – the oafish , heavy drinking former social democrat prime minister known for his brilliant acerbic wit – announced he was resigning after his leftist citizens ' rights party failed to gain enough votes to enter parliament .
but in many ways his was the real success story of the evening – he had developed a personal animosity towards social democrat leader paroubek .
in the end zeman 's party won 4.3 percent – almost all of them social democrat voters , helping to deprive paroubek of the victory he so craved .

be proud . "
hundreds of foreign residents in russia are victims of violent right-wing extremism every year .
authorities are taking the problem seriously , but xenophobic attitudes are widespread in russian society . on an outdoor court at the university of vladivostok , a group of chinese exchange students are dribbling and shooting hoops in their own corner around a single net , separate from their russian counterparts .
here on the russian pacific coast , these exchange students are only 60 kilometers away from their home country , and yet russia does not feel like home to them .
" they 're afraid for their safety , " one russian student told deutsche welle .
" that 's why they spend entire days here and at the student residences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students usually only leave their dorms in vladivostok in groups when these exchange students do venture into town beyond the safe bubble of their dormitory , lecture halls and the basketball courts , then they only go in groups .
always on guard right-wing extremists in vladivostok have become more active in recent years , stoked by local mistrust of russia 's up-and-coming neighbor china as well as by worries about a weak economy and more foreigners coming into the country .
one chinese student in vladivostok told deutsche welle about her boyfriend 's encounter with a gang of thugs .
" about ten guys broke his nose , " she said .
" just like that , without saying anything . "
the young man ran away from his attackers , but according to his girlfriend , he was n't safe again until he was back at the university .
according to the sova center in moscow , an organization that researches racism and xenophobia , last year in russia around 70 people were killed in racially motivated attacks , while more than 300 were injured .
the center says that moscow and st. petersburg are especially dangerous places for central asians and people from the caucasus .
however , the situation has improved and those numbers have fallen by a third since 2008 .
police and judges are now taking the matter more seriously , according to the center 's director , alexander verkhovsky .
he says special police forces have been established to tackle right-wing extremism and that they have made several arrests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander verkhovsky is director of the anti-racist sova center in moscow a shock for the kremlin however , it took russian authorities some time to recognize the danger of right-wing radicals .
for years , critics of the kremlin felt that the government was more accommodating to extremist nationalists than it was to the country 's democratic opposition .
a turning point came in 2006 when extremists led a deadly pogrom against caucasian-owned businesses and restaurants in the small city of kondopoga , in russia 's northwest karelia region .
according to verkhovsky , it was only when the kremlin realized that it had lost control over kondopoga for a day that the kremlin started taking extremist nationalists seriously .
" it greatly alarmed the government , " said verkhovsky , who said the kremlin saw the event as " a political threat . "
still waters run deep verkhovsky told deutsche welle that the kremlin 's fight against racism has deeper roots than a push to secure power .
according to him , the nation 's authoritarian political climate has made open discussion of the topic taboo .
based on the silence of politicians , he said , many extremists have felt that russian society was on their side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china looms on vladivostok 's horizon " those who are out killing people feel they are pioneering a people 's movement , " he said .
in fact , extremist ideas are deeply anchored in the mindset of russian society .
according to some surveys , 55 percent of russians want to see foreign residents – especially those from central asia or the caucasus – stripped of their rights or even deported , and this , despite the fact that the russian economy depends on the cheap labor of people from these countries .
at the basketball court in vladivostok where chinese exchange students take refuge , many native students are certain that pacific russia 's economic prosperity depends on china .

hundreds of foreign residents in russia are victims of violent right-wing extremism every year .
authorities are taking the problem seriously , but xenophobic attitudes are widespread in russian society . on an outdoor court at the university of vladivostok , a group of chinese exchange students are dribbling and shooting hoops in their own corner around a single net , separate from their russian counterparts .
here on the russian pacific coast , these exchange students are only 60 kilometers away from their home country , and yet russia does not feel like home to them .
" they 're afraid for their safety , " one russian student told deutsche welle .
" that 's why they spend entire days here and at the student residences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students usually only leave their dorms in vladivostok in groups when these exchange students do venture into town beyond the safe bubble of their dormitory , lecture halls and the basketball courts , then they only go in groups .
always on guard right-wing extremists in vladivostok have become more active in recent years , stoked by local mistrust of russia 's up-and-coming neighbor china as well as by worries about a weak economy and more foreigners coming into the country .
one chinese student in vladivostok told deutsche welle about her boyfriend 's encounter with a gang of thugs .
" about ten guys broke his nose , " she said .
" just like that , without saying anything . "
the young man ran away from his attackers , but according to his girlfriend , he was n't safe again until he was back at the university .
according to the sova center in moscow , an organization that researches racism and xenophobia , last year in russia around 70 people were killed in racially motivated attacks , while more than 300 were injured .
the center says that moscow and st. petersburg are especially dangerous places for central asians and people from the caucasus .
however , the situation has improved and those numbers have fallen by a third since 2008 .
police and judges are now taking the matter more seriously , according to the center 's director , alexander verkhovsky .
he says special police forces have been established to tackle right-wing extremism and that they have made several arrests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander verkhovsky is director of the anti-racist sova center in moscow a shock for the kremlin however , it took russian authorities some time to recognize the danger of right-wing radicals .
for years , critics of the kremlin felt that the government was more accommodating to extremist nationalists than it was to the country 's democratic opposition .
a turning point came in 2006 when extremists led a deadly pogrom against caucasian-owned businesses and restaurants in the small city of kondopoga , in russia 's northwest karelia region .
according to verkhovsky , it was only when the kremlin realized that it had lost control over kondopoga for a day that the kremlin started taking extremist nationalists seriously .
" it greatly alarmed the government , " said verkhovsky , who said the kremlin saw the event as " a political threat . "
still waters run deep verkhovsky told deutsche welle that the kremlin 's fight against racism has deeper roots than a push to secure power .
according to him , the nation 's authoritarian political climate has made open discussion of the topic taboo .
based on the silence of politicians , he said , many extremists have felt that russian society was on their side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china looms on vladivostok 's horizon " those who are out killing people feel they are pioneering a people 's movement , " he said .
in fact , extremist ideas are deeply anchored in the mindset of russian society .
according to some surveys , 55 percent of russians want to see foreign residents – especially those from central asia or the caucasus – stripped of their rights or even deported , and this , despite the fact that the russian economy depends on the cheap labor of people from these countries .
at the basketball court in vladivostok where chinese exchange students take refuge , many native students are certain that pacific russia 's economic prosperity depends on china .

laws , whose job had been to oversee cuts to public spending , stood down over expenses revelations . cabinet minister david laws has stepped down from his high-ranking position in britain 's financial ministry after only 18 day in office , following revelations about expenses and his private life .
laws , a member of the liberal democrat party , resigned from his position as chief secretary to the treasury after the daily telegraph newspaper reported he had claimed more than 40,000 pounds -lrb- 47,100 euros , $ 57,800 -rrb- in expenses to pay rent to his long-term male partner .
" i do not see how i can carry out my crucial work on the budget and spending review while i have to deal with the private and public implications of recent revelations , ” laws said in a statement on saturday .
the millionaire former banker said he had not disclosed the financial arrangement due to his " desire to keep my sexuality a secret . "
he said he had not considered himself in breach of rules on expenses because he and his partner , lobbyist james lundie , had separate bank accounts and led separate social lives .
public spending cuts in his position at the finance ministry , laws was deputy to chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- george osborne .
the pair were overseeing tough austerity cuts aimed at reducing britain 's budget deficit , which stands at about 156 billion pounds , exceeding 11 percent of gross domestic product .
the british government last week agreed to immediate spending cuts totaling some 6 billion pounds .
the resignation is an early blow for britain 's first coalition government for 65 years , formed between britain 's conservative and liberal democrat parties .

laws , whose job had been to oversee cuts to public spending , stood down over expenses revelations . cabinet minister david laws has stepped down from his high-ranking position in britain 's financial ministry after only 18 day in office , following revelations about expenses and his private life .
laws , a member of the liberal democrat party , resigned from his position as chief secretary to the treasury after the daily telegraph newspaper reported he had claimed more than 40,000 pounds -lrb- 47,100 euros , $ 57,800 -rrb- in expenses to pay rent to his long-term male partner .
" i do not see how i can carry out my crucial work on the budget and spending review while i have to deal with the private and public implications of recent revelations , ” laws said in a statement on saturday .
the millionaire former banker said he had not disclosed the financial arrangement due to his " desire to keep my sexuality a secret . "
he said he had not considered himself in breach of rules on expenses because he and his partner , lobbyist james lundie , had separate bank accounts and led separate social lives .
public spending cuts in his position at the finance ministry , laws was deputy to chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- george osborne .
the pair were overseeing tough austerity cuts aimed at reducing britain 's budget deficit , which stands at about 156 billion pounds , exceeding 11 percent of gross domestic product .
the british government last week agreed to immediate spending cuts totaling some 6 billion pounds .
the resignation is an early blow for britain 's first coalition government for 65 years , formed between britain 's conservative and liberal democrat parties .
conservative prime minister david cameron called laws ' decision " honorable . "
the liberal democrat leader , deputy prime minister nick clegg , said laws had taken a " very painful decision . " rc / reuters / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hague said relations with washington would be " solid but not slavish " and pointedly omitted any reference to the phrase " special relationship " which has been a staple in statements referring to ties between the uk and the united states .
while attempting to distance britain from the image of being the " poodle " of successive us governments , hague 's " vision of a new , distinctive british foreign policy " did not suggest that europe would be the main beneficiary of the new government 's change of direction on the world stage .
instead of turning its attention to the power base of european politics across the water , hague said britain would develop its own identity and strategic role , following a new foreign-policy agenda which would differ in its " reach and ambition " from that pursued by the previous labour governments .
as well as confirming that britain would not join the euro-zone over the next five years of the new parliament , hague - a well-known eurosceptic - rejected ideas of further and deeper political union with brussels and instead announced the government 's desire for " freeing up the single market to boost economic growth . "
hague says britain will stay out eu 's financial structures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hague said that britain would stay out of eu financial affairs britain , hague said , would not be contributing to the financial assistance offered to the beleaguered economies of the euro-zone in the foreseeable future as it would be " difficult at a time of economic constraint . "
however , while distancing britain from the eu , hague said that his government would like the eu to " use its collective weight more effectively on the world stage . "
" in terms of joining the euro zone and keeping out of the bailout operations , this shows continuity with labour 's views on these topics , " thomas klau , head of the paris office of the european council for foreign relations and an eu expert , told deutsche welle .
" what cameron and hague have shown so far in europe , and indeed in washington , is that continuity is set to prevail over radical change . "
" earlier fears that a tory or tory-liberal coalition government would usher in an era of clashes with the eu so far hav n't materialised , " he added .
" this is largely down to the liberals ' inclusion in the coalition and the tories making it clear they wo n't be stepping into margaret thatcher 's shoes and waving her handbag about .
they may be talking tough on the eu but it does n't represent a huge shift away from polices labour adopted under tony blair . "
" in terms of questioning the eu 's role in the world , there was some concern that the tories would set up in opposition to the lisbon treaty and try to undermine the eu 's regulations governing its operations abroad , " klau said .
" there were even fears that they would be down right hostile to this but again , there has been little indication as yet that this will be the case .
hague has said that the eu should have a crucial role in certain areas , especially dealing with non-eu members , specifically russia .
so this policy announcement did n't really include anything worrying or shocking for the eu . "
with the eu kept at arms length and the cosiness of former relations with the us reduced to a firm handshake , the new british foreign policy agenda focuses heavily on london 's ambition to make its influence felt on the world stage . new emphasis on taking lead on global issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan and the middle east are priorities for britain rejecting ideas that britain was in strategic and influential decline , hague targeted increased engagement and cooperation with the emerging economies in the world and deepening of relations with countries in the gulf and the middle east , along with brazil , japan , india and china .
foreign engagement would " run through the veins of the entire administration , " hague said , announcing the creation of a newly-established national security council which would ensure that the " new philosophy will be translated into action . "
hague highlighted britain 's continued role in afghanistan , where the uk has 9,500 troops deployed , and relations with pakistan as areas of prime importance .
he added that britain would continue to back a two-state solution in the middle east and pursue a dual approach of " engagement and sanctions " in regard to iran , while backing current moves in the united nations to tighten punitive measures .
prime minister david cameron recently called on the international community to " ratchet up " pressure on tehran through sanctions in a bid to prevent the islamic republic pursuing what the west suspects is a nuclear weapons program .
britain stands more chance of success with eu , say experts " britain 's global policy is going to be shaped by the events which happen during the lifespan of this coalition , " klau said .
" will we see a clear break from labour policies on climate change , financial regulation , iran and the middle east ?
not necessarily .
the middle east in particular was a high priority for blair and this will be the same for cameron . "
" whether this ambitious britain can make a meaningful contribution with global resonance outside of the eu is another matter , " he added .
" all major eu powers must recognise that there 's not much governments can do when they act alone .
the chances of success are low when their efforts are not within the framework of a joint eu initiative .
the best they can hope for is a photo opportunity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say britain can achieve more with the eu than without almut moeller , head of the alfred von oppenheim centre for european policy studies at the german council on foreign relations , agrees that it is impossible for any state to work individually with success on global issues without being part of a framework .
but she believes that britain could actually benefit from being more involved with the eu at this time , not less .
" this is actually a really good opportunity for britain to become more engaged in european policies , " moeller told deutsche welle .
" there is a will to cooperate and a consensus that it makes sense to work together so if the british want pursue certain goals and shape european policies , especially in security and defence issues , then this is the right time .
there are a number of security and defence issues within the lisbon treaty which have stalled and there are no discussions being taken on these .
britain could give these and other policies which are lacking leadership the impetus they need . "

to keep it up against serbia , manuel neuer will have to keep things tidy in goal . manuel neuer 's career is stuck in fast-forward .
the goalkeeper was just 20 when he deposed seasoned no.1 frank rost between the sticks at schalke .
at the age of 21 , he was the penalty-saving hero as his hometown club found itself in the champions league quarter-finals .
last summer , he was part of the germany under-21 team that won the european championships .
and now this summer he 's been trusted with keeping goal for the full side at the world cup .
" i feel ready for the task , " neuer told sport bild newspaper before the tournament .
jens lehmann is among those who are n't as sure .
" if we want to be world champions , it would be difficult to imagine it with manuel neuer as our number one goalkeeper , " the former national ' keeper told bild .
" he has made mistakes over and over again .
but i do like neuer , he will make a good goalkeeper one day . "
whether that day has yet come is something that will become clear as the tournament progresses - but neuer himself seems to have no problem with lehmann ’ s comments - time and again , he names the former arsenal man as one of his idols .
bildunterschrift : the world cup will be another leap forward for the schalke man all the tools in his locker neuer has just six international caps to date , and coming into the tournament none of them had been in competitive games .
he made his debut less than a year ago , impressing against the united arab emirates .
but he was at fault for ivory coast 's first goal in a friendly in november 2009 , his clearance bouncing off emmanuel eboue and into the goal .
picked for germany 's recent world cup warm-up against with malta , he had a quiet evening , but stayed alert enough to make one superb save and deny roderick briffa .
the hallmark of a top-level goalkeeper .
therein lies the frustration many feel with neuer 's ability .
he is an unrivalled shot-stopper , but prone to costly lapses in concentration .
he might grow out of it , he 's only 24 .
neuer is a one-club man , born in gelsenkirchen and on the books at schalke since the age of five .
he got his chance in the first-team early in the 2006-07 season , and has n't relinquished the position since .
" it all happened so fast , there was no time to think about the whole situation , " said the young keeper .
in his second season as no.1 he made two point-blank saves in normal time , and two more in the penalty shoot-out , to drop fc porto and win schalke a place in the last eight of the champions league .
he finished this season in confident fashion with a penalty save against bundesliga rivals mainz , showing a penalty-stopping specialism that augurs well with tournament football approaching .
neuer , who stands at around 195cm -lrb- 6 ' 5 " -rrb- , is both imposing and agile .
germany would do well to use his strong throw to launch quick counter attacks , as schalke have done to good effect .
involvement in several contentious incidents in last september 's ruhr derby against dortmund shows a feisty side to his character .
moreover , neuer is a commanding figure for the defenders in front of him .
it 's an important consideration for national coach joachim loew , with the gloves of lehmann - not to mention greats like oliver kahn and toni schumacher - still to be filled .

to keep it up against serbia , manuel neuer will have to keep things tidy in goal . manuel neuer 's career is stuck in fast-forward .
the goalkeeper was just 20 when he deposed seasoned no.1 frank rost between the sticks at schalke .
at the age of 21 , he was the penalty-saving hero as his hometown club found itself in the champions league quarter-finals .
last summer , he was part of the germany under-21 team that won the european championships .
and now this summer he 's been trusted with keeping goal for the full side at the world cup .
" i feel ready for the task , " neuer told sport bild newspaper before the tournament .
jens lehmann is among those who are n't as sure .
" if we want to be world champions , it would be difficult to imagine it with manuel neuer as our number one goalkeeper , " the former national ' keeper told bild .
" he has made mistakes over and over again .
but i do like neuer , he will make a good goalkeeper one day . "
whether that day has yet come is something that will become clear as the tournament progresses - but neuer himself seems to have no problem with lehmann ’ s comments - time and again , he names the former arsenal man as one of his idols .
bildunterschrift : the world cup will be another leap forward for the schalke man all the tools in his locker neuer has just six international caps to date , and coming into the tournament none of them had been in competitive games .
he made his debut less than a year ago , impressing against the united arab emirates .
but he was at fault for ivory coast 's first goal in a friendly in november 2009 , his clearance bouncing off emmanuel eboue and into the goal .
picked for germany 's recent world cup warm-up against with malta , he had a quiet evening , but stayed alert enough to make one superb save and deny roderick briffa .
the hallmark of a top-level goalkeeper .
therein lies the frustration many feel with neuer 's ability .
he is an unrivalled shot-stopper , but prone to costly lapses in concentration .
he might grow out of it , he 's only 24 .
neuer is a one-club man , born in gelsenkirchen and on the books at schalke since the age of five .
he got his chance in the first-team early in the 2006-07 season , and has n't relinquished the position since .
" it all happened so fast , there was no time to think about the whole situation , " said the young keeper .
in his second season as no.1 he made two point-blank saves in normal time , and two more in the penalty shoot-out , to drop fc porto and win schalke a place in the last eight of the champions league .
he finished this season in confident fashion with a penalty save against bundesliga rivals mainz , showing a penalty-stopping specialism that augurs well with tournament football approaching .
neuer , who stands at around 195cm -lrb- 6 ' 5 " -rrb- , is both imposing and agile .
germany would do well to use his strong throw to launch quick counter attacks , as schalke have done to good effect .
involvement in several contentious incidents in last september 's ruhr derby against dortmund shows a feisty side to his character .
moreover , neuer is a commanding figure for the defenders in front of him .
it 's an important consideration for national coach joachim loew , with the gloves of lehmann - not to mention greats like oliver kahn and toni schumacher - still to be filled .

he finished this season in confident fashion with a penalty save against bundesliga rivals mainz , showing a penalty-stopping specialism that augurs well with tournament football approaching .
neuer , who stands at around 195cm -lrb- 6 ' 5 " -rrb- , is both imposing and agile .
germany would do well to use his strong throw to launch quick counter attacks , as schalke have done to good effect .
involvement in several contentious incidents in last september 's ruhr derby against dortmund shows a feisty side to his character .
moreover , neuer is a commanding figure for the defenders in front of him .
it 's an important consideration for national coach joachim loew , with the gloves of lehmann - not to mention greats like oliver kahn and toni schumacher - still to be filled .

central defender heiko westermann is the latest first-team player to be ruled out of the competition , having fractured his left foot in saturday 's 3-0 friendly win against hungary in budapest .
" heiko would have played a very important role at the world cup for our team .
that is because of his multi-faceted play .
in training he was in superb physical condition , " loew said .
the 27-year-old central defender , who has 19 caps , played a crucial role in schalke 's failed push for the bundesliga title this season , cementing himself as a regular in the national team in the process .
" naturally i am devastated because it was my big goal to take part in the world cup , " said westermann .
" i felt fully fit but now the only thing left for me to do is to wish the team all the best at the tournament . "
bildunterschrift : torn ankle ligaments have already sidelined captain michael ballack five down , 23 required westermann is the fifth german player to be ruled out of the world cup with injury in a matter of weeks .
captain michael ballack is out with an ankle ligament injury , with fellow midfielders christian traesch and simon rolfes also unable to represent their country .
first choice goalkeeper rene adler 's broken ribs mean that westermann 's schalke team mate , manuel neuer , will wear the number one shirt in south africa .
both adler and neuer are relatively new to international soccer , after the tragic suicide of former first choice goalie robert enke late last year .
coach joachim loew , still with one of the strongest squads of any of the 32 world cup competitors at his disposal , must name his final 23-man selection for the competition on tuesday .

red bull team mates sebastian vettel and mark webber crashed while fighting for the lead ; vettel retired , webber salvaged third place . mclaren 's pair of british world champions could scarcely believe their luck in istanbul , when an inter-team crash ahead of them left them with an easy one-two finish at the turkish grand prix .
red bull 's mark webber was leading at roughly two-thirds race distance , ahead of german team mate sebastian vettel , with the mclarens pressuring behind in third and fourth places .
then the red bull duo evidently forgot motor sport 's golden rule : never take out your team mate .
vettel tried an ambitious overtaking maneuver on webber 's red bull , and the pair collided .
the german retired immediately , while webber had to pit for repairs and finished up in third place .
" it 's stupid between team mates , but i should have been given the necessary space , " vettel lamented in the pit lane after retiring , blaming webber for the collision .

hamilton watched the red bull crash from his cockpit , saying it was " like an action movie in 3d .
" i do n't know what happened , " he said in the winner 's press conference , " but they collided and we got past them , and then we had a bit of a battle - a fair one , i must say - before the end . "
button , who succeeded hamilton as world champion in 2009 , also complemented his team mate for keeping the battle between them clean .
meanwhile , a disappointed red bull team boss christian horner also offered indirect praise to the mclaren duo , saying he wished his drivers had shown similar restraint under pressure .

red bull team mates sebastian vettel and mark webber crashed while fighting for the lead ; vettel retired , webber salvaged third place . mclaren 's pair of british world champions could scarcely believe their luck in istanbul , when an inter-team crash ahead of them left them with an easy one-two finish at the turkish grand prix .
red bull 's mark webber was leading at roughly two-thirds race distance , ahead of german team mate sebastian vettel , with the mclarens pressuring behind in third and fourth places .
then the red bull duo evidently forgot motor sport 's golden rule : never take out your team mate .
vettel tried an ambitious overtaking maneuver on webber 's red bull , and the pair collided .
the german retired immediately , while webber had to pit for repairs and finished up in third place .
" it 's stupid between team mates , but i should have been given the necessary space , " vettel lamented in the pit lane after retiring , blaming webber for the collision .
" it was a disaster , " webber said afterwards , although he did n't share vettel 's interpretation of the crash .
" it can happen .
he had a slight speed advantage , but he turned right into me and made contact and … well , that was it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel 's car was ruined in the crash , webber managed to limp home the crash was the latest in a string of problems that have stopped red bull , whose car still seems the class of the field , from converting their pace into results .
" all we ask for " after the crash , mclaren 's british world champions hamilton and button had their own wheel-to-wheel battle for the lead , but they managed to keep it fairly clean , with only minimal contact between the pair .
hamilton watched the red bull crash from his cockpit , saying it was " like an action movie in 3d .
" i do n't know what happened , " he said in the winner 's press conference , " but they collided and we got past them , and then we had a bit of a battle - a fair one , i must say - before the end . "
button , who succeeded hamilton as world champion in 2009 , also complemented his team mate for keeping the battle between them clean .
meanwhile , a disappointed red bull team boss christian horner also offered indirect praise to the mclaren duo , saying he wished his drivers had shown similar restraint under pressure .
" we saw lewis -lrb- hamilton -rrb- and jenson -lrb- button -rrb- racing each other and giving each other space .
that 's all we ask for , " he said .
schumacher 's best of the season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : normally strong , ferrari had a difficult day in the mid-field returning seven-time champion michael schumacher finished in fourth for mercedes , with his german team mate nico rosberg glued to his gearbox in fifth .
fourth position is the best result of 2010 for schumacher , who is still looking for his first podium finish since launching a comeback this season .
the two mercedes drivers managed to keep the hard-charging renault of robert kubica at bay throughout the race , but lacked the pace to challenge the leaders .
adrian sutil finished ninth for force india , behind the ferraris of felipe massa and fernando alonso , meaning that three of the six germans on the grid scored points in turkey .
in the race for the world championship , third place was enough to maintain mark webber 's lead in the standings , but the mclaren duo of button and hamilton are close behind .
vettel 's retirement means he drops to fifth in the standings , behind ferrari 's fernando alonso .
but vettel , webber , and red bull will all be wondering how large their leads over the competition might have been , had the first seven races of the season ran more smoothly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.05.2010 continuity trumps change as ambitious britain sets foreign policy goals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's tory-liberal coalition wants to lead on global issues britain 's recently elected coalition government announced a set of new and ambitious foreign policy goals this week with a focus on leading - not following - on global issues . britain 's new conservative-liberal coalition government gave the clearest signs yet that the years of slavishly following a policy line drawn by united states were over as foreign secretary william hague announced the uk 's new foreign policy agenda in london on thursday .
hague said relations with washington would be " solid but not slavish " and pointedly omitted any reference to the phrase " special relationship " which has been a staple in statements referring to ties between the uk and the united states .
while attempting to distance britain from the image of being the " poodle " of successive us governments , hague 's " vision of a new , distinctive british foreign policy " did not suggest that europe would be the main beneficiary of the new government 's change of direction on the world stage .
instead of turning its attention to the power base of european politics across the water , hague said britain would develop its own identity and strategic role , following a new foreign-policy agenda which would differ in its " reach and ambition " from that pursued by the previous labour governments .
as well as confirming that britain would not join the euro-zone over the next five years of the new parliament , hague - a well-known eurosceptic - rejected ideas of further and deeper political union with brussels and instead announced the government 's desire for " freeing up the single market to boost economic growth . "
hague says britain will stay out eu 's financial structures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hague said that britain would stay out of eu financial affairs britain , hague said , would not be contributing to the financial assistance offered to the beleaguered economies of the euro-zone in the foreseeable future as it would be " difficult at a time of economic constraint . "
however , while distancing britain from the eu , hague said that his government would like the eu to " use its collective weight more effectively on the world stage . "
" in terms of joining the euro zone and keeping out of the bailout operations , this shows continuity with labour 's views on these topics , " thomas klau , head of the paris office of the european council for foreign relations and an eu expert , told deutsche welle .
" what cameron and hague have shown so far in europe , and indeed in washington , is that continuity is set to prevail over radical change . "
" earlier fears that a tory or tory-liberal coalition government would usher in an era of clashes with the eu so far hav n't materialised , " he added .
" this is largely down to the liberals ' inclusion in the coalition and the tories making it clear they wo n't be stepping into margaret thatcher 's shoes and waving her handbag about .
they may be talking tough on the eu but it does n't represent a huge shift away from polices labour adopted under tony blair . "
" in terms of questioning the eu 's role in the world , there was some concern that the tories would set up in opposition to the lisbon treaty and try to undermine the eu 's regulations governing its operations abroad , " klau said .
" there were even fears that they would be down right hostile to this but again , there has been little indication as yet that this will be the case .
hague has said that the eu should have a crucial role in certain areas , especially dealing with non-eu members , specifically russia .
so this policy announcement did n't really include anything worrying or shocking for the eu . "
with the eu kept at arms length and the cosiness of former relations with the us reduced to a firm handshake , the new british foreign policy agenda focuses heavily on london 's ambition to make its influence felt on the world stage . new emphasis on taking lead on global issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan and the middle east are priorities for britain rejecting ideas that britain was in strategic and influential decline , hague targeted increased engagement and cooperation with the emerging economies in the world and deepening of relations with countries in the gulf and the middle east , along with brazil , japan , india and china .
foreign engagement would " run through the veins of the entire administration , " hague said , announcing the creation of a newly-established national security council which would ensure that the " new philosophy will be translated into action . "
hague highlighted britain 's continued role in afghanistan , where the uk has 9,500 troops deployed , and relations with pakistan as areas of prime importance .
he added that britain would continue to back a two-state solution in the middle east and pursue a dual approach of " engagement and sanctions " in regard to iran , while backing current moves in the united nations to tighten punitive measures .
prime minister david cameron recently called on the international community to " ratchet up " pressure on tehran through sanctions in a bid to prevent the islamic republic pursuing what the west suspects is a nuclear weapons program .
britain stands more chance of success with eu , say experts " britain 's global policy is going to be shaped by the events which happen during the lifespan of this coalition , " klau said .
" will we see a clear break from labour policies on climate change , financial regulation , iran and the middle east ?
not necessarily .
the middle east in particular was a high priority for blair and this will be the same for cameron . "
" whether this ambitious britain can make a meaningful contribution with global resonance outside of the eu is another matter , " he added .
" all major eu powers must recognise that there 's not much governments can do when they act alone .
the chances of success are low when their efforts are not within the framework of a joint eu initiative .
the best they can hope for is a photo opportunity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say britain can achieve more with the eu than without almut moeller , head of the alfred von oppenheim centre for european policy studies at the german council on foreign relations , agrees that it is impossible for any state to work individually with success on global issues without being part of a framework .
but she believes that britain could actually benefit from being more involved with the eu at this time , not less .
" this is actually a really good opportunity for britain to become more engaged in european policies , " moeller told deutsche welle .
" there is a will to cooperate and a consensus that it makes sense to work together so if the british want pursue certain goals and shape european policies , especially in security and defence issues , then this is the right time .
there are a number of security and defence issues within the lisbon treaty which have stalled and there are no discussions being taken on these .
britain could give these and other policies which are lacking leadership the impetus they need . "

to keep it up against serbia , manuel neuer will have to keep things tidy in goal . manuel neuer 's career is stuck in fast-forward .
the goalkeeper was just 20 when he deposed seasoned no.1 frank rost between the sticks at schalke .
at the age of 21 , he was the penalty-saving hero as his hometown club found itself in the champions league quarter-finals .
last summer , he was part of the germany under-21 team that won the european championships .
and now this summer he 's been trusted with keeping goal for the full side at the world cup .
" i feel ready for the task , " neuer told sport bild newspaper before the tournament .
jens lehmann is among those who are n't as sure .
" if we want to be world champions , it would be difficult to imagine it with manuel neuer as our number one goalkeeper , " the former national ' keeper told bild .
" he has made mistakes over and over again .
but i do like neuer , he will make a good goalkeeper one day . "
whether that day has yet come is something that will become clear as the tournament progresses - but neuer himself seems to have no problem with lehmann ’ s comments - time and again , he names the former arsenal man as one of his idols .
bildunterschrift : the world cup will be another leap forward for the schalke man all the tools in his locker neuer has just six international caps to date , and coming into the tournament none of them had been in competitive games .
he made his debut less than a year ago , impressing against the united arab emirates .
but he was at fault for ivory coast 's first goal in a friendly in november 2009 , his clearance bouncing off emmanuel eboue and into the goal .
picked for germany 's recent world cup warm-up against with malta , he had a quiet evening , but stayed alert enough to make one superb save and deny roderick briffa .
the hallmark of a top-level goalkeeper .
therein lies the frustration many feel with neuer 's ability .
he is an unrivalled shot-stopper , but prone to costly lapses in concentration .
he might grow out of it , he 's only 24 .
neuer is a one-club man , born in gelsenkirchen and on the books at schalke since the age of five .
he got his chance in the first-team early in the 2006-07 season , and has n't relinquished the position since .
" it all happened so fast , there was no time to think about the whole situation , " said the young keeper .
in his second season as no.1 he made two point-blank saves in normal time , and two more in the penalty shoot-out , to drop fc porto and win schalke a place in the last eight of the champions league .
he finished this season in confident fashion with a penalty save against bundesliga rivals mainz , showing a penalty-stopping specialism that augurs well with tournament football approaching .
neuer , who stands at around 195cm -lrb- 6 ' 5 " -rrb- , is both imposing and agile .
germany would do well to use his strong throw to launch quick counter attacks , as schalke have done to good effect .
involvement in several contentious incidents in last september 's ruhr derby against dortmund shows a feisty side to his character .
moreover , neuer is a commanding figure for the defenders in front of him .
it 's an important consideration for national coach joachim loew , with the gloves of lehmann - not to mention greats like oliver kahn and toni schumacher - still to be filled .

to keep it up against serbia , manuel neuer will have to keep things tidy in goal . manuel neuer 's career is stuck in fast-forward .
the goalkeeper was just 20 when he deposed seasoned no.1 frank rost between the sticks at schalke .
at the age of 21 , he was the penalty-saving hero as his hometown club found itself in the champions league quarter-finals .
last summer , he was part of the germany under-21 team that won the european championships .
and now this summer he 's been trusted with keeping goal for the full side at the world cup .
" i feel ready for the task , " neuer told sport bild newspaper before the tournament .
jens lehmann is among those who are n't as sure .
" if we want to be world champions , it would be difficult to imagine it with manuel neuer as our number one goalkeeper , " the former national ' keeper told bild .
" he has made mistakes over and over again .
but i do like neuer , he will make a good goalkeeper one day . "
whether that day has yet come is something that will become clear as the tournament progresses - but neuer himself seems to have no problem with lehmann ’ s comments - time and again , he names the former arsenal man as one of his idols .
bildunterschrift : the world cup will be another leap forward for the schalke man all the tools in his locker neuer has just six international caps to date , and coming into the tournament none of them had been in competitive games .
he made his debut less than a year ago , impressing against the united arab emirates .
but he was at fault for ivory coast 's first goal in a friendly in november 2009 , his clearance bouncing off emmanuel eboue and into the goal .
picked for germany 's recent world cup warm-up against with malta , he had a quiet evening , but stayed alert enough to make one superb save and deny roderick briffa .
the hallmark of a top-level goalkeeper .
therein lies the frustration many feel with neuer 's ability .
he is an unrivalled shot-stopper , but prone to costly lapses in concentration .
he might grow out of it , he 's only 24 .
neuer is a one-club man , born in gelsenkirchen and on the books at schalke since the age of five .
he got his chance in the first-team early in the 2006-07 season , and has n't relinquished the position since .
" it all happened so fast , there was no time to think about the whole situation , " said the young keeper .
in his second season as no.1 he made two point-blank saves in normal time , and two more in the penalty shoot-out , to drop fc porto and win schalke a place in the last eight of the champions league .
he finished this season in confident fashion with a penalty save against bundesliga rivals mainz , showing a penalty-stopping specialism that augurs well with tournament football approaching .
neuer , who stands at around 195cm -lrb- 6 ' 5 " -rrb- , is both imposing and agile .
germany would do well to use his strong throw to launch quick counter attacks , as schalke have done to good effect .
involvement in several contentious incidents in last september 's ruhr derby against dortmund shows a feisty side to his character .
moreover , neuer is a commanding figure for the defenders in front of him .
it 's an important consideration for national coach joachim loew , with the gloves of lehmann - not to mention greats like oliver kahn and toni schumacher - still to be filled .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 30.05.2010 czech students restore historic dance hall in the sudetenland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in its prime , this former dance hall hosted many parties after decades of neglect during the communist era , a group of students in the czech republic has taken the initiative to fix up some of the sudetenland 's cultural monuments .
topping the list : a historic dance hall . it 's early enough for morning fog to be still hanging above the high ash mountains in the sudetenland - a part of the czech republic annexed by nazi germany in the build-up to the second world war .
despite the early hour , a small group of students has already put in quite a trip to be here .
a mini-bus has brought them along meandering roads , through pine forests and villages that nestle between peaks in the hilly landscape .
at the end of the long drive is an old house in the woods .
it 's made of wood , but apart from the roof and the support beams , not much is left .
it 's just a ruin in the forest , but this group is determined to change that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stained glass cast colorful silhouettes of the dancers from the dance floor " we have tools here : rakes , shovels , brooms - that sort of thing , " says tomas hradil , head of the student group that is working on the house .
" first we 'll make things clean and tidy .
flood waters have washed away the stones , so we have to stack them around the perimeter .
then we 'll give it all a once over with a scythe . "
hradil is in his late thirties , and sports a full , dark beard .
his handshake is strong , but as his students fan out and get to work around him , hradil lets out a sigh and shows he has a soft spot for the ruined building in the woods .
" look around here , there used to be stairs that led up to the top floor , " he says .
" now all you see are the stone foundations .
the wood and all the ornamentation were removed by people over the years and taken back to their own homes . "
a bright stage for dancing when it opened in 1904 , the building was a dance hall in the middle of the forest , and it shone elegantly in its prime .
the outer walls consisted of window frames , filled with colored panes in art nouveau style .
inside was a single large room and a dance floor , and crystal chandeliers hung from the ceiling .
people from the entire area came whenever there was a reason to celebrate .
they were mostly germans , but czechs and poles came as well .
today there 's nothing left of the original building other than the foundation and supports - and the dreams of the students who are working to restore it .
" how magnificent it must have been when these windows still shone with all their colors ! " says one of hradil 's students .
" when they had a party here , and everything was brightly lit , and you could see the silhouettes of the people who were dancing inside , and hear the music outside … " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomas hradil heads the student group ' brontosaurus ' today , shards of the art nouveau windows lie all around the building .
hradil says vandals smashed the glass .
if it were up to him , he would rebuild the whole dance hall , but that project is a bit too big for the time being .
financial limitations keep his group , which calls itself ' brontosaurus , ' from undertaking anything too big .
in the past , old fountains on the hiking path near the spa town of jesenik have been restored , and new nature trails through the mountainous country have been blazed .
now , the student volunteers who come from all over the czech republic on their holidays have their sights set on the old dance hall .
if they ca n't fully reconstruct it , they hope at least to keep it from collapsing .
relics from the past should the project ever reach a point where a full reconstruction is possible , hradil thinks he 'd be able to count on some locals to help in tracking down some of the original contents .
" we 've come to realize that the people who stripped the building of all the valuables have actually done us a service , " says hradil .
" the people did n't want to give the communist regime the satisfaction of getting them .
and now they are contacting us , because they heard we are working on restructuring the hall . "
as word spreads about the project , items from the dance hall are slowly being returned .
little gestures like these are like a small miracle in the sudetenland , which had once been lost and forgotten for decades .

hague said relations with washington would be " solid but not slavish " and pointedly omitted any reference to the phrase " special relationship " which has been a staple in statements referring to ties between the uk and the united states .
while attempting to distance britain from the image of being the " poodle " of successive us governments , hague 's " vision of a new , distinctive british foreign policy " did not suggest that europe would be the main beneficiary of the new government 's change of direction on the world stage .
instead of turning its attention to the power base of european politics across the water , hague said britain would develop its own identity and strategic role , following a new foreign-policy agenda which would differ in its " reach and ambition " from that pursued by the previous labour governments .
as well as confirming that britain would not join the euro-zone over the next five years of the new parliament , hague - a well-known eurosceptic - rejected ideas of further and deeper political union with brussels and instead announced the government 's desire for " freeing up the single market to boost economic growth . "
hague says britain will stay out eu 's financial structures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hague said that britain would stay out of eu financial affairs britain , hague said , would not be contributing to the financial assistance offered to the beleaguered economies of the euro-zone in the foreseeable future as it would be " difficult at a time of economic constraint . "
however , while distancing britain from the eu , hague said that his government would like the eu to " use its collective weight more effectively on the world stage . "
" in terms of joining the euro zone and keeping out of the bailout operations , this shows continuity with labour 's views on these topics , " thomas klau , head of the paris office of the european council for foreign relations and an eu expert , told deutsche welle .
" what cameron and hague have shown so far in europe , and indeed in washington , is that continuity is set to prevail over radical change . "
" earlier fears that a tory or tory-liberal coalition government would usher in an era of clashes with the eu so far hav n't materialised , " he added .
" this is largely down to the liberals ' inclusion in the coalition and the tories making it clear they wo n't be stepping into margaret thatcher 's shoes and waving her handbag about .
they may be talking tough on the eu but it does n't represent a huge shift away from polices labour adopted under tony blair . "
" in terms of questioning the eu 's role in the world , there was some concern that the tories would set up in opposition to the lisbon treaty and try to undermine the eu 's regulations governing its operations abroad , " klau said .
" there were even fears that they would be down right hostile to this but again , there has been little indication as yet that this will be the case .
hague has said that the eu should have a crucial role in certain areas , especially dealing with non-eu members , specifically russia .
so this policy announcement did n't really include anything worrying or shocking for the eu . "
with the eu kept at arms length and the cosiness of former relations with the us reduced to a firm handshake , the new british foreign policy agenda focuses heavily on london 's ambition to make its influence felt on the world stage . new emphasis on taking lead on global issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan and the middle east are priorities for britain rejecting ideas that britain was in strategic and influential decline , hague targeted increased engagement and cooperation with the emerging economies in the world and deepening of relations with countries in the gulf and the middle east , along with brazil , japan , india and china .
foreign engagement would " run through the veins of the entire administration , " hague said , announcing the creation of a newly-established national security council which would ensure that the " new philosophy will be translated into action . "
hague highlighted britain 's continued role in afghanistan , where the uk has 9,500 troops deployed , and relations with pakistan as areas of prime importance .
he added that britain would continue to back a two-state solution in the middle east and pursue a dual approach of " engagement and sanctions " in regard to iran , while backing current moves in the united nations to tighten punitive measures .
prime minister david cameron recently called on the international community to " ratchet up " pressure on tehran through sanctions in a bid to prevent the islamic republic pursuing what the west suspects is a nuclear weapons program .
britain stands more chance of success with eu , say experts " britain 's global policy is going to be shaped by the events which happen during the lifespan of this coalition , " klau said .
" will we see a clear break from labour policies on climate change , financial regulation , iran and the middle east ?
not necessarily .
the middle east in particular was a high priority for blair and this will be the same for cameron . "
" whether this ambitious britain can make a meaningful contribution with global resonance outside of the eu is another matter , " he added .
" all major eu powers must recognise that there 's not much governments can do when they act alone .
the chances of success are low when their efforts are not within the framework of a joint eu initiative .
the best they can hope for is a photo opportunity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say britain can achieve more with the eu than without almut moeller , head of the alfred von oppenheim centre for european policy studies at the german council on foreign relations , agrees that it is impossible for any state to work individually with success on global issues without being part of a framework .
but she believes that britain could actually benefit from being more involved with the eu at this time , not less .
" this is actually a really good opportunity for britain to become more engaged in european policies , " moeller told deutsche welle .
" there is a will to cooperate and a consensus that it makes sense to work together so if the british want pursue certain goals and shape european policies , especially in security and defence issues , then this is the right time .
there are a number of security and defence issues within the lisbon treaty which have stalled and there are no discussions being taken on these .
britain could give these and other policies which are lacking leadership the impetus they need . "

the young man ran away from his attackers , but according to his girlfriend , he was n't safe again until he was back at the university .
according to the sova center in moscow , an organization that researches racism and xenophobia , last year in russia around 70 people were killed in racially motivated attacks , while more than 300 were injured .
the center says that moscow and st. petersburg are especially dangerous places for central asians and people from the caucasus .
however , the situation has improved and those numbers have fallen by a third since 2008 .
police and judges are now taking the matter more seriously , according to the center 's director , alexander verkhovsky .
he says special police forces have been established to tackle right-wing extremism and that they have made several arrests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander verkhovsky is director of the anti-racist sova center in moscow a shock for the kremlin however , it took russian authorities some time to recognize the danger of right-wing radicals .
for years , critics of the kremlin felt that the government was more accommodating to extremist nationalists than it was to the country 's democratic opposition .
a turning point came in 2006 when extremists led a deadly pogrom against caucasian-owned businesses and restaurants in the small city of kondopoga , in russia 's northwest karelia region .
according to verkhovsky , it was only when the kremlin realized that it had lost control over kondopoga for a day that the kremlin started taking extremist nationalists seriously .
" it greatly alarmed the government , " said verkhovsky , who said the kremlin saw the event as " a political threat . "
still waters run deep verkhovsky told deutsche welle that the kremlin 's fight against racism has deeper roots than a push to secure power .
according to him , the nation 's authoritarian political climate has made open discussion of the topic taboo .
based on the silence of politicians , he said , many extremists have felt that russian society was on their side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china looms on vladivostok 's horizon " those who are out killing people feel they are pioneering a people 's movement , " he said .
in fact , extremist ideas are deeply anchored in the mindset of russian society .
according to some surveys , 55 percent of russians want to see foreign residents – especially those from central asia or the caucasus – stripped of their rights or even deported , and this , despite the fact that the russian economy depends on the cheap labor of people from these countries .

hague said relations with washington would be " solid but not slavish " and pointedly omitted any reference to the phrase " special relationship " which has been a staple in statements referring to ties between the uk and the united states .
while attempting to distance britain from the image of being the " poodle " of successive us governments , hague 's " vision of a new , distinctive british foreign policy " did not suggest that europe would be the main beneficiary of the new government 's change of direction on the world stage .
instead of turning its attention to the power base of european politics across the water , hague said britain would develop its own identity and strategic role , following a new foreign-policy agenda which would differ in its " reach and ambition " from that pursued by the previous labour governments .
as well as confirming that britain would not join the euro-zone over the next five years of the new parliament , hague - a well-known eurosceptic - rejected ideas of further and deeper political union with brussels and instead announced the government 's desire for " freeing up the single market to boost economic growth . "
hague says britain will stay out eu 's financial structures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hague said that britain would stay out of eu financial affairs britain , hague said , would not be contributing to the financial assistance offered to the beleaguered economies of the euro-zone in the foreseeable future as it would be " difficult at a time of economic constraint . "
however , while distancing britain from the eu , hague said that his government would like the eu to " use its collective weight more effectively on the world stage . "
" in terms of joining the euro zone and keeping out of the bailout operations , this shows continuity with labour 's views on these topics , " thomas klau , head of the paris office of the european council for foreign relations and an eu expert , told deutsche welle .
" what cameron and hague have shown so far in europe , and indeed in washington , is that continuity is set to prevail over radical change . "
" earlier fears that a tory or tory-liberal coalition government would usher in an era of clashes with the eu so far hav n't materialised , " he added .
" this is largely down to the liberals ' inclusion in the coalition and the tories making it clear they wo n't be stepping into margaret thatcher 's shoes and waving her handbag about .
they may be talking tough on the eu but it does n't represent a huge shift away from polices labour adopted under tony blair . "
" in terms of questioning the eu 's role in the world , there was some concern that the tories would set up in opposition to the lisbon treaty and try to undermine the eu 's regulations governing its operations abroad , " klau said .
" there were even fears that they would be down right hostile to this but again , there has been little indication as yet that this will be the case .
hague has said that the eu should have a crucial role in certain areas , especially dealing with non-eu members , specifically russia .
so this policy announcement did n't really include anything worrying or shocking for the eu . "
with the eu kept at arms length and the cosiness of former relations with the us reduced to a firm handshake , the new british foreign policy agenda focuses heavily on london 's ambition to make its influence felt on the world stage . new emphasis on taking lead on global issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan and the middle east are priorities for britain rejecting ideas that britain was in strategic and influential decline , hague targeted increased engagement and cooperation with the emerging economies in the world and deepening of relations with countries in the gulf and the middle east , along with brazil , japan , india and china .
foreign engagement would " run through the veins of the entire administration , " hague said , announcing the creation of a newly-established national security council which would ensure that the " new philosophy will be translated into action . "
hague highlighted britain 's continued role in afghanistan , where the uk has 9,500 troops deployed , and relations with pakistan as areas of prime importance .
he added that britain would continue to back a two-state solution in the middle east and pursue a dual approach of " engagement and sanctions " in regard to iran , while backing current moves in the united nations to tighten punitive measures .
prime minister david cameron recently called on the international community to " ratchet up " pressure on tehran through sanctions in a bid to prevent the islamic republic pursuing what the west suspects is a nuclear weapons program .
britain stands more chance of success with eu , say experts " britain 's global policy is going to be shaped by the events which happen during the lifespan of this coalition , " klau said .
" will we see a clear break from labour policies on climate change , financial regulation , iran and the middle east ?
not necessarily .
the middle east in particular was a high priority for blair and this will be the same for cameron . "
" whether this ambitious britain can make a meaningful contribution with global resonance outside of the eu is another matter , " he added .
" all major eu powers must recognise that there 's not much governments can do when they act alone .
the chances of success are low when their efforts are not within the framework of a joint eu initiative .
the best they can hope for is a photo opportunity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say britain can achieve more with the eu than without almut moeller , head of the alfred von oppenheim centre for european policy studies at the german council on foreign relations , agrees that it is impossible for any state to work individually with success on global issues without being part of a framework .
but she believes that britain could actually benefit from being more involved with the eu at this time , not less .
" this is actually a really good opportunity for britain to become more engaged in european policies , " moeller told deutsche welle .
" there is a will to cooperate and a consensus that it makes sense to work together so if the british want pursue certain goals and shape european policies , especially in security and defence issues , then this is the right time .
there are a number of security and defence issues within the lisbon treaty which have stalled and there are no discussions being taken on these .
britain could give these and other policies which are lacking leadership the impetus they need . "

to keep it up against serbia , manuel neuer will have to keep things tidy in goal . manuel neuer 's career is stuck in fast-forward .
the goalkeeper was just 20 when he deposed seasoned no.1 frank rost between the sticks at schalke .
at the age of 21 , he was the penalty-saving hero as his hometown club found itself in the champions league quarter-finals .
last summer , he was part of the germany under-21 team that won the european championships .
and now this summer he 's been trusted with keeping goal for the full side at the world cup .
" i feel ready for the task , " neuer told sport bild newspaper before the tournament .
jens lehmann is among those who are n't as sure .
" if we want to be world champions , it would be difficult to imagine it with manuel neuer as our number one goalkeeper , " the former national ' keeper told bild .
" he has made mistakes over and over again .
but i do like neuer , he will make a good goalkeeper one day . "
whether that day has yet come is something that will become clear as the tournament progresses - but neuer himself seems to have no problem with lehmann ’ s comments - time and again , he names the former arsenal man as one of his idols .
bildunterschrift : the world cup will be another leap forward for the schalke man all the tools in his locker neuer has just six international caps to date , and coming into the tournament none of them had been in competitive games .
he made his debut less than a year ago , impressing against the united arab emirates .
but he was at fault for ivory coast 's first goal in a friendly in november 2009 , his clearance bouncing off emmanuel eboue and into the goal .
picked for germany 's recent world cup warm-up against with malta , he had a quiet evening , but stayed alert enough to make one superb save and deny roderick briffa .
the hallmark of a top-level goalkeeper .
therein lies the frustration many feel with neuer 's ability .
he is an unrivalled shot-stopper , but prone to costly lapses in concentration .
he might grow out of it , he 's only 24 .
neuer is a one-club man , born in gelsenkirchen and on the books at schalke since the age of five .
he got his chance in the first-team early in the 2006-07 season , and has n't relinquished the position since .
" it all happened so fast , there was no time to think about the whole situation , " said the young keeper .
in his second season as no.1 he made two point-blank saves in normal time , and two more in the penalty shoot-out , to drop fc porto and win schalke a place in the last eight of the champions league .
he finished this season in confident fashion with a penalty save against bundesliga rivals mainz , showing a penalty-stopping specialism that augurs well with tournament football approaching .
neuer , who stands at around 195cm -lrb- 6 ' 5 " -rrb- , is both imposing and agile .
germany would do well to use his strong throw to launch quick counter attacks , as schalke have done to good effect .
involvement in several contentious incidents in last september 's ruhr derby against dortmund shows a feisty side to his character .
moreover , neuer is a commanding figure for the defenders in front of him .
it 's an important consideration for national coach joachim loew , with the gloves of lehmann - not to mention greats like oliver kahn and toni schumacher - still to be filled .

be proud . "
hundreds of foreign residents in russia are victims of violent right-wing extremism every year .
authorities are taking the problem seriously , but xenophobic attitudes are widespread in russian society . on an outdoor court at the university of vladivostok , a group of chinese exchange students are dribbling and shooting hoops in their own corner around a single net , separate from their russian counterparts .
here on the russian pacific coast , these exchange students are only 60 kilometers away from their home country , and yet russia does not feel like home to them .
" they 're afraid for their safety , " one russian student told deutsche welle .
" that 's why they spend entire days here and at the student residences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students usually only leave their dorms in vladivostok in groups when these exchange students do venture into town beyond the safe bubble of their dormitory , lecture halls and the basketball courts , then they only go in groups .
always on guard right-wing extremists in vladivostok have become more active in recent years , stoked by local mistrust of russia 's up-and-coming neighbor china as well as by worries about a weak economy and more foreigners coming into the country .
one chinese student in vladivostok told deutsche welle about her boyfriend 's encounter with a gang of thugs .
" about ten guys broke his nose , " she said .
" just like that , without saying anything . "
the young man ran away from his attackers , but according to his girlfriend , he was n't safe again until he was back at the university .
according to the sova center in moscow , an organization that researches racism and xenophobia , last year in russia around 70 people were killed in racially motivated attacks , while more than 300 were injured .
the center says that moscow and st. petersburg are especially dangerous places for central asians and people from the caucasus .
however , the situation has improved and those numbers have fallen by a third since 2008 .
police and judges are now taking the matter more seriously , according to the center 's director , alexander verkhovsky .
he says special police forces have been established to tackle right-wing extremism and that they have made several arrests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander verkhovsky is director of the anti-racist sova center in moscow a shock for the kremlin however , it took russian authorities some time to recognize the danger of right-wing radicals .
for years , critics of the kremlin felt that the government was more accommodating to extremist nationalists than it was to the country 's democratic opposition .
a turning point came in 2006 when extremists led a deadly pogrom against caucasian-owned businesses and restaurants in the small city of kondopoga , in russia 's northwest karelia region .
according to verkhovsky , it was only when the kremlin realized that it had lost control over kondopoga for a day that the kremlin started taking extremist nationalists seriously .
" it greatly alarmed the government , " said verkhovsky , who said the kremlin saw the event as " a political threat . "
still waters run deep verkhovsky told deutsche welle that the kremlin 's fight against racism has deeper roots than a push to secure power .
according to him , the nation 's authoritarian political climate has made open discussion of the topic taboo .
based on the silence of politicians , he said , many extremists have felt that russian society was on their side .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china looms on vladivostok 's horizon " those who are out killing people feel they are pioneering a people 's movement , " he said .
in fact , extremist ideas are deeply anchored in the mindset of russian society .
according to some surveys , 55 percent of russians want to see foreign residents – especially those from central asia or the caucasus – stripped of their rights or even deported , and this , despite the fact that the russian economy depends on the cheap labor of people from these countries .
at the basketball court in vladivostok where chinese exchange students take refuge , many native students are certain that pacific russia 's economic prosperity depends on china .

neuer is a one-club man , born in gelsenkirchen and on the books at schalke since the age of five .
he got his chance in the first-team early in the 2006-07 season , and has n't relinquished the position since .
" it all happened so fast , there was no time to think about the whole situation , " said the young keeper .
in his second season as no.1 he made two point-blank saves in normal time , and two more in the penalty shoot-out , to drop fc porto and win schalke a place in the last eight of the champions league .
he finished this season in confident fashion with a penalty save against bundesliga rivals mainz , showing a penalty-stopping specialism that augurs well with tournament football approaching .
neuer , who stands at around 195cm -lrb- 6 ' 5 " -rrb- , is both imposing and agile .
germany would do well to use his strong throw to launch quick counter attacks , as schalke have done to good effect .
involvement in several contentious incidents in last september 's ruhr derby against dortmund shows a feisty side to his character .
moreover , neuer is a commanding figure for the defenders in front of him .
it 's an important consideration for national coach joachim loew , with the gloves of lehmann - not to mention greats like oliver kahn and toni schumacher - still to be filled .

hague said relations with washington would be " solid but not slavish " and pointedly omitted any reference to the phrase " special relationship " which has been a staple in statements referring to ties between the uk and the united states .
while attempting to distance britain from the image of being the " poodle " of successive us governments , hague 's " vision of a new , distinctive british foreign policy " did not suggest that europe would be the main beneficiary of the new government 's change of direction on the world stage .
instead of turning its attention to the power base of european politics across the water , hague said britain would develop its own identity and strategic role , following a new foreign-policy agenda which would differ in its " reach and ambition " from that pursued by the previous labour governments .
as well as confirming that britain would not join the euro-zone over the next five years of the new parliament , hague - a well-known eurosceptic - rejected ideas of further and deeper political union with brussels and instead announced the government 's desire for " freeing up the single market to boost economic growth . "
hague says britain will stay out eu 's financial structures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hague said that britain would stay out of eu financial affairs britain , hague said , would not be contributing to the financial assistance offered to the beleaguered economies of the euro-zone in the foreseeable future as it would be " difficult at a time of economic constraint . "
however , while distancing britain from the eu , hague said that his government would like the eu to " use its collective weight more effectively on the world stage . "
" in terms of joining the euro zone and keeping out of the bailout operations , this shows continuity with labour 's views on these topics , " thomas klau , head of the paris office of the european council for foreign relations and an eu expert , told deutsche welle .
" what cameron and hague have shown so far in europe , and indeed in washington , is that continuity is set to prevail over radical change . "
" earlier fears that a tory or tory-liberal coalition government would usher in an era of clashes with the eu so far hav n't materialised , " he added .
" this is largely down to the liberals ' inclusion in the coalition and the tories making it clear they wo n't be stepping into margaret thatcher 's shoes and waving her handbag about .
they may be talking tough on the eu but it does n't represent a huge shift away from polices labour adopted under tony blair . "
" in terms of questioning the eu 's role in the world , there was some concern that the tories would set up in opposition to the lisbon treaty and try to undermine the eu 's regulations governing its operations abroad , " klau said .
" there were even fears that they would be down right hostile to this but again , there has been little indication as yet that this will be the case .
hague has said that the eu should have a crucial role in certain areas , especially dealing with non-eu members , specifically russia .
so this policy announcement did n't really include anything worrying or shocking for the eu . "
with the eu kept at arms length and the cosiness of former relations with the us reduced to a firm handshake , the new british foreign policy agenda focuses heavily on london 's ambition to make its influence felt on the world stage . new emphasis on taking lead on global issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan and the middle east are priorities for britain rejecting ideas that britain was in strategic and influential decline , hague targeted increased engagement and cooperation with the emerging economies in the world and deepening of relations with countries in the gulf and the middle east , along with brazil , japan , india and china .
foreign engagement would " run through the veins of the entire administration , " hague said , announcing the creation of a newly-established national security council which would ensure that the " new philosophy will be translated into action . "
hague highlighted britain 's continued role in afghanistan , where the uk has 9,500 troops deployed , and relations with pakistan as areas of prime importance .
he added that britain would continue to back a two-state solution in the middle east and pursue a dual approach of " engagement and sanctions " in regard to iran , while backing current moves in the united nations to tighten punitive measures .
prime minister david cameron recently called on the international community to " ratchet up " pressure on tehran through sanctions in a bid to prevent the islamic republic pursuing what the west suspects is a nuclear weapons program .
britain stands more chance of success with eu , say experts " britain 's global policy is going to be shaped by the events which happen during the lifespan of this coalition , " klau said .
" will we see a clear break from labour policies on climate change , financial regulation , iran and the middle east ?
not necessarily .
the middle east in particular was a high priority for blair and this will be the same for cameron . "
" whether this ambitious britain can make a meaningful contribution with global resonance outside of the eu is another matter , " he added .
" all major eu powers must recognise that there 's not much governments can do when they act alone .
the chances of success are low when their efforts are not within the framework of a joint eu initiative .
the best they can hope for is a photo opportunity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say britain can achieve more with the eu than without almut moeller , head of the alfred von oppenheim centre for european policy studies at the german council on foreign relations , agrees that it is impossible for any state to work individually with success on global issues without being part of a framework .
but she believes that britain could actually benefit from being more involved with the eu at this time , not less .
" this is actually a really good opportunity for britain to become more engaged in european policies , " moeller told deutsche welle .
" there is a will to cooperate and a consensus that it makes sense to work together so if the british want pursue certain goals and shape european policies , especially in security and defence issues , then this is the right time .
there are a number of security and defence issues within the lisbon treaty which have stalled and there are no discussions being taken on these .
britain could give these and other policies which are lacking leadership the impetus they need . "

prime minister david cameron recently called on the international community to " ratchet up " pressure on tehran through sanctions in a bid to prevent the islamic republic pursuing what the west suspects is a nuclear weapons program .
britain stands more chance of success with eu , say experts " britain 's global policy is going to be shaped by the events which happen during the lifespan of this coalition , " klau said .
" will we see a clear break from labour policies on climate change , financial regulation , iran and the middle east ?
not necessarily .
the middle east in particular was a high priority for blair and this will be the same for cameron . "
" whether this ambitious britain can make a meaningful contribution with global resonance outside of the eu is another matter , " he added .
" all major eu powers must recognise that there 's not much governments can do when they act alone .
the chances of success are low when their efforts are not within the framework of a joint eu initiative .
the best they can hope for is a photo opportunity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say britain can achieve more with the eu than without almut moeller , head of the alfred von oppenheim centre for european policy studies at the german council on foreign relations , agrees that it is impossible for any state to work individually with success on global issues without being part of a framework .
but she believes that britain could actually benefit from being more involved with the eu at this time , not less .
" this is actually a really good opportunity for britain to become more engaged in european policies , " moeller told deutsche welle .
" there is a will to cooperate and a consensus that it makes sense to work together so if the british want pursue certain goals and shape european policies , especially in security and defence issues , then this is the right time .
there are a number of security and defence issues within the lisbon treaty which have stalled and there are no discussions being taken on these .
britain could give these and other policies which are lacking leadership the impetus they need . "

to keep it up against serbia , manuel neuer will have to keep things tidy in goal . manuel neuer 's career is stuck in fast-forward .
the goalkeeper was just 20 when he deposed seasoned no.1 frank rost between the sticks at schalke .
at the age of 21 , he was the penalty-saving hero as his hometown club found itself in the champions league quarter-finals .
last summer , he was part of the germany under-21 team that won the european championships .
and now this summer he 's been trusted with keeping goal for the full side at the world cup .
" i feel ready for the task , " neuer told sport bild newspaper before the tournament .
jens lehmann is among those who are n't as sure .
" if we want to be world champions , it would be difficult to imagine it with manuel neuer as our number one goalkeeper , " the former national ' keeper told bild .
" he has made mistakes over and over again .
but i do like neuer , he will make a good goalkeeper one day . "
whether that day has yet come is something that will become clear as the tournament progresses - but neuer himself seems to have no problem with lehmann ’ s comments - time and again , he names the former arsenal man as one of his idols .
bildunterschrift : the world cup will be another leap forward for the schalke man all the tools in his locker neuer has just six international caps to date , and coming into the tournament none of them had been in competitive games .
he made his debut less than a year ago , impressing against the united arab emirates .
but he was at fault for ivory coast 's first goal in a friendly in november 2009 , his clearance bouncing off emmanuel eboue and into the goal .
picked for germany 's recent world cup warm-up against with malta , he had a quiet evening , but stayed alert enough to make one superb save and deny roderick briffa .
the hallmark of a top-level goalkeeper .
therein lies the frustration many feel with neuer 's ability .
he is an unrivalled shot-stopper , but prone to costly lapses in concentration .
he might grow out of it , he 's only 24 .
neuer is a one-club man , born in gelsenkirchen and on the books at schalke since the age of five .
he got his chance in the first-team early in the 2006-07 season , and has n't relinquished the position since .
" it all happened so fast , there was no time to think about the whole situation , " said the young keeper .
in his second season as no.1 he made two point-blank saves in normal time , and two more in the penalty shoot-out , to drop fc porto and win schalke a place in the last eight of the champions league .
he finished this season in confident fashion with a penalty save against bundesliga rivals mainz , showing a penalty-stopping specialism that augurs well with tournament football approaching .
neuer , who stands at around 195cm -lrb- 6 ' 5 " -rrb- , is both imposing and agile .
germany would do well to use his strong throw to launch quick counter attacks , as schalke have done to good effect .
involvement in several contentious incidents in last september 's ruhr derby against dortmund shows a feisty side to his character .
moreover , neuer is a commanding figure for the defenders in front of him .
it 's an important consideration for national coach joachim loew , with the gloves of lehmann - not to mention greats like oliver kahn and toni schumacher - still to be filled .
