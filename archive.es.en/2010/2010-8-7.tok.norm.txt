the taliban have claimed responsibility for the killings . the german government strongly condemned saturday the murder of 10 aid workers in northern afghanistan , the majority of whom were foreigners , including one german woman .
" the german government is indignant over the terrible attack , " government spokeswoman sabine heimbach said in a statement .
the government called for a full inquiry into the " cowardly murder " and for the perpetrators to be punished .
" the incident underlines the necessity to continue working with determination towards stabilizing the situation in afghanistan , so the afghan government can increasingly take responsibility for security in the country , " the government said .
the bullet-riddled bodies of the eight foreign medical workers and two afghans working for an international health charity were discovered in a mountainous , forested area in northern afghanistan , according to afghan police .
the taliban quickly claimed responsibility for the attack on a group they called " christian missionaries . "
the international assistance mission -lrb- iam -rrb- , a non-profit christian health organization , said six of the dead were americans , one was german and one was british .
the iam provides medical and eye care in remote areas and has been operating in afghanistan since 1966 .
robbery a likely motive dirk frans , the group 's director , said the team numbered 12 , including four afghans , two of whom were killed . the group , he said , were on their way back to kabul from an eye facility in nuristan province near the border with pakistan .
" they were killed on their way back .
they had no guns and no security because we come at the communities ' invitation and they take care of us , " frans told the agence france-presse news agency .
" there have never been any threats against us .
if there were threats , we would not have gone , " he said .
he said the organization would continue its activities .
despite the taliban claim , frans said police had told him that robbery was the likely motive for the killings .
the victims , seven men and three women , had been stripped of all their money and belongings .
he denied the taliban 's claim that the group carried bibles in the local language dari .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuristan and badakshan are close to afghanistan 's porous border with pakistan conflicting information according to police , an afghan colleague of the victims who survived the attack walked to a police station in badakhshan to inform them of the attack .
police said the attack took place some two weeks ago , but because of the remoteness of the area they were unable to recover the bodies until thursday .
the information was in apparent conflict with the taliban 's claims that the attack was on friday .
the taliban also claimed there were nine foreigners - five men and four women - and one afghan national .
the survivor , identified only as sayedullah , said the foreigners worked at a hospital in kabul .
the victims were reportedly found next to their three four-wheel drive vehicles and had been lined up before they were shot .

the gates ' campaign is " too garish , " an asset manager told german news magazine der spiegel , asking to remain anonymous .
hamburg multimillionaire peter kraemer said the initiative was " highly problematic " and suggested that germany 's wealthy find other ways to donate .
gates launched his campaign , known as the giving pledge , with investor warren buffet in june .
the campaign was initially intended to encourage wealthy americans to donate at least 50 percent of their wealth to charitable causes , but has since gone global .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gates foundation has given away nearly $ 23 billion since 1994 gates said this week that he and buffet have scheduled meetings with some of the wealthiest people in china and india in the coming months .
forty billionaires have so far pledged to donate at least half of their fortunes to charity , including new york city mayor michael bloomberg , hollywood director george lucas and mexican tycoon carlos slim .
based on a forbes magazine estimate of the billionaires ' wealth , at least $ 150 billion -lrb- 112.9 billion euros -rrb- could be given away .
' a troubling development ' in an interview with der spiegel , kraemer said donations in the united states are for the most part tax deductible , giving the rich the option of contributing to charity or paying taxes .
he said donations of this magnitude lead to the wealthy minority of the population rather than the government deciding on where to allocate charitable funds . " i find this to be a troubling development , " said kramer .
" who has given these people the authority to decide where such huge amounts of money should be spent ? "
some wealthy germans are already known to be generous donors .
co-founder of software giant sap dietmar hopp finances soccer club tsg 1899 hoffenheim and has donated assets worth about 2.9 billion euros to a foundation .
hopp 's partner klaus tschira has also donated more than half of his fortune to a foundation promoting science , mathematics and computer science .

guido westerwelle : i do n't think it 's something anyone would wish upon themselves .
nobody relishes having political responsibility in times like these .
the decision was taken many years ago by the government of the time and we now have to face up to our responsibility .
we have to contribute to our own security , to protect ourselves and our citizens from terrorism as far as possible .
and it 's also in our interest that afghanistan develops positively and becomes a stable country again in the future .
there have been two afghanistan conferences this year , one in london and one in kabul .
you took part in both and you played a major role in one .
a basic framework of action was agreed , involving more security force training , attempts to integrate former taliban and more civil reconstruction .
six months on , has there been any progress ?
or is it too early to judge ?
well , the situation is varied .
i fear we 're going to go through some security setbacks first .
the harvest season is coming to an end .
experience has shown that that often aggravates the security situation .
on the other hand , there are 134 districts in the north and only eight of those are regarded as being particularly dangerous .
so you have to see that as well as building roads and schools , including girls ' schools , we 've helped stabilize the region politically .
that was our main goal .
our other goal is to be able to transfer responsibility for security to the afghan government in 2014 .
that 's also president hamid karzai 's goal and it was agreed by the international community at the recent afghanistan conference in kabul .
still , many people have the impression that things are not really improving in afghanistan .
why is civil reconstruction progressing so slowly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle says most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing i believe you 've got to look at the various aspects differently .
it 's true that some areas of development are not progressing much .
but others have seen positive changes and that should be appreciated .
you must n't forget that we 're there because the great majority of ordinary afghans want us there .
at the same time , we 've now got to implement the change of strategy that we agreed first in london and then in kabul - and that involves achieving political reconciliation .
are you finding you 're increasingly able to ' win the hearts of afghans ' - as one former defense minister put it ?
are afghans open to that ?
yes .
as far as we know , most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing .
the debate in germany and other european countries just shows you the setbacks , the attacks and all the negative issues , things that are not working .
you rarely see examples of progress .
one such example is the peace jirga gathering .
about 1,600 delegates attended and managed to reach an agreement , and about 20 percent of the delegates were women .
in my opinion , developments like that receive too little recognition . you ca n't understand afghanistan without looking at its neighbors .
let 's start with pakistan .
the country is actually an ally , but , as we 've come to see , there are sections in that society that oppose us - some would even call them enemies .
is the government in islamabad not playing fair ?
i think , even there , you have to see the successes .
for example , in the run-up to the afghanistan conference , a trade deal was agreed between afghanistan and pakistan .
that does n't sound all that spectacular , but if you know the history of the two countries , it 's a pretty amazing event .
then there 's a further issue to consider .
we need the neighbors , we need regional cooperation to be successful .
in london at the beginning of the year we were missing one country from the region .
but in kabul the entire region was represented and agreed to the declaration .
that helps strengthen the bonds between neighbors .
we want to encourage that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops have been in afghanistan since 2001 that of course is difficult to imagine , for example with iran .
and that 's who we 're talking about in this case .
sanctions have been imposed on the country , people are scared of nuclear arms ; they 're scared of the iranian president .
but you also have to engage the iranians somehow , in order to stabilize afghanistan .
is such a balancing act realistic ?
well , it 's necessary , or at least it 's essential we try .
the eu and the un did n't decide on sanctions in order to oppose a country , or to prevent iran from using nuclear power for civilian purposes .
instead , we want to see the iranian government return to the negotiating table , to cooperate , to provide transparency - things that iran has actually already committed itself to .
all countries are permitted to use nuclear power for peaceful and civilian purposes .
but they must also cooperate with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , and provide complete transparency to demonstrate they are using it for exclusively civilian purposes - and not secretly developing a bomb .
that is what we need to prevent , and we remain willing to negotiate with iran .
i could also imagine that talks could take place in september between our european colleague catherine ashton and the iranian side .
that 's our goal .
but it requires cooperation and transparency from iran - and iran must not lay down any preconditions for comprehensive talks .
the war in afghanistan is viewed skeptically in many countries - in most countries , by the majority of the population .
after eight years of involvement in afghanistan , how long will patience last for the hope of reaching the goal we want to reach - a relatively peaceful afghanistan ?
that 's a very hard question to answer .
and i can only advise that we do n't lose sight of our own interests .
it is in our interest that we do not allow those who export terrorism into the world … to turn afghanistan back into a safe haven where they can re-arm .
people forget that many attacks were planned there , and some of those attacks also targeted europe .
yes , we should be skeptical , and view any foreign deployment of the bundeswehr initially with a healthy dose of skepticism .
but i would also suggest that we understand that this also concerns our own security , and that is why we want to be and must be successful .
but we also need a clear perspective on withdrawal - something we can work towards by doing even more , as , for example , in supporting civil redevelopment .

dw : is the war in afghanistan a political nightmare for you ?
guido westerwelle : i do n't think it 's something anyone would wish upon themselves .
nobody relishes having political responsibility in times like these .
the decision was taken many years ago by the government of the time and we now have to face up to our responsibility .
we have to contribute to our own security , to protect ourselves and our citizens from terrorism as far as possible .
and it 's also in our interest that afghanistan develops positively and becomes a stable country again in the future .

the gates ' campaign is " too garish , " an asset manager told german news magazine der spiegel , asking to remain anonymous .
hamburg multimillionaire peter kraemer said the initiative was " highly problematic " and suggested that germany 's wealthy find other ways to donate .
gates launched his campaign , known as the giving pledge , with investor warren buffet in june .
the campaign was initially intended to encourage wealthy americans to donate at least 50 percent of their wealth to charitable causes , but has since gone global .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gates foundation has given away nearly $ 23 billion since 1994 gates said this week that he and buffet have scheduled meetings with some of the wealthiest people in china and india in the coming months .
forty billionaires have so far pledged to donate at least half of their fortunes to charity , including new york city mayor michael bloomberg , hollywood director george lucas and mexican tycoon carlos slim .
based on a forbes magazine estimate of the billionaires ' wealth , at least $ 150 billion -lrb- 112.9 billion euros -rrb- could be given away .
' a troubling development ' in an interview with der spiegel , kraemer said donations in the united states are for the most part tax deductible , giving the rich the option of contributing to charity or paying taxes .
he said donations of this magnitude lead to the wealthy minority of the population rather than the government deciding on where to allocate charitable funds . " i find this to be a troubling development , " said kramer .
" who has given these people the authority to decide where such huge amounts of money should be spent ? "
some wealthy germans are already known to be generous donors .
co-founder of software giant sap dietmar hopp finances soccer club tsg 1899 hoffenheim and has donated assets worth about 2.9 billion euros to a foundation .
hopp 's partner klaus tschira has also donated more than half of his fortune to a foundation promoting science , mathematics and computer science .

dw : is the war in afghanistan a political nightmare for you ?
guido westerwelle : i do n't think it 's something anyone would wish upon themselves .
nobody relishes having political responsibility in times like these .
the decision was taken many years ago by the government of the time and we now have to face up to our responsibility .
we have to contribute to our own security , to protect ourselves and our citizens from terrorism as far as possible .
and it 's also in our interest that afghanistan develops positively and becomes a stable country again in the future .
there have been two afghanistan conferences this year , one in london and one in kabul .
you took part in both and you played a major role in one .
a basic framework of action was agreed , involving more security force training , attempts to integrate former taliban and more civil reconstruction .
six months on , has there been any progress ?
or is it too early to judge ?
well , the situation is varied .
i fear we 're going to go through some security setbacks first .
the harvest season is coming to an end .
experience has shown that that often aggravates the security situation .
on the other hand , there are 134 districts in the north and only eight of those are regarded as being particularly dangerous .
so you have to see that as well as building roads and schools , including girls ' schools , we 've helped stabilize the region politically .
that was our main goal .
our other goal is to be able to transfer responsibility for security to the afghan government in 2014 .
that 's also president hamid karzai 's goal and it was agreed by the international community at the recent afghanistan conference in kabul .
still , many people have the impression that things are not really improving in afghanistan .
why is civil reconstruction progressing so slowly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle says most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing i believe you 've got to look at the various aspects differently .
it 's true that some areas of development are not progressing much .
but others have seen positive changes and that should be appreciated .
you must n't forget that we 're there because the great majority of ordinary afghans want us there .
at the same time , we 've now got to implement the change of strategy that we agreed first in london and then in kabul - and that involves achieving political reconciliation .
are you finding you 're increasingly able to ' win the hearts of afghans ' - as one former defense minister put it ?
are afghans open to that ?
yes .
as far as we know , most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing .
the debate in germany and other european countries just shows you the setbacks , the attacks and all the negative issues , things that are not working .
you rarely see examples of progress .
one such example is the peace jirga gathering .
about 1,600 delegates attended and managed to reach an agreement , and about 20 percent of the delegates were women .
in my opinion , developments like that receive too little recognition . you ca n't understand afghanistan without looking at its neighbors .
let 's start with pakistan .
the country is actually an ally , but , as we 've come to see , there are sections in that society that oppose us - some would even call them enemies .
is the government in islamabad not playing fair ?
i think , even there , you have to see the successes .
for example , in the run-up to the afghanistan conference , a trade deal was agreed between afghanistan and pakistan .
that does n't sound all that spectacular , but if you know the history of the two countries , it 's a pretty amazing event .
then there 's a further issue to consider .
we need the neighbors , we need regional cooperation to be successful .
in london at the beginning of the year we were missing one country from the region .
but in kabul the entire region was represented and agreed to the declaration .
that helps strengthen the bonds between neighbors .
we want to encourage that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops have been in afghanistan since 2001 that of course is difficult to imagine , for example with iran .
and that 's who we 're talking about in this case .
sanctions have been imposed on the country , people are scared of nuclear arms ; they 're scared of the iranian president .
but you also have to engage the iranians somehow , in order to stabilize afghanistan .
is such a balancing act realistic ?
well , it 's necessary , or at least it 's essential we try .
the eu and the un did n't decide on sanctions in order to oppose a country , or to prevent iran from using nuclear power for civilian purposes .
instead , we want to see the iranian government return to the negotiating table , to cooperate , to provide transparency - things that iran has actually already committed itself to .
all countries are permitted to use nuclear power for peaceful and civilian purposes .
but they must also cooperate with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , and provide complete transparency to demonstrate they are using it for exclusively civilian purposes - and not secretly developing a bomb .
that is what we need to prevent , and we remain willing to negotiate with iran .
i could also imagine that talks could take place in september between our european colleague catherine ashton and the iranian side .
that 's our goal .
but it requires cooperation and transparency from iran - and iran must not lay down any preconditions for comprehensive talks .
the war in afghanistan is viewed skeptically in many countries - in most countries , by the majority of the population .
after eight years of involvement in afghanistan , how long will patience last for the hope of reaching the goal we want to reach - a relatively peaceful afghanistan ?
that 's a very hard question to answer .
and i can only advise that we do n't lose sight of our own interests .
it is in our interest that we do not allow those who export terrorism into the world … to turn afghanistan back into a safe haven where they can re-arm .
people forget that many attacks were planned there , and some of those attacks also targeted europe .
yes , we should be skeptical , and view any foreign deployment of the bundeswehr initially with a healthy dose of skepticism .
but i would also suggest that we understand that this also concerns our own security , and that is why we want to be and must be successful .
but we also need a clear perspective on withdrawal - something we can work towards by doing even more , as , for example , in supporting civil redevelopment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 07.08.2010 stuttgart racing to find players to prevent another rollercoaster season großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfb have lost some of the stars that aided last season 's revival last season was a microcosm of stuttgart ’ s entire bundesliga history , with their final league table chart looking like the blueprint for a new rollercoaster .
vfb has regularly plumbed the depths and scaled the heights . last season started with high hopes after coach markus babbel 's miracle working in the previous campaign had lifted a seemingly doomed vfb team out of the depths of the relegation zone and into the champions league qualification places .
the young coach seemed to have revived the club and fans even started dreaming of a return to title-winning ways which were then only two years in the past .
die roten -lrb- the reds -rrb- suffered a nightmare start , however , losing 2-0 to reigning champions wolfsburg and plummeting to last place in the league on the opening day .
they were soon up to seventh the following week after a more impressive 4-2 home win against freiburg .
but things started to go badly wrong after that .
six defeats , six draws and only one victory in the following 13 games saw stuttgart back in the relegation zone .
babbel survived until december 6 after a dull 1-1 home draw to vfl bochum confirmed his magic touch had deserted him .
babbel was immediately replaced by swiss coach christian gross who slowly and surely rebuilt the team 's confidence , leading them to a sixth place finish and into the knock-out rounds of the champions league where they lost to title-holders barcelona over two legs .
given the club 's record , fans might expect stuttgart to go into freefall again this season to even things up but gross appears to have the right formula on the pitch to make them competitive again .
however , stuttgart face a race against time to rebuild before the season starts , after seeing a number of players move on this summer with few solid deals under way to replace them .
khedira leaves biggest hole after stuttgart exodus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's midfield will have a khedira-shaped hole in it vfb have lost goalkeeper jens lehmann to retirement , sold ricardo osorio to cf monterey , martin lanig to cologne and roberto hilbert to besiktas , and have watched helplessly as alexander hleb ended his loan spell and rejoined barcelona .
but the most damaging loss could turn out to be the sale of sami khedira to real madrid .
khedira , who shone for the german national team at this summer 's world cup in south africa , successfully passed his medical with the spanish giants at the weekend to complete a 14-million-euro -lrb- $ 18.3 million -rrb- switch .
the 23-year-old midfielder joins jose mourinho 's real revolution on a five-year deal .
christian gross will have to move fast in the transfer market if he is to furnish his squad with players capable of improving on last season 's standards .
at the moment , he 'll be lucky to maintain the level vfb finally reached and could even struggle to avoid a reversal of fortunes .
gross calls back prodigal sons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian midfielder elson is back at stuttgart this season the swiss coach has not been sitting on his hands all summer , however .
he has brought former vfb midfielders elson and christian gentner back from hannover and wolfsburg respectively , while ex-stuttgart goalkeeper marc ziegler has returned from borussia dortmund to replace lehmann .
gross has also boosted the forward line with 23-year-old austrian striker martin harnik from fortuna duesseldorf , who scored the winner on his debut for the club in stuttgart 's europa league qualification game against norwegian club molde fk last week .
but to build on the progress he achieved with stuttgart in the second half of last season , gross needs to add a few more players of quality , especially after khedira , his pivotal midfielder , jumped ship .
one player who could be on the verge of joining vfb to fill khedira 's vacant role is marseille midfielder andre ayew , the 20-year-old who caught the eye with some excellent displays for ghana at the world cup .
ghana 's ayew the man to replace spain-bound sami bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart hopes to complete ayew 's switch from marseille while reports - and stuttgart sporting director jochen schneider - suggest a deal is in place and that the player wants to join vfb , the transfer may not be as clear cut as some may think .
despite missing marseille 's title-winning campaign last season while on loan at newly promoted arles-avignon , didier deschamps - the french champions ' coach - is said to be considering a greater role for ayew for the coming season .
if he is sold , however , stuttgart can expect to pay more than the one million euros they were offering before the world cup .
but with the club cash-rich from the sale of khedira , any hike in price should not prove to be too much of a problem .
what could be a stumbling block is the interest being paid ayew by bundesliga rivals borussia dortmund and schalke 04 , but if a move to germany is on the cards , ayew has admitted that vfb would be his favoured destination .
stuttgart free to move on long-term target degen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-bvb defender degen -lrb- l . -rrb- could return to the bundesliga christian gross has also boosted his defensive situation by signing his compatriot philipp degen on loan from liverpool .
the out-of-favour 27-year-old attacking full-back was told he could leave liverpool by new boss roy hodgson and was keen to return to the bundesliga after having moved to anfield from borussia dortmund in 2008 .
there may be some concerns about the swiss international 's injury record , however .
due to persistent injuries , degen made just 13 appearances for liverpool in two years since arriving on a free transfer .
he suffered a fractured ankle before even playing a competitive game for the team and then suffered a hernia , a fractured rib and broke his foot twice in the space of a year .
this may be why gross took degen on loan for a season before committing any funds to a permanent transfer .

vfb has regularly plumbed the depths and scaled the heights . last season started with high hopes after coach markus babbel 's miracle working in the previous campaign had lifted a seemingly doomed vfb team out of the depths of the relegation zone and into the champions league qualification places .
the young coach seemed to have revived the club and fans even started dreaming of a return to title-winning ways which were then only two years in the past .
die roten -lrb- the reds -rrb- suffered a nightmare start , however , losing 2-0 to reigning champions wolfsburg and plummeting to last place in the league on the opening day .
they were soon up to seventh the following week after a more impressive 4-2 home win against freiburg .
but things started to go badly wrong after that .
six defeats , six draws and only one victory in the following 13 games saw stuttgart back in the relegation zone .
babbel survived until december 6 after a dull 1-1 home draw to vfl bochum confirmed his magic touch had deserted him .
babbel was immediately replaced by swiss coach christian gross who slowly and surely rebuilt the team 's confidence , leading them to a sixth place finish and into the knock-out rounds of the champions league where they lost to title-holders barcelona over two legs .
given the club 's record , fans might expect stuttgart to go into freefall again this season to even things up but gross appears to have the right formula on the pitch to make them competitive again .
however , stuttgart face a race against time to rebuild before the season starts , after seeing a number of players move on this summer with few solid deals under way to replace them .
khedira leaves biggest hole after stuttgart exodus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's midfield will have a khedira-shaped hole in it vfb have lost goalkeeper jens lehmann to retirement , sold ricardo osorio to cf monterey , martin lanig to cologne and roberto hilbert to besiktas , and have watched helplessly as alexander hleb ended his loan spell and rejoined barcelona .
but the most damaging loss could turn out to be the sale of sami khedira to real madrid .
khedira , who shone for the german national team at this summer 's world cup in south africa , successfully passed his medical with the spanish giants at the weekend to complete a 14-million-euro -lrb- $ 18.3 million -rrb- switch .
the 23-year-old midfielder joins jose mourinho 's real revolution on a five-year deal .
christian gross will have to move fast in the transfer market if he is to furnish his squad with players capable of improving on last season 's standards .
at the moment , he 'll be lucky to maintain the level vfb finally reached and could even struggle to avoid a reversal of fortunes .
gross calls back prodigal sons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian midfielder elson is back at stuttgart this season the swiss coach has not been sitting on his hands all summer , however .
he has brought former vfb midfielders elson and christian gentner back from hannover and wolfsburg respectively , while ex-stuttgart goalkeeper marc ziegler has returned from borussia dortmund to replace lehmann .
gross has also boosted the forward line with 23-year-old austrian striker martin harnik from fortuna duesseldorf , who scored the winner on his debut for the club in stuttgart 's europa league qualification game against norwegian club molde fk last week .
but to build on the progress he achieved with stuttgart in the second half of last season , gross needs to add a few more players of quality , especially after khedira , his pivotal midfielder , jumped ship .
one player who could be on the verge of joining vfb to fill khedira 's vacant role is marseille midfielder andre ayew , the 20-year-old who caught the eye with some excellent displays for ghana at the world cup .
ghana 's ayew the man to replace spain-bound sami bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart hopes to complete ayew 's switch from marseille while reports - and stuttgart sporting director jochen schneider - suggest a deal is in place and that the player wants to join vfb , the transfer may not be as clear cut as some may think .
despite missing marseille 's title-winning campaign last season while on loan at newly promoted arles-avignon , didier deschamps - the french champions ' coach - is said to be considering a greater role for ayew for the coming season .
if he is sold , however , stuttgart can expect to pay more than the one million euros they were offering before the world cup .
but with the club cash-rich from the sale of khedira , any hike in price should not prove to be too much of a problem .
what could be a stumbling block is the interest being paid ayew by bundesliga rivals borussia dortmund and schalke 04 , but if a move to germany is on the cards , ayew has admitted that vfb would be his favoured destination .
stuttgart free to move on long-term target degen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-bvb defender degen -lrb- l . -rrb- could return to the bundesliga christian gross has also boosted his defensive situation by signing his compatriot philipp degen on loan from liverpool .
the out-of-favour 27-year-old attacking full-back was told he could leave liverpool by new boss roy hodgson and was keen to return to the bundesliga after having moved to anfield from borussia dortmund in 2008 .
there may be some concerns about the swiss international 's injury record , however .
due to persistent injuries , degen made just 13 appearances for liverpool in two years since arriving on a free transfer .
he suffered a fractured ankle before even playing a competitive game for the team and then suffered a hernia , a fractured rib and broke his foot twice in the space of a year .
this may be why gross took degen on loan for a season before committing any funds to a permanent transfer .

but the most damaging loss could turn out to be the sale of sami khedira to real madrid .
khedira , who shone for the german national team at this summer 's world cup in south africa , successfully passed his medical with the spanish giants at the weekend to complete a 14-million-euro -lrb- $ 18.3 million -rrb- switch .
the 23-year-old midfielder joins jose mourinho 's real revolution on a five-year deal .
christian gross will have to move fast in the transfer market if he is to furnish his squad with players capable of improving on last season 's standards .
at the moment , he 'll be lucky to maintain the level vfb finally reached and could even struggle to avoid a reversal of fortunes .
gross calls back prodigal sons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian midfielder elson is back at stuttgart this season the swiss coach has not been sitting on his hands all summer , however .
he has brought former vfb midfielders elson and christian gentner back from hannover and wolfsburg respectively , while ex-stuttgart goalkeeper marc ziegler has returned from borussia dortmund to replace lehmann .
gross has also boosted the forward line with 23-year-old austrian striker martin harnik from fortuna duesseldorf , who scored the winner on his debut for the club in stuttgart 's europa league qualification game against norwegian club molde fk last week .
but to build on the progress he achieved with stuttgart in the second half of last season , gross needs to add a few more players of quality , especially after khedira , his pivotal midfielder , jumped ship .
one player who could be on the verge of joining vfb to fill khedira 's vacant role is marseille midfielder andre ayew , the 20-year-old who caught the eye with some excellent displays for ghana at the world cup .
ghana 's ayew the man to replace spain-bound sami bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart hopes to complete ayew 's switch from marseille while reports - and stuttgart sporting director jochen schneider - suggest a deal is in place and that the player wants to join vfb , the transfer may not be as clear cut as some may think .
despite missing marseille 's title-winning campaign last season while on loan at newly promoted arles-avignon , didier deschamps - the french champions ' coach - is said to be considering a greater role for ayew for the coming season .
if he is sold , however , stuttgart can expect to pay more than the one million euros they were offering before the world cup .
but with the club cash-rich from the sale of khedira , any hike in price should not prove to be too much of a problem .
what could be a stumbling block is the interest being paid ayew by bundesliga rivals borussia dortmund and schalke 04 , but if a move to germany is on the cards , ayew has admitted that vfb would be his favoured destination .
stuttgart free to move on long-term target degen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-bvb defender degen -lrb- l . -rrb- could return to the bundesliga christian gross has also boosted his defensive situation by signing his compatriot philipp degen on loan from liverpool .
the out-of-favour 27-year-old attacking full-back was told he could leave liverpool by new boss roy hodgson and was keen to return to the bundesliga after having moved to anfield from borussia dortmund in 2008 .
there may be some concerns about the swiss international 's injury record , however .
due to persistent injuries , degen made just 13 appearances for liverpool in two years since arriving on a free transfer .
he suffered a fractured ankle before even playing a competitive game for the team and then suffered a hernia , a fractured rib and broke his foot twice in the space of a year .
this may be why gross took degen on loan for a season before committing any funds to a permanent transfer .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuristan and badakshan are close to afghanistan 's porous border with pakistan conflicting information according to police , an afghan colleague of the victims who survived the attack walked to a police station in badakhshan to inform them of the attack .
police said the attack took place some two weeks ago , but because of the remoteness of the area they were unable to recover the bodies until thursday .
the information was in apparent conflict with the taliban 's claims that the attack was on friday .
the taliban also claimed there were nine foreigners - five men and four women - and one afghan national .
the survivor , identified only as sayedullah , said the foreigners worked at a hospital in kabul .
the victims were reportedly found next to their three four-wheel drive vehicles and had been lined up before they were shot .
a western official , asking to remain anonymous , said the us embassy was organizing the return of the bodies to kabul where they would be formally identified . author : martin kuebler -lrb- ap / dpa / epd / afp -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw : is the war in afghanistan a political nightmare for you ?
guido westerwelle : i do n't think it 's something anyone would wish upon themselves .
nobody relishes having political responsibility in times like these .
the decision was taken many years ago by the government of the time and we now have to face up to our responsibility .
we have to contribute to our own security , to protect ourselves and our citizens from terrorism as far as possible .
and it 's also in our interest that afghanistan develops positively and becomes a stable country again in the future .
there have been two afghanistan conferences this year , one in london and one in kabul .
you took part in both and you played a major role in one .
a basic framework of action was agreed , involving more security force training , attempts to integrate former taliban and more civil reconstruction .
six months on , has there been any progress ?
or is it too early to judge ?
well , the situation is varied .
i fear we 're going to go through some security setbacks first .
the harvest season is coming to an end .
experience has shown that that often aggravates the security situation .
on the other hand , there are 134 districts in the north and only eight of those are regarded as being particularly dangerous .
so you have to see that as well as building roads and schools , including girls ' schools , we 've helped stabilize the region politically .
that was our main goal .
our other goal is to be able to transfer responsibility for security to the afghan government in 2014 .
that 's also president hamid karzai 's goal and it was agreed by the international community at the recent afghanistan conference in kabul .
still , many people have the impression that things are not really improving in afghanistan .
why is civil reconstruction progressing so slowly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle says most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing i believe you 've got to look at the various aspects differently .
it 's true that some areas of development are not progressing much .
but others have seen positive changes and that should be appreciated .
you must n't forget that we 're there because the great majority of ordinary afghans want us there .
at the same time , we 've now got to implement the change of strategy that we agreed first in london and then in kabul - and that involves achieving political reconciliation .
are you finding you 're increasingly able to ' win the hearts of afghans ' - as one former defense minister put it ?
are afghans open to that ?
yes .
as far as we know , most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing .
the debate in germany and other european countries just shows you the setbacks , the attacks and all the negative issues , things that are not working .
you rarely see examples of progress .
one such example is the peace jirga gathering .
about 1,600 delegates attended and managed to reach an agreement , and about 20 percent of the delegates were women .
in my opinion , developments like that receive too little recognition . you ca n't understand afghanistan without looking at its neighbors .
let 's start with pakistan .
the country is actually an ally , but , as we 've come to see , there are sections in that society that oppose us - some would even call them enemies .
is the government in islamabad not playing fair ?
i think , even there , you have to see the successes .
for example , in the run-up to the afghanistan conference , a trade deal was agreed between afghanistan and pakistan .
that does n't sound all that spectacular , but if you know the history of the two countries , it 's a pretty amazing event .
then there 's a further issue to consider .
we need the neighbors , we need regional cooperation to be successful .
in london at the beginning of the year we were missing one country from the region .
but in kabul the entire region was represented and agreed to the declaration .
that helps strengthen the bonds between neighbors .
we want to encourage that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops have been in afghanistan since 2001 that of course is difficult to imagine , for example with iran .
and that 's who we 're talking about in this case .
sanctions have been imposed on the country , people are scared of nuclear arms ; they 're scared of the iranian president .
but you also have to engage the iranians somehow , in order to stabilize afghanistan .
is such a balancing act realistic ?
well , it 's necessary , or at least it 's essential we try .
the eu and the un did n't decide on sanctions in order to oppose a country , or to prevent iran from using nuclear power for civilian purposes .
instead , we want to see the iranian government return to the negotiating table , to cooperate , to provide transparency - things that iran has actually already committed itself to .
all countries are permitted to use nuclear power for peaceful and civilian purposes .
but they must also cooperate with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , and provide complete transparency to demonstrate they are using it for exclusively civilian purposes - and not secretly developing a bomb .
that is what we need to prevent , and we remain willing to negotiate with iran .
i could also imagine that talks could take place in september between our european colleague catherine ashton and the iranian side .
that 's our goal .
but it requires cooperation and transparency from iran - and iran must not lay down any preconditions for comprehensive talks .
the war in afghanistan is viewed skeptically in many countries - in most countries , by the majority of the population .
after eight years of involvement in afghanistan , how long will patience last for the hope of reaching the goal we want to reach - a relatively peaceful afghanistan ?
that 's a very hard question to answer .
and i can only advise that we do n't lose sight of our own interests .
it is in our interest that we do not allow those who export terrorism into the world … to turn afghanistan back into a safe haven where they can re-arm .
people forget that many attacks were planned there , and some of those attacks also targeted europe .
yes , we should be skeptical , and view any foreign deployment of the bundeswehr initially with a healthy dose of skepticism .
but i would also suggest that we understand that this also concerns our own security , and that is why we want to be and must be successful .
but we also need a clear perspective on withdrawal - something we can work towards by doing even more , as , for example , in supporting civil redevelopment .

the taliban have claimed responsibility for the killings . the german government strongly condemned saturday the murder of 10 aid workers in northern afghanistan , the majority of whom were foreigners , including one german woman .
" the german government is indignant over the terrible attack , " government spokeswoman sabine heimbach said in a statement .
the government called for a full inquiry into the " cowardly murder " and for the perpetrators to be punished .
" the incident underlines the necessity to continue working with determination towards stabilizing the situation in afghanistan , so the afghan government can increasingly take responsibility for security in the country , " the government said .
the bullet-riddled bodies of the eight foreign medical workers and two afghans working for an international health charity were discovered in a mountainous , forested area in northern afghanistan , according to afghan police .
the taliban quickly claimed responsibility for the attack on a group they called " christian missionaries . "
the international assistance mission -lrb- iam -rrb- , a non-profit christian health organization , said six of the dead were americans , one was german and one was british .
the iam provides medical and eye care in remote areas and has been operating in afghanistan since 1966 .
robbery a likely motive dirk frans , the group 's director , said the team numbered 12 , including four afghans , two of whom were killed . the group , he said , were on their way back to kabul from an eye facility in nuristan province near the border with pakistan .
" they were killed on their way back .
they had no guns and no security because we come at the communities ' invitation and they take care of us , " frans told the agence france-presse news agency .
" there have never been any threats against us .
if there were threats , we would not have gone , " he said .
he said the organization would continue its activities .
despite the taliban claim , frans said police had told him that robbery was the likely motive for the killings .
the victims , seven men and three women , had been stripped of all their money and belongings .
he denied the taliban 's claim that the group carried bibles in the local language dari .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuristan and badakshan are close to afghanistan 's porous border with pakistan conflicting information according to police , an afghan colleague of the victims who survived the attack walked to a police station in badakhshan to inform them of the attack .
police said the attack took place some two weeks ago , but because of the remoteness of the area they were unable to recover the bodies until thursday .
the information was in apparent conflict with the taliban 's claims that the attack was on friday .
the taliban also claimed there were nine foreigners - five men and four women - and one afghan national .
the survivor , identified only as sayedullah , said the foreigners worked at a hospital in kabul .
the victims were reportedly found next to their three four-wheel drive vehicles and had been lined up before they were shot .

the taliban have claimed responsibility for the killings . the german government strongly condemned saturday the murder of 10 aid workers in northern afghanistan , the majority of whom were foreigners , including one german woman .
" the german government is indignant over the terrible attack , " government spokeswoman sabine heimbach said in a statement .
the government called for a full inquiry into the " cowardly murder " and for the perpetrators to be punished .
" the incident underlines the necessity to continue working with determination towards stabilizing the situation in afghanistan , so the afghan government can increasingly take responsibility for security in the country , " the government said .
the bullet-riddled bodies of the eight foreign medical workers and two afghans working for an international health charity were discovered in a mountainous , forested area in northern afghanistan , according to afghan police .
the taliban quickly claimed responsibility for the attack on a group they called " christian missionaries . "
the international assistance mission -lrb- iam -rrb- , a non-profit christian health organization , said six of the dead were americans , one was german and one was british .
the iam provides medical and eye care in remote areas and has been operating in afghanistan since 1966 .
robbery a likely motive dirk frans , the group 's director , said the team numbered 12 , including four afghans , two of whom were killed . the group , he said , were on their way back to kabul from an eye facility in nuristan province near the border with pakistan .
" they were killed on their way back .
they had no guns and no security because we come at the communities ' invitation and they take care of us , " frans told the agence france-presse news agency .
" there have never been any threats against us .
if there were threats , we would not have gone , " he said .
he said the organization would continue its activities .
despite the taliban claim , frans said police had told him that robbery was the likely motive for the killings .
the victims , seven men and three women , had been stripped of all their money and belongings .
he denied the taliban 's claim that the group carried bibles in the local language dari .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuristan and badakshan are close to afghanistan 's porous border with pakistan conflicting information according to police , an afghan colleague of the victims who survived the attack walked to a police station in badakhshan to inform them of the attack .
police said the attack took place some two weeks ago , but because of the remoteness of the area they were unable to recover the bodies until thursday .
the information was in apparent conflict with the taliban 's claims that the attack was on friday .
the taliban also claimed there were nine foreigners - five men and four women - and one afghan national .
the survivor , identified only as sayedullah , said the foreigners worked at a hospital in kabul .
the victims were reportedly found next to their three four-wheel drive vehicles and had been lined up before they were shot .
a western official , asking to remain anonymous , said the us embassy was organizing the return of the bodies to kabul where they would be formally identified . author : martin kuebler -lrb- ap / dpa / epd / afp -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 07.08.2010 un climate talks founder ahead of cancun großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks were aimed at smoothing the way for a deal talks to clear the way for a deal on climate change in cancun later this year have made little progress .
eu climate commissioner connie hedegaard said that , if anything , negoations were going in the wrong direction . international efforts to curb the threat of global warming are backsliding , said negotiators after a week of un climate talks in bonn .
chances of an early deal on curbing global warming ahead of the next major conference in cancun , mexico looked increasingly slim , the eu said on friday .
" these negotiations have , if anything , gone backwards , " said eu climate action commissioner connie hedegaard on the outcome of discussions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hedegaard said the world was ' in danger of missing the train ' in a statement , hedegaard said that major polluters appeared reluctant to take on their " fair share " of reductions to carbon emissions .
" this imbalance is not helpful and could seriously endanger the prospects of securing the successful outcome the world needs from the cancun climate conference next december , ” she warned .
" at this pace the world will simply collectively miss the train . "
last minute additions several major industrial nations still refuse to make legally binding cuts .
efforts to agree on a draft text for negotiation in cancun were hampered after a number of countries demanded last-minute additions to suit their own interests .
the eu 's co-lead negotiator , artur runge-metzger , accused some countries of making additions in a “ tit for tat " way that was not in keeping with the spirit of the talks .
referring to the next set of discussions in tianjin , china , runge-metzger said , " it is important in tianjin to turn that spirit around . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floods in pakistan were highlighted as an example of the dangers of climate change the copenhagen accord agreed in principle a goal of capping any global increase of temperatures at 2 degrees centigrade -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
the principles for providing aid to countries to deal with curbing c02 were also laid out along with plans to monitor emissions cuts .
however , even the limited achievements of that conference appeared to be in jeopardy , said european union representative peter wittoeck .
" it is disappointing to see some countries that have associated themselves with the accord seem to be dissociating themselves from its political consensus , " said wittoeck .
worries over us legislation wittoeck added that worries that the us congress would not pass legislation on climate change later this year had also cast a shadow over proceedings .
us negotiator jonathan pershing said he was eager for swift agreement , adding that record global temperatures , forest fires in russia and deadly floods in pakistan were " all consistent with the kind of changes we could expect from climate change , and they will get worse if we do n't act quickly . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un climate change chief christiana figueres said some progress had been made " unfortunately , what we have seen over and over this week is that some countries are walking back from the progress made in copenhagen , " pershing told journalists .
he told the reuters news agency that negotiators were putting too much onus on rich nations to deliver cuts , rather than seeking global commitments .
un climate chief christiana figueres said she believed that some progress had been made but that governments had to focus on solutions .
" to receive the desired outcome in cancun they must radically narrow down the choices that are now on the table , " she said .

dw : is the war in afghanistan a political nightmare for you ?
guido westerwelle : i do n't think it 's something anyone would wish upon themselves .
nobody relishes having political responsibility in times like these .
the decision was taken many years ago by the government of the time and we now have to face up to our responsibility .
we have to contribute to our own security , to protect ourselves and our citizens from terrorism as far as possible .
and it 's also in our interest that afghanistan develops positively and becomes a stable country again in the future .
there have been two afghanistan conferences this year , one in london and one in kabul .
you took part in both and you played a major role in one .
a basic framework of action was agreed , involving more security force training , attempts to integrate former taliban and more civil reconstruction .
six months on , has there been any progress ?
or is it too early to judge ?
well , the situation is varied .
i fear we 're going to go through some security setbacks first .
the harvest season is coming to an end .
experience has shown that that often aggravates the security situation .
on the other hand , there are 134 districts in the north and only eight of those are regarded as being particularly dangerous .
so you have to see that as well as building roads and schools , including girls ' schools , we 've helped stabilize the region politically .
that was our main goal .
our other goal is to be able to transfer responsibility for security to the afghan government in 2014 .
that 's also president hamid karzai 's goal and it was agreed by the international community at the recent afghanistan conference in kabul .
still , many people have the impression that things are not really improving in afghanistan .
why is civil reconstruction progressing so slowly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle says most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing i believe you 've got to look at the various aspects differently .
it 's true that some areas of development are not progressing much .
but others have seen positive changes and that should be appreciated .
you must n't forget that we 're there because the great majority of ordinary afghans want us there .
at the same time , we 've now got to implement the change of strategy that we agreed first in london and then in kabul - and that involves achieving political reconciliation .
are you finding you 're increasingly able to ' win the hearts of afghans ' - as one former defense minister put it ?
are afghans open to that ?
yes .
as far as we know , most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing .
the debate in germany and other european countries just shows you the setbacks , the attacks and all the negative issues , things that are not working .
you rarely see examples of progress .
one such example is the peace jirga gathering .
about 1,600 delegates attended and managed to reach an agreement , and about 20 percent of the delegates were women .
in my opinion , developments like that receive too little recognition . you ca n't understand afghanistan without looking at its neighbors .
let 's start with pakistan .
the country is actually an ally , but , as we 've come to see , there are sections in that society that oppose us - some would even call them enemies .
is the government in islamabad not playing fair ?
i think , even there , you have to see the successes .
for example , in the run-up to the afghanistan conference , a trade deal was agreed between afghanistan and pakistan .
that does n't sound all that spectacular , but if you know the history of the two countries , it 's a pretty amazing event .
then there 's a further issue to consider .
we need the neighbors , we need regional cooperation to be successful .
in london at the beginning of the year we were missing one country from the region .
but in kabul the entire region was represented and agreed to the declaration .
that helps strengthen the bonds between neighbors .
we want to encourage that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops have been in afghanistan since 2001 that of course is difficult to imagine , for example with iran .
and that 's who we 're talking about in this case .
sanctions have been imposed on the country , people are scared of nuclear arms ; they 're scared of the iranian president .
but you also have to engage the iranians somehow , in order to stabilize afghanistan .
is such a balancing act realistic ?
well , it 's necessary , or at least it 's essential we try .
the eu and the un did n't decide on sanctions in order to oppose a country , or to prevent iran from using nuclear power for civilian purposes .
instead , we want to see the iranian government return to the negotiating table , to cooperate , to provide transparency - things that iran has actually already committed itself to .
all countries are permitted to use nuclear power for peaceful and civilian purposes .
but they must also cooperate with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , and provide complete transparency to demonstrate they are using it for exclusively civilian purposes - and not secretly developing a bomb .
that is what we need to prevent , and we remain willing to negotiate with iran .
i could also imagine that talks could take place in september between our european colleague catherine ashton and the iranian side .
that 's our goal .
but it requires cooperation and transparency from iran - and iran must not lay down any preconditions for comprehensive talks .
the war in afghanistan is viewed skeptically in many countries - in most countries , by the majority of the population .
after eight years of involvement in afghanistan , how long will patience last for the hope of reaching the goal we want to reach - a relatively peaceful afghanistan ?
that 's a very hard question to answer .
and i can only advise that we do n't lose sight of our own interests .
it is in our interest that we do not allow those who export terrorism into the world … to turn afghanistan back into a safe haven where they can re-arm .
people forget that many attacks were planned there , and some of those attacks also targeted europe .
yes , we should be skeptical , and view any foreign deployment of the bundeswehr initially with a healthy dose of skepticism .
but i would also suggest that we understand that this also concerns our own security , and that is why we want to be and must be successful .
but we also need a clear perspective on withdrawal - something we can work towards by doing even more , as , for example , in supporting civil redevelopment .

so you have to see that as well as building roads and schools , including girls ' schools , we 've helped stabilize the region politically .
that was our main goal .
our other goal is to be able to transfer responsibility for security to the afghan government in 2014 .
that 's also president hamid karzai 's goal and it was agreed by the international community at the recent afghanistan conference in kabul .
still , many people have the impression that things are not really improving in afghanistan .
why is civil reconstruction progressing so slowly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle says most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing i believe you 've got to look at the various aspects differently .
it 's true that some areas of development are not progressing much .
but others have seen positive changes and that should be appreciated .
you must n't forget that we 're there because the great majority of ordinary afghans want us there .
at the same time , we 've now got to implement the change of strategy that we agreed first in london and then in kabul - and that involves achieving political reconciliation .
are you finding you 're increasingly able to ' win the hearts of afghans ' - as one former defense minister put it ?
are afghans open to that ?
yes .
as far as we know , most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing .
the debate in germany and other european countries just shows you the setbacks , the attacks and all the negative issues , things that are not working .
you rarely see examples of progress .
one such example is the peace jirga gathering .
about 1,600 delegates attended and managed to reach an agreement , and about 20 percent of the delegates were women .
in my opinion , developments like that receive too little recognition . you ca n't understand afghanistan without looking at its neighbors .
let 's start with pakistan .
the country is actually an ally , but , as we 've come to see , there are sections in that society that oppose us - some would even call them enemies .
is the government in islamabad not playing fair ?
i think , even there , you have to see the successes .
for example , in the run-up to the afghanistan conference , a trade deal was agreed between afghanistan and pakistan .
that does n't sound all that spectacular , but if you know the history of the two countries , it 's a pretty amazing event .
then there 's a further issue to consider .
we need the neighbors , we need regional cooperation to be successful .
in london at the beginning of the year we were missing one country from the region .
but in kabul the entire region was represented and agreed to the declaration .
that helps strengthen the bonds between neighbors .
we want to encourage that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops have been in afghanistan since 2001 that of course is difficult to imagine , for example with iran .
and that 's who we 're talking about in this case .
sanctions have been imposed on the country , people are scared of nuclear arms ; they 're scared of the iranian president .
but you also have to engage the iranians somehow , in order to stabilize afghanistan .
is such a balancing act realistic ?
well , it 's necessary , or at least it 's essential we try .
the eu and the un did n't decide on sanctions in order to oppose a country , or to prevent iran from using nuclear power for civilian purposes .
instead , we want to see the iranian government return to the negotiating table , to cooperate , to provide transparency - things that iran has actually already committed itself to .
all countries are permitted to use nuclear power for peaceful and civilian purposes .
but they must also cooperate with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , and provide complete transparency to demonstrate they are using it for exclusively civilian purposes - and not secretly developing a bomb .
that is what we need to prevent , and we remain willing to negotiate with iran .
i could also imagine that talks could take place in september between our european colleague catherine ashton and the iranian side .
that 's our goal .
but it requires cooperation and transparency from iran - and iran must not lay down any preconditions for comprehensive talks .
the war in afghanistan is viewed skeptically in many countries - in most countries , by the majority of the population .
after eight years of involvement in afghanistan , how long will patience last for the hope of reaching the goal we want to reach - a relatively peaceful afghanistan ?
that 's a very hard question to answer .
and i can only advise that we do n't lose sight of our own interests .
it is in our interest that we do not allow those who export terrorism into the world … to turn afghanistan back into a safe haven where they can re-arm .
people forget that many attacks were planned there , and some of those attacks also targeted europe .
yes , we should be skeptical , and view any foreign deployment of the bundeswehr initially with a healthy dose of skepticism .
but i would also suggest that we understand that this also concerns our own security , and that is why we want to be and must be successful .
but we also need a clear perspective on withdrawal - something we can work towards by doing even more , as , for example , in supporting civil redevelopment .

dw : is the war in afghanistan a political nightmare for you ?
guido westerwelle : i do n't think it 's something anyone would wish upon themselves .
nobody relishes having political responsibility in times like these .
the decision was taken many years ago by the government of the time and we now have to face up to our responsibility .
we have to contribute to our own security , to protect ourselves and our citizens from terrorism as far as possible .
and it 's also in our interest that afghanistan develops positively and becomes a stable country again in the future .
there have been two afghanistan conferences this year , one in london and one in kabul .
you took part in both and you played a major role in one .
a basic framework of action was agreed , involving more security force training , attempts to integrate former taliban and more civil reconstruction .
six months on , has there been any progress ?
or is it too early to judge ?
well , the situation is varied .
i fear we 're going to go through some security setbacks first .
the harvest season is coming to an end .
experience has shown that that often aggravates the security situation .
on the other hand , there are 134 districts in the north and only eight of those are regarded as being particularly dangerous .

the gates ' campaign is " too garish , " an asset manager told german news magazine der spiegel , asking to remain anonymous .
hamburg multimillionaire peter kraemer said the initiative was " highly problematic " and suggested that germany 's wealthy find other ways to donate .
gates launched his campaign , known as the giving pledge , with investor warren buffet in june .
the campaign was initially intended to encourage wealthy americans to donate at least 50 percent of their wealth to charitable causes , but has since gone global .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gates foundation has given away nearly $ 23 billion since 1994 gates said this week that he and buffet have scheduled meetings with some of the wealthiest people in china and india in the coming months .
forty billionaires have so far pledged to donate at least half of their fortunes to charity , including new york city mayor michael bloomberg , hollywood director george lucas and mexican tycoon carlos slim .
based on a forbes magazine estimate of the billionaires ' wealth , at least $ 150 billion -lrb- 112.9 billion euros -rrb- could be given away .
' a troubling development ' in an interview with der spiegel , kraemer said donations in the united states are for the most part tax deductible , giving the rich the option of contributing to charity or paying taxes .
he said donations of this magnitude lead to the wealthy minority of the population rather than the government deciding on where to allocate charitable funds . " i find this to be a troubling development , " said kramer .
" who has given these people the authority to decide where such huge amounts of money should be spent ? "
some wealthy germans are already known to be generous donors .
co-founder of software giant sap dietmar hopp finances soccer club tsg 1899 hoffenheim and has donated assets worth about 2.9 billion euros to a foundation .
hopp 's partner klaus tschira has also donated more than half of his fortune to a foundation promoting science , mathematics and computer science .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 07.08.2010 being honored by the fatherland : germany 's federal cross of merit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal cross of merit was introduced in 1951 where the uk has its knighthood , and france its legion of honour , germany rewards its loyal citizens with the federal cross of merit .
its most famous recent recipient was the national soccer team coach joachim loew . after the deflating end to germany 's thrilling world cup campaign in south africa , president christian wulff did his best to lift the mood by nominating coach joachim loew and his team for some national honors .
the honor that loew is to receive is the most commonly awarded - the cross of merit on ribbon , or the knight 's cross .
eight other national football coaches have received the same honor , as has the women 's soccer team coach silvia neid .
the footballers themselves , meanwhile , are to be honored with the silver laurel leaf , the highest sporting honor in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew is the latest in a line of football coaches to receive the honor loew is by some distance the most famous person on this year 's list of winners .
unlike in britain , celebrities rarely make the cut , and if they do , it is never for things like " services to entertainment . "
susanne bos-eisolt , who is in charge of the department of the president 's office that administrates the honors , explains what they are for .
" first , to say thank you for what people do voluntarily for the state and for society .
and often it is about making the invisible visible , " she told deutsche welle .
" people often work on a small scale in local communities over many years , so that the wider public never gets to hear about them .
but as soon as the president says " thank you , " either personally or through such an award , the invisible becomes visible . "
anyone can nominate anyone there is a democratic principle behind germany 's state honors .
literally anyone can nominate anyone for any award .
all it takes is a letter either to the presidential office - or your local state premier - detailing the name , address and the accomplishments of the nominee .
german citizenship is not a requirement , either for the nominee or the nominator , and some seven percent of the approximately 2,300 awards handed out every year go to foreigners .
there are eight different federal orders of merit and they are organised more or less by demographic range - the more lives you have affected , the bigger the honor .
the simplest honor - the medal of merit - is often awarded to people who have selflessly looked after their families , while the highest honor - " the grand cross " - is reserved exclusively for heads of state .
there is also a special class of the grand cross , which has only been awarded twice – once to germany 's first post-war chancellor konrad adenauer , and once to chancellor helmut kohl .
the awards in between mainly go to politicians , professors , nobel prize winners , assorted philanthropists and museum directors .
sometimes , in a given year , they are grouped into themes .
last year , the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall was marked by awards relating to the former east germany .
devalued by dictatorship this left one of the recipients , hubertus knabe , director of the stasi prison memorial site in berlin with a dilemma .
" yes , i hesitated to accept this cross of merit because these kinds of state awards were misused in the past in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" we had two dictatorships , and every dictatorship used state awards to honor all kinds of collaboration . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the award is often presented in a ceremony at the presidential palace knabe , an historian who has extensively studied the darker side of the german democratic republic , is used to associating state honors with corruption and toeing the party line .
" if you read all these personal files , how they got all these orders and awards , it makes you a little bit allergic against these kind of state awards , " he said .
collector 's items uwe brueckner does not suffer from any such allergy .
the berlin policeman has been collecting german medals of honor since the age of 15 in 1975 .
to the occasional amusement of other collectors , brueckner has specialized in the federal order of merit in all its forms .
" i wanted to collect something where i had a chance of getting the complete set , " says brueckner , recalling his years of teenage rebellion .
" most collectors are more interested in earlier periods , especially the third reich , but there are so many different medals , and so many of them are impossible to find . "
he has now completed the federal republic set - with 200 individual medals - though for the higher levels he has had to make do with examples that do not have the original certificate with them , and so have probably been bought direct from the manufacturer .
he keeps the cream of his collection in a beautifully-lit display case in the hallway of his small flat in north berlin .
the most privileged shelf - at eye-level - is dedicated to the federal order of merit , and brueckner has set the honors out in an immaculate arrangement .
his prize possession is a " great cross of merit with star and shoulder ribbon " awarded to karl branner , the mayor of the western german town of kassel , in 1990 .
" it 's better than collecting coins , " brueckner said .
" coins all look the same , and stamps are no fun because you ca n't even touch them without devaluing them .
but medals often have real craftsmanship in them .
also , there 's a story and some history behind every one . "
while the modern federal cross of merit has little in the way of craftsmanship – " nowadays they are just factory products that are n't embellished at all " – brueckner is still proud of his set , partly for loyalty reasons .
" would i describe myself as a patriot ? " he asks himself .
" yes , i suppose so .
i suppose there 's some patriotism involved .
i support germany anyway . "

the taliban have claimed responsibility for the killings . the german government strongly condemned saturday the murder of 10 aid workers in northern afghanistan , the majority of whom were foreigners , including one german woman .
" the german government is indignant over the terrible attack , " government spokeswoman sabine heimbach said in a statement .
the government called for a full inquiry into the " cowardly murder " and for the perpetrators to be punished .
" the incident underlines the necessity to continue working with determination towards stabilizing the situation in afghanistan , so the afghan government can increasingly take responsibility for security in the country , " the government said .
the bullet-riddled bodies of the eight foreign medical workers and two afghans working for an international health charity were discovered in a mountainous , forested area in northern afghanistan , according to afghan police .
the taliban quickly claimed responsibility for the attack on a group they called " christian missionaries . "
the international assistance mission -lrb- iam -rrb- , a non-profit christian health organization , said six of the dead were americans , one was german and one was british .
the iam provides medical and eye care in remote areas and has been operating in afghanistan since 1966 .
robbery a likely motive dirk frans , the group 's director , said the team numbered 12 , including four afghans , two of whom were killed . the group , he said , were on their way back to kabul from an eye facility in nuristan province near the border with pakistan .
" they were killed on their way back .
they had no guns and no security because we come at the communities ' invitation and they take care of us , " frans told the agence france-presse news agency .
" there have never been any threats against us .
if there were threats , we would not have gone , " he said .
he said the organization would continue its activities .
despite the taliban claim , frans said police had told him that robbery was the likely motive for the killings .
the victims , seven men and three women , had been stripped of all their money and belongings .
he denied the taliban 's claim that the group carried bibles in the local language dari .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuristan and badakshan are close to afghanistan 's porous border with pakistan conflicting information according to police , an afghan colleague of the victims who survived the attack walked to a police station in badakhshan to inform them of the attack .
police said the attack took place some two weeks ago , but because of the remoteness of the area they were unable to recover the bodies until thursday .
the information was in apparent conflict with the taliban 's claims that the attack was on friday .
the taliban also claimed there were nine foreigners - five men and four women - and one afghan national .
the survivor , identified only as sayedullah , said the foreigners worked at a hospital in kabul .
the victims were reportedly found next to their three four-wheel drive vehicles and had been lined up before they were shot .
a western official , asking to remain anonymous , said the us embassy was organizing the return of the bodies to kabul where they would be formally identified . author : martin kuebler -lrb- ap / dpa / epd / afp -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw : is the war in afghanistan a political nightmare for you ?
guido westerwelle : i do n't think it 's something anyone would wish upon themselves .
nobody relishes having political responsibility in times like these .
the decision was taken many years ago by the government of the time and we now have to face up to our responsibility .
we have to contribute to our own security , to protect ourselves and our citizens from terrorism as far as possible .
and it 's also in our interest that afghanistan develops positively and becomes a stable country again in the future .
there have been two afghanistan conferences this year , one in london and one in kabul .
you took part in both and you played a major role in one .
a basic framework of action was agreed , involving more security force training , attempts to integrate former taliban and more civil reconstruction .
six months on , has there been any progress ?
or is it too early to judge ?
well , the situation is varied .
i fear we 're going to go through some security setbacks first .
the harvest season is coming to an end .
experience has shown that that often aggravates the security situation .
on the other hand , there are 134 districts in the north and only eight of those are regarded as being particularly dangerous .
so you have to see that as well as building roads and schools , including girls ' schools , we 've helped stabilize the region politically .
that was our main goal .
our other goal is to be able to transfer responsibility for security to the afghan government in 2014 .
that 's also president hamid karzai 's goal and it was agreed by the international community at the recent afghanistan conference in kabul .
still , many people have the impression that things are not really improving in afghanistan .
why is civil reconstruction progressing so slowly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle says most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing i believe you 've got to look at the various aspects differently .
it 's true that some areas of development are not progressing much .
but others have seen positive changes and that should be appreciated .
you must n't forget that we 're there because the great majority of ordinary afghans want us there .
at the same time , we 've now got to implement the change of strategy that we agreed first in london and then in kabul - and that involves achieving political reconciliation .
are you finding you 're increasingly able to ' win the hearts of afghans ' - as one former defense minister put it ?
are afghans open to that ?
yes .
as far as we know , most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing .
the debate in germany and other european countries just shows you the setbacks , the attacks and all the negative issues , things that are not working .
you rarely see examples of progress .
one such example is the peace jirga gathering .
about 1,600 delegates attended and managed to reach an agreement , and about 20 percent of the delegates were women .
in my opinion , developments like that receive too little recognition . you ca n't understand afghanistan without looking at its neighbors .
let 's start with pakistan .
the country is actually an ally , but , as we 've come to see , there are sections in that society that oppose us - some would even call them enemies .
is the government in islamabad not playing fair ?
i think , even there , you have to see the successes .
for example , in the run-up to the afghanistan conference , a trade deal was agreed between afghanistan and pakistan .
that does n't sound all that spectacular , but if you know the history of the two countries , it 's a pretty amazing event .
then there 's a further issue to consider .
we need the neighbors , we need regional cooperation to be successful .
in london at the beginning of the year we were missing one country from the region .
but in kabul the entire region was represented and agreed to the declaration .
that helps strengthen the bonds between neighbors .
we want to encourage that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops have been in afghanistan since 2001 that of course is difficult to imagine , for example with iran .
and that 's who we 're talking about in this case .
sanctions have been imposed on the country , people are scared of nuclear arms ; they 're scared of the iranian president .
but you also have to engage the iranians somehow , in order to stabilize afghanistan .
is such a balancing act realistic ?
well , it 's necessary , or at least it 's essential we try .
the eu and the un did n't decide on sanctions in order to oppose a country , or to prevent iran from using nuclear power for civilian purposes .
instead , we want to see the iranian government return to the negotiating table , to cooperate , to provide transparency - things that iran has actually already committed itself to .
all countries are permitted to use nuclear power for peaceful and civilian purposes .
but they must also cooperate with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , and provide complete transparency to demonstrate they are using it for exclusively civilian purposes - and not secretly developing a bomb .
that is what we need to prevent , and we remain willing to negotiate with iran .
i could also imagine that talks could take place in september between our european colleague catherine ashton and the iranian side .
that 's our goal .
but it requires cooperation and transparency from iran - and iran must not lay down any preconditions for comprehensive talks .
the war in afghanistan is viewed skeptically in many countries - in most countries , by the majority of the population .
after eight years of involvement in afghanistan , how long will patience last for the hope of reaching the goal we want to reach - a relatively peaceful afghanistan ?
that 's a very hard question to answer .
and i can only advise that we do n't lose sight of our own interests .
it is in our interest that we do not allow those who export terrorism into the world … to turn afghanistan back into a safe haven where they can re-arm .
people forget that many attacks were planned there , and some of those attacks also targeted europe .
yes , we should be skeptical , and view any foreign deployment of the bundeswehr initially with a healthy dose of skepticism .
but i would also suggest that we understand that this also concerns our own security , and that is why we want to be and must be successful .
but we also need a clear perspective on withdrawal - something we can work towards by doing even more , as , for example , in supporting civil redevelopment .

its most famous recent recipient was the national soccer team coach joachim loew . after the deflating end to germany 's thrilling world cup campaign in south africa , president christian wulff did his best to lift the mood by nominating coach joachim loew and his team for some national honors .
the honor that loew is to receive is the most commonly awarded - the cross of merit on ribbon , or the knight 's cross .
eight other national football coaches have received the same honor , as has the women 's soccer team coach silvia neid .

the taliban have claimed responsibility for the killings . the german government strongly condemned saturday the murder of 10 aid workers in northern afghanistan , the majority of whom were foreigners , including one german woman .
" the german government is indignant over the terrible attack , " government spokeswoman sabine heimbach said in a statement .
the government called for a full inquiry into the " cowardly murder " and for the perpetrators to be punished .
" the incident underlines the necessity to continue working with determination towards stabilizing the situation in afghanistan , so the afghan government can increasingly take responsibility for security in the country , " the government said .
the bullet-riddled bodies of the eight foreign medical workers and two afghans working for an international health charity were discovered in a mountainous , forested area in northern afghanistan , according to afghan police .
the taliban quickly claimed responsibility for the attack on a group they called " christian missionaries . "
the international assistance mission -lrb- iam -rrb- , a non-profit christian health organization , said six of the dead were americans , one was german and one was british .
the iam provides medical and eye care in remote areas and has been operating in afghanistan since 1966 .
robbery a likely motive dirk frans , the group 's director , said the team numbered 12 , including four afghans , two of whom were killed . the group , he said , were on their way back to kabul from an eye facility in nuristan province near the border with pakistan .
" they were killed on their way back .
they had no guns and no security because we come at the communities ' invitation and they take care of us , " frans told the agence france-presse news agency .
" there have never been any threats against us .
if there were threats , we would not have gone , " he said .
he said the organization would continue its activities .
despite the taliban claim , frans said police had told him that robbery was the likely motive for the killings .
the victims , seven men and three women , had been stripped of all their money and belongings .
he denied the taliban 's claim that the group carried bibles in the local language dari .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuristan and badakshan are close to afghanistan 's porous border with pakistan conflicting information according to police , an afghan colleague of the victims who survived the attack walked to a police station in badakhshan to inform them of the attack .
police said the attack took place some two weeks ago , but because of the remoteness of the area they were unable to recover the bodies until thursday .
the information was in apparent conflict with the taliban 's claims that the attack was on friday .
the taliban also claimed there were nine foreigners - five men and four women - and one afghan national .
the survivor , identified only as sayedullah , said the foreigners worked at a hospital in kabul .
the victims were reportedly found next to their three four-wheel drive vehicles and had been lined up before they were shot .
a western official , asking to remain anonymous , said the us embassy was organizing the return of the bodies to kabul where they would be formally identified . author : martin kuebler -lrb- ap / dpa / epd / afp -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw : is the war in afghanistan a political nightmare for you ?
guido westerwelle : i do n't think it 's something anyone would wish upon themselves .
nobody relishes having political responsibility in times like these .
the decision was taken many years ago by the government of the time and we now have to face up to our responsibility .
we have to contribute to our own security , to protect ourselves and our citizens from terrorism as far as possible .
and it 's also in our interest that afghanistan develops positively and becomes a stable country again in the future .
there have been two afghanistan conferences this year , one in london and one in kabul .
you took part in both and you played a major role in one .
a basic framework of action was agreed , involving more security force training , attempts to integrate former taliban and more civil reconstruction .
six months on , has there been any progress ?
or is it too early to judge ?
well , the situation is varied .
i fear we 're going to go through some security setbacks first .
the harvest season is coming to an end .
experience has shown that that often aggravates the security situation .
on the other hand , there are 134 districts in the north and only eight of those are regarded as being particularly dangerous .
so you have to see that as well as building roads and schools , including girls ' schools , we 've helped stabilize the region politically .
that was our main goal .
our other goal is to be able to transfer responsibility for security to the afghan government in 2014 .
that 's also president hamid karzai 's goal and it was agreed by the international community at the recent afghanistan conference in kabul .
still , many people have the impression that things are not really improving in afghanistan .
why is civil reconstruction progressing so slowly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle says most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing i believe you 've got to look at the various aspects differently .
it 's true that some areas of development are not progressing much .
but others have seen positive changes and that should be appreciated .
you must n't forget that we 're there because the great majority of ordinary afghans want us there .
at the same time , we 've now got to implement the change of strategy that we agreed first in london and then in kabul - and that involves achieving political reconciliation .
are you finding you 're increasingly able to ' win the hearts of afghans ' - as one former defense minister put it ?
are afghans open to that ?
yes .
as far as we know , most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing .
the debate in germany and other european countries just shows you the setbacks , the attacks and all the negative issues , things that are not working .
you rarely see examples of progress .
one such example is the peace jirga gathering .
about 1,600 delegates attended and managed to reach an agreement , and about 20 percent of the delegates were women .
in my opinion , developments like that receive too little recognition . you ca n't understand afghanistan without looking at its neighbors .
let 's start with pakistan .
the country is actually an ally , but , as we 've come to see , there are sections in that society that oppose us - some would even call them enemies .
is the government in islamabad not playing fair ?
i think , even there , you have to see the successes .
for example , in the run-up to the afghanistan conference , a trade deal was agreed between afghanistan and pakistan .
that does n't sound all that spectacular , but if you know the history of the two countries , it 's a pretty amazing event .
then there 's a further issue to consider .
we need the neighbors , we need regional cooperation to be successful .
in london at the beginning of the year we were missing one country from the region .
but in kabul the entire region was represented and agreed to the declaration .
that helps strengthen the bonds between neighbors .
we want to encourage that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops have been in afghanistan since 2001 that of course is difficult to imagine , for example with iran .
and that 's who we 're talking about in this case .
sanctions have been imposed on the country , people are scared of nuclear arms ; they 're scared of the iranian president .
but you also have to engage the iranians somehow , in order to stabilize afghanistan .
is such a balancing act realistic ?
well , it 's necessary , or at least it 's essential we try .
the eu and the un did n't decide on sanctions in order to oppose a country , or to prevent iran from using nuclear power for civilian purposes .
instead , we want to see the iranian government return to the negotiating table , to cooperate , to provide transparency - things that iran has actually already committed itself to .
all countries are permitted to use nuclear power for peaceful and civilian purposes .
but they must also cooperate with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , and provide complete transparency to demonstrate they are using it for exclusively civilian purposes - and not secretly developing a bomb .
that is what we need to prevent , and we remain willing to negotiate with iran .
i could also imagine that talks could take place in september between our european colleague catherine ashton and the iranian side .
that 's our goal .
but it requires cooperation and transparency from iran - and iran must not lay down any preconditions for comprehensive talks .
the war in afghanistan is viewed skeptically in many countries - in most countries , by the majority of the population .
after eight years of involvement in afghanistan , how long will patience last for the hope of reaching the goal we want to reach - a relatively peaceful afghanistan ?
that 's a very hard question to answer .
and i can only advise that we do n't lose sight of our own interests .
it is in our interest that we do not allow those who export terrorism into the world … to turn afghanistan back into a safe haven where they can re-arm .
people forget that many attacks were planned there , and some of those attacks also targeted europe .
yes , we should be skeptical , and view any foreign deployment of the bundeswehr initially with a healthy dose of skepticism .
but i would also suggest that we understand that this also concerns our own security , and that is why we want to be and must be successful .
but we also need a clear perspective on withdrawal - something we can work towards by doing even more , as , for example , in supporting civil redevelopment .

dw : is the war in afghanistan a political nightmare for you ?
guido westerwelle : i do n't think it 's something anyone would wish upon themselves .
nobody relishes having political responsibility in times like these .
the decision was taken many years ago by the government of the time and we now have to face up to our responsibility .
we have to contribute to our own security , to protect ourselves and our citizens from terrorism as far as possible .
and it 's also in our interest that afghanistan develops positively and becomes a stable country again in the future .
there have been two afghanistan conferences this year , one in london and one in kabul .
you took part in both and you played a major role in one .
a basic framework of action was agreed , involving more security force training , attempts to integrate former taliban and more civil reconstruction .
six months on , has there been any progress ?
or is it too early to judge ?
well , the situation is varied .
i fear we 're going to go through some security setbacks first .
the harvest season is coming to an end .
experience has shown that that often aggravates the security situation .
on the other hand , there are 134 districts in the north and only eight of those are regarded as being particularly dangerous .
so you have to see that as well as building roads and schools , including girls ' schools , we 've helped stabilize the region politically .
that was our main goal .
our other goal is to be able to transfer responsibility for security to the afghan government in 2014 .
that 's also president hamid karzai 's goal and it was agreed by the international community at the recent afghanistan conference in kabul .
still , many people have the impression that things are not really improving in afghanistan .
why is civil reconstruction progressing so slowly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle says most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing i believe you 've got to look at the various aspects differently .
it 's true that some areas of development are not progressing much .
but others have seen positive changes and that should be appreciated .
you must n't forget that we 're there because the great majority of ordinary afghans want us there .
at the same time , we 've now got to implement the change of strategy that we agreed first in london and then in kabul - and that involves achieving political reconciliation .
are you finding you 're increasingly able to ' win the hearts of afghans ' - as one former defense minister put it ?
are afghans open to that ?
yes .
as far as we know , most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing .
the debate in germany and other european countries just shows you the setbacks , the attacks and all the negative issues , things that are not working .
you rarely see examples of progress .
one such example is the peace jirga gathering .
about 1,600 delegates attended and managed to reach an agreement , and about 20 percent of the delegates were women .
in my opinion , developments like that receive too little recognition . you ca n't understand afghanistan without looking at its neighbors .
let 's start with pakistan .
the country is actually an ally , but , as we 've come to see , there are sections in that society that oppose us - some would even call them enemies .
is the government in islamabad not playing fair ?
i think , even there , you have to see the successes .
for example , in the run-up to the afghanistan conference , a trade deal was agreed between afghanistan and pakistan .
that does n't sound all that spectacular , but if you know the history of the two countries , it 's a pretty amazing event .
then there 's a further issue to consider .
we need the neighbors , we need regional cooperation to be successful .
in london at the beginning of the year we were missing one country from the region .
but in kabul the entire region was represented and agreed to the declaration .
that helps strengthen the bonds between neighbors .
we want to encourage that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops have been in afghanistan since 2001 that of course is difficult to imagine , for example with iran .
and that 's who we 're talking about in this case .
sanctions have been imposed on the country , people are scared of nuclear arms ; they 're scared of the iranian president .
but you also have to engage the iranians somehow , in order to stabilize afghanistan .
is such a balancing act realistic ?
well , it 's necessary , or at least it 's essential we try .
the eu and the un did n't decide on sanctions in order to oppose a country , or to prevent iran from using nuclear power for civilian purposes .
instead , we want to see the iranian government return to the negotiating table , to cooperate , to provide transparency - things that iran has actually already committed itself to .
all countries are permitted to use nuclear power for peaceful and civilian purposes .
but they must also cooperate with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , and provide complete transparency to demonstrate they are using it for exclusively civilian purposes - and not secretly developing a bomb .
that is what we need to prevent , and we remain willing to negotiate with iran .
i could also imagine that talks could take place in september between our european colleague catherine ashton and the iranian side .
that 's our goal .
but it requires cooperation and transparency from iran - and iran must not lay down any preconditions for comprehensive talks .
the war in afghanistan is viewed skeptically in many countries - in most countries , by the majority of the population .
after eight years of involvement in afghanistan , how long will patience last for the hope of reaching the goal we want to reach - a relatively peaceful afghanistan ?
that 's a very hard question to answer .
and i can only advise that we do n't lose sight of our own interests .
it is in our interest that we do not allow those who export terrorism into the world … to turn afghanistan back into a safe haven where they can re-arm .
people forget that many attacks were planned there , and some of those attacks also targeted europe .
yes , we should be skeptical , and view any foreign deployment of the bundeswehr initially with a healthy dose of skepticism .
but i would also suggest that we understand that this also concerns our own security , and that is why we want to be and must be successful .
but we also need a clear perspective on withdrawal - something we can work towards by doing even more , as , for example , in supporting civil redevelopment .

on the other hand , there are 134 districts in the north and only eight of those are regarded as being particularly dangerous .
so you have to see that as well as building roads and schools , including girls ' schools , we 've helped stabilize the region politically .
that was our main goal .
our other goal is to be able to transfer responsibility for security to the afghan government in 2014 .
that 's also president hamid karzai 's goal and it was agreed by the international community at the recent afghanistan conference in kabul .
still , many people have the impression that things are not really improving in afghanistan .
why is civil reconstruction progressing so slowly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle says most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing i believe you 've got to look at the various aspects differently .
it 's true that some areas of development are not progressing much .
but others have seen positive changes and that should be appreciated .
you must n't forget that we 're there because the great majority of ordinary afghans want us there .
at the same time , we 've now got to implement the change of strategy that we agreed first in london and then in kabul - and that involves achieving political reconciliation .
are you finding you 're increasingly able to ' win the hearts of afghans ' - as one former defense minister put it ?
are afghans open to that ?
yes .
as far as we know , most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing .
the debate in germany and other european countries just shows you the setbacks , the attacks and all the negative issues , things that are not working .
you rarely see examples of progress .
one such example is the peace jirga gathering .
about 1,600 delegates attended and managed to reach an agreement , and about 20 percent of the delegates were women .
in my opinion , developments like that receive too little recognition . you ca n't understand afghanistan without looking at its neighbors .
let 's start with pakistan .
the country is actually an ally , but , as we 've come to see , there are sections in that society that oppose us - some would even call them enemies .
is the government in islamabad not playing fair ?
i think , even there , you have to see the successes .
for example , in the run-up to the afghanistan conference , a trade deal was agreed between afghanistan and pakistan .
that does n't sound all that spectacular , but if you know the history of the two countries , it 's a pretty amazing event .
then there 's a further issue to consider .
we need the neighbors , we need regional cooperation to be successful .
in london at the beginning of the year we were missing one country from the region .
but in kabul the entire region was represented and agreed to the declaration .
that helps strengthen the bonds between neighbors .
we want to encourage that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops have been in afghanistan since 2001 that of course is difficult to imagine , for example with iran .
and that 's who we 're talking about in this case .
sanctions have been imposed on the country , people are scared of nuclear arms ; they 're scared of the iranian president .
but you also have to engage the iranians somehow , in order to stabilize afghanistan .
is such a balancing act realistic ?
well , it 's necessary , or at least it 's essential we try .
the eu and the un did n't decide on sanctions in order to oppose a country , or to prevent iran from using nuclear power for civilian purposes .
instead , we want to see the iranian government return to the negotiating table , to cooperate , to provide transparency - things that iran has actually already committed itself to .
all countries are permitted to use nuclear power for peaceful and civilian purposes .
but they must also cooperate with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , and provide complete transparency to demonstrate they are using it for exclusively civilian purposes - and not secretly developing a bomb .
that is what we need to prevent , and we remain willing to negotiate with iran .
i could also imagine that talks could take place in september between our european colleague catherine ashton and the iranian side .
that 's our goal .
but it requires cooperation and transparency from iran - and iran must not lay down any preconditions for comprehensive talks .
the war in afghanistan is viewed skeptically in many countries - in most countries , by the majority of the population .
after eight years of involvement in afghanistan , how long will patience last for the hope of reaching the goal we want to reach - a relatively peaceful afghanistan ?
that 's a very hard question to answer .
and i can only advise that we do n't lose sight of our own interests .
it is in our interest that we do not allow those who export terrorism into the world … to turn afghanistan back into a safe haven where they can re-arm .
people forget that many attacks were planned there , and some of those attacks also targeted europe .
yes , we should be skeptical , and view any foreign deployment of the bundeswehr initially with a healthy dose of skepticism .
but i would also suggest that we understand that this also concerns our own security , and that is why we want to be and must be successful .
but we also need a clear perspective on withdrawal - something we can work towards by doing even more , as , for example , in supporting civil redevelopment .

the taliban have claimed responsibility for the killings . the german government strongly condemned saturday the murder of 10 aid workers in northern afghanistan , the majority of whom were foreigners , including one german woman .
" the german government is indignant over the terrible attack , " government spokeswoman sabine heimbach said in a statement .
the government called for a full inquiry into the " cowardly murder " and for the perpetrators to be punished .
" the incident underlines the necessity to continue working with determination towards stabilizing the situation in afghanistan , so the afghan government can increasingly take responsibility for security in the country , " the government said .
the bullet-riddled bodies of the eight foreign medical workers and two afghans working for an international health charity were discovered in a mountainous , forested area in northern afghanistan , according to afghan police .
the taliban quickly claimed responsibility for the attack on a group they called " christian missionaries . "
the international assistance mission -lrb- iam -rrb- , a non-profit christian health organization , said six of the dead were americans , one was german and one was british .
the iam provides medical and eye care in remote areas and has been operating in afghanistan since 1966 .
robbery a likely motive dirk frans , the group 's director , said the team numbered 12 , including four afghans , two of whom were killed . the group , he said , were on their way back to kabul from an eye facility in nuristan province near the border with pakistan .
" they were killed on their way back .
they had no guns and no security because we come at the communities ' invitation and they take care of us , " frans told the agence france-presse news agency .
" there have never been any threats against us .
if there were threats , we would not have gone , " he said .
he said the organization would continue its activities .
despite the taliban claim , frans said police had told him that robbery was the likely motive for the killings .
the victims , seven men and three women , had been stripped of all their money and belongings .
he denied the taliban 's claim that the group carried bibles in the local language dari .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuristan and badakshan are close to afghanistan 's porous border with pakistan conflicting information according to police , an afghan colleague of the victims who survived the attack walked to a police station in badakhshan to inform them of the attack .
police said the attack took place some two weeks ago , but because of the remoteness of the area they were unable to recover the bodies until thursday .
the information was in apparent conflict with the taliban 's claims that the attack was on friday .
the taliban also claimed there were nine foreigners - five men and four women - and one afghan national .
the survivor , identified only as sayedullah , said the foreigners worked at a hospital in kabul .
the victims were reportedly found next to their three four-wheel drive vehicles and had been lined up before they were shot .
a western official , asking to remain anonymous , said the us embassy was organizing the return of the bodies to kabul where they would be formally identified . author : martin kuebler -lrb- ap / dpa / epd / afp -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the gates ' campaign is " too garish , " an asset manager told german news magazine der spiegel , asking to remain anonymous .
hamburg multimillionaire peter kraemer said the initiative was " highly problematic " and suggested that germany 's wealthy find other ways to donate .
gates launched his campaign , known as the giving pledge , with investor warren buffet in june .
the campaign was initially intended to encourage wealthy americans to donate at least 50 percent of their wealth to charitable causes , but has since gone global .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gates foundation has given away nearly $ 23 billion since 1994 gates said this week that he and buffet have scheduled meetings with some of the wealthiest people in china and india in the coming months .
forty billionaires have so far pledged to donate at least half of their fortunes to charity , including new york city mayor michael bloomberg , hollywood director george lucas and mexican tycoon carlos slim .
based on a forbes magazine estimate of the billionaires ' wealth , at least $ 150 billion -lrb- 112.9 billion euros -rrb- could be given away .
' a troubling development ' in an interview with der spiegel , kraemer said donations in the united states are for the most part tax deductible , giving the rich the option of contributing to charity or paying taxes .
he said donations of this magnitude lead to the wealthy minority of the population rather than the government deciding on where to allocate charitable funds . " i find this to be a troubling development , " said kramer .
" who has given these people the authority to decide where such huge amounts of money should be spent ? "
some wealthy germans are already known to be generous donors .

eu climate commissioner connie hedegaard said that , if anything , negoations were going in the wrong direction . international efforts to curb the threat of global warming are backsliding , said negotiators after a week of un climate talks in bonn .
chances of an early deal on curbing global warming ahead of the next major conference in cancun , mexico looked increasingly slim , the eu said on friday .
" these negotiations have , if anything , gone backwards , " said eu climate action commissioner connie hedegaard on the outcome of discussions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hedegaard said the world was ' in danger of missing the train ' in a statement , hedegaard said that major polluters appeared reluctant to take on their " fair share " of reductions to carbon emissions .
" this imbalance is not helpful and could seriously endanger the prospects of securing the successful outcome the world needs from the cancun climate conference next december , ” she warned .
" at this pace the world will simply collectively miss the train . "
last minute additions several major industrial nations still refuse to make legally binding cuts .
efforts to agree on a draft text for negotiation in cancun were hampered after a number of countries demanded last-minute additions to suit their own interests .
the eu 's co-lead negotiator , artur runge-metzger , accused some countries of making additions in a “ tit for tat " way that was not in keeping with the spirit of the talks .
referring to the next set of discussions in tianjin , china , runge-metzger said , " it is important in tianjin to turn that spirit around . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floods in pakistan were highlighted as an example of the dangers of climate change the copenhagen accord agreed in principle a goal of capping any global increase of temperatures at 2 degrees centigrade -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
the principles for providing aid to countries to deal with curbing c02 were also laid out along with plans to monitor emissions cuts .
however , even the limited achievements of that conference appeared to be in jeopardy , said european union representative peter wittoeck .
" it is disappointing to see some countries that have associated themselves with the accord seem to be dissociating themselves from its political consensus , " said wittoeck .
worries over us legislation wittoeck added that worries that the us congress would not pass legislation on climate change later this year had also cast a shadow over proceedings .
us negotiator jonathan pershing said he was eager for swift agreement , adding that record global temperatures , forest fires in russia and deadly floods in pakistan were " all consistent with the kind of changes we could expect from climate change , and they will get worse if we do n't act quickly . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un climate change chief christiana figueres said some progress had been made " unfortunately , what we have seen over and over this week is that some countries are walking back from the progress made in copenhagen , " pershing told journalists .
he told the reuters news agency that negotiators were putting too much onus on rich nations to deliver cuts , rather than seeking global commitments .
un climate chief christiana figueres said she believed that some progress had been made but that governments had to focus on solutions .
" to receive the desired outcome in cancun they must radically narrow down the choices that are now on the table , " she said .

the taliban have claimed responsibility for the killings . the german government strongly condemned saturday the murder of 10 aid workers in northern afghanistan , the majority of whom were foreigners , including one german woman .
" the german government is indignant over the terrible attack , " government spokeswoman sabine heimbach said in a statement .
the government called for a full inquiry into the " cowardly murder " and for the perpetrators to be punished .
" the incident underlines the necessity to continue working with determination towards stabilizing the situation in afghanistan , so the afghan government can increasingly take responsibility for security in the country , " the government said .
the bullet-riddled bodies of the eight foreign medical workers and two afghans working for an international health charity were discovered in a mountainous , forested area in northern afghanistan , according to afghan police .
the taliban quickly claimed responsibility for the attack on a group they called " christian missionaries . "
the international assistance mission -lrb- iam -rrb- , a non-profit christian health organization , said six of the dead were americans , one was german and one was british .
the iam provides medical and eye care in remote areas and has been operating in afghanistan since 1966 .
robbery a likely motive dirk frans , the group 's director , said the team numbered 12 , including four afghans , two of whom were killed . the group , he said , were on their way back to kabul from an eye facility in nuristan province near the border with pakistan .
" they were killed on their way back .
they had no guns and no security because we come at the communities ' invitation and they take care of us , " frans told the agence france-presse news agency .
" there have never been any threats against us .
if there were threats , we would not have gone , " he said .
he said the organization would continue its activities .
despite the taliban claim , frans said police had told him that robbery was the likely motive for the killings .

the taliban have claimed responsibility for the killings . the german government strongly condemned saturday the murder of 10 aid workers in northern afghanistan , the majority of whom were foreigners , including one german woman .
" the german government is indignant over the terrible attack , " government spokeswoman sabine heimbach said in a statement .
the government called for a full inquiry into the " cowardly murder " and for the perpetrators to be punished .
" the incident underlines the necessity to continue working with determination towards stabilizing the situation in afghanistan , so the afghan government can increasingly take responsibility for security in the country , " the government said .
the bullet-riddled bodies of the eight foreign medical workers and two afghans working for an international health charity were discovered in a mountainous , forested area in northern afghanistan , according to afghan police .
the taliban quickly claimed responsibility for the attack on a group they called " christian missionaries . "
the international assistance mission -lrb- iam -rrb- , a non-profit christian health organization , said six of the dead were americans , one was german and one was british .
the iam provides medical and eye care in remote areas and has been operating in afghanistan since 1966 .
robbery a likely motive dirk frans , the group 's director , said the team numbered 12 , including four afghans , two of whom were killed . the group , he said , were on their way back to kabul from an eye facility in nuristan province near the border with pakistan .
" they were killed on their way back .
they had no guns and no security because we come at the communities ' invitation and they take care of us , " frans told the agence france-presse news agency .
" there have never been any threats against us .
if there were threats , we would not have gone , " he said .
he said the organization would continue its activities .
despite the taliban claim , frans said police had told him that robbery was the likely motive for the killings .
the victims , seven men and three women , had been stripped of all their money and belongings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 07.08.2010 stuttgart racing to find players to prevent another rollercoaster season großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfb have lost some of the stars that aided last season 's revival last season was a microcosm of stuttgart ’ s entire bundesliga history , with their final league table chart looking like the blueprint for a new rollercoaster .
vfb has regularly plumbed the depths and scaled the heights . last season started with high hopes after coach markus babbel 's miracle working in the previous campaign had lifted a seemingly doomed vfb team out of the depths of the relegation zone and into the champions league qualification places .
the young coach seemed to have revived the club and fans even started dreaming of a return to title-winning ways which were then only two years in the past .
die roten -lrb- the reds -rrb- suffered a nightmare start , however , losing 2-0 to reigning champions wolfsburg and plummeting to last place in the league on the opening day .
they were soon up to seventh the following week after a more impressive 4-2 home win against freiburg .
but things started to go badly wrong after that .
six defeats , six draws and only one victory in the following 13 games saw stuttgart back in the relegation zone .
babbel survived until december 6 after a dull 1-1 home draw to vfl bochum confirmed his magic touch had deserted him .
babbel was immediately replaced by swiss coach christian gross who slowly and surely rebuilt the team 's confidence , leading them to a sixth place finish and into the knock-out rounds of the champions league where they lost to title-holders barcelona over two legs .
given the club 's record , fans might expect stuttgart to go into freefall again this season to even things up but gross appears to have the right formula on the pitch to make them competitive again .
however , stuttgart face a race against time to rebuild before the season starts , after seeing a number of players move on this summer with few solid deals under way to replace them .
khedira leaves biggest hole after stuttgart exodus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's midfield will have a khedira-shaped hole in it vfb have lost goalkeeper jens lehmann to retirement , sold ricardo osorio to cf monterey , martin lanig to cologne and roberto hilbert to besiktas , and have watched helplessly as alexander hleb ended his loan spell and rejoined barcelona .
but the most damaging loss could turn out to be the sale of sami khedira to real madrid .
khedira , who shone for the german national team at this summer 's world cup in south africa , successfully passed his medical with the spanish giants at the weekend to complete a 14-million-euro -lrb- $ 18.3 million -rrb- switch .
the 23-year-old midfielder joins jose mourinho 's real revolution on a five-year deal .
christian gross will have to move fast in the transfer market if he is to furnish his squad with players capable of improving on last season 's standards .
at the moment , he 'll be lucky to maintain the level vfb finally reached and could even struggle to avoid a reversal of fortunes .
gross calls back prodigal sons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian midfielder elson is back at stuttgart this season the swiss coach has not been sitting on his hands all summer , however .
he has brought former vfb midfielders elson and christian gentner back from hannover and wolfsburg respectively , while ex-stuttgart goalkeeper marc ziegler has returned from borussia dortmund to replace lehmann .
gross has also boosted the forward line with 23-year-old austrian striker martin harnik from fortuna duesseldorf , who scored the winner on his debut for the club in stuttgart 's europa league qualification game against norwegian club molde fk last week .
but to build on the progress he achieved with stuttgart in the second half of last season , gross needs to add a few more players of quality , especially after khedira , his pivotal midfielder , jumped ship .
one player who could be on the verge of joining vfb to fill khedira 's vacant role is marseille midfielder andre ayew , the 20-year-old who caught the eye with some excellent displays for ghana at the world cup .
ghana 's ayew the man to replace spain-bound sami bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart hopes to complete ayew 's switch from marseille while reports - and stuttgart sporting director jochen schneider - suggest a deal is in place and that the player wants to join vfb , the transfer may not be as clear cut as some may think .
despite missing marseille 's title-winning campaign last season while on loan at newly promoted arles-avignon , didier deschamps - the french champions ' coach - is said to be considering a greater role for ayew for the coming season .
if he is sold , however , stuttgart can expect to pay more than the one million euros they were offering before the world cup .
but with the club cash-rich from the sale of khedira , any hike in price should not prove to be too much of a problem .
what could be a stumbling block is the interest being paid ayew by bundesliga rivals borussia dortmund and schalke 04 , but if a move to germany is on the cards , ayew has admitted that vfb would be his favoured destination .
stuttgart free to move on long-term target degen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-bvb defender degen -lrb- l . -rrb- could return to the bundesliga christian gross has also boosted his defensive situation by signing his compatriot philipp degen on loan from liverpool .
the out-of-favour 27-year-old attacking full-back was told he could leave liverpool by new boss roy hodgson and was keen to return to the bundesliga after having moved to anfield from borussia dortmund in 2008 .
there may be some concerns about the swiss international 's injury record , however .
due to persistent injuries , degen made just 13 appearances for liverpool in two years since arriving on a free transfer .
he suffered a fractured ankle before even playing a competitive game for the team and then suffered a hernia , a fractured rib and broke his foot twice in the space of a year .
this may be why gross took degen on loan for a season before committing any funds to a permanent transfer .

vfb has regularly plumbed the depths and scaled the heights . last season started with high hopes after coach markus babbel 's miracle working in the previous campaign had lifted a seemingly doomed vfb team out of the depths of the relegation zone and into the champions league qualification places .
the young coach seemed to have revived the club and fans even started dreaming of a return to title-winning ways which were then only two years in the past .
die roten -lrb- the reds -rrb- suffered a nightmare start , however , losing 2-0 to reigning champions wolfsburg and plummeting to last place in the league on the opening day .
they were soon up to seventh the following week after a more impressive 4-2 home win against freiburg .
but things started to go badly wrong after that .
six defeats , six draws and only one victory in the following 13 games saw stuttgart back in the relegation zone .
babbel survived until december 6 after a dull 1-1 home draw to vfl bochum confirmed his magic touch had deserted him .
babbel was immediately replaced by swiss coach christian gross who slowly and surely rebuilt the team 's confidence , leading them to a sixth place finish and into the knock-out rounds of the champions league where they lost to title-holders barcelona over two legs .
given the club 's record , fans might expect stuttgart to go into freefall again this season to even things up but gross appears to have the right formula on the pitch to make them competitive again .
however , stuttgart face a race against time to rebuild before the season starts , after seeing a number of players move on this summer with few solid deals under way to replace them .
khedira leaves biggest hole after stuttgart exodus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's midfield will have a khedira-shaped hole in it vfb have lost goalkeeper jens lehmann to retirement , sold ricardo osorio to cf monterey , martin lanig to cologne and roberto hilbert to besiktas , and have watched helplessly as alexander hleb ended his loan spell and rejoined barcelona .
but the most damaging loss could turn out to be the sale of sami khedira to real madrid .
khedira , who shone for the german national team at this summer 's world cup in south africa , successfully passed his medical with the spanish giants at the weekend to complete a 14-million-euro -lrb- $ 18.3 million -rrb- switch .
the 23-year-old midfielder joins jose mourinho 's real revolution on a five-year deal .
christian gross will have to move fast in the transfer market if he is to furnish his squad with players capable of improving on last season 's standards .
at the moment , he 'll be lucky to maintain the level vfb finally reached and could even struggle to avoid a reversal of fortunes .
gross calls back prodigal sons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian midfielder elson is back at stuttgart this season the swiss coach has not been sitting on his hands all summer , however .
he has brought former vfb midfielders elson and christian gentner back from hannover and wolfsburg respectively , while ex-stuttgart goalkeeper marc ziegler has returned from borussia dortmund to replace lehmann .
gross has also boosted the forward line with 23-year-old austrian striker martin harnik from fortuna duesseldorf , who scored the winner on his debut for the club in stuttgart 's europa league qualification game against norwegian club molde fk last week .
but to build on the progress he achieved with stuttgart in the second half of last season , gross needs to add a few more players of quality , especially after khedira , his pivotal midfielder , jumped ship .
one player who could be on the verge of joining vfb to fill khedira 's vacant role is marseille midfielder andre ayew , the 20-year-old who caught the eye with some excellent displays for ghana at the world cup .
ghana 's ayew the man to replace spain-bound sami bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart hopes to complete ayew 's switch from marseille while reports - and stuttgart sporting director jochen schneider - suggest a deal is in place and that the player wants to join vfb , the transfer may not be as clear cut as some may think .
despite missing marseille 's title-winning campaign last season while on loan at newly promoted arles-avignon , didier deschamps - the french champions ' coach - is said to be considering a greater role for ayew for the coming season .
if he is sold , however , stuttgart can expect to pay more than the one million euros they were offering before the world cup .
but with the club cash-rich from the sale of khedira , any hike in price should not prove to be too much of a problem .
what could be a stumbling block is the interest being paid ayew by bundesliga rivals borussia dortmund and schalke 04 , but if a move to germany is on the cards , ayew has admitted that vfb would be his favoured destination .
stuttgart free to move on long-term target degen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-bvb defender degen -lrb- l . -rrb- could return to the bundesliga christian gross has also boosted his defensive situation by signing his compatriot philipp degen on loan from liverpool .
the out-of-favour 27-year-old attacking full-back was told he could leave liverpool by new boss roy hodgson and was keen to return to the bundesliga after having moved to anfield from borussia dortmund in 2008 .
there may be some concerns about the swiss international 's injury record , however .
due to persistent injuries , degen made just 13 appearances for liverpool in two years since arriving on a free transfer .
he suffered a fractured ankle before even playing a competitive game for the team and then suffered a hernia , a fractured rib and broke his foot twice in the space of a year .

christian gross will have to move fast in the transfer market if he is to furnish his squad with players capable of improving on last season 's standards .
at the moment , he 'll be lucky to maintain the level vfb finally reached and could even struggle to avoid a reversal of fortunes .
gross calls back prodigal sons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian midfielder elson is back at stuttgart this season the swiss coach has not been sitting on his hands all summer , however .
he has brought former vfb midfielders elson and christian gentner back from hannover and wolfsburg respectively , while ex-stuttgart goalkeeper marc ziegler has returned from borussia dortmund to replace lehmann .
gross has also boosted the forward line with 23-year-old austrian striker martin harnik from fortuna duesseldorf , who scored the winner on his debut for the club in stuttgart 's europa league qualification game against norwegian club molde fk last week .
but to build on the progress he achieved with stuttgart in the second half of last season , gross needs to add a few more players of quality , especially after khedira , his pivotal midfielder , jumped ship .
one player who could be on the verge of joining vfb to fill khedira 's vacant role is marseille midfielder andre ayew , the 20-year-old who caught the eye with some excellent displays for ghana at the world cup .
ghana 's ayew the man to replace spain-bound sami bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart hopes to complete ayew 's switch from marseille while reports - and stuttgart sporting director jochen schneider - suggest a deal is in place and that the player wants to join vfb , the transfer may not be as clear cut as some may think .
despite missing marseille 's title-winning campaign last season while on loan at newly promoted arles-avignon , didier deschamps - the french champions ' coach - is said to be considering a greater role for ayew for the coming season .
if he is sold , however , stuttgart can expect to pay more than the one million euros they were offering before the world cup .
but with the club cash-rich from the sale of khedira , any hike in price should not prove to be too much of a problem .
what could be a stumbling block is the interest being paid ayew by bundesliga rivals borussia dortmund and schalke 04 , but if a move to germany is on the cards , ayew has admitted that vfb would be his favoured destination .
stuttgart free to move on long-term target degen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-bvb defender degen -lrb- l . -rrb- could return to the bundesliga christian gross has also boosted his defensive situation by signing his compatriot philipp degen on loan from liverpool .
the out-of-favour 27-year-old attacking full-back was told he could leave liverpool by new boss roy hodgson and was keen to return to the bundesliga after having moved to anfield from borussia dortmund in 2008 .
there may be some concerns about the swiss international 's injury record , however .
due to persistent injuries , degen made just 13 appearances for liverpool in two years since arriving on a free transfer .
he suffered a fractured ankle before even playing a competitive game for the team and then suffered a hernia , a fractured rib and broke his foot twice in the space of a year .
this may be why gross took degen on loan for a season before committing any funds to a permanent transfer .

the taliban have claimed responsibility for the killings . the german government strongly condemned saturday the murder of 10 aid workers in northern afghanistan , the majority of whom were foreigners , including one german woman .
" the german government is indignant over the terrible attack , " government spokeswoman sabine heimbach said in a statement .
the government called for a full inquiry into the " cowardly murder " and for the perpetrators to be punished .
" the incident underlines the necessity to continue working with determination towards stabilizing the situation in afghanistan , so the afghan government can increasingly take responsibility for security in the country , " the government said .
the bullet-riddled bodies of the eight foreign medical workers and two afghans working for an international health charity were discovered in a mountainous , forested area in northern afghanistan , according to afghan police .
the taliban quickly claimed responsibility for the attack on a group they called " christian missionaries . "
the international assistance mission -lrb- iam -rrb- , a non-profit christian health organization , said six of the dead were americans , one was german and one was british .
the iam provides medical and eye care in remote areas and has been operating in afghanistan since 1966 .
robbery a likely motive dirk frans , the group 's director , said the team numbered 12 , including four afghans , two of whom were killed . the group , he said , were on their way back to kabul from an eye facility in nuristan province near the border with pakistan .
" they were killed on their way back .
they had no guns and no security because we come at the communities ' invitation and they take care of us , " frans told the agence france-presse news agency .
" there have never been any threats against us .
if there were threats , we would not have gone , " he said .
he said the organization would continue its activities .
despite the taliban claim , frans said police had told him that robbery was the likely motive for the killings .
the victims , seven men and three women , had been stripped of all their money and belongings .
he denied the taliban 's claim that the group carried bibles in the local language dari .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuristan and badakshan are close to afghanistan 's porous border with pakistan conflicting information according to police , an afghan colleague of the victims who survived the attack walked to a police station in badakhshan to inform them of the attack .
police said the attack took place some two weeks ago , but because of the remoteness of the area they were unable to recover the bodies until thursday .
the information was in apparent conflict with the taliban 's claims that the attack was on friday .
the taliban also claimed there were nine foreigners - five men and four women - and one afghan national .
the survivor , identified only as sayedullah , said the foreigners worked at a hospital in kabul .
the victims were reportedly found next to their three four-wheel drive vehicles and had been lined up before they were shot .
a western official , asking to remain anonymous , said the us embassy was organizing the return of the bodies to kabul where they would be formally identified . author : martin kuebler -lrb- ap / dpa / epd / afp -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

vfb has regularly plumbed the depths and scaled the heights . last season started with high hopes after coach markus babbel 's miracle working in the previous campaign had lifted a seemingly doomed vfb team out of the depths of the relegation zone and into the champions league qualification places .
the young coach seemed to have revived the club and fans even started dreaming of a return to title-winning ways which were then only two years in the past .
die roten -lrb- the reds -rrb- suffered a nightmare start , however , losing 2-0 to reigning champions wolfsburg and plummeting to last place in the league on the opening day .
they were soon up to seventh the following week after a more impressive 4-2 home win against freiburg .
but things started to go badly wrong after that .
six defeats , six draws and only one victory in the following 13 games saw stuttgart back in the relegation zone .
babbel survived until december 6 after a dull 1-1 home draw to vfl bochum confirmed his magic touch had deserted him .
babbel was immediately replaced by swiss coach christian gross who slowly and surely rebuilt the team 's confidence , leading them to a sixth place finish and into the knock-out rounds of the champions league where they lost to title-holders barcelona over two legs .
given the club 's record , fans might expect stuttgart to go into freefall again this season to even things up but gross appears to have the right formula on the pitch to make them competitive again .
however , stuttgart face a race against time to rebuild before the season starts , after seeing a number of players move on this summer with few solid deals under way to replace them .
khedira leaves biggest hole after stuttgart exodus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's midfield will have a khedira-shaped hole in it vfb have lost goalkeeper jens lehmann to retirement , sold ricardo osorio to cf monterey , martin lanig to cologne and roberto hilbert to besiktas , and have watched helplessly as alexander hleb ended his loan spell and rejoined barcelona .
but the most damaging loss could turn out to be the sale of sami khedira to real madrid .
khedira , who shone for the german national team at this summer 's world cup in south africa , successfully passed his medical with the spanish giants at the weekend to complete a 14-million-euro -lrb- $ 18.3 million -rrb- switch .
the 23-year-old midfielder joins jose mourinho 's real revolution on a five-year deal .
christian gross will have to move fast in the transfer market if he is to furnish his squad with players capable of improving on last season 's standards .
at the moment , he 'll be lucky to maintain the level vfb finally reached and could even struggle to avoid a reversal of fortunes .
gross calls back prodigal sons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian midfielder elson is back at stuttgart this season the swiss coach has not been sitting on his hands all summer , however .
he has brought former vfb midfielders elson and christian gentner back from hannover and wolfsburg respectively , while ex-stuttgart goalkeeper marc ziegler has returned from borussia dortmund to replace lehmann .
gross has also boosted the forward line with 23-year-old austrian striker martin harnik from fortuna duesseldorf , who scored the winner on his debut for the club in stuttgart 's europa league qualification game against norwegian club molde fk last week .
but to build on the progress he achieved with stuttgart in the second half of last season , gross needs to add a few more players of quality , especially after khedira , his pivotal midfielder , jumped ship .
one player who could be on the verge of joining vfb to fill khedira 's vacant role is marseille midfielder andre ayew , the 20-year-old who caught the eye with some excellent displays for ghana at the world cup .
ghana 's ayew the man to replace spain-bound sami bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart hopes to complete ayew 's switch from marseille while reports - and stuttgart sporting director jochen schneider - suggest a deal is in place and that the player wants to join vfb , the transfer may not be as clear cut as some may think .
despite missing marseille 's title-winning campaign last season while on loan at newly promoted arles-avignon , didier deschamps - the french champions ' coach - is said to be considering a greater role for ayew for the coming season .
if he is sold , however , stuttgart can expect to pay more than the one million euros they were offering before the world cup .
but with the club cash-rich from the sale of khedira , any hike in price should not prove to be too much of a problem .
what could be a stumbling block is the interest being paid ayew by bundesliga rivals borussia dortmund and schalke 04 , but if a move to germany is on the cards , ayew has admitted that vfb would be his favoured destination .
stuttgart free to move on long-term target degen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-bvb defender degen -lrb- l . -rrb- could return to the bundesliga christian gross has also boosted his defensive situation by signing his compatriot philipp degen on loan from liverpool .
the out-of-favour 27-year-old attacking full-back was told he could leave liverpool by new boss roy hodgson and was keen to return to the bundesliga after having moved to anfield from borussia dortmund in 2008 .
there may be some concerns about the swiss international 's injury record , however .
due to persistent injuries , degen made just 13 appearances for liverpool in two years since arriving on a free transfer .
he suffered a fractured ankle before even playing a competitive game for the team and then suffered a hernia , a fractured rib and broke his foot twice in the space of a year .
this may be why gross took degen on loan for a season before committing any funds to a permanent transfer .

vfb has regularly plumbed the depths and scaled the heights . last season started with high hopes after coach markus babbel 's miracle working in the previous campaign had lifted a seemingly doomed vfb team out of the depths of the relegation zone and into the champions league qualification places .
the young coach seemed to have revived the club and fans even started dreaming of a return to title-winning ways which were then only two years in the past .
die roten -lrb- the reds -rrb- suffered a nightmare start , however , losing 2-0 to reigning champions wolfsburg and plummeting to last place in the league on the opening day .
they were soon up to seventh the following week after a more impressive 4-2 home win against freiburg .
but things started to go badly wrong after that .
six defeats , six draws and only one victory in the following 13 games saw stuttgart back in the relegation zone .
babbel survived until december 6 after a dull 1-1 home draw to vfl bochum confirmed his magic touch had deserted him .
babbel was immediately replaced by swiss coach christian gross who slowly and surely rebuilt the team 's confidence , leading them to a sixth place finish and into the knock-out rounds of the champions league where they lost to title-holders barcelona over two legs .
given the club 's record , fans might expect stuttgart to go into freefall again this season to even things up but gross appears to have the right formula on the pitch to make them competitive again .
however , stuttgart face a race against time to rebuild before the season starts , after seeing a number of players move on this summer with few solid deals under way to replace them .
khedira leaves biggest hole after stuttgart exodus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's midfield will have a khedira-shaped hole in it vfb have lost goalkeeper jens lehmann to retirement , sold ricardo osorio to cf monterey , martin lanig to cologne and roberto hilbert to besiktas , and have watched helplessly as alexander hleb ended his loan spell and rejoined barcelona .
but the most damaging loss could turn out to be the sale of sami khedira to real madrid .
khedira , who shone for the german national team at this summer 's world cup in south africa , successfully passed his medical with the spanish giants at the weekend to complete a 14-million-euro -lrb- $ 18.3 million -rrb- switch .
the 23-year-old midfielder joins jose mourinho 's real revolution on a five-year deal .
christian gross will have to move fast in the transfer market if he is to furnish his squad with players capable of improving on last season 's standards .
at the moment , he 'll be lucky to maintain the level vfb finally reached and could even struggle to avoid a reversal of fortunes .
gross calls back prodigal sons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian midfielder elson is back at stuttgart this season the swiss coach has not been sitting on his hands all summer , however .
he has brought former vfb midfielders elson and christian gentner back from hannover and wolfsburg respectively , while ex-stuttgart goalkeeper marc ziegler has returned from borussia dortmund to replace lehmann .
gross has also boosted the forward line with 23-year-old austrian striker martin harnik from fortuna duesseldorf , who scored the winner on his debut for the club in stuttgart 's europa league qualification game against norwegian club molde fk last week .
but to build on the progress he achieved with stuttgart in the second half of last season , gross needs to add a few more players of quality , especially after khedira , his pivotal midfielder , jumped ship .
one player who could be on the verge of joining vfb to fill khedira 's vacant role is marseille midfielder andre ayew , the 20-year-old who caught the eye with some excellent displays for ghana at the world cup .

despite missing marseille 's title-winning campaign last season while on loan at newly promoted arles-avignon , didier deschamps - the french champions ' coach - is said to be considering a greater role for ayew for the coming season .
if he is sold , however , stuttgart can expect to pay more than the one million euros they were offering before the world cup .
but with the club cash-rich from the sale of khedira , any hike in price should not prove to be too much of a problem .
what could be a stumbling block is the interest being paid ayew by bundesliga rivals borussia dortmund and schalke 04 , but if a move to germany is on the cards , ayew has admitted that vfb would be his favoured destination .

khedira leaves biggest hole after stuttgart exodus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's midfield will have a khedira-shaped hole in it vfb have lost goalkeeper jens lehmann to retirement , sold ricardo osorio to cf monterey , martin lanig to cologne and roberto hilbert to besiktas , and have watched helplessly as alexander hleb ended his loan spell and rejoined barcelona .
but the most damaging loss could turn out to be the sale of sami khedira to real madrid .
khedira , who shone for the german national team at this summer 's world cup in south africa , successfully passed his medical with the spanish giants at the weekend to complete a 14-million-euro -lrb- $ 18.3 million -rrb- switch .
the 23-year-old midfielder joins jose mourinho 's real revolution on a five-year deal .
christian gross will have to move fast in the transfer market if he is to furnish his squad with players capable of improving on last season 's standards .
at the moment , he 'll be lucky to maintain the level vfb finally reached and could even struggle to avoid a reversal of fortunes .
gross calls back prodigal sons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian midfielder elson is back at stuttgart this season the swiss coach has not been sitting on his hands all summer , however .
he has brought former vfb midfielders elson and christian gentner back from hannover and wolfsburg respectively , while ex-stuttgart goalkeeper marc ziegler has returned from borussia dortmund to replace lehmann .
gross has also boosted the forward line with 23-year-old austrian striker martin harnik from fortuna duesseldorf , who scored the winner on his debut for the club in stuttgart 's europa league qualification game against norwegian club molde fk last week .
but to build on the progress he achieved with stuttgart in the second half of last season , gross needs to add a few more players of quality , especially after khedira , his pivotal midfielder , jumped ship .
one player who could be on the verge of joining vfb to fill khedira 's vacant role is marseille midfielder andre ayew , the 20-year-old who caught the eye with some excellent displays for ghana at the world cup .
ghana 's ayew the man to replace spain-bound sami bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart hopes to complete ayew 's switch from marseille while reports - and stuttgart sporting director jochen schneider - suggest a deal is in place and that the player wants to join vfb , the transfer may not be as clear cut as some may think .
despite missing marseille 's title-winning campaign last season while on loan at newly promoted arles-avignon , didier deschamps - the french champions ' coach - is said to be considering a greater role for ayew for the coming season .
if he is sold , however , stuttgart can expect to pay more than the one million euros they were offering before the world cup .
but with the club cash-rich from the sale of khedira , any hike in price should not prove to be too much of a problem .
what could be a stumbling block is the interest being paid ayew by bundesliga rivals borussia dortmund and schalke 04 , but if a move to germany is on the cards , ayew has admitted that vfb would be his favoured destination .
stuttgart free to move on long-term target degen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-bvb defender degen -lrb- l . -rrb- could return to the bundesliga christian gross has also boosted his defensive situation by signing his compatriot philipp degen on loan from liverpool .
the out-of-favour 27-year-old attacking full-back was told he could leave liverpool by new boss roy hodgson and was keen to return to the bundesliga after having moved to anfield from borussia dortmund in 2008 .
there may be some concerns about the swiss international 's injury record , however .
due to persistent injuries , degen made just 13 appearances for liverpool in two years since arriving on a free transfer .
he suffered a fractured ankle before even playing a competitive game for the team and then suffered a hernia , a fractured rib and broke his foot twice in the space of a year .
this may be why gross took degen on loan for a season before committing any funds to a permanent transfer .

vfb has regularly plumbed the depths and scaled the heights . last season started with high hopes after coach markus babbel 's miracle working in the previous campaign had lifted a seemingly doomed vfb team out of the depths of the relegation zone and into the champions league qualification places .
the young coach seemed to have revived the club and fans even started dreaming of a return to title-winning ways which were then only two years in the past .
die roten -lrb- the reds -rrb- suffered a nightmare start , however , losing 2-0 to reigning champions wolfsburg and plummeting to last place in the league on the opening day .
they were soon up to seventh the following week after a more impressive 4-2 home win against freiburg .
but things started to go badly wrong after that .
six defeats , six draws and only one victory in the following 13 games saw stuttgart back in the relegation zone .
babbel survived until december 6 after a dull 1-1 home draw to vfl bochum confirmed his magic touch had deserted him .
babbel was immediately replaced by swiss coach christian gross who slowly and surely rebuilt the team 's confidence , leading them to a sixth place finish and into the knock-out rounds of the champions league where they lost to title-holders barcelona over two legs .
given the club 's record , fans might expect stuttgart to go into freefall again this season to even things up but gross appears to have the right formula on the pitch to make them competitive again .
however , stuttgart face a race against time to rebuild before the season starts , after seeing a number of players move on this summer with few solid deals under way to replace them .

the taliban have claimed responsibility for the killings . the german government strongly condemned saturday the murder of 10 aid workers in northern afghanistan , the majority of whom were foreigners , including one german woman .
" the german government is indignant over the terrible attack , " government spokeswoman sabine heimbach said in a statement .
the government called for a full inquiry into the " cowardly murder " and for the perpetrators to be punished .
" the incident underlines the necessity to continue working with determination towards stabilizing the situation in afghanistan , so the afghan government can increasingly take responsibility for security in the country , " the government said .
the bullet-riddled bodies of the eight foreign medical workers and two afghans working for an international health charity were discovered in a mountainous , forested area in northern afghanistan , according to afghan police .
the taliban quickly claimed responsibility for the attack on a group they called " christian missionaries . "
the international assistance mission -lrb- iam -rrb- , a non-profit christian health organization , said six of the dead were americans , one was german and one was british .
the iam provides medical and eye care in remote areas and has been operating in afghanistan since 1966 .
robbery a likely motive dirk frans , the group 's director , said the team numbered 12 , including four afghans , two of whom were killed . the group , he said , were on their way back to kabul from an eye facility in nuristan province near the border with pakistan .
" they were killed on their way back .
they had no guns and no security because we come at the communities ' invitation and they take care of us , " frans told the agence france-presse news agency .
" there have never been any threats against us .
if there were threats , we would not have gone , " he said .
he said the organization would continue its activities .
despite the taliban claim , frans said police had told him that robbery was the likely motive for the killings .
the victims , seven men and three women , had been stripped of all their money and belongings .
he denied the taliban 's claim that the group carried bibles in the local language dari .

police said the attack took place some two weeks ago , but because of the remoteness of the area they were unable to recover the bodies until thursday .
the information was in apparent conflict with the taliban 's claims that the attack was on friday .
the taliban also claimed there were nine foreigners - five men and four women - and one afghan national .
the survivor , identified only as sayedullah , said the foreigners worked at a hospital in kabul .

the taliban have claimed responsibility for the killings . the german government strongly condemned saturday the murder of 10 aid workers in northern afghanistan , the majority of whom were foreigners , including one german woman .
" the german government is indignant over the terrible attack , " government spokeswoman sabine heimbach said in a statement .
the government called for a full inquiry into the " cowardly murder " and for the perpetrators to be punished .
" the incident underlines the necessity to continue working with determination towards stabilizing the situation in afghanistan , so the afghan government can increasingly take responsibility for security in the country , " the government said .
the bullet-riddled bodies of the eight foreign medical workers and two afghans working for an international health charity were discovered in a mountainous , forested area in northern afghanistan , according to afghan police .
the taliban quickly claimed responsibility for the attack on a group they called " christian missionaries . "
the international assistance mission -lrb- iam -rrb- , a non-profit christian health organization , said six of the dead were americans , one was german and one was british .
the iam provides medical and eye care in remote areas and has been operating in afghanistan since 1966 .
robbery a likely motive dirk frans , the group 's director , said the team numbered 12 , including four afghans , two of whom were killed . the group , he said , were on their way back to kabul from an eye facility in nuristan province near the border with pakistan .
" they were killed on their way back .
they had no guns and no security because we come at the communities ' invitation and they take care of us , " frans told the agence france-presse news agency .
" there have never been any threats against us .
if there were threats , we would not have gone , " he said .
he said the organization would continue its activities .
despite the taliban claim , frans said police had told him that robbery was the likely motive for the killings .
the victims , seven men and three women , had been stripped of all their money and belongings .
he denied the taliban 's claim that the group carried bibles in the local language dari .

dw : is the war in afghanistan a political nightmare for you ?
guido westerwelle : i do n't think it 's something anyone would wish upon themselves .
nobody relishes having political responsibility in times like these .
the decision was taken many years ago by the government of the time and we now have to face up to our responsibility .
we have to contribute to our own security , to protect ourselves and our citizens from terrorism as far as possible .
and it 's also in our interest that afghanistan develops positively and becomes a stable country again in the future .
there have been two afghanistan conferences this year , one in london and one in kabul .
you took part in both and you played a major role in one .
a basic framework of action was agreed , involving more security force training , attempts to integrate former taliban and more civil reconstruction .
six months on , has there been any progress ?
or is it too early to judge ?
well , the situation is varied .
i fear we 're going to go through some security setbacks first .
the harvest season is coming to an end .
experience has shown that that often aggravates the security situation .
on the other hand , there are 134 districts in the north and only eight of those are regarded as being particularly dangerous .
so you have to see that as well as building roads and schools , including girls ' schools , we 've helped stabilize the region politically .
that was our main goal .
our other goal is to be able to transfer responsibility for security to the afghan government in 2014 .
that 's also president hamid karzai 's goal and it was agreed by the international community at the recent afghanistan conference in kabul .
still , many people have the impression that things are not really improving in afghanistan .
why is civil reconstruction progressing so slowly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle says most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing i believe you 've got to look at the various aspects differently .
it 's true that some areas of development are not progressing much .
but others have seen positive changes and that should be appreciated .
you must n't forget that we 're there because the great majority of ordinary afghans want us there .
at the same time , we 've now got to implement the change of strategy that we agreed first in london and then in kabul - and that involves achieving political reconciliation .
are you finding you 're increasingly able to ' win the hearts of afghans ' - as one former defense minister put it ?
are afghans open to that ?
yes .
as far as we know , most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing .
the debate in germany and other european countries just shows you the setbacks , the attacks and all the negative issues , things that are not working .
you rarely see examples of progress .
one such example is the peace jirga gathering .
about 1,600 delegates attended and managed to reach an agreement , and about 20 percent of the delegates were women .
in my opinion , developments like that receive too little recognition . you ca n't understand afghanistan without looking at its neighbors .
let 's start with pakistan .
the country is actually an ally , but , as we 've come to see , there are sections in that society that oppose us - some would even call them enemies .
is the government in islamabad not playing fair ?
i think , even there , you have to see the successes .
for example , in the run-up to the afghanistan conference , a trade deal was agreed between afghanistan and pakistan .
that does n't sound all that spectacular , but if you know the history of the two countries , it 's a pretty amazing event .
then there 's a further issue to consider .
we need the neighbors , we need regional cooperation to be successful .
in london at the beginning of the year we were missing one country from the region .
but in kabul the entire region was represented and agreed to the declaration .
that helps strengthen the bonds between neighbors .
we want to encourage that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops have been in afghanistan since 2001 that of course is difficult to imagine , for example with iran .
and that 's who we 're talking about in this case .
sanctions have been imposed on the country , people are scared of nuclear arms ; they 're scared of the iranian president .
but you also have to engage the iranians somehow , in order to stabilize afghanistan .
is such a balancing act realistic ?
well , it 's necessary , or at least it 's essential we try .
the eu and the un did n't decide on sanctions in order to oppose a country , or to prevent iran from using nuclear power for civilian purposes .
instead , we want to see the iranian government return to the negotiating table , to cooperate , to provide transparency - things that iran has actually already committed itself to .
all countries are permitted to use nuclear power for peaceful and civilian purposes .
but they must also cooperate with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , and provide complete transparency to demonstrate they are using it for exclusively civilian purposes - and not secretly developing a bomb .
that is what we need to prevent , and we remain willing to negotiate with iran .
i could also imagine that talks could take place in september between our european colleague catherine ashton and the iranian side .
that 's our goal .
but it requires cooperation and transparency from iran - and iran must not lay down any preconditions for comprehensive talks .
the war in afghanistan is viewed skeptically in many countries - in most countries , by the majority of the population .
after eight years of involvement in afghanistan , how long will patience last for the hope of reaching the goal we want to reach - a relatively peaceful afghanistan ?
that 's a very hard question to answer .
and i can only advise that we do n't lose sight of our own interests .
it is in our interest that we do not allow those who export terrorism into the world … to turn afghanistan back into a safe haven where they can re-arm .
people forget that many attacks were planned there , and some of those attacks also targeted europe .
yes , we should be skeptical , and view any foreign deployment of the bundeswehr initially with a healthy dose of skepticism .
but i would also suggest that we understand that this also concerns our own security , and that is why we want to be and must be successful .
but we also need a clear perspective on withdrawal - something we can work towards by doing even more , as , for example , in supporting civil redevelopment .

dw : is the war in afghanistan a political nightmare for you ?
guido westerwelle : i do n't think it 's something anyone would wish upon themselves .
nobody relishes having political responsibility in times like these .
the decision was taken many years ago by the government of the time and we now have to face up to our responsibility .
we have to contribute to our own security , to protect ourselves and our citizens from terrorism as far as possible .
and it 's also in our interest that afghanistan develops positively and becomes a stable country again in the future .
there have been two afghanistan conferences this year , one in london and one in kabul .
you took part in both and you played a major role in one .
a basic framework of action was agreed , involving more security force training , attempts to integrate former taliban and more civil reconstruction .
six months on , has there been any progress ?
or is it too early to judge ?
well , the situation is varied .
i fear we 're going to go through some security setbacks first .
the harvest season is coming to an end .
experience has shown that that often aggravates the security situation .
on the other hand , there are 134 districts in the north and only eight of those are regarded as being particularly dangerous .
so you have to see that as well as building roads and schools , including girls ' schools , we 've helped stabilize the region politically .
that was our main goal .
our other goal is to be able to transfer responsibility for security to the afghan government in 2014 .
that 's also president hamid karzai 's goal and it was agreed by the international community at the recent afghanistan conference in kabul .
still , many people have the impression that things are not really improving in afghanistan .
why is civil reconstruction progressing so slowly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle says most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing i believe you 've got to look at the various aspects differently .
it 's true that some areas of development are not progressing much .
but others have seen positive changes and that should be appreciated .
you must n't forget that we 're there because the great majority of ordinary afghans want us there .
at the same time , we 've now got to implement the change of strategy that we agreed first in london and then in kabul - and that involves achieving political reconciliation .
are you finding you 're increasingly able to ' win the hearts of afghans ' - as one former defense minister put it ?
are afghans open to that ?
yes .
as far as we know , most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing .
the debate in germany and other european countries just shows you the setbacks , the attacks and all the negative issues , things that are not working .
you rarely see examples of progress .
one such example is the peace jirga gathering .
about 1,600 delegates attended and managed to reach an agreement , and about 20 percent of the delegates were women .
in my opinion , developments like that receive too little recognition . you ca n't understand afghanistan without looking at its neighbors .
let 's start with pakistan .
the country is actually an ally , but , as we 've come to see , there are sections in that society that oppose us - some would even call them enemies .
is the government in islamabad not playing fair ?
i think , even there , you have to see the successes .
for example , in the run-up to the afghanistan conference , a trade deal was agreed between afghanistan and pakistan .
that does n't sound all that spectacular , but if you know the history of the two countries , it 's a pretty amazing event .
then there 's a further issue to consider .
we need the neighbors , we need regional cooperation to be successful .
in london at the beginning of the year we were missing one country from the region .
but in kabul the entire region was represented and agreed to the declaration .
that helps strengthen the bonds between neighbors .
we want to encourage that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops have been in afghanistan since 2001 that of course is difficult to imagine , for example with iran .
and that 's who we 're talking about in this case .
sanctions have been imposed on the country , people are scared of nuclear arms ; they 're scared of the iranian president .
but you also have to engage the iranians somehow , in order to stabilize afghanistan .
is such a balancing act realistic ?
well , it 's necessary , or at least it 's essential we try .
the eu and the un did n't decide on sanctions in order to oppose a country , or to prevent iran from using nuclear power for civilian purposes .
instead , we want to see the iranian government return to the negotiating table , to cooperate , to provide transparency - things that iran has actually already committed itself to .
all countries are permitted to use nuclear power for peaceful and civilian purposes .
but they must also cooperate with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , and provide complete transparency to demonstrate they are using it for exclusively civilian purposes - and not secretly developing a bomb .
that is what we need to prevent , and we remain willing to negotiate with iran .
i could also imagine that talks could take place in september between our european colleague catherine ashton and the iranian side .
that 's our goal .
but it requires cooperation and transparency from iran - and iran must not lay down any preconditions for comprehensive talks .
the war in afghanistan is viewed skeptically in many countries - in most countries , by the majority of the population .
after eight years of involvement in afghanistan , how long will patience last for the hope of reaching the goal we want to reach - a relatively peaceful afghanistan ?
that 's a very hard question to answer .
and i can only advise that we do n't lose sight of our own interests .
it is in our interest that we do not allow those who export terrorism into the world … to turn afghanistan back into a safe haven where they can re-arm .
people forget that many attacks were planned there , and some of those attacks also targeted europe .
yes , we should be skeptical , and view any foreign deployment of the bundeswehr initially with a healthy dose of skepticism .
but i would also suggest that we understand that this also concerns our own security , and that is why we want to be and must be successful .
but we also need a clear perspective on withdrawal - something we can work towards by doing even more , as , for example , in supporting civil redevelopment .

dw : is the war in afghanistan a political nightmare for you ?
guido westerwelle : i do n't think it 's something anyone would wish upon themselves .
nobody relishes having political responsibility in times like these .
the decision was taken many years ago by the government of the time and we now have to face up to our responsibility .
we have to contribute to our own security , to protect ourselves and our citizens from terrorism as far as possible .
and it 's also in our interest that afghanistan develops positively and becomes a stable country again in the future .
there have been two afghanistan conferences this year , one in london and one in kabul .
you took part in both and you played a major role in one .
a basic framework of action was agreed , involving more security force training , attempts to integrate former taliban and more civil reconstruction .
six months on , has there been any progress ?
or is it too early to judge ?
well , the situation is varied .
i fear we 're going to go through some security setbacks first .
the harvest season is coming to an end .
experience has shown that that often aggravates the security situation .
on the other hand , there are 134 districts in the north and only eight of those are regarded as being particularly dangerous .
so you have to see that as well as building roads and schools , including girls ' schools , we 've helped stabilize the region politically .
that was our main goal .
our other goal is to be able to transfer responsibility for security to the afghan government in 2014 .
that 's also president hamid karzai 's goal and it was agreed by the international community at the recent afghanistan conference in kabul .
still , many people have the impression that things are not really improving in afghanistan .
why is civil reconstruction progressing so slowly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle says most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing i believe you 've got to look at the various aspects differently .
it 's true that some areas of development are not progressing much .
but others have seen positive changes and that should be appreciated .
you must n't forget that we 're there because the great majority of ordinary afghans want us there .
at the same time , we 've now got to implement the change of strategy that we agreed first in london and then in kabul - and that involves achieving political reconciliation .
are you finding you 're increasingly able to ' win the hearts of afghans ' - as one former defense minister put it ?
are afghans open to that ?
yes .
as far as we know , most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing .
the debate in germany and other european countries just shows you the setbacks , the attacks and all the negative issues , things that are not working .
you rarely see examples of progress .
one such example is the peace jirga gathering .
about 1,600 delegates attended and managed to reach an agreement , and about 20 percent of the delegates were women .
in my opinion , developments like that receive too little recognition . you ca n't understand afghanistan without looking at its neighbors .
let 's start with pakistan .
the country is actually an ally , but , as we 've come to see , there are sections in that society that oppose us - some would even call them enemies .
is the government in islamabad not playing fair ?
i think , even there , you have to see the successes .
for example , in the run-up to the afghanistan conference , a trade deal was agreed between afghanistan and pakistan .
that does n't sound all that spectacular , but if you know the history of the two countries , it 's a pretty amazing event .
then there 's a further issue to consider .
we need the neighbors , we need regional cooperation to be successful .
in london at the beginning of the year we were missing one country from the region .
but in kabul the entire region was represented and agreed to the declaration .
that helps strengthen the bonds between neighbors .
we want to encourage that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops have been in afghanistan since 2001 that of course is difficult to imagine , for example with iran .
and that 's who we 're talking about in this case .
sanctions have been imposed on the country , people are scared of nuclear arms ; they 're scared of the iranian president .
but you also have to engage the iranians somehow , in order to stabilize afghanistan .
is such a balancing act realistic ?
well , it 's necessary , or at least it 's essential we try .
the eu and the un did n't decide on sanctions in order to oppose a country , or to prevent iran from using nuclear power for civilian purposes .
instead , we want to see the iranian government return to the negotiating table , to cooperate , to provide transparency - things that iran has actually already committed itself to .
all countries are permitted to use nuclear power for peaceful and civilian purposes .
but they must also cooperate with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , and provide complete transparency to demonstrate they are using it for exclusively civilian purposes - and not secretly developing a bomb .
that is what we need to prevent , and we remain willing to negotiate with iran .
i could also imagine that talks could take place in september between our european colleague catherine ashton and the iranian side .
that 's our goal .
but it requires cooperation and transparency from iran - and iran must not lay down any preconditions for comprehensive talks .
the war in afghanistan is viewed skeptically in many countries - in most countries , by the majority of the population .
after eight years of involvement in afghanistan , how long will patience last for the hope of reaching the goal we want to reach - a relatively peaceful afghanistan ?
that 's a very hard question to answer .
and i can only advise that we do n't lose sight of our own interests .
it is in our interest that we do not allow those who export terrorism into the world … to turn afghanistan back into a safe haven where they can re-arm .
people forget that many attacks were planned there , and some of those attacks also targeted europe .
yes , we should be skeptical , and view any foreign deployment of the bundeswehr initially with a healthy dose of skepticism .
but i would also suggest that we understand that this also concerns our own security , and that is why we want to be and must be successful .
but we also need a clear perspective on withdrawal - something we can work towards by doing even more , as , for example , in supporting civil redevelopment .

the gates ' campaign is " too garish , " an asset manager told german news magazine der spiegel , asking to remain anonymous .
hamburg multimillionaire peter kraemer said the initiative was " highly problematic " and suggested that germany 's wealthy find other ways to donate .
gates launched his campaign , known as the giving pledge , with investor warren buffet in june .
the campaign was initially intended to encourage wealthy americans to donate at least 50 percent of their wealth to charitable causes , but has since gone global .

based on a forbes magazine estimate of the billionaires ' wealth , at least $ 150 billion -lrb- 112.9 billion euros -rrb- could be given away .
' a troubling development ' in an interview with der spiegel , kraemer said donations in the united states are for the most part tax deductible , giving the rich the option of contributing to charity or paying taxes .
he said donations of this magnitude lead to the wealthy minority of the population rather than the government deciding on where to allocate charitable funds . " i find this to be a troubling development , " said kramer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 07.08.2010 being honored by the fatherland : germany 's federal cross of merit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal cross of merit was introduced in 1951 where the uk has its knighthood , and france its legion of honour , germany rewards its loyal citizens with the federal cross of merit .
its most famous recent recipient was the national soccer team coach joachim loew . after the deflating end to germany 's thrilling world cup campaign in south africa , president christian wulff did his best to lift the mood by nominating coach joachim loew and his team for some national honors .
the honor that loew is to receive is the most commonly awarded - the cross of merit on ribbon , or the knight 's cross .
eight other national football coaches have received the same honor , as has the women 's soccer team coach silvia neid .
the footballers themselves , meanwhile , are to be honored with the silver laurel leaf , the highest sporting honor in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew is the latest in a line of football coaches to receive the honor loew is by some distance the most famous person on this year 's list of winners .
unlike in britain , celebrities rarely make the cut , and if they do , it is never for things like " services to entertainment . "
susanne bos-eisolt , who is in charge of the department of the president 's office that administrates the honors , explains what they are for .
" first , to say thank you for what people do voluntarily for the state and for society .
and often it is about making the invisible visible , " she told deutsche welle .
" people often work on a small scale in local communities over many years , so that the wider public never gets to hear about them .
but as soon as the president says " thank you , " either personally or through such an award , the invisible becomes visible . "
anyone can nominate anyone there is a democratic principle behind germany 's state honors .
literally anyone can nominate anyone for any award .
all it takes is a letter either to the presidential office - or your local state premier - detailing the name , address and the accomplishments of the nominee .
german citizenship is not a requirement , either for the nominee or the nominator , and some seven percent of the approximately 2,300 awards handed out every year go to foreigners .
there are eight different federal orders of merit and they are organised more or less by demographic range - the more lives you have affected , the bigger the honor .
the simplest honor - the medal of merit - is often awarded to people who have selflessly looked after their families , while the highest honor - " the grand cross " - is reserved exclusively for heads of state .
there is also a special class of the grand cross , which has only been awarded twice – once to germany 's first post-war chancellor konrad adenauer , and once to chancellor helmut kohl .
the awards in between mainly go to politicians , professors , nobel prize winners , assorted philanthropists and museum directors .
sometimes , in a given year , they are grouped into themes .
last year , the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall was marked by awards relating to the former east germany .
devalued by dictatorship this left one of the recipients , hubertus knabe , director of the stasi prison memorial site in berlin with a dilemma .
" yes , i hesitated to accept this cross of merit because these kinds of state awards were misused in the past in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" we had two dictatorships , and every dictatorship used state awards to honor all kinds of collaboration . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the award is often presented in a ceremony at the presidential palace knabe , an historian who has extensively studied the darker side of the german democratic republic , is used to associating state honors with corruption and toeing the party line .
" if you read all these personal files , how they got all these orders and awards , it makes you a little bit allergic against these kind of state awards , " he said .
collector 's items uwe brueckner does not suffer from any such allergy .
the berlin policeman has been collecting german medals of honor since the age of 15 in 1975 .
to the occasional amusement of other collectors , brueckner has specialized in the federal order of merit in all its forms .
" i wanted to collect something where i had a chance of getting the complete set , " says brueckner , recalling his years of teenage rebellion .
" most collectors are more interested in earlier periods , especially the third reich , but there are so many different medals , and so many of them are impossible to find . "
he has now completed the federal republic set - with 200 individual medals - though for the higher levels he has had to make do with examples that do not have the original certificate with them , and so have probably been bought direct from the manufacturer .
he keeps the cream of his collection in a beautifully-lit display case in the hallway of his small flat in north berlin .
the most privileged shelf - at eye-level - is dedicated to the federal order of merit , and brueckner has set the honors out in an immaculate arrangement .
his prize possession is a " great cross of merit with star and shoulder ribbon " awarded to karl branner , the mayor of the western german town of kassel , in 1990 .
" it 's better than collecting coins , " brueckner said .
" coins all look the same , and stamps are no fun because you ca n't even touch them without devaluing them .
but medals often have real craftsmanship in them .
also , there 's a story and some history behind every one . "
while the modern federal cross of merit has little in the way of craftsmanship – " nowadays they are just factory products that are n't embellished at all " – brueckner is still proud of his set , partly for loyalty reasons .
" would i describe myself as a patriot ? " he asks himself .
" yes , i suppose so .
i suppose there 's some patriotism involved .
i support germany anyway . "

vfb has regularly plumbed the depths and scaled the heights . last season started with high hopes after coach markus babbel 's miracle working in the previous campaign had lifted a seemingly doomed vfb team out of the depths of the relegation zone and into the champions league qualification places .
the young coach seemed to have revived the club and fans even started dreaming of a return to title-winning ways which were then only two years in the past .
die roten -lrb- the reds -rrb- suffered a nightmare start , however , losing 2-0 to reigning champions wolfsburg and plummeting to last place in the league on the opening day .
they were soon up to seventh the following week after a more impressive 4-2 home win against freiburg .
but things started to go badly wrong after that .
six defeats , six draws and only one victory in the following 13 games saw stuttgart back in the relegation zone .
babbel survived until december 6 after a dull 1-1 home draw to vfl bochum confirmed his magic touch had deserted him .
babbel was immediately replaced by swiss coach christian gross who slowly and surely rebuilt the team 's confidence , leading them to a sixth place finish and into the knock-out rounds of the champions league where they lost to title-holders barcelona over two legs .
given the club 's record , fans might expect stuttgart to go into freefall again this season to even things up but gross appears to have the right formula on the pitch to make them competitive again .
however , stuttgart face a race against time to rebuild before the season starts , after seeing a number of players move on this summer with few solid deals under way to replace them .
khedira leaves biggest hole after stuttgart exodus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's midfield will have a khedira-shaped hole in it vfb have lost goalkeeper jens lehmann to retirement , sold ricardo osorio to cf monterey , martin lanig to cologne and roberto hilbert to besiktas , and have watched helplessly as alexander hleb ended his loan spell and rejoined barcelona .
but the most damaging loss could turn out to be the sale of sami khedira to real madrid .
khedira , who shone for the german national team at this summer 's world cup in south africa , successfully passed his medical with the spanish giants at the weekend to complete a 14-million-euro -lrb- $ 18.3 million -rrb- switch .
the 23-year-old midfielder joins jose mourinho 's real revolution on a five-year deal .
christian gross will have to move fast in the transfer market if he is to furnish his squad with players capable of improving on last season 's standards .
at the moment , he 'll be lucky to maintain the level vfb finally reached and could even struggle to avoid a reversal of fortunes .
gross calls back prodigal sons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian midfielder elson is back at stuttgart this season the swiss coach has not been sitting on his hands all summer , however .
he has brought former vfb midfielders elson and christian gentner back from hannover and wolfsburg respectively , while ex-stuttgart goalkeeper marc ziegler has returned from borussia dortmund to replace lehmann .
gross has also boosted the forward line with 23-year-old austrian striker martin harnik from fortuna duesseldorf , who scored the winner on his debut for the club in stuttgart 's europa league qualification game against norwegian club molde fk last week .
but to build on the progress he achieved with stuttgart in the second half of last season , gross needs to add a few more players of quality , especially after khedira , his pivotal midfielder , jumped ship .
one player who could be on the verge of joining vfb to fill khedira 's vacant role is marseille midfielder andre ayew , the 20-year-old who caught the eye with some excellent displays for ghana at the world cup .
ghana 's ayew the man to replace spain-bound sami bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart hopes to complete ayew 's switch from marseille while reports - and stuttgart sporting director jochen schneider - suggest a deal is in place and that the player wants to join vfb , the transfer may not be as clear cut as some may think .
despite missing marseille 's title-winning campaign last season while on loan at newly promoted arles-avignon , didier deschamps - the french champions ' coach - is said to be considering a greater role for ayew for the coming season .
if he is sold , however , stuttgart can expect to pay more than the one million euros they were offering before the world cup .
but with the club cash-rich from the sale of khedira , any hike in price should not prove to be too much of a problem .
what could be a stumbling block is the interest being paid ayew by bundesliga rivals borussia dortmund and schalke 04 , but if a move to germany is on the cards , ayew has admitted that vfb would be his favoured destination .
stuttgart free to move on long-term target degen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-bvb defender degen -lrb- l . -rrb- could return to the bundesliga christian gross has also boosted his defensive situation by signing his compatriot philipp degen on loan from liverpool .
the out-of-favour 27-year-old attacking full-back was told he could leave liverpool by new boss roy hodgson and was keen to return to the bundesliga after having moved to anfield from borussia dortmund in 2008 .
there may be some concerns about the swiss international 's injury record , however .
due to persistent injuries , degen made just 13 appearances for liverpool in two years since arriving on a free transfer .
he suffered a fractured ankle before even playing a competitive game for the team and then suffered a hernia , a fractured rib and broke his foot twice in the space of a year .
this may be why gross took degen on loan for a season before committing any funds to a permanent transfer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 07.08.2010 being honored by the fatherland : germany 's federal cross of merit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal cross of merit was introduced in 1951 where the uk has its knighthood , and france its legion of honour , germany rewards its loyal citizens with the federal cross of merit .
its most famous recent recipient was the national soccer team coach joachim loew . after the deflating end to germany 's thrilling world cup campaign in south africa , president christian wulff did his best to lift the mood by nominating coach joachim loew and his team for some national honors .
the honor that loew is to receive is the most commonly awarded - the cross of merit on ribbon , or the knight 's cross .
eight other national football coaches have received the same honor , as has the women 's soccer team coach silvia neid .
the footballers themselves , meanwhile , are to be honored with the silver laurel leaf , the highest sporting honor in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew is the latest in a line of football coaches to receive the honor loew is by some distance the most famous person on this year 's list of winners .
unlike in britain , celebrities rarely make the cut , and if they do , it is never for things like " services to entertainment . "
susanne bos-eisolt , who is in charge of the department of the president 's office that administrates the honors , explains what they are for .
" first , to say thank you for what people do voluntarily for the state and for society .
and often it is about making the invisible visible , " she told deutsche welle .
" people often work on a small scale in local communities over many years , so that the wider public never gets to hear about them .
but as soon as the president says " thank you , " either personally or through such an award , the invisible becomes visible . "
anyone can nominate anyone there is a democratic principle behind germany 's state honors .
literally anyone can nominate anyone for any award .
all it takes is a letter either to the presidential office - or your local state premier - detailing the name , address and the accomplishments of the nominee .
german citizenship is not a requirement , either for the nominee or the nominator , and some seven percent of the approximately 2,300 awards handed out every year go to foreigners .
there are eight different federal orders of merit and they are organised more or less by demographic range - the more lives you have affected , the bigger the honor .
the simplest honor - the medal of merit - is often awarded to people who have selflessly looked after their families , while the highest honor - " the grand cross " - is reserved exclusively for heads of state .
there is also a special class of the grand cross , which has only been awarded twice – once to germany 's first post-war chancellor konrad adenauer , and once to chancellor helmut kohl .
the awards in between mainly go to politicians , professors , nobel prize winners , assorted philanthropists and museum directors .
sometimes , in a given year , they are grouped into themes .
last year , the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall was marked by awards relating to the former east germany .
devalued by dictatorship this left one of the recipients , hubertus knabe , director of the stasi prison memorial site in berlin with a dilemma .
" yes , i hesitated to accept this cross of merit because these kinds of state awards were misused in the past in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" we had two dictatorships , and every dictatorship used state awards to honor all kinds of collaboration . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the award is often presented in a ceremony at the presidential palace knabe , an historian who has extensively studied the darker side of the german democratic republic , is used to associating state honors with corruption and toeing the party line .
" if you read all these personal files , how they got all these orders and awards , it makes you a little bit allergic against these kind of state awards , " he said .
collector 's items uwe brueckner does not suffer from any such allergy .
the berlin policeman has been collecting german medals of honor since the age of 15 in 1975 .
to the occasional amusement of other collectors , brueckner has specialized in the federal order of merit in all its forms .
" i wanted to collect something where i had a chance of getting the complete set , " says brueckner , recalling his years of teenage rebellion .
" most collectors are more interested in earlier periods , especially the third reich , but there are so many different medals , and so many of them are impossible to find . "
he has now completed the federal republic set - with 200 individual medals - though for the higher levels he has had to make do with examples that do not have the original certificate with them , and so have probably been bought direct from the manufacturer .
he keeps the cream of his collection in a beautifully-lit display case in the hallway of his small flat in north berlin .
the most privileged shelf - at eye-level - is dedicated to the federal order of merit , and brueckner has set the honors out in an immaculate arrangement .
his prize possession is a " great cross of merit with star and shoulder ribbon " awarded to karl branner , the mayor of the western german town of kassel , in 1990 .
" it 's better than collecting coins , " brueckner said .
" coins all look the same , and stamps are no fun because you ca n't even touch them without devaluing them .
but medals often have real craftsmanship in them .
also , there 's a story and some history behind every one . "
while the modern federal cross of merit has little in the way of craftsmanship – " nowadays they are just factory products that are n't embellished at all " – brueckner is still proud of his set , partly for loyalty reasons .
" would i describe myself as a patriot ? " he asks himself .
" yes , i suppose so .
i suppose there 's some patriotism involved .
i support germany anyway . "

vfb has regularly plumbed the depths and scaled the heights . last season started with high hopes after coach markus babbel 's miracle working in the previous campaign had lifted a seemingly doomed vfb team out of the depths of the relegation zone and into the champions league qualification places .
the young coach seemed to have revived the club and fans even started dreaming of a return to title-winning ways which were then only two years in the past .
die roten -lrb- the reds -rrb- suffered a nightmare start , however , losing 2-0 to reigning champions wolfsburg and plummeting to last place in the league on the opening day .
they were soon up to seventh the following week after a more impressive 4-2 home win against freiburg .
but things started to go badly wrong after that .
six defeats , six draws and only one victory in the following 13 games saw stuttgart back in the relegation zone .
babbel survived until december 6 after a dull 1-1 home draw to vfl bochum confirmed his magic touch had deserted him .
babbel was immediately replaced by swiss coach christian gross who slowly and surely rebuilt the team 's confidence , leading them to a sixth place finish and into the knock-out rounds of the champions league where they lost to title-holders barcelona over two legs .
given the club 's record , fans might expect stuttgart to go into freefall again this season to even things up but gross appears to have the right formula on the pitch to make them competitive again .
however , stuttgart face a race against time to rebuild before the season starts , after seeing a number of players move on this summer with few solid deals under way to replace them .
khedira leaves biggest hole after stuttgart exodus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's midfield will have a khedira-shaped hole in it vfb have lost goalkeeper jens lehmann to retirement , sold ricardo osorio to cf monterey , martin lanig to cologne and roberto hilbert to besiktas , and have watched helplessly as alexander hleb ended his loan spell and rejoined barcelona .
but the most damaging loss could turn out to be the sale of sami khedira to real madrid .
khedira , who shone for the german national team at this summer 's world cup in south africa , successfully passed his medical with the spanish giants at the weekend to complete a 14-million-euro -lrb- $ 18.3 million -rrb- switch .
the 23-year-old midfielder joins jose mourinho 's real revolution on a five-year deal .
christian gross will have to move fast in the transfer market if he is to furnish his squad with players capable of improving on last season 's standards .
at the moment , he 'll be lucky to maintain the level vfb finally reached and could even struggle to avoid a reversal of fortunes .
gross calls back prodigal sons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian midfielder elson is back at stuttgart this season the swiss coach has not been sitting on his hands all summer , however .
he has brought former vfb midfielders elson and christian gentner back from hannover and wolfsburg respectively , while ex-stuttgart goalkeeper marc ziegler has returned from borussia dortmund to replace lehmann .
gross has also boosted the forward line with 23-year-old austrian striker martin harnik from fortuna duesseldorf , who scored the winner on his debut for the club in stuttgart 's europa league qualification game against norwegian club molde fk last week .
but to build on the progress he achieved with stuttgart in the second half of last season , gross needs to add a few more players of quality , especially after khedira , his pivotal midfielder , jumped ship .
one player who could be on the verge of joining vfb to fill khedira 's vacant role is marseille midfielder andre ayew , the 20-year-old who caught the eye with some excellent displays for ghana at the world cup .
ghana 's ayew the man to replace spain-bound sami bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart hopes to complete ayew 's switch from marseille while reports - and stuttgart sporting director jochen schneider - suggest a deal is in place and that the player wants to join vfb , the transfer may not be as clear cut as some may think .
despite missing marseille 's title-winning campaign last season while on loan at newly promoted arles-avignon , didier deschamps - the french champions ' coach - is said to be considering a greater role for ayew for the coming season .
if he is sold , however , stuttgart can expect to pay more than the one million euros they were offering before the world cup .
but with the club cash-rich from the sale of khedira , any hike in price should not prove to be too much of a problem .
what could be a stumbling block is the interest being paid ayew by bundesliga rivals borussia dortmund and schalke 04 , but if a move to germany is on the cards , ayew has admitted that vfb would be his favoured destination .
stuttgart free to move on long-term target degen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-bvb defender degen -lrb- l . -rrb- could return to the bundesliga christian gross has also boosted his defensive situation by signing his compatriot philipp degen on loan from liverpool .
the out-of-favour 27-year-old attacking full-back was told he could leave liverpool by new boss roy hodgson and was keen to return to the bundesliga after having moved to anfield from borussia dortmund in 2008 .
there may be some concerns about the swiss international 's injury record , however .
due to persistent injuries , degen made just 13 appearances for liverpool in two years since arriving on a free transfer .
he suffered a fractured ankle before even playing a competitive game for the team and then suffered a hernia , a fractured rib and broke his foot twice in the space of a year .
this may be why gross took degen on loan for a season before committing any funds to a permanent transfer .

eu climate commissioner connie hedegaard said that , if anything , negoations were going in the wrong direction . international efforts to curb the threat of global warming are backsliding , said negotiators after a week of un climate talks in bonn .
chances of an early deal on curbing global warming ahead of the next major conference in cancun , mexico looked increasingly slim , the eu said on friday .
" these negotiations have , if anything , gone backwards , " said eu climate action commissioner connie hedegaard on the outcome of discussions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hedegaard said the world was ' in danger of missing the train ' in a statement , hedegaard said that major polluters appeared reluctant to take on their " fair share " of reductions to carbon emissions .
" this imbalance is not helpful and could seriously endanger the prospects of securing the successful outcome the world needs from the cancun climate conference next december , ” she warned .
" at this pace the world will simply collectively miss the train . "
last minute additions several major industrial nations still refuse to make legally binding cuts .
efforts to agree on a draft text for negotiation in cancun were hampered after a number of countries demanded last-minute additions to suit their own interests .
the eu 's co-lead negotiator , artur runge-metzger , accused some countries of making additions in a “ tit for tat " way that was not in keeping with the spirit of the talks .
referring to the next set of discussions in tianjin , china , runge-metzger said , " it is important in tianjin to turn that spirit around . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floods in pakistan were highlighted as an example of the dangers of climate change the copenhagen accord agreed in principle a goal of capping any global increase of temperatures at 2 degrees centigrade -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
the principles for providing aid to countries to deal with curbing c02 were also laid out along with plans to monitor emissions cuts .
however , even the limited achievements of that conference appeared to be in jeopardy , said european union representative peter wittoeck .
" it is disappointing to see some countries that have associated themselves with the accord seem to be dissociating themselves from its political consensus , " said wittoeck .
worries over us legislation wittoeck added that worries that the us congress would not pass legislation on climate change later this year had also cast a shadow over proceedings .
us negotiator jonathan pershing said he was eager for swift agreement , adding that record global temperatures , forest fires in russia and deadly floods in pakistan were " all consistent with the kind of changes we could expect from climate change , and they will get worse if we do n't act quickly . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un climate change chief christiana figueres said some progress had been made " unfortunately , what we have seen over and over this week is that some countries are walking back from the progress made in copenhagen , " pershing told journalists .
he told the reuters news agency that negotiators were putting too much onus on rich nations to deliver cuts , rather than seeking global commitments .
un climate chief christiana figueres said she believed that some progress had been made but that governments had to focus on solutions .
" to receive the desired outcome in cancun they must radically narrow down the choices that are now on the table , " she said .

the gates ' campaign is " too garish , " an asset manager told german news magazine der spiegel , asking to remain anonymous .
hamburg multimillionaire peter kraemer said the initiative was " highly problematic " and suggested that germany 's wealthy find other ways to donate .
gates launched his campaign , known as the giving pledge , with investor warren buffet in june .
the campaign was initially intended to encourage wealthy americans to donate at least 50 percent of their wealth to charitable causes , but has since gone global .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gates foundation has given away nearly $ 23 billion since 1994 gates said this week that he and buffet have scheduled meetings with some of the wealthiest people in china and india in the coming months .
forty billionaires have so far pledged to donate at least half of their fortunes to charity , including new york city mayor michael bloomberg , hollywood director george lucas and mexican tycoon carlos slim .
based on a forbes magazine estimate of the billionaires ' wealth , at least $ 150 billion -lrb- 112.9 billion euros -rrb- could be given away .
' a troubling development ' in an interview with der spiegel , kraemer said donations in the united states are for the most part tax deductible , giving the rich the option of contributing to charity or paying taxes .
he said donations of this magnitude lead to the wealthy minority of the population rather than the government deciding on where to allocate charitable funds . " i find this to be a troubling development , " said kramer .
" who has given these people the authority to decide where such huge amounts of money should be spent ? "
some wealthy germans are already known to be generous donors .
co-founder of software giant sap dietmar hopp finances soccer club tsg 1899 hoffenheim and has donated assets worth about 2.9 billion euros to a foundation .
hopp 's partner klaus tschira has also donated more than half of his fortune to a foundation promoting science , mathematics and computer science .

dw : is the war in afghanistan a political nightmare for you ?
guido westerwelle : i do n't think it 's something anyone would wish upon themselves .
nobody relishes having political responsibility in times like these .
the decision was taken many years ago by the government of the time and we now have to face up to our responsibility .
we have to contribute to our own security , to protect ourselves and our citizens from terrorism as far as possible .
and it 's also in our interest that afghanistan develops positively and becomes a stable country again in the future .
there have been two afghanistan conferences this year , one in london and one in kabul .
you took part in both and you played a major role in one .
a basic framework of action was agreed , involving more security force training , attempts to integrate former taliban and more civil reconstruction .
six months on , has there been any progress ?
or is it too early to judge ?
well , the situation is varied .
i fear we 're going to go through some security setbacks first .
the harvest season is coming to an end .
experience has shown that that often aggravates the security situation .
on the other hand , there are 134 districts in the north and only eight of those are regarded as being particularly dangerous .
so you have to see that as well as building roads and schools , including girls ' schools , we 've helped stabilize the region politically .
that was our main goal .
our other goal is to be able to transfer responsibility for security to the afghan government in 2014 .
that 's also president hamid karzai 's goal and it was agreed by the international community at the recent afghanistan conference in kabul .
still , many people have the impression that things are not really improving in afghanistan .
why is civil reconstruction progressing so slowly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle says most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing i believe you 've got to look at the various aspects differently .
it 's true that some areas of development are not progressing much .
but others have seen positive changes and that should be appreciated .
you must n't forget that we 're there because the great majority of ordinary afghans want us there .
at the same time , we 've now got to implement the change of strategy that we agreed first in london and then in kabul - and that involves achieving political reconciliation .
are you finding you 're increasingly able to ' win the hearts of afghans ' - as one former defense minister put it ?
are afghans open to that ?
yes .
as far as we know , most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing .
the debate in germany and other european countries just shows you the setbacks , the attacks and all the negative issues , things that are not working .
you rarely see examples of progress .
one such example is the peace jirga gathering .
about 1,600 delegates attended and managed to reach an agreement , and about 20 percent of the delegates were women .
in my opinion , developments like that receive too little recognition . you ca n't understand afghanistan without looking at its neighbors .
let 's start with pakistan .
the country is actually an ally , but , as we 've come to see , there are sections in that society that oppose us - some would even call them enemies .
is the government in islamabad not playing fair ?
i think , even there , you have to see the successes .
for example , in the run-up to the afghanistan conference , a trade deal was agreed between afghanistan and pakistan .
that does n't sound all that spectacular , but if you know the history of the two countries , it 's a pretty amazing event .
then there 's a further issue to consider .
we need the neighbors , we need regional cooperation to be successful .
in london at the beginning of the year we were missing one country from the region .
but in kabul the entire region was represented and agreed to the declaration .
that helps strengthen the bonds between neighbors .
we want to encourage that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops have been in afghanistan since 2001 that of course is difficult to imagine , for example with iran .
and that 's who we 're talking about in this case .
sanctions have been imposed on the country , people are scared of nuclear arms ; they 're scared of the iranian president .
but you also have to engage the iranians somehow , in order to stabilize afghanistan .
is such a balancing act realistic ?
well , it 's necessary , or at least it 's essential we try .
the eu and the un did n't decide on sanctions in order to oppose a country , or to prevent iran from using nuclear power for civilian purposes .
instead , we want to see the iranian government return to the negotiating table , to cooperate , to provide transparency - things that iran has actually already committed itself to .
all countries are permitted to use nuclear power for peaceful and civilian purposes .
but they must also cooperate with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , and provide complete transparency to demonstrate they are using it for exclusively civilian purposes - and not secretly developing a bomb .
that is what we need to prevent , and we remain willing to negotiate with iran .
i could also imagine that talks could take place in september between our european colleague catherine ashton and the iranian side .
that 's our goal .
but it requires cooperation and transparency from iran - and iran must not lay down any preconditions for comprehensive talks .
the war in afghanistan is viewed skeptically in many countries - in most countries , by the majority of the population .
after eight years of involvement in afghanistan , how long will patience last for the hope of reaching the goal we want to reach - a relatively peaceful afghanistan ?
that 's a very hard question to answer .
and i can only advise that we do n't lose sight of our own interests .
it is in our interest that we do not allow those who export terrorism into the world … to turn afghanistan back into a safe haven where they can re-arm .
people forget that many attacks were planned there , and some of those attacks also targeted europe .
yes , we should be skeptical , and view any foreign deployment of the bundeswehr initially with a healthy dose of skepticism .
but i would also suggest that we understand that this also concerns our own security , and that is why we want to be and must be successful .
but we also need a clear perspective on withdrawal - something we can work towards by doing even more , as , for example , in supporting civil redevelopment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 07.08.2010 stuttgart racing to find players to prevent another rollercoaster season großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfb have lost some of the stars that aided last season 's revival last season was a microcosm of stuttgart ’ s entire bundesliga history , with their final league table chart looking like the blueprint for a new rollercoaster .
vfb has regularly plumbed the depths and scaled the heights . last season started with high hopes after coach markus babbel 's miracle working in the previous campaign had lifted a seemingly doomed vfb team out of the depths of the relegation zone and into the champions league qualification places .
the young coach seemed to have revived the club and fans even started dreaming of a return to title-winning ways which were then only two years in the past .
die roten -lrb- the reds -rrb- suffered a nightmare start , however , losing 2-0 to reigning champions wolfsburg and plummeting to last place in the league on the opening day .
they were soon up to seventh the following week after a more impressive 4-2 home win against freiburg .
but things started to go badly wrong after that .
six defeats , six draws and only one victory in the following 13 games saw stuttgart back in the relegation zone .
babbel survived until december 6 after a dull 1-1 home draw to vfl bochum confirmed his magic touch had deserted him .
babbel was immediately replaced by swiss coach christian gross who slowly and surely rebuilt the team 's confidence , leading them to a sixth place finish and into the knock-out rounds of the champions league where they lost to title-holders barcelona over two legs .
given the club 's record , fans might expect stuttgart to go into freefall again this season to even things up but gross appears to have the right formula on the pitch to make them competitive again .
however , stuttgart face a race against time to rebuild before the season starts , after seeing a number of players move on this summer with few solid deals under way to replace them .
khedira leaves biggest hole after stuttgart exodus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's midfield will have a khedira-shaped hole in it vfb have lost goalkeeper jens lehmann to retirement , sold ricardo osorio to cf monterey , martin lanig to cologne and roberto hilbert to besiktas , and have watched helplessly as alexander hleb ended his loan spell and rejoined barcelona .
but the most damaging loss could turn out to be the sale of sami khedira to real madrid .
khedira , who shone for the german national team at this summer 's world cup in south africa , successfully passed his medical with the spanish giants at the weekend to complete a 14-million-euro -lrb- $ 18.3 million -rrb- switch .
the 23-year-old midfielder joins jose mourinho 's real revolution on a five-year deal .
christian gross will have to move fast in the transfer market if he is to furnish his squad with players capable of improving on last season 's standards .
at the moment , he 'll be lucky to maintain the level vfb finally reached and could even struggle to avoid a reversal of fortunes .
gross calls back prodigal sons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian midfielder elson is back at stuttgart this season the swiss coach has not been sitting on his hands all summer , however .
he has brought former vfb midfielders elson and christian gentner back from hannover and wolfsburg respectively , while ex-stuttgart goalkeeper marc ziegler has returned from borussia dortmund to replace lehmann .
gross has also boosted the forward line with 23-year-old austrian striker martin harnik from fortuna duesseldorf , who scored the winner on his debut for the club in stuttgart 's europa league qualification game against norwegian club molde fk last week .
but to build on the progress he achieved with stuttgart in the second half of last season , gross needs to add a few more players of quality , especially after khedira , his pivotal midfielder , jumped ship .
one player who could be on the verge of joining vfb to fill khedira 's vacant role is marseille midfielder andre ayew , the 20-year-old who caught the eye with some excellent displays for ghana at the world cup .

despite missing marseille 's title-winning campaign last season while on loan at newly promoted arles-avignon , didier deschamps - the french champions ' coach - is said to be considering a greater role for ayew for the coming season .
if he is sold , however , stuttgart can expect to pay more than the one million euros they were offering before the world cup .
but with the club cash-rich from the sale of khedira , any hike in price should not prove to be too much of a problem .
what could be a stumbling block is the interest being paid ayew by bundesliga rivals borussia dortmund and schalke 04 , but if a move to germany is on the cards , ayew has admitted that vfb would be his favoured destination .

due to persistent injuries , degen made just 13 appearances for liverpool in two years since arriving on a free transfer .
he suffered a fractured ankle before even playing a competitive game for the team and then suffered a hernia , a fractured rib and broke his foot twice in the space of a year .
this may be why gross took degen on loan for a season before committing any funds to a permanent transfer .

vfb has regularly plumbed the depths and scaled the heights . last season started with high hopes after coach markus babbel 's miracle working in the previous campaign had lifted a seemingly doomed vfb team out of the depths of the relegation zone and into the champions league qualification places .
the young coach seemed to have revived the club and fans even started dreaming of a return to title-winning ways which were then only two years in the past .
die roten -lrb- the reds -rrb- suffered a nightmare start , however , losing 2-0 to reigning champions wolfsburg and plummeting to last place in the league on the opening day .
they were soon up to seventh the following week after a more impressive 4-2 home win against freiburg .
but things started to go badly wrong after that .
six defeats , six draws and only one victory in the following 13 games saw stuttgart back in the relegation zone .
babbel survived until december 6 after a dull 1-1 home draw to vfl bochum confirmed his magic touch had deserted him .
babbel was immediately replaced by swiss coach christian gross who slowly and surely rebuilt the team 's confidence , leading them to a sixth place finish and into the knock-out rounds of the champions league where they lost to title-holders barcelona over two legs .
given the club 's record , fans might expect stuttgart to go into freefall again this season to even things up but gross appears to have the right formula on the pitch to make them competitive again .
however , stuttgart face a race against time to rebuild before the season starts , after seeing a number of players move on this summer with few solid deals under way to replace them .
khedira leaves biggest hole after stuttgart exodus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's midfield will have a khedira-shaped hole in it vfb have lost goalkeeper jens lehmann to retirement , sold ricardo osorio to cf monterey , martin lanig to cologne and roberto hilbert to besiktas , and have watched helplessly as alexander hleb ended his loan spell and rejoined barcelona .
but the most damaging loss could turn out to be the sale of sami khedira to real madrid .
khedira , who shone for the german national team at this summer 's world cup in south africa , successfully passed his medical with the spanish giants at the weekend to complete a 14-million-euro -lrb- $ 18.3 million -rrb- switch .
the 23-year-old midfielder joins jose mourinho 's real revolution on a five-year deal .
christian gross will have to move fast in the transfer market if he is to furnish his squad with players capable of improving on last season 's standards .
at the moment , he 'll be lucky to maintain the level vfb finally reached and could even struggle to avoid a reversal of fortunes .
gross calls back prodigal sons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian midfielder elson is back at stuttgart this season the swiss coach has not been sitting on his hands all summer , however .
he has brought former vfb midfielders elson and christian gentner back from hannover and wolfsburg respectively , while ex-stuttgart goalkeeper marc ziegler has returned from borussia dortmund to replace lehmann .
gross has also boosted the forward line with 23-year-old austrian striker martin harnik from fortuna duesseldorf , who scored the winner on his debut for the club in stuttgart 's europa league qualification game against norwegian club molde fk last week .
but to build on the progress he achieved with stuttgart in the second half of last season , gross needs to add a few more players of quality , especially after khedira , his pivotal midfielder , jumped ship .
one player who could be on the verge of joining vfb to fill khedira 's vacant role is marseille midfielder andre ayew , the 20-year-old who caught the eye with some excellent displays for ghana at the world cup .
ghana 's ayew the man to replace spain-bound sami bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart hopes to complete ayew 's switch from marseille while reports - and stuttgart sporting director jochen schneider - suggest a deal is in place and that the player wants to join vfb , the transfer may not be as clear cut as some may think .
despite missing marseille 's title-winning campaign last season while on loan at newly promoted arles-avignon , didier deschamps - the french champions ' coach - is said to be considering a greater role for ayew for the coming season .
if he is sold , however , stuttgart can expect to pay more than the one million euros they were offering before the world cup .
but with the club cash-rich from the sale of khedira , any hike in price should not prove to be too much of a problem .
what could be a stumbling block is the interest being paid ayew by bundesliga rivals borussia dortmund and schalke 04 , but if a move to germany is on the cards , ayew has admitted that vfb would be his favoured destination .
stuttgart free to move on long-term target degen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-bvb defender degen -lrb- l . -rrb- could return to the bundesliga christian gross has also boosted his defensive situation by signing his compatriot philipp degen on loan from liverpool .

vfb has regularly plumbed the depths and scaled the heights . last season started with high hopes after coach markus babbel 's miracle working in the previous campaign had lifted a seemingly doomed vfb team out of the depths of the relegation zone and into the champions league qualification places .
the young coach seemed to have revived the club and fans even started dreaming of a return to title-winning ways which were then only two years in the past .
die roten -lrb- the reds -rrb- suffered a nightmare start , however , losing 2-0 to reigning champions wolfsburg and plummeting to last place in the league on the opening day .
they were soon up to seventh the following week after a more impressive 4-2 home win against freiburg .
but things started to go badly wrong after that .
six defeats , six draws and only one victory in the following 13 games saw stuttgart back in the relegation zone .
babbel survived until december 6 after a dull 1-1 home draw to vfl bochum confirmed his magic touch had deserted him .
babbel was immediately replaced by swiss coach christian gross who slowly and surely rebuilt the team 's confidence , leading them to a sixth place finish and into the knock-out rounds of the champions league where they lost to title-holders barcelona over two legs .
given the club 's record , fans might expect stuttgart to go into freefall again this season to even things up but gross appears to have the right formula on the pitch to make them competitive again .
however , stuttgart face a race against time to rebuild before the season starts , after seeing a number of players move on this summer with few solid deals under way to replace them .
khedira leaves biggest hole after stuttgart exodus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's midfield will have a khedira-shaped hole in it vfb have lost goalkeeper jens lehmann to retirement , sold ricardo osorio to cf monterey , martin lanig to cologne and roberto hilbert to besiktas , and have watched helplessly as alexander hleb ended his loan spell and rejoined barcelona .
but the most damaging loss could turn out to be the sale of sami khedira to real madrid .
khedira , who shone for the german national team at this summer 's world cup in south africa , successfully passed his medical with the spanish giants at the weekend to complete a 14-million-euro -lrb- $ 18.3 million -rrb- switch .
the 23-year-old midfielder joins jose mourinho 's real revolution on a five-year deal .
christian gross will have to move fast in the transfer market if he is to furnish his squad with players capable of improving on last season 's standards .
at the moment , he 'll be lucky to maintain the level vfb finally reached and could even struggle to avoid a reversal of fortunes .
gross calls back prodigal sons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian midfielder elson is back at stuttgart this season the swiss coach has not been sitting on his hands all summer , however .
he has brought former vfb midfielders elson and christian gentner back from hannover and wolfsburg respectively , while ex-stuttgart goalkeeper marc ziegler has returned from borussia dortmund to replace lehmann .
gross has also boosted the forward line with 23-year-old austrian striker martin harnik from fortuna duesseldorf , who scored the winner on his debut for the club in stuttgart 's europa league qualification game against norwegian club molde fk last week .
but to build on the progress he achieved with stuttgart in the second half of last season , gross needs to add a few more players of quality , especially after khedira , his pivotal midfielder , jumped ship .
one player who could be on the verge of joining vfb to fill khedira 's vacant role is marseille midfielder andre ayew , the 20-year-old who caught the eye with some excellent displays for ghana at the world cup .
ghana 's ayew the man to replace spain-bound sami bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart hopes to complete ayew 's switch from marseille while reports - and stuttgart sporting director jochen schneider - suggest a deal is in place and that the player wants to join vfb , the transfer may not be as clear cut as some may think .
despite missing marseille 's title-winning campaign last season while on loan at newly promoted arles-avignon , didier deschamps - the french champions ' coach - is said to be considering a greater role for ayew for the coming season .
if he is sold , however , stuttgart can expect to pay more than the one million euros they were offering before the world cup .
but with the club cash-rich from the sale of khedira , any hike in price should not prove to be too much of a problem .
what could be a stumbling block is the interest being paid ayew by bundesliga rivals borussia dortmund and schalke 04 , but if a move to germany is on the cards , ayew has admitted that vfb would be his favoured destination .
stuttgart free to move on long-term target degen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-bvb defender degen -lrb- l . -rrb- could return to the bundesliga christian gross has also boosted his defensive situation by signing his compatriot philipp degen on loan from liverpool .
the out-of-favour 27-year-old attacking full-back was told he could leave liverpool by new boss roy hodgson and was keen to return to the bundesliga after having moved to anfield from borussia dortmund in 2008 .
there may be some concerns about the swiss international 's injury record , however .
due to persistent injuries , degen made just 13 appearances for liverpool in two years since arriving on a free transfer .
he suffered a fractured ankle before even playing a competitive game for the team and then suffered a hernia , a fractured rib and broke his foot twice in the space of a year .
this may be why gross took degen on loan for a season before committing any funds to a permanent transfer .

dw : is the war in afghanistan a political nightmare for you ?
guido westerwelle : i do n't think it 's something anyone would wish upon themselves .
nobody relishes having political responsibility in times like these .
the decision was taken many years ago by the government of the time and we now have to face up to our responsibility .
we have to contribute to our own security , to protect ourselves and our citizens from terrorism as far as possible .
and it 's also in our interest that afghanistan develops positively and becomes a stable country again in the future .
there have been two afghanistan conferences this year , one in london and one in kabul .
you took part in both and you played a major role in one .
a basic framework of action was agreed , involving more security force training , attempts to integrate former taliban and more civil reconstruction .
six months on , has there been any progress ?
or is it too early to judge ?
well , the situation is varied .
i fear we 're going to go through some security setbacks first .
the harvest season is coming to an end .
experience has shown that that often aggravates the security situation .
on the other hand , there are 134 districts in the north and only eight of those are regarded as being particularly dangerous .
so you have to see that as well as building roads and schools , including girls ' schools , we 've helped stabilize the region politically .
that was our main goal .
our other goal is to be able to transfer responsibility for security to the afghan government in 2014 .
that 's also president hamid karzai 's goal and it was agreed by the international community at the recent afghanistan conference in kabul .
still , many people have the impression that things are not really improving in afghanistan .
why is civil reconstruction progressing so slowly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle says most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing i believe you 've got to look at the various aspects differently .
it 's true that some areas of development are not progressing much .
but others have seen positive changes and that should be appreciated .
you must n't forget that we 're there because the great majority of ordinary afghans want us there .
at the same time , we 've now got to implement the change of strategy that we agreed first in london and then in kabul - and that involves achieving political reconciliation .
are you finding you 're increasingly able to ' win the hearts of afghans ' - as one former defense minister put it ?
are afghans open to that ?
yes .
as far as we know , most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing .
the debate in germany and other european countries just shows you the setbacks , the attacks and all the negative issues , things that are not working .
you rarely see examples of progress .
one such example is the peace jirga gathering .
about 1,600 delegates attended and managed to reach an agreement , and about 20 percent of the delegates were women .
in my opinion , developments like that receive too little recognition . you ca n't understand afghanistan without looking at its neighbors .
let 's start with pakistan .
the country is actually an ally , but , as we 've come to see , there are sections in that society that oppose us - some would even call them enemies .
is the government in islamabad not playing fair ?
i think , even there , you have to see the successes .
for example , in the run-up to the afghanistan conference , a trade deal was agreed between afghanistan and pakistan .
that does n't sound all that spectacular , but if you know the history of the two countries , it 's a pretty amazing event .
then there 's a further issue to consider .
we need the neighbors , we need regional cooperation to be successful .
in london at the beginning of the year we were missing one country from the region .
but in kabul the entire region was represented and agreed to the declaration .
that helps strengthen the bonds between neighbors .
we want to encourage that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops have been in afghanistan since 2001 that of course is difficult to imagine , for example with iran .
and that 's who we 're talking about in this case .
sanctions have been imposed on the country , people are scared of nuclear arms ; they 're scared of the iranian president .
but you also have to engage the iranians somehow , in order to stabilize afghanistan .
is such a balancing act realistic ?
well , it 's necessary , or at least it 's essential we try .
the eu and the un did n't decide on sanctions in order to oppose a country , or to prevent iran from using nuclear power for civilian purposes .
instead , we want to see the iranian government return to the negotiating table , to cooperate , to provide transparency - things that iran has actually already committed itself to .
all countries are permitted to use nuclear power for peaceful and civilian purposes .
but they must also cooperate with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , and provide complete transparency to demonstrate they are using it for exclusively civilian purposes - and not secretly developing a bomb .
that is what we need to prevent , and we remain willing to negotiate with iran .
i could also imagine that talks could take place in september between our european colleague catherine ashton and the iranian side .
that 's our goal .
but it requires cooperation and transparency from iran - and iran must not lay down any preconditions for comprehensive talks .
the war in afghanistan is viewed skeptically in many countries - in most countries , by the majority of the population .
after eight years of involvement in afghanistan , how long will patience last for the hope of reaching the goal we want to reach - a relatively peaceful afghanistan ?
that 's a very hard question to answer .
and i can only advise that we do n't lose sight of our own interests .
it is in our interest that we do not allow those who export terrorism into the world … to turn afghanistan back into a safe haven where they can re-arm .
people forget that many attacks were planned there , and some of those attacks also targeted europe .
yes , we should be skeptical , and view any foreign deployment of the bundeswehr initially with a healthy dose of skepticism .
but i would also suggest that we understand that this also concerns our own security , and that is why we want to be and must be successful .
but we also need a clear perspective on withdrawal - something we can work towards by doing even more , as , for example , in supporting civil redevelopment .

vfb has regularly plumbed the depths and scaled the heights . last season started with high hopes after coach markus babbel 's miracle working in the previous campaign had lifted a seemingly doomed vfb team out of the depths of the relegation zone and into the champions league qualification places .
the young coach seemed to have revived the club and fans even started dreaming of a return to title-winning ways which were then only two years in the past .
die roten -lrb- the reds -rrb- suffered a nightmare start , however , losing 2-0 to reigning champions wolfsburg and plummeting to last place in the league on the opening day .
they were soon up to seventh the following week after a more impressive 4-2 home win against freiburg .
but things started to go badly wrong after that .
six defeats , six draws and only one victory in the following 13 games saw stuttgart back in the relegation zone .
babbel survived until december 6 after a dull 1-1 home draw to vfl bochum confirmed his magic touch had deserted him .
babbel was immediately replaced by swiss coach christian gross who slowly and surely rebuilt the team 's confidence , leading them to a sixth place finish and into the knock-out rounds of the champions league where they lost to title-holders barcelona over two legs .
given the club 's record , fans might expect stuttgart to go into freefall again this season to even things up but gross appears to have the right formula on the pitch to make them competitive again .
however , stuttgart face a race against time to rebuild before the season starts , after seeing a number of players move on this summer with few solid deals under way to replace them .
khedira leaves biggest hole after stuttgart exodus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's midfield will have a khedira-shaped hole in it vfb have lost goalkeeper jens lehmann to retirement , sold ricardo osorio to cf monterey , martin lanig to cologne and roberto hilbert to besiktas , and have watched helplessly as alexander hleb ended his loan spell and rejoined barcelona .
but the most damaging loss could turn out to be the sale of sami khedira to real madrid .
khedira , who shone for the german national team at this summer 's world cup in south africa , successfully passed his medical with the spanish giants at the weekend to complete a 14-million-euro -lrb- $ 18.3 million -rrb- switch .
the 23-year-old midfielder joins jose mourinho 's real revolution on a five-year deal .
christian gross will have to move fast in the transfer market if he is to furnish his squad with players capable of improving on last season 's standards .
at the moment , he 'll be lucky to maintain the level vfb finally reached and could even struggle to avoid a reversal of fortunes .
gross calls back prodigal sons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian midfielder elson is back at stuttgart this season the swiss coach has not been sitting on his hands all summer , however .
he has brought former vfb midfielders elson and christian gentner back from hannover and wolfsburg respectively , while ex-stuttgart goalkeeper marc ziegler has returned from borussia dortmund to replace lehmann .
gross has also boosted the forward line with 23-year-old austrian striker martin harnik from fortuna duesseldorf , who scored the winner on his debut for the club in stuttgart 's europa league qualification game against norwegian club molde fk last week .
but to build on the progress he achieved with stuttgart in the second half of last season , gross needs to add a few more players of quality , especially after khedira , his pivotal midfielder , jumped ship .
one player who could be on the verge of joining vfb to fill khedira 's vacant role is marseille midfielder andre ayew , the 20-year-old who caught the eye with some excellent displays for ghana at the world cup .
ghana 's ayew the man to replace spain-bound sami bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart hopes to complete ayew 's switch from marseille while reports - and stuttgart sporting director jochen schneider - suggest a deal is in place and that the player wants to join vfb , the transfer may not be as clear cut as some may think .
despite missing marseille 's title-winning campaign last season while on loan at newly promoted arles-avignon , didier deschamps - the french champions ' coach - is said to be considering a greater role for ayew for the coming season .
if he is sold , however , stuttgart can expect to pay more than the one million euros they were offering before the world cup .
but with the club cash-rich from the sale of khedira , any hike in price should not prove to be too much of a problem .
what could be a stumbling block is the interest being paid ayew by bundesliga rivals borussia dortmund and schalke 04 , but if a move to germany is on the cards , ayew has admitted that vfb would be his favoured destination .
stuttgart free to move on long-term target degen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-bvb defender degen -lrb- l . -rrb- could return to the bundesliga christian gross has also boosted his defensive situation by signing his compatriot philipp degen on loan from liverpool .
the out-of-favour 27-year-old attacking full-back was told he could leave liverpool by new boss roy hodgson and was keen to return to the bundesliga after having moved to anfield from borussia dortmund in 2008 .
there may be some concerns about the swiss international 's injury record , however .
due to persistent injuries , degen made just 13 appearances for liverpool in two years since arriving on a free transfer .
he suffered a fractured ankle before even playing a competitive game for the team and then suffered a hernia , a fractured rib and broke his foot twice in the space of a year .
this may be why gross took degen on loan for a season before committing any funds to a permanent transfer .

the gates ' campaign is " too garish , " an asset manager told german news magazine der spiegel , asking to remain anonymous .
hamburg multimillionaire peter kraemer said the initiative was " highly problematic " and suggested that germany 's wealthy find other ways to donate .
gates launched his campaign , known as the giving pledge , with investor warren buffet in june .
the campaign was initially intended to encourage wealthy americans to donate at least 50 percent of their wealth to charitable causes , but has since gone global .

based on a forbes magazine estimate of the billionaires ' wealth , at least $ 150 billion -lrb- 112.9 billion euros -rrb- could be given away .
' a troubling development ' in an interview with der spiegel , kraemer said donations in the united states are for the most part tax deductible , giving the rich the option of contributing to charity or paying taxes .
he said donations of this magnitude lead to the wealthy minority of the population rather than the government deciding on where to allocate charitable funds . " i find this to be a troubling development , " said kramer .

vfb has regularly plumbed the depths and scaled the heights . last season started with high hopes after coach markus babbel 's miracle working in the previous campaign had lifted a seemingly doomed vfb team out of the depths of the relegation zone and into the champions league qualification places .
the young coach seemed to have revived the club and fans even started dreaming of a return to title-winning ways which were then only two years in the past .

they were soon up to seventh the following week after a more impressive 4-2 home win against freiburg .
but things started to go badly wrong after that .
six defeats , six draws and only one victory in the following 13 games saw stuttgart back in the relegation zone .

given the club 's record , fans might expect stuttgart to go into freefall again this season to even things up but gross appears to have the right formula on the pitch to make them competitive again .
however , stuttgart face a race against time to rebuild before the season starts , after seeing a number of players move on this summer with few solid deals under way to replace them .
khedira leaves biggest hole after stuttgart exodus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's midfield will have a khedira-shaped hole in it vfb have lost goalkeeper jens lehmann to retirement , sold ricardo osorio to cf monterey , martin lanig to cologne and roberto hilbert to besiktas , and have watched helplessly as alexander hleb ended his loan spell and rejoined barcelona .
but the most damaging loss could turn out to be the sale of sami khedira to real madrid .

christian gross will have to move fast in the transfer market if he is to furnish his squad with players capable of improving on last season 's standards .

the taliban have claimed responsibility for the killings . the german government strongly condemned saturday the murder of 10 aid workers in northern afghanistan , the majority of whom were foreigners , including one german woman .
" the german government is indignant over the terrible attack , " government spokeswoman sabine heimbach said in a statement .
the government called for a full inquiry into the " cowardly murder " and for the perpetrators to be punished .
" the incident underlines the necessity to continue working with determination towards stabilizing the situation in afghanistan , so the afghan government can increasingly take responsibility for security in the country , " the government said .
the bullet-riddled bodies of the eight foreign medical workers and two afghans working for an international health charity were discovered in a mountainous , forested area in northern afghanistan , according to afghan police .
the taliban quickly claimed responsibility for the attack on a group they called " christian missionaries . "
the international assistance mission -lrb- iam -rrb- , a non-profit christian health organization , said six of the dead were americans , one was german and one was british .
the iam provides medical and eye care in remote areas and has been operating in afghanistan since 1966 .
robbery a likely motive dirk frans , the group 's director , said the team numbered 12 , including four afghans , two of whom were killed . the group , he said , were on their way back to kabul from an eye facility in nuristan province near the border with pakistan .
" they were killed on their way back .
they had no guns and no security because we come at the communities ' invitation and they take care of us , " frans told the agence france-presse news agency .
" there have never been any threats against us .
if there were threats , we would not have gone , " he said .
he said the organization would continue its activities .
despite the taliban claim , frans said police had told him that robbery was the likely motive for the killings .
the victims , seven men and three women , had been stripped of all their money and belongings .
he denied the taliban 's claim that the group carried bibles in the local language dari .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuristan and badakshan are close to afghanistan 's porous border with pakistan conflicting information according to police , an afghan colleague of the victims who survived the attack walked to a police station in badakhshan to inform them of the attack .
police said the attack took place some two weeks ago , but because of the remoteness of the area they were unable to recover the bodies until thursday .
the information was in apparent conflict with the taliban 's claims that the attack was on friday .
the taliban also claimed there were nine foreigners - five men and four women - and one afghan national .
the survivor , identified only as sayedullah , said the foreigners worked at a hospital in kabul .
the victims were reportedly found next to their three four-wheel drive vehicles and had been lined up before they were shot .

the gates ' campaign is " too garish , " an asset manager told german news magazine der spiegel , asking to remain anonymous .
hamburg multimillionaire peter kraemer said the initiative was " highly problematic " and suggested that germany 's wealthy find other ways to donate .

dw : is the war in afghanistan a political nightmare for you ?
guido westerwelle : i do n't think it 's something anyone would wish upon themselves .
nobody relishes having political responsibility in times like these .
the decision was taken many years ago by the government of the time and we now have to face up to our responsibility .
we have to contribute to our own security , to protect ourselves and our citizens from terrorism as far as possible .
and it 's also in our interest that afghanistan develops positively and becomes a stable country again in the future .
there have been two afghanistan conferences this year , one in london and one in kabul .
you took part in both and you played a major role in one .
a basic framework of action was agreed , involving more security force training , attempts to integrate former taliban and more civil reconstruction .
six months on , has there been any progress ?
or is it too early to judge ?
well , the situation is varied .
i fear we 're going to go through some security setbacks first .
the harvest season is coming to an end .
experience has shown that that often aggravates the security situation .
on the other hand , there are 134 districts in the north and only eight of those are regarded as being particularly dangerous .
so you have to see that as well as building roads and schools , including girls ' schools , we 've helped stabilize the region politically .
that was our main goal .
our other goal is to be able to transfer responsibility for security to the afghan government in 2014 .
that 's also president hamid karzai 's goal and it was agreed by the international community at the recent afghanistan conference in kabul .
still , many people have the impression that things are not really improving in afghanistan .
why is civil reconstruction progressing so slowly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle says most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing i believe you 've got to look at the various aspects differently .
it 's true that some areas of development are not progressing much .
but others have seen positive changes and that should be appreciated .
you must n't forget that we 're there because the great majority of ordinary afghans want us there .
at the same time , we 've now got to implement the change of strategy that we agreed first in london and then in kabul - and that involves achieving political reconciliation .
are you finding you 're increasingly able to ' win the hearts of afghans ' - as one former defense minister put it ?
are afghans open to that ?
yes .
as far as we know , most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing .
the debate in germany and other european countries just shows you the setbacks , the attacks and all the negative issues , things that are not working .
you rarely see examples of progress .
one such example is the peace jirga gathering .
about 1,600 delegates attended and managed to reach an agreement , and about 20 percent of the delegates were women .
in my opinion , developments like that receive too little recognition . you ca n't understand afghanistan without looking at its neighbors .
let 's start with pakistan .
the country is actually an ally , but , as we 've come to see , there are sections in that society that oppose us - some would even call them enemies .
is the government in islamabad not playing fair ?
i think , even there , you have to see the successes .
for example , in the run-up to the afghanistan conference , a trade deal was agreed between afghanistan and pakistan .
that does n't sound all that spectacular , but if you know the history of the two countries , it 's a pretty amazing event .
then there 's a further issue to consider .
we need the neighbors , we need regional cooperation to be successful .
in london at the beginning of the year we were missing one country from the region .
but in kabul the entire region was represented and agreed to the declaration .
that helps strengthen the bonds between neighbors .
we want to encourage that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops have been in afghanistan since 2001 that of course is difficult to imagine , for example with iran .
and that 's who we 're talking about in this case .
sanctions have been imposed on the country , people are scared of nuclear arms ; they 're scared of the iranian president .
but you also have to engage the iranians somehow , in order to stabilize afghanistan .
is such a balancing act realistic ?
well , it 's necessary , or at least it 's essential we try .
the eu and the un did n't decide on sanctions in order to oppose a country , or to prevent iran from using nuclear power for civilian purposes .
instead , we want to see the iranian government return to the negotiating table , to cooperate , to provide transparency - things that iran has actually already committed itself to .
all countries are permitted to use nuclear power for peaceful and civilian purposes .
but they must also cooperate with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , and provide complete transparency to demonstrate they are using it for exclusively civilian purposes - and not secretly developing a bomb .
that is what we need to prevent , and we remain willing to negotiate with iran .
i could also imagine that talks could take place in september between our european colleague catherine ashton and the iranian side .
that 's our goal .
but it requires cooperation and transparency from iran - and iran must not lay down any preconditions for comprehensive talks .
the war in afghanistan is viewed skeptically in many countries - in most countries , by the majority of the population .
after eight years of involvement in afghanistan , how long will patience last for the hope of reaching the goal we want to reach - a relatively peaceful afghanistan ?
that 's a very hard question to answer .
and i can only advise that we do n't lose sight of our own interests .
it is in our interest that we do not allow those who export terrorism into the world … to turn afghanistan back into a safe haven where they can re-arm .
people forget that many attacks were planned there , and some of those attacks also targeted europe .
yes , we should be skeptical , and view any foreign deployment of the bundeswehr initially with a healthy dose of skepticism .
but i would also suggest that we understand that this also concerns our own security , and that is why we want to be and must be successful .
but we also need a clear perspective on withdrawal - something we can work towards by doing even more , as , for example , in supporting civil redevelopment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 07.08.2010 stuttgart racing to find players to prevent another rollercoaster season großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfb have lost some of the stars that aided last season 's revival last season was a microcosm of stuttgart ’ s entire bundesliga history , with their final league table chart looking like the blueprint for a new rollercoaster .
vfb has regularly plumbed the depths and scaled the heights . last season started with high hopes after coach markus babbel 's miracle working in the previous campaign had lifted a seemingly doomed vfb team out of the depths of the relegation zone and into the champions league qualification places .
the young coach seemed to have revived the club and fans even started dreaming of a return to title-winning ways which were then only two years in the past .
die roten -lrb- the reds -rrb- suffered a nightmare start , however , losing 2-0 to reigning champions wolfsburg and plummeting to last place in the league on the opening day .
they were soon up to seventh the following week after a more impressive 4-2 home win against freiburg .
but things started to go badly wrong after that .
six defeats , six draws and only one victory in the following 13 games saw stuttgart back in the relegation zone .
babbel survived until december 6 after a dull 1-1 home draw to vfl bochum confirmed his magic touch had deserted him .
babbel was immediately replaced by swiss coach christian gross who slowly and surely rebuilt the team 's confidence , leading them to a sixth place finish and into the knock-out rounds of the champions league where they lost to title-holders barcelona over two legs .
given the club 's record , fans might expect stuttgart to go into freefall again this season to even things up but gross appears to have the right formula on the pitch to make them competitive again .
however , stuttgart face a race against time to rebuild before the season starts , after seeing a number of players move on this summer with few solid deals under way to replace them .
khedira leaves biggest hole after stuttgart exodus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's midfield will have a khedira-shaped hole in it vfb have lost goalkeeper jens lehmann to retirement , sold ricardo osorio to cf monterey , martin lanig to cologne and roberto hilbert to besiktas , and have watched helplessly as alexander hleb ended his loan spell and rejoined barcelona .
but the most damaging loss could turn out to be the sale of sami khedira to real madrid .
khedira , who shone for the german national team at this summer 's world cup in south africa , successfully passed his medical with the spanish giants at the weekend to complete a 14-million-euro -lrb- $ 18.3 million -rrb- switch .
the 23-year-old midfielder joins jose mourinho 's real revolution on a five-year deal .
christian gross will have to move fast in the transfer market if he is to furnish his squad with players capable of improving on last season 's standards .
at the moment , he 'll be lucky to maintain the level vfb finally reached and could even struggle to avoid a reversal of fortunes .
gross calls back prodigal sons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian midfielder elson is back at stuttgart this season the swiss coach has not been sitting on his hands all summer , however .
he has brought former vfb midfielders elson and christian gentner back from hannover and wolfsburg respectively , while ex-stuttgart goalkeeper marc ziegler has returned from borussia dortmund to replace lehmann .
gross has also boosted the forward line with 23-year-old austrian striker martin harnik from fortuna duesseldorf , who scored the winner on his debut for the club in stuttgart 's europa league qualification game against norwegian club molde fk last week .
but to build on the progress he achieved with stuttgart in the second half of last season , gross needs to add a few more players of quality , especially after khedira , his pivotal midfielder , jumped ship .
one player who could be on the verge of joining vfb to fill khedira 's vacant role is marseille midfielder andre ayew , the 20-year-old who caught the eye with some excellent displays for ghana at the world cup .
ghana 's ayew the man to replace spain-bound sami bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart hopes to complete ayew 's switch from marseille while reports - and stuttgart sporting director jochen schneider - suggest a deal is in place and that the player wants to join vfb , the transfer may not be as clear cut as some may think .
despite missing marseille 's title-winning campaign last season while on loan at newly promoted arles-avignon , didier deschamps - the french champions ' coach - is said to be considering a greater role for ayew for the coming season .
if he is sold , however , stuttgart can expect to pay more than the one million euros they were offering before the world cup .
but with the club cash-rich from the sale of khedira , any hike in price should not prove to be too much of a problem .
what could be a stumbling block is the interest being paid ayew by bundesliga rivals borussia dortmund and schalke 04 , but if a move to germany is on the cards , ayew has admitted that vfb would be his favoured destination .
stuttgart free to move on long-term target degen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-bvb defender degen -lrb- l . -rrb- could return to the bundesliga christian gross has also boosted his defensive situation by signing his compatriot philipp degen on loan from liverpool .
the out-of-favour 27-year-old attacking full-back was told he could leave liverpool by new boss roy hodgson and was keen to return to the bundesliga after having moved to anfield from borussia dortmund in 2008 .
there may be some concerns about the swiss international 's injury record , however .
due to persistent injuries , degen made just 13 appearances for liverpool in two years since arriving on a free transfer .
he suffered a fractured ankle before even playing a competitive game for the team and then suffered a hernia , a fractured rib and broke his foot twice in the space of a year .
this may be why gross took degen on loan for a season before committing any funds to a permanent transfer .

eu climate commissioner connie hedegaard said that , if anything , negoations were going in the wrong direction . international efforts to curb the threat of global warming are backsliding , said negotiators after a week of un climate talks in bonn .
chances of an early deal on curbing global warming ahead of the next major conference in cancun , mexico looked increasingly slim , the eu said on friday .
" these negotiations have , if anything , gone backwards , " said eu climate action commissioner connie hedegaard on the outcome of discussions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hedegaard said the world was ' in danger of missing the train ' in a statement , hedegaard said that major polluters appeared reluctant to take on their " fair share " of reductions to carbon emissions .
" this imbalance is not helpful and could seriously endanger the prospects of securing the successful outcome the world needs from the cancun climate conference next december , ” she warned .
" at this pace the world will simply collectively miss the train . "
last minute additions several major industrial nations still refuse to make legally binding cuts .
efforts to agree on a draft text for negotiation in cancun were hampered after a number of countries demanded last-minute additions to suit their own interests .
the eu 's co-lead negotiator , artur runge-metzger , accused some countries of making additions in a “ tit for tat " way that was not in keeping with the spirit of the talks .
referring to the next set of discussions in tianjin , china , runge-metzger said , " it is important in tianjin to turn that spirit around . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floods in pakistan were highlighted as an example of the dangers of climate change the copenhagen accord agreed in principle a goal of capping any global increase of temperatures at 2 degrees centigrade -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
the principles for providing aid to countries to deal with curbing c02 were also laid out along with plans to monitor emissions cuts .
however , even the limited achievements of that conference appeared to be in jeopardy , said european union representative peter wittoeck .
" it is disappointing to see some countries that have associated themselves with the accord seem to be dissociating themselves from its political consensus , " said wittoeck .
worries over us legislation wittoeck added that worries that the us congress would not pass legislation on climate change later this year had also cast a shadow over proceedings .
us negotiator jonathan pershing said he was eager for swift agreement , adding that record global temperatures , forest fires in russia and deadly floods in pakistan were " all consistent with the kind of changes we could expect from climate change , and they will get worse if we do n't act quickly . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un climate change chief christiana figueres said some progress had been made " unfortunately , what we have seen over and over this week is that some countries are walking back from the progress made in copenhagen , " pershing told journalists .
he told the reuters news agency that negotiators were putting too much onus on rich nations to deliver cuts , rather than seeking global commitments .
un climate chief christiana figueres said she believed that some progress had been made but that governments had to focus on solutions .
" to receive the desired outcome in cancun they must radically narrow down the choices that are now on the table , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 07.08.2010 stuttgart racing to find players to prevent another rollercoaster season großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfb have lost some of the stars that aided last season 's revival last season was a microcosm of stuttgart ’ s entire bundesliga history , with their final league table chart looking like the blueprint for a new rollercoaster .
vfb has regularly plumbed the depths and scaled the heights . last season started with high hopes after coach markus babbel 's miracle working in the previous campaign had lifted a seemingly doomed vfb team out of the depths of the relegation zone and into the champions league qualification places .
the young coach seemed to have revived the club and fans even started dreaming of a return to title-winning ways which were then only two years in the past .
die roten -lrb- the reds -rrb- suffered a nightmare start , however , losing 2-0 to reigning champions wolfsburg and plummeting to last place in the league on the opening day .
they were soon up to seventh the following week after a more impressive 4-2 home win against freiburg .
but things started to go badly wrong after that .
six defeats , six draws and only one victory in the following 13 games saw stuttgart back in the relegation zone .
babbel survived until december 6 after a dull 1-1 home draw to vfl bochum confirmed his magic touch had deserted him .
babbel was immediately replaced by swiss coach christian gross who slowly and surely rebuilt the team 's confidence , leading them to a sixth place finish and into the knock-out rounds of the champions league where they lost to title-holders barcelona over two legs .
given the club 's record , fans might expect stuttgart to go into freefall again this season to even things up but gross appears to have the right formula on the pitch to make them competitive again .
however , stuttgart face a race against time to rebuild before the season starts , after seeing a number of players move on this summer with few solid deals under way to replace them .
khedira leaves biggest hole after stuttgart exodus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's midfield will have a khedira-shaped hole in it vfb have lost goalkeeper jens lehmann to retirement , sold ricardo osorio to cf monterey , martin lanig to cologne and roberto hilbert to besiktas , and have watched helplessly as alexander hleb ended his loan spell and rejoined barcelona .
but the most damaging loss could turn out to be the sale of sami khedira to real madrid .
khedira , who shone for the german national team at this summer 's world cup in south africa , successfully passed his medical with the spanish giants at the weekend to complete a 14-million-euro -lrb- $ 18.3 million -rrb- switch .
the 23-year-old midfielder joins jose mourinho 's real revolution on a five-year deal .
christian gross will have to move fast in the transfer market if he is to furnish his squad with players capable of improving on last season 's standards .
at the moment , he 'll be lucky to maintain the level vfb finally reached and could even struggle to avoid a reversal of fortunes .
gross calls back prodigal sons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian midfielder elson is back at stuttgart this season the swiss coach has not been sitting on his hands all summer , however .
he has brought former vfb midfielders elson and christian gentner back from hannover and wolfsburg respectively , while ex-stuttgart goalkeeper marc ziegler has returned from borussia dortmund to replace lehmann .
gross has also boosted the forward line with 23-year-old austrian striker martin harnik from fortuna duesseldorf , who scored the winner on his debut for the club in stuttgart 's europa league qualification game against norwegian club molde fk last week .
but to build on the progress he achieved with stuttgart in the second half of last season , gross needs to add a few more players of quality , especially after khedira , his pivotal midfielder , jumped ship .
one player who could be on the verge of joining vfb to fill khedira 's vacant role is marseille midfielder andre ayew , the 20-year-old who caught the eye with some excellent displays for ghana at the world cup .
ghana 's ayew the man to replace spain-bound sami bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart hopes to complete ayew 's switch from marseille while reports - and stuttgart sporting director jochen schneider - suggest a deal is in place and that the player wants to join vfb , the transfer may not be as clear cut as some may think .
despite missing marseille 's title-winning campaign last season while on loan at newly promoted arles-avignon , didier deschamps - the french champions ' coach - is said to be considering a greater role for ayew for the coming season .
if he is sold , however , stuttgart can expect to pay more than the one million euros they were offering before the world cup .
but with the club cash-rich from the sale of khedira , any hike in price should not prove to be too much of a problem .
what could be a stumbling block is the interest being paid ayew by bundesliga rivals borussia dortmund and schalke 04 , but if a move to germany is on the cards , ayew has admitted that vfb would be his favoured destination .
stuttgart free to move on long-term target degen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-bvb defender degen -lrb- l . -rrb- could return to the bundesliga christian gross has also boosted his defensive situation by signing his compatriot philipp degen on loan from liverpool .
the out-of-favour 27-year-old attacking full-back was told he could leave liverpool by new boss roy hodgson and was keen to return to the bundesliga after having moved to anfield from borussia dortmund in 2008 .
there may be some concerns about the swiss international 's injury record , however .
due to persistent injuries , degen made just 13 appearances for liverpool in two years since arriving on a free transfer .
he suffered a fractured ankle before even playing a competitive game for the team and then suffered a hernia , a fractured rib and broke his foot twice in the space of a year .
this may be why gross took degen on loan for a season before committing any funds to a permanent transfer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 07.08.2010 being honored by the fatherland : germany 's federal cross of merit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal cross of merit was introduced in 1951 where the uk has its knighthood , and france its legion of honour , germany rewards its loyal citizens with the federal cross of merit .
its most famous recent recipient was the national soccer team coach joachim loew . after the deflating end to germany 's thrilling world cup campaign in south africa , president christian wulff did his best to lift the mood by nominating coach joachim loew and his team for some national honors .
the honor that loew is to receive is the most commonly awarded - the cross of merit on ribbon , or the knight 's cross .
eight other national football coaches have received the same honor , as has the women 's soccer team coach silvia neid .
the footballers themselves , meanwhile , are to be honored with the silver laurel leaf , the highest sporting honor in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew is the latest in a line of football coaches to receive the honor loew is by some distance the most famous person on this year 's list of winners .
unlike in britain , celebrities rarely make the cut , and if they do , it is never for things like " services to entertainment . "
susanne bos-eisolt , who is in charge of the department of the president 's office that administrates the honors , explains what they are for .
" first , to say thank you for what people do voluntarily for the state and for society .
and often it is about making the invisible visible , " she told deutsche welle .
" people often work on a small scale in local communities over many years , so that the wider public never gets to hear about them .
but as soon as the president says " thank you , " either personally or through such an award , the invisible becomes visible . "
anyone can nominate anyone there is a democratic principle behind germany 's state honors .
literally anyone can nominate anyone for any award .
all it takes is a letter either to the presidential office - or your local state premier - detailing the name , address and the accomplishments of the nominee .
german citizenship is not a requirement , either for the nominee or the nominator , and some seven percent of the approximately 2,300 awards handed out every year go to foreigners .
there are eight different federal orders of merit and they are organised more or less by demographic range - the more lives you have affected , the bigger the honor .
the simplest honor - the medal of merit - is often awarded to people who have selflessly looked after their families , while the highest honor - " the grand cross " - is reserved exclusively for heads of state .
there is also a special class of the grand cross , which has only been awarded twice – once to germany 's first post-war chancellor konrad adenauer , and once to chancellor helmut kohl .
the awards in between mainly go to politicians , professors , nobel prize winners , assorted philanthropists and museum directors .
sometimes , in a given year , they are grouped into themes .
last year , the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall was marked by awards relating to the former east germany .
devalued by dictatorship this left one of the recipients , hubertus knabe , director of the stasi prison memorial site in berlin with a dilemma .
" yes , i hesitated to accept this cross of merit because these kinds of state awards were misused in the past in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" we had two dictatorships , and every dictatorship used state awards to honor all kinds of collaboration . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the award is often presented in a ceremony at the presidential palace knabe , an historian who has extensively studied the darker side of the german democratic republic , is used to associating state honors with corruption and toeing the party line .
" if you read all these personal files , how they got all these orders and awards , it makes you a little bit allergic against these kind of state awards , " he said .
collector 's items uwe brueckner does not suffer from any such allergy .
the berlin policeman has been collecting german medals of honor since the age of 15 in 1975 .
to the occasional amusement of other collectors , brueckner has specialized in the federal order of merit in all its forms .
" i wanted to collect something where i had a chance of getting the complete set , " says brueckner , recalling his years of teenage rebellion .
" most collectors are more interested in earlier periods , especially the third reich , but there are so many different medals , and so many of them are impossible to find . "
he has now completed the federal republic set - with 200 individual medals - though for the higher levels he has had to make do with examples that do not have the original certificate with them , and so have probably been bought direct from the manufacturer .
he keeps the cream of his collection in a beautifully-lit display case in the hallway of his small flat in north berlin .
the most privileged shelf - at eye-level - is dedicated to the federal order of merit , and brueckner has set the honors out in an immaculate arrangement .
his prize possession is a " great cross of merit with star and shoulder ribbon " awarded to karl branner , the mayor of the western german town of kassel , in 1990 .
" it 's better than collecting coins , " brueckner said .
" coins all look the same , and stamps are no fun because you ca n't even touch them without devaluing them .
but medals often have real craftsmanship in them .
also , there 's a story and some history behind every one . "
while the modern federal cross of merit has little in the way of craftsmanship – " nowadays they are just factory products that are n't embellished at all " – brueckner is still proud of his set , partly for loyalty reasons .
" would i describe myself as a patriot ? " he asks himself .
" yes , i suppose so .
i suppose there 's some patriotism involved .
i support germany anyway . "

vfb has regularly plumbed the depths and scaled the heights . last season started with high hopes after coach markus babbel 's miracle working in the previous campaign had lifted a seemingly doomed vfb team out of the depths of the relegation zone and into the champions league qualification places .
the young coach seemed to have revived the club and fans even started dreaming of a return to title-winning ways which were then only two years in the past .
die roten -lrb- the reds -rrb- suffered a nightmare start , however , losing 2-0 to reigning champions wolfsburg and plummeting to last place in the league on the opening day .
they were soon up to seventh the following week after a more impressive 4-2 home win against freiburg .
but things started to go badly wrong after that .
six defeats , six draws and only one victory in the following 13 games saw stuttgart back in the relegation zone .
babbel survived until december 6 after a dull 1-1 home draw to vfl bochum confirmed his magic touch had deserted him .
babbel was immediately replaced by swiss coach christian gross who slowly and surely rebuilt the team 's confidence , leading them to a sixth place finish and into the knock-out rounds of the champions league where they lost to title-holders barcelona over two legs .
given the club 's record , fans might expect stuttgart to go into freefall again this season to even things up but gross appears to have the right formula on the pitch to make them competitive again .
however , stuttgart face a race against time to rebuild before the season starts , after seeing a number of players move on this summer with few solid deals under way to replace them .
khedira leaves biggest hole after stuttgart exodus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's midfield will have a khedira-shaped hole in it vfb have lost goalkeeper jens lehmann to retirement , sold ricardo osorio to cf monterey , martin lanig to cologne and roberto hilbert to besiktas , and have watched helplessly as alexander hleb ended his loan spell and rejoined barcelona .
but the most damaging loss could turn out to be the sale of sami khedira to real madrid .
khedira , who shone for the german national team at this summer 's world cup in south africa , successfully passed his medical with the spanish giants at the weekend to complete a 14-million-euro -lrb- $ 18.3 million -rrb- switch .
the 23-year-old midfielder joins jose mourinho 's real revolution on a five-year deal .
christian gross will have to move fast in the transfer market if he is to furnish his squad with players capable of improving on last season 's standards .
at the moment , he 'll be lucky to maintain the level vfb finally reached and could even struggle to avoid a reversal of fortunes .
gross calls back prodigal sons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian midfielder elson is back at stuttgart this season the swiss coach has not been sitting on his hands all summer , however .
he has brought former vfb midfielders elson and christian gentner back from hannover and wolfsburg respectively , while ex-stuttgart goalkeeper marc ziegler has returned from borussia dortmund to replace lehmann .
gross has also boosted the forward line with 23-year-old austrian striker martin harnik from fortuna duesseldorf , who scored the winner on his debut for the club in stuttgart 's europa league qualification game against norwegian club molde fk last week .
but to build on the progress he achieved with stuttgart in the second half of last season , gross needs to add a few more players of quality , especially after khedira , his pivotal midfielder , jumped ship .
one player who could be on the verge of joining vfb to fill khedira 's vacant role is marseille midfielder andre ayew , the 20-year-old who caught the eye with some excellent displays for ghana at the world cup .
ghana 's ayew the man to replace spain-bound sami bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart hopes to complete ayew 's switch from marseille while reports - and stuttgart sporting director jochen schneider - suggest a deal is in place and that the player wants to join vfb , the transfer may not be as clear cut as some may think .
despite missing marseille 's title-winning campaign last season while on loan at newly promoted arles-avignon , didier deschamps - the french champions ' coach - is said to be considering a greater role for ayew for the coming season .
if he is sold , however , stuttgart can expect to pay more than the one million euros they were offering before the world cup .
but with the club cash-rich from the sale of khedira , any hike in price should not prove to be too much of a problem .
what could be a stumbling block is the interest being paid ayew by bundesliga rivals borussia dortmund and schalke 04 , but if a move to germany is on the cards , ayew has admitted that vfb would be his favoured destination .
stuttgart free to move on long-term target degen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-bvb defender degen -lrb- l . -rrb- could return to the bundesliga christian gross has also boosted his defensive situation by signing his compatriot philipp degen on loan from liverpool .
the out-of-favour 27-year-old attacking full-back was told he could leave liverpool by new boss roy hodgson and was keen to return to the bundesliga after having moved to anfield from borussia dortmund in 2008 .
there may be some concerns about the swiss international 's injury record , however .
due to persistent injuries , degen made just 13 appearances for liverpool in two years since arriving on a free transfer .
he suffered a fractured ankle before even playing a competitive game for the team and then suffered a hernia , a fractured rib and broke his foot twice in the space of a year .
this may be why gross took degen on loan for a season before committing any funds to a permanent transfer .

but with the club cash-rich from the sale of khedira , any hike in price should not prove to be too much of a problem .
what could be a stumbling block is the interest being paid ayew by bundesliga rivals borussia dortmund and schalke 04 , but if a move to germany is on the cards , ayew has admitted that vfb would be his favoured destination .
stuttgart free to move on long-term target degen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-bvb defender degen -lrb- l . -rrb- could return to the bundesliga christian gross has also boosted his defensive situation by signing his compatriot philipp degen on loan from liverpool .
the out-of-favour 27-year-old attacking full-back was told he could leave liverpool by new boss roy hodgson and was keen to return to the bundesliga after having moved to anfield from borussia dortmund in 2008 .
there may be some concerns about the swiss international 's injury record , however .
due to persistent injuries , degen made just 13 appearances for liverpool in two years since arriving on a free transfer .
he suffered a fractured ankle before even playing a competitive game for the team and then suffered a hernia , a fractured rib and broke his foot twice in the space of a year .
this may be why gross took degen on loan for a season before committing any funds to a permanent transfer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 07.08.2010 being honored by the fatherland : germany 's federal cross of merit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal cross of merit was introduced in 1951 where the uk has its knighthood , and france its legion of honour , germany rewards its loyal citizens with the federal cross of merit .
its most famous recent recipient was the national soccer team coach joachim loew . after the deflating end to germany 's thrilling world cup campaign in south africa , president christian wulff did his best to lift the mood by nominating coach joachim loew and his team for some national honors .
the honor that loew is to receive is the most commonly awarded - the cross of merit on ribbon , or the knight 's cross .
eight other national football coaches have received the same honor , as has the women 's soccer team coach silvia neid .
the footballers themselves , meanwhile , are to be honored with the silver laurel leaf , the highest sporting honor in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew is the latest in a line of football coaches to receive the honor loew is by some distance the most famous person on this year 's list of winners .
unlike in britain , celebrities rarely make the cut , and if they do , it is never for things like " services to entertainment . "
susanne bos-eisolt , who is in charge of the department of the president 's office that administrates the honors , explains what they are for .
" first , to say thank you for what people do voluntarily for the state and for society .
and often it is about making the invisible visible , " she told deutsche welle .
" people often work on a small scale in local communities over many years , so that the wider public never gets to hear about them .
but as soon as the president says " thank you , " either personally or through such an award , the invisible becomes visible . "
anyone can nominate anyone there is a democratic principle behind germany 's state honors .
literally anyone can nominate anyone for any award .
all it takes is a letter either to the presidential office - or your local state premier - detailing the name , address and the accomplishments of the nominee .
german citizenship is not a requirement , either for the nominee or the nominator , and some seven percent of the approximately 2,300 awards handed out every year go to foreigners .
there are eight different federal orders of merit and they are organised more or less by demographic range - the more lives you have affected , the bigger the honor .
the simplest honor - the medal of merit - is often awarded to people who have selflessly looked after their families , while the highest honor - " the grand cross " - is reserved exclusively for heads of state .
there is also a special class of the grand cross , which has only been awarded twice – once to germany 's first post-war chancellor konrad adenauer , and once to chancellor helmut kohl .
the awards in between mainly go to politicians , professors , nobel prize winners , assorted philanthropists and museum directors .
sometimes , in a given year , they are grouped into themes .
last year , the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall was marked by awards relating to the former east germany .
devalued by dictatorship this left one of the recipients , hubertus knabe , director of the stasi prison memorial site in berlin with a dilemma .
" yes , i hesitated to accept this cross of merit because these kinds of state awards were misused in the past in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" we had two dictatorships , and every dictatorship used state awards to honor all kinds of collaboration . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the award is often presented in a ceremony at the presidential palace knabe , an historian who has extensively studied the darker side of the german democratic republic , is used to associating state honors with corruption and toeing the party line .
" if you read all these personal files , how they got all these orders and awards , it makes you a little bit allergic against these kind of state awards , " he said .
collector 's items uwe brueckner does not suffer from any such allergy .
the berlin policeman has been collecting german medals of honor since the age of 15 in 1975 .
to the occasional amusement of other collectors , brueckner has specialized in the federal order of merit in all its forms .
" i wanted to collect something where i had a chance of getting the complete set , " says brueckner , recalling his years of teenage rebellion .
" most collectors are more interested in earlier periods , especially the third reich , but there are so many different medals , and so many of them are impossible to find . "
he has now completed the federal republic set - with 200 individual medals - though for the higher levels he has had to make do with examples that do not have the original certificate with them , and so have probably been bought direct from the manufacturer .
he keeps the cream of his collection in a beautifully-lit display case in the hallway of his small flat in north berlin .
the most privileged shelf - at eye-level - is dedicated to the federal order of merit , and brueckner has set the honors out in an immaculate arrangement .
his prize possession is a " great cross of merit with star and shoulder ribbon " awarded to karl branner , the mayor of the western german town of kassel , in 1990 .
" it 's better than collecting coins , " brueckner said .
" coins all look the same , and stamps are no fun because you ca n't even touch them without devaluing them .
but medals often have real craftsmanship in them .
also , there 's a story and some history behind every one . "
while the modern federal cross of merit has little in the way of craftsmanship – " nowadays they are just factory products that are n't embellished at all " – brueckner is still proud of his set , partly for loyalty reasons .
" would i describe myself as a patriot ? " he asks himself .
" yes , i suppose so .
i suppose there 's some patriotism involved .
i support germany anyway . "

dw : is the war in afghanistan a political nightmare for you ?
guido westerwelle : i do n't think it 's something anyone would wish upon themselves .
nobody relishes having political responsibility in times like these .
the decision was taken many years ago by the government of the time and we now have to face up to our responsibility .
we have to contribute to our own security , to protect ourselves and our citizens from terrorism as far as possible .
and it 's also in our interest that afghanistan develops positively and becomes a stable country again in the future .
there have been two afghanistan conferences this year , one in london and one in kabul .
you took part in both and you played a major role in one .
a basic framework of action was agreed , involving more security force training , attempts to integrate former taliban and more civil reconstruction .
six months on , has there been any progress ?
or is it too early to judge ?
well , the situation is varied .
i fear we 're going to go through some security setbacks first .
the harvest season is coming to an end .
experience has shown that that often aggravates the security situation .
on the other hand , there are 134 districts in the north and only eight of those are regarded as being particularly dangerous .
so you have to see that as well as building roads and schools , including girls ' schools , we 've helped stabilize the region politically .
that was our main goal .
our other goal is to be able to transfer responsibility for security to the afghan government in 2014 .
that 's also president hamid karzai 's goal and it was agreed by the international community at the recent afghanistan conference in kabul .
still , many people have the impression that things are not really improving in afghanistan .
why is civil reconstruction progressing so slowly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle says most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing i believe you 've got to look at the various aspects differently .
it 's true that some areas of development are not progressing much .
but others have seen positive changes and that should be appreciated .
you must n't forget that we 're there because the great majority of ordinary afghans want us there .
at the same time , we 've now got to implement the change of strategy that we agreed first in london and then in kabul - and that involves achieving political reconciliation .
are you finding you 're increasingly able to ' win the hearts of afghans ' - as one former defense minister put it ?
are afghans open to that ?
yes .
as far as we know , most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing .
the debate in germany and other european countries just shows you the setbacks , the attacks and all the negative issues , things that are not working .
you rarely see examples of progress .
one such example is the peace jirga gathering .
about 1,600 delegates attended and managed to reach an agreement , and about 20 percent of the delegates were women .
in my opinion , developments like that receive too little recognition . you ca n't understand afghanistan without looking at its neighbors .
let 's start with pakistan .
the country is actually an ally , but , as we 've come to see , there are sections in that society that oppose us - some would even call them enemies .
is the government in islamabad not playing fair ?
i think , even there , you have to see the successes .
for example , in the run-up to the afghanistan conference , a trade deal was agreed between afghanistan and pakistan .
that does n't sound all that spectacular , but if you know the history of the two countries , it 's a pretty amazing event .
then there 's a further issue to consider .
we need the neighbors , we need regional cooperation to be successful .
in london at the beginning of the year we were missing one country from the region .
but in kabul the entire region was represented and agreed to the declaration .
that helps strengthen the bonds between neighbors .
we want to encourage that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops have been in afghanistan since 2001 that of course is difficult to imagine , for example with iran .
and that 's who we 're talking about in this case .
sanctions have been imposed on the country , people are scared of nuclear arms ; they 're scared of the iranian president .
but you also have to engage the iranians somehow , in order to stabilize afghanistan .
is such a balancing act realistic ?
well , it 's necessary , or at least it 's essential we try .
the eu and the un did n't decide on sanctions in order to oppose a country , or to prevent iran from using nuclear power for civilian purposes .
instead , we want to see the iranian government return to the negotiating table , to cooperate , to provide transparency - things that iran has actually already committed itself to .
all countries are permitted to use nuclear power for peaceful and civilian purposes .
but they must also cooperate with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , and provide complete transparency to demonstrate they are using it for exclusively civilian purposes - and not secretly developing a bomb .
that is what we need to prevent , and we remain willing to negotiate with iran .
i could also imagine that talks could take place in september between our european colleague catherine ashton and the iranian side .
that 's our goal .
but it requires cooperation and transparency from iran - and iran must not lay down any preconditions for comprehensive talks .
the war in afghanistan is viewed skeptically in many countries - in most countries , by the majority of the population .
after eight years of involvement in afghanistan , how long will patience last for the hope of reaching the goal we want to reach - a relatively peaceful afghanistan ?
that 's a very hard question to answer .
and i can only advise that we do n't lose sight of our own interests .
it is in our interest that we do not allow those who export terrorism into the world … to turn afghanistan back into a safe haven where they can re-arm .
people forget that many attacks were planned there , and some of those attacks also targeted europe .
yes , we should be skeptical , and view any foreign deployment of the bundeswehr initially with a healthy dose of skepticism .
but i would also suggest that we understand that this also concerns our own security , and that is why we want to be and must be successful .
but we also need a clear perspective on withdrawal - something we can work towards by doing even more , as , for example , in supporting civil redevelopment .

dw : is the war in afghanistan a political nightmare for you ?
guido westerwelle : i do n't think it 's something anyone would wish upon themselves .
nobody relishes having political responsibility in times like these .
the decision was taken many years ago by the government of the time and we now have to face up to our responsibility .
we have to contribute to our own security , to protect ourselves and our citizens from terrorism as far as possible .
and it 's also in our interest that afghanistan develops positively and becomes a stable country again in the future .
there have been two afghanistan conferences this year , one in london and one in kabul .
you took part in both and you played a major role in one .
a basic framework of action was agreed , involving more security force training , attempts to integrate former taliban and more civil reconstruction .
six months on , has there been any progress ?
or is it too early to judge ?
well , the situation is varied .
i fear we 're going to go through some security setbacks first .
the harvest season is coming to an end .
experience has shown that that often aggravates the security situation .
on the other hand , there are 134 districts in the north and only eight of those are regarded as being particularly dangerous .
so you have to see that as well as building roads and schools , including girls ' schools , we 've helped stabilize the region politically .
that was our main goal .
our other goal is to be able to transfer responsibility for security to the afghan government in 2014 .
that 's also president hamid karzai 's goal and it was agreed by the international community at the recent afghanistan conference in kabul .
still , many people have the impression that things are not really improving in afghanistan .
why is civil reconstruction progressing so slowly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle says most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing i believe you 've got to look at the various aspects differently .
it 's true that some areas of development are not progressing much .
but others have seen positive changes and that should be appreciated .
you must n't forget that we 're there because the great majority of ordinary afghans want us there .
at the same time , we 've now got to implement the change of strategy that we agreed first in london and then in kabul - and that involves achieving political reconciliation .
are you finding you 're increasingly able to ' win the hearts of afghans ' - as one former defense minister put it ?
are afghans open to that ?
yes .
as far as we know , most of the population is grateful for what the international community is doing .
the debate in germany and other european countries just shows you the setbacks , the attacks and all the negative issues , things that are not working .
you rarely see examples of progress .
one such example is the peace jirga gathering .
about 1,600 delegates attended and managed to reach an agreement , and about 20 percent of the delegates were women .
in my opinion , developments like that receive too little recognition . you ca n't understand afghanistan without looking at its neighbors .
let 's start with pakistan .
the country is actually an ally , but , as we 've come to see , there are sections in that society that oppose us - some would even call them enemies .
is the government in islamabad not playing fair ?
i think , even there , you have to see the successes .
for example , in the run-up to the afghanistan conference , a trade deal was agreed between afghanistan and pakistan .
that does n't sound all that spectacular , but if you know the history of the two countries , it 's a pretty amazing event .
then there 's a further issue to consider .
we need the neighbors , we need regional cooperation to be successful .
in london at the beginning of the year we were missing one country from the region .
but in kabul the entire region was represented and agreed to the declaration .
that helps strengthen the bonds between neighbors .
we want to encourage that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops have been in afghanistan since 2001 that of course is difficult to imagine , for example with iran .
and that 's who we 're talking about in this case .
sanctions have been imposed on the country , people are scared of nuclear arms ; they 're scared of the iranian president .
but you also have to engage the iranians somehow , in order to stabilize afghanistan .
is such a balancing act realistic ?
well , it 's necessary , or at least it 's essential we try .
the eu and the un did n't decide on sanctions in order to oppose a country , or to prevent iran from using nuclear power for civilian purposes .
instead , we want to see the iranian government return to the negotiating table , to cooperate , to provide transparency - things that iran has actually already committed itself to .
all countries are permitted to use nuclear power for peaceful and civilian purposes .
but they must also cooperate with the international atomic energy agency in vienna , and provide complete transparency to demonstrate they are using it for exclusively civilian purposes - and not secretly developing a bomb .
that is what we need to prevent , and we remain willing to negotiate with iran .
i could also imagine that talks could take place in september between our european colleague catherine ashton and the iranian side .
that 's our goal .
but it requires cooperation and transparency from iran - and iran must not lay down any preconditions for comprehensive talks .
the war in afghanistan is viewed skeptically in many countries - in most countries , by the majority of the population .
after eight years of involvement in afghanistan , how long will patience last for the hope of reaching the goal we want to reach - a relatively peaceful afghanistan ?
that 's a very hard question to answer .
and i can only advise that we do n't lose sight of our own interests .
it is in our interest that we do not allow those who export terrorism into the world … to turn afghanistan back into a safe haven where they can re-arm .
people forget that many attacks were planned there , and some of those attacks also targeted europe .
yes , we should be skeptical , and view any foreign deployment of the bundeswehr initially with a healthy dose of skepticism .
but i would also suggest that we understand that this also concerns our own security , and that is why we want to be and must be successful .
but we also need a clear perspective on withdrawal - something we can work towards by doing even more , as , for example , in supporting civil redevelopment .

its most famous recent recipient was the national soccer team coach joachim loew . after the deflating end to germany 's thrilling world cup campaign in south africa , president christian wulff did his best to lift the mood by nominating coach joachim loew and his team for some national honors .
the honor that loew is to receive is the most commonly awarded - the cross of merit on ribbon , or the knight 's cross .
eight other national football coaches have received the same honor , as has the women 's soccer team coach silvia neid .
the footballers themselves , meanwhile , are to be honored with the silver laurel leaf , the highest sporting honor in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew is the latest in a line of football coaches to receive the honor loew is by some distance the most famous person on this year 's list of winners .
unlike in britain , celebrities rarely make the cut , and if they do , it is never for things like " services to entertainment . "
susanne bos-eisolt , who is in charge of the department of the president 's office that administrates the honors , explains what they are for .
" first , to say thank you for what people do voluntarily for the state and for society .
and often it is about making the invisible visible , " she told deutsche welle .
" people often work on a small scale in local communities over many years , so that the wider public never gets to hear about them .
but as soon as the president says " thank you , " either personally or through such an award , the invisible becomes visible . "
anyone can nominate anyone there is a democratic principle behind germany 's state honors .
literally anyone can nominate anyone for any award .
all it takes is a letter either to the presidential office - or your local state premier - detailing the name , address and the accomplishments of the nominee .
german citizenship is not a requirement , either for the nominee or the nominator , and some seven percent of the approximately 2,300 awards handed out every year go to foreigners .
there are eight different federal orders of merit and they are organised more or less by demographic range - the more lives you have affected , the bigger the honor .
the simplest honor - the medal of merit - is often awarded to people who have selflessly looked after their families , while the highest honor - " the grand cross " - is reserved exclusively for heads of state .
there is also a special class of the grand cross , which has only been awarded twice – once to germany 's first post-war chancellor konrad adenauer , and once to chancellor helmut kohl .
the awards in between mainly go to politicians , professors , nobel prize winners , assorted philanthropists and museum directors .
sometimes , in a given year , they are grouped into themes .
last year , the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall was marked by awards relating to the former east germany .
devalued by dictatorship this left one of the recipients , hubertus knabe , director of the stasi prison memorial site in berlin with a dilemma .
" yes , i hesitated to accept this cross of merit because these kinds of state awards were misused in the past in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
" we had two dictatorships , and every dictatorship used state awards to honor all kinds of collaboration . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the award is often presented in a ceremony at the presidential palace knabe , an historian who has extensively studied the darker side of the german democratic republic , is used to associating state honors with corruption and toeing the party line .
" if you read all these personal files , how they got all these orders and awards , it makes you a little bit allergic against these kind of state awards , " he said .
collector 's items uwe brueckner does not suffer from any such allergy .
the berlin policeman has been collecting german medals of honor since the age of 15 in 1975 .
to the occasional amusement of other collectors , brueckner has specialized in the federal order of merit in all its forms .
" i wanted to collect something where i had a chance of getting the complete set , " says brueckner , recalling his years of teenage rebellion .
" most collectors are more interested in earlier periods , especially the third reich , but there are so many different medals , and so many of them are impossible to find . "
he has now completed the federal republic set - with 200 individual medals - though for the higher levels he has had to make do with examples that do not have the original certificate with them , and so have probably been bought direct from the manufacturer .
he keeps the cream of his collection in a beautifully-lit display case in the hallway of his small flat in north berlin .
the most privileged shelf - at eye-level - is dedicated to the federal order of merit , and brueckner has set the honors out in an immaculate arrangement .
his prize possession is a " great cross of merit with star and shoulder ribbon " awarded to karl branner , the mayor of the western german town of kassel , in 1990 .
" it 's better than collecting coins , " brueckner said .
" coins all look the same , and stamps are no fun because you ca n't even touch them without devaluing them .
but medals often have real craftsmanship in them .
also , there 's a story and some history behind every one . "
while the modern federal cross of merit has little in the way of craftsmanship – " nowadays they are just factory products that are n't embellished at all " – brueckner is still proud of his set , partly for loyalty reasons .
" would i describe myself as a patriot ? " he asks himself .
" yes , i suppose so .
i suppose there 's some patriotism involved .
i support germany anyway . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 07.08.2010 stuttgart racing to find players to prevent another rollercoaster season großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vfb have lost some of the stars that aided last season 's revival last season was a microcosm of stuttgart ’ s entire bundesliga history , with their final league table chart looking like the blueprint for a new rollercoaster .
vfb has regularly plumbed the depths and scaled the heights . last season started with high hopes after coach markus babbel 's miracle working in the previous campaign had lifted a seemingly doomed vfb team out of the depths of the relegation zone and into the champions league qualification places .
the young coach seemed to have revived the club and fans even started dreaming of a return to title-winning ways which were then only two years in the past .
die roten -lrb- the reds -rrb- suffered a nightmare start , however , losing 2-0 to reigning champions wolfsburg and plummeting to last place in the league on the opening day .
they were soon up to seventh the following week after a more impressive 4-2 home win against freiburg .
but things started to go badly wrong after that .
six defeats , six draws and only one victory in the following 13 games saw stuttgart back in the relegation zone .
babbel survived until december 6 after a dull 1-1 home draw to vfl bochum confirmed his magic touch had deserted him .
babbel was immediately replaced by swiss coach christian gross who slowly and surely rebuilt the team 's confidence , leading them to a sixth place finish and into the knock-out rounds of the champions league where they lost to title-holders barcelona over two legs .
given the club 's record , fans might expect stuttgart to go into freefall again this season to even things up but gross appears to have the right formula on the pitch to make them competitive again .
however , stuttgart face a race against time to rebuild before the season starts , after seeing a number of players move on this summer with few solid deals under way to replace them .
khedira leaves biggest hole after stuttgart exodus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's midfield will have a khedira-shaped hole in it vfb have lost goalkeeper jens lehmann to retirement , sold ricardo osorio to cf monterey , martin lanig to cologne and roberto hilbert to besiktas , and have watched helplessly as alexander hleb ended his loan spell and rejoined barcelona .
but the most damaging loss could turn out to be the sale of sami khedira to real madrid .
khedira , who shone for the german national team at this summer 's world cup in south africa , successfully passed his medical with the spanish giants at the weekend to complete a 14-million-euro -lrb- $ 18.3 million -rrb- switch .
the 23-year-old midfielder joins jose mourinho 's real revolution on a five-year deal .
christian gross will have to move fast in the transfer market if he is to furnish his squad with players capable of improving on last season 's standards .
at the moment , he 'll be lucky to maintain the level vfb finally reached and could even struggle to avoid a reversal of fortunes .
gross calls back prodigal sons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian midfielder elson is back at stuttgart this season the swiss coach has not been sitting on his hands all summer , however .
he has brought former vfb midfielders elson and christian gentner back from hannover and wolfsburg respectively , while ex-stuttgart goalkeeper marc ziegler has returned from borussia dortmund to replace lehmann .
gross has also boosted the forward line with 23-year-old austrian striker martin harnik from fortuna duesseldorf , who scored the winner on his debut for the club in stuttgart 's europa league qualification game against norwegian club molde fk last week .
but to build on the progress he achieved with stuttgart in the second half of last season , gross needs to add a few more players of quality , especially after khedira , his pivotal midfielder , jumped ship .
one player who could be on the verge of joining vfb to fill khedira 's vacant role is marseille midfielder andre ayew , the 20-year-old who caught the eye with some excellent displays for ghana at the world cup .
ghana 's ayew the man to replace spain-bound sami bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart hopes to complete ayew 's switch from marseille while reports - and stuttgart sporting director jochen schneider - suggest a deal is in place and that the player wants to join vfb , the transfer may not be as clear cut as some may think .
despite missing marseille 's title-winning campaign last season while on loan at newly promoted arles-avignon , didier deschamps - the french champions ' coach - is said to be considering a greater role for ayew for the coming season .
if he is sold , however , stuttgart can expect to pay more than the one million euros they were offering before the world cup .
but with the club cash-rich from the sale of khedira , any hike in price should not prove to be too much of a problem .
what could be a stumbling block is the interest being paid ayew by bundesliga rivals borussia dortmund and schalke 04 , but if a move to germany is on the cards , ayew has admitted that vfb would be his favoured destination .
stuttgart free to move on long-term target degen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-bvb defender degen -lrb- l . -rrb- could return to the bundesliga christian gross has also boosted his defensive situation by signing his compatriot philipp degen on loan from liverpool .
the out-of-favour 27-year-old attacking full-back was told he could leave liverpool by new boss roy hodgson and was keen to return to the bundesliga after having moved to anfield from borussia dortmund in 2008 .
there may be some concerns about the swiss international 's injury record , however .
due to persistent injuries , degen made just 13 appearances for liverpool in two years since arriving on a free transfer .
he suffered a fractured ankle before even playing a competitive game for the team and then suffered a hernia , a fractured rib and broke his foot twice in the space of a year .
this may be why gross took degen on loan for a season before committing any funds to a permanent transfer .

babbel was immediately replaced by swiss coach christian gross who slowly and surely rebuilt the team 's confidence , leading them to a sixth place finish and into the knock-out rounds of the champions league where they lost to title-holders barcelona over two legs .
given the club 's record , fans might expect stuttgart to go into freefall again this season to even things up but gross appears to have the right formula on the pitch to make them competitive again .
however , stuttgart face a race against time to rebuild before the season starts , after seeing a number of players move on this summer with few solid deals under way to replace them .
khedira leaves biggest hole after stuttgart exodus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's midfield will have a khedira-shaped hole in it vfb have lost goalkeeper jens lehmann to retirement , sold ricardo osorio to cf monterey , martin lanig to cologne and roberto hilbert to besiktas , and have watched helplessly as alexander hleb ended his loan spell and rejoined barcelona .
but the most damaging loss could turn out to be the sale of sami khedira to real madrid .
khedira , who shone for the german national team at this summer 's world cup in south africa , successfully passed his medical with the spanish giants at the weekend to complete a 14-million-euro -lrb- $ 18.3 million -rrb- switch .
the 23-year-old midfielder joins jose mourinho 's real revolution on a five-year deal .
christian gross will have to move fast in the transfer market if he is to furnish his squad with players capable of improving on last season 's standards .
at the moment , he 'll be lucky to maintain the level vfb finally reached and could even struggle to avoid a reversal of fortunes .
gross calls back prodigal sons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian midfielder elson is back at stuttgart this season the swiss coach has not been sitting on his hands all summer , however .
he has brought former vfb midfielders elson and christian gentner back from hannover and wolfsburg respectively , while ex-stuttgart goalkeeper marc ziegler has returned from borussia dortmund to replace lehmann .
gross has also boosted the forward line with 23-year-old austrian striker martin harnik from fortuna duesseldorf , who scored the winner on his debut for the club in stuttgart 's europa league qualification game against norwegian club molde fk last week .
but to build on the progress he achieved with stuttgart in the second half of last season , gross needs to add a few more players of quality , especially after khedira , his pivotal midfielder , jumped ship .
one player who could be on the verge of joining vfb to fill khedira 's vacant role is marseille midfielder andre ayew , the 20-year-old who caught the eye with some excellent displays for ghana at the world cup .
ghana 's ayew the man to replace spain-bound sami bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart hopes to complete ayew 's switch from marseille while reports - and stuttgart sporting director jochen schneider - suggest a deal is in place and that the player wants to join vfb , the transfer may not be as clear cut as some may think .
despite missing marseille 's title-winning campaign last season while on loan at newly promoted arles-avignon , didier deschamps - the french champions ' coach - is said to be considering a greater role for ayew for the coming season .
if he is sold , however , stuttgart can expect to pay more than the one million euros they were offering before the world cup .
but with the club cash-rich from the sale of khedira , any hike in price should not prove to be too much of a problem .
what could be a stumbling block is the interest being paid ayew by bundesliga rivals borussia dortmund and schalke 04 , but if a move to germany is on the cards , ayew has admitted that vfb would be his favoured destination .
stuttgart free to move on long-term target degen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-bvb defender degen -lrb- l . -rrb- could return to the bundesliga christian gross has also boosted his defensive situation by signing his compatriot philipp degen on loan from liverpool .
the out-of-favour 27-year-old attacking full-back was told he could leave liverpool by new boss roy hodgson and was keen to return to the bundesliga after having moved to anfield from borussia dortmund in 2008 .
there may be some concerns about the swiss international 's injury record , however .
due to persistent injuries , degen made just 13 appearances for liverpool in two years since arriving on a free transfer .
he suffered a fractured ankle before even playing a competitive game for the team and then suffered a hernia , a fractured rib and broke his foot twice in the space of a year .
this may be why gross took degen on loan for a season before committing any funds to a permanent transfer .

vfb has regularly plumbed the depths and scaled the heights . last season started with high hopes after coach markus babbel 's miracle working in the previous campaign had lifted a seemingly doomed vfb team out of the depths of the relegation zone and into the champions league qualification places .
the young coach seemed to have revived the club and fans even started dreaming of a return to title-winning ways which were then only two years in the past .
die roten -lrb- the reds -rrb- suffered a nightmare start , however , losing 2-0 to reigning champions wolfsburg and plummeting to last place in the league on the opening day .
they were soon up to seventh the following week after a more impressive 4-2 home win against freiburg .
but things started to go badly wrong after that .
